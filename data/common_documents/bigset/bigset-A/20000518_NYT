STARS PLANNING AN AVALANCHE OF PAIN

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars don't just smell blood. They saw it.
</P>
<P>
   It was spilling from Colorado Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote's
face early in Game 2 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The series is even, but the teams might no longer be.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took a hit in Game 1 when first-line winger Brenden
Morrow was lost for the season with a fractured right ankle. But
the Avalanche is bloodied and limping, with its top three
defensemen injured only two games into the best-of-seven Western
Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, who has a fractured orbital bone, will not play in Game 3
tomorrow night. Ray Bourque has missed the past four games with an
injured left knee. Sandis Ozolinsh has what the team is calling a
``bruised foot.''
</P>
<P>
   They are the Avalanche's skating wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are planning as if all three Colorado defensemen will
play, but they also know the Avalanche could be the worse for wear.
The Avalanche has only five other defensemen on its roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly don't want to let them off the hook in any
way,'' Stars winger Kirk Muller said. ``We've got to keep getting
it in there and working hard and grinding it out. They're down in
numbers where they've got to use everybody. I think it's important
that we just try to maintain pressure. That's the big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs' top defensive pairing of Foote and Bourque hasn't been
together since the second period of Game 3 of the Western
Conference semifinals, when Bourque was injured in a loss to the
Detroit Red Wings. Now, with Bourque expected to make his return
tomorrow night, Foote is out.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2:42 into Game 2, Foote was hit under his right eye by the
stick of Stars winger Jere Lehtinen, who was following through on a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   It is a painful injury to the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Foote is Colorado's most physical player with 49 hits, and he
was logging 27:37 of ice time a game before his injury. Foote and
Aaron Miller, who replaced Bourque, helped hold the Stars' first
line to nine shots in Game 1, including only three in the first two
periods combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam Foote is to Colorado what Derian Hatcher is for us,''
Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``He's a physical
presence, and every time he's on the ice, you've got to watch out
for where he is. He gets a chance to bump you, he's going to do it.
He knew in Game 1 that he had a good chance of containing Mike
\RModano\S, and that's exactly what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to our advantage that he's not in there, although you
don't ever want to see a guy with a serious eye injury go down.
It's unfortunate that it happened, and hopefully he can return.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars intend to go out of character in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a passive team at the start of road games, the Stars
will try to keep Colorado on its heels, which considering that the
Avs have feet and knee problems, is not the place they want to be.
The Stars are expected to aggressively attack goalie Patrick Roy,
which is what they did in the first 11 minutes of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't let off any bit,'' said Modano, who had no
goals and three shots in Game 1 and two goals on seven shots in
Game 2. ``We have to keep going at them hard, playing the same way.
We really can't afford to let off and give them any time to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing to the Avalanche, 2-0, in Game 1, the Stars were in
Colorado's zone for 26 minutes, 42 seconds. But they managed only
24 shots, including only 11 in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' forecheck returned in Game 2, and they got 34 shots,
including 17 in the second period, when Modano's two goals gave
them the lead. The Stars won, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in Game 2 we did a much better job of getting in and
getting on the puck,'' Muller said. ``In Game 1, we kind of sat
back a bit too much. ... We're more effective if we play the way we
did in Game 2, where we're putting pressure on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk about our team, they mention defense and all
that. But I think what we'd like to try to do is try to create
pressure like that over 60 minutes and try to wear teams down.
That's a big point of our team.''

IF JACKSON HAD HIS WAY, PIPPEN WOULD BE IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ This is ALMOST as Phil Jackson envisioned
things when he signed up to become Los Angeles Lakers head coach.
</P>
<P>
   A dominant season, a strong playoff run, an NBA Finals berth in
reach,and with the biggest series of the season about to get
underway, Scottie Pippen right in the midst of it all.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so this isn't exactly the reunion Jackson had planned.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson badly wanted his former Chicago Bulls swingman in Lakers
gear, spent much of the offseason talking about it and never hid
his disappointment when the Portland Trail Blazers instead swooped
in and plucked Pippen from the Houston Rockets last October.
</P>
<P>
   So now Jackson can only smile and acknowledge the obvious: His
former pupil, the one he felt would perfectly complement and tutor
Lakers stars Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal and guide them to the
championship . . . now stands between them and the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very ironic, yeah,'' Jackson said Wednesday, as the
Lakers prepared for Saturday's Western Conference Finals opener
against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's boiled down to. As ironic as it is, this is
where it's at, and I think it's a great intrigue,'' Jackson said.
``I think it's really a lot of fun, because when it happened, I was
able to say that we let our biggest opponent step in a gap and
supply themselves with a player that could eventually end up
costing us big-time, and here we arein this situation, wondering if
this is what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, of course, can have fun with this discussion because
he's notthe one who decided against acquiring the three-time
All-NBA selection. But he also knows what the consequences might be
come game time Saturday, and he takes that matter seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen not only knows the triangle offense better than the
Lakers after playing in it for 11 years, he also remains one of the
league's top defenders, an eight-time All-Defensive team selection
with a long wingspanand, even at age 34, great athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   He can guard forwards, potentially shutting down Glen Rice, the
Lakers' third leading scorer. He can defend guards, helping slow
Bryant or more likely taking former Bulls teammate Ron Harper out
of the game. And since Harper often runs the offense, that's no
small concern. Pippen's skills also allow him to play the passing
lanes, denying the Lakers the precision they seek in the triangle
offense.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Lakers saw all of this in their four meetings with
the Blazers this season. ``He hurt us, he hurt us badly,'' Jackson
said of Pippen's role in the Blazers' 97-82 victory at Portland in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty effective, as far as trying to break up the
timing,'' Bryant admitted, ``but it really doesn't matter. . . .
He's one man. It doesn't matter. If all five guys were in sync,
then yeah, it'd be a littleharder. But even if that was the case,
you can still get around it, because you're just basically going
away from pressure. So no matter what Scottie does, we can get
around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen himself seemed to agree with Bryant's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know and what I see is not going to slow Shaq down,
it's not going to slow Kobe down and it's not going to slow Rice
down,'' Pippen said. ``We have to be on the court and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pippen isn't defending the triangle, he might be defending
against his former coach's mind games. Jackson on Wednesday
basically put the Blazers' entire season on Pippen's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that if Scottie doesn't lead this
basketball club and take this team by the horns, they're not going
to get by us,'' Jackson said. ``He's going to have to be the one
that brings them by us. And of course, I'm going to be trying to
take that strength in his game away.''
</P>
<P>
   Notably, Pippen failed to lead the Bulls to the championship in
1994, after Michael Jordan retired and Pippen was forced into the
leadership role. So why does Portland's fate rest in Pippen's
hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who else can lead them,'' Jackson said. ``I don't
see another leader on that basketball club, that can get things
done at critical times and make the plays. . . . He's got to make
the plays happen, so somebody else gets the ball. He's a very good
playmaker, he's one of the best playmakers in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Jackson wanted him in the Lakers lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just fun thinking about how we could harass people
defensively, how much fun that would have been,'' Bryant said.
``But now he's on the other side, so I get to harass him a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Buss last summer had a shot at Pippen, but with the
NBA's luxury tax looming, could not stomach the four years and $54
million remaining on his contract. Blazers owner Paul Allen, a
Microsoft founder and billionaire, had no such hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Jackson said, ``it's a matter of economics in
this league, and this is one of them that stands out, most
definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves him wondering where he'll find the next twist in
this ironic play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Jackson said, grinning, ``we'll find out. That's what
it's about.''

WEB SITE HELPS KIDS MASTER FINANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Assisted by an Internet-savvy elementary school
student, California State Controller Kathleen Connell introduced
her office's Web site for children Wednesday at Balboa Elementary
School.
</P>
<P>
   The site, called ``Kids Sense,'' incorporates sounds, animated
figures and games in an effort to teach children about money,
government and personal finance.
</P>
<P>
   At the site, located at www.sco.ca.gov, children can learn how
much they can earn through a savings account and how to create a
personal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Connell launched the site during a visit to the school in
suburban Northridge, which her son attends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a new economy and the fact that we're
minting new millionaires each day,'' Connell said. ``The sooner
they learn how to invest and save it and spend it prudently, the
better they can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell, the state's chief financial officer, introduced the
site via a live Webcast from the school's library.
</P>
<P>
   Students helped by demonstrating how to navigate the site and
asking questions about how it works.
</P>
<P>
   She answered questions from students as well as some that had
come in through the Web site. One written question asked whether
someone without a powerful computer could use the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have access to the Internet, you will be able
to use this Web site,'' Connell said. ``We had kids around the
state help us. It's meant to be lively and interactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The students receive instruction in how to use the Internet as
part of their regular studies, said Linda Gurian, the school's
technology coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn how to research using the Internet,'' she said.
``It's a very good supplement to what they're doing in school.
We're really trying to incorporate technology into the
curriculum.''

TWO STARS FORWARDS MISS PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner and
center Guy Carbonneau did not practice yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner, who has missed one game in the playoffs _ Game 3
at San Jose _ missed yesterday's practice nursing some aches, while
Carbonneau just took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   In Langenbrunner's place, Jon Sim practiced on the second line
with Joe Nieuwendyk and Scott Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an opportunity with both guys to do extensive off-ice
training really from yesterday to today to tomorrow to have them at
100 percent,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Jamie and
Carbonneau were at 85 or 95 percent starting the series.''
</P>
<P>
   So, was it Langenbrunner's shoulder, or the mysterious
all-encompassing flu bug?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. It's somewhere between the waist and the head. ... This
will be as good as Lags has been in the playoffs,'' Hitchcock said.
``\RFor\S Carbo, this is just a day off because of old age and
stuff like that.'' \Nsubheds:Long layoff Yesterday being Wednesday,
Game 3 should have been played.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Tina Turner concert in Denver, however, the delay
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am no different than any other player in the league; I think
they drag it out quite a bit,'' Stars defenseman Dave Manson said.
``I would rather be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Stars have some momentum after playing four
solid periods _ the third in Game 1 and all three in Game 2 _
maintaining it could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like the last four periods we did play pretty good
hockey,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said. ``We can't use
\Rthe delay\S as an excuse. We have to put it in our minds \Rthat\S
we have to come out Friday night the same way we did ... whatever
night it was we just played.'' \Nsubheds:Conn Smythe envy Stars
center Mike Modano has never won the Hart Trophy, or Selke Trophy
or any regular-season award in his 11-year NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of others _ including a ``Pass, Punt, Kick'' award
when he was 8 _ and some high school trophies. Sure, they all mean
something, but there another one that really wants.
</P>
<P>
   The Conn Smythe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, yeah \Rit's bigger than the Hart Trophy\S,''
Modano said. ``The trophies we gain now in the playoffs _ the
Stanley Cup, the Conn Smythe _ I think those outweigh any
individual trophies you can get as far as the regular season. I
think it would be something that would be very rewarding for a long
time.''

ANY EMPLOYERS FOUND TO VIOLATE LAW ON PARITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH
COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to insert new 2nd graf and rewrite 3rd graf) By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional investigators say thousands of
employers are violating a federal law that requires similar levels
of insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And even those that are in technical compliance with the law
have in most cases found ways to skirt its intent, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they said, the 1996 law does not appear to have
increased access to mental health services as Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, from the General Accounting Office, will
present their findings on Thursday at a Senate hearing requested by
lawmakers hoping to expand the law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the Mental Health Parity Act, group health plans
may not set annual or lifetime dollar limits on a person's mental
health care that are lower than the limits for general medical and
surgical services.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office surveyed employers in 26 states
and found that 14 percent were not complying with the federal
standards. Most of these companies, by their own account, had
lifetime limits on mental health benefits of $100,000 or less, but
set higher ceilings for medical and surgical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO estimated that 9,000 to 13,000 employers in the 26
states were violating the federal standards, but it did not name
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in these states ``have often seen only minor changes
in their health benefits, resulting in little or no increase in
their access to mental health services,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Even employers that complied with the law found ways to restrict
access to mental health care, by setting limits on the number of
office visits or days of hospital care for which they would pay. By
such techniques, the report said, most health plans that comply
with the law _ 87 percent _ ``restrict mental health benefits to a
greater extent than medical and surgical benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office said it ``did not find significant
differences in the rate of employer noncompliance based on
characteristics such as employer size, industry or geographic
region.'' In other words, investigators found compliance problems
among employers of all types.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law does not apply to health plans sponsored by an
employer with 50 or fewer employees. It applies to employers that
serve as their own insurers, paying claims from company assets, as
well as to companies that buy health insurance on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said: ``Some employers seem to be
living up to the letter of the law, but not its spirit. I believe
these practices will have to be examined in more detail as we
proceed with reauthorization of the Mental Health Parity Act.'' The
law expires on Sept. 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is being held by the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions, of which Jeffords is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the 1996 law, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., cited the findings to support their
contention that Congress should broaden the law to prohibit
disparities in coverage for mental and physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban would be ``a major step toward ending the persistent
discrimination against people who suffer from mental illness,''
Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, has advocated
``full parity'' in insurance coverage, and Gore sometimes promotes
the idea in presidential campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing on Thursday, the Clinton administration will
officially embrace the concept for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony prepared for the hearing, Dr. Steven E. Hyman,
director of the National Institute of Mental Health, says there is
``no reason based on biomedical or behavioral science why mental
disorders should be treated differently from any other medical
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, Hyman said, no scientific reason that a health plan
should cover Parkinson's disease but not schizophrenia, for both
are ``chronic and not yet curable diseases that affect dopamine
systems in the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said the 1996 law had had ``a
negligible effect'' on health insurance costs and premiums. A more
comprehensive law requiring full parity could lead to ``cost
increases of about 2 percent to 4 percent,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   E. Neil Trautwein, director of employment policy at the National
Association of Manufacturers, said, ``To the extent that an
employer is not in compliance, it may be because of confusion over
the application of the law or perhaps a continued struggle to hold
health cost increases in check.''
</P>
<P>
   James A. Klein, president of the Association of Private Pension
and Welfare Plans, a trade group composed mainly of Fortune 500
companies, said he was surprised to hear that some companies were
not complying. ``I don't have any evidence to dispute that,'' Klein
said, ``but our members tend to have very high compliance because
they track these requirements closely.''

CALIFORNIA STILL NATION'S HIGH-TECH POWERHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ California's booming high-tech industry has
grown to nearly twice the size of its nearest competitor, and
high-tech salaries are nearly double the average for other workers
in the state, said a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state had an estimated 834,000 high-tech workers in 1998,
making an average of $67,000 annually, according to a study by the
American Electronics Association and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
That's 92 percent more than other California private sector workers
earn.
</P>
<P>
   The study, Cyberstates 4.0, found that California added more
than 193,000 tech jobs between 1993 and 1998, the most recent year
for which job data are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news is quite good for California. It shows that the state
remains a technology powerhouse for the country, and the data
really bears that out,'' said Mark Albertson, the American
Electronics Association's senior vice president for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really shows the tremendous strength the high-tech industry
has within the economy, and it underscores its importance to
California and the rest of the states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of technology industries in the Cyberstates study
included companies in three broad categories: Electronics
manufacturing, communications services and software and related
computer services. The study's definition excludes biotechnology,
wholesale and retail trade in technology goods and temporary
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the high-tech work force surged to 5 million in
1999, adding some 1.2 million workers since 1993, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico added new high-tech jobs between 1997 and 1998.
California, Texas, Virginia, Colorado, and Georgia led the nation
in high-tech job creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever, we're seeing high-tech growth in all
50 states,'' Albertson said. ``That is remarkable when you think of
how far the industry has come over a relatively short period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which gives a state-by-state breakdown of the
technology industry, also found that California exported $53
billion worth of high-tech goods, which make up 54 percent of the
state's total exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, by far and away, our largest export sector. It really
is helping drive our success in recent years,'' said Ted Gibson,
chief economist for the California Department of Finance. ``Just
about everything they do, whether it's producing a good or
producing a service is sold outside the state's borders. That's
what makes an economy work: You've got to make goods and services
that you're able to sell elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital and research and development are healthy in
California as well, the study shows. The state leads the nation
with $16.9 billion in venture capital investments in 1999 and $41.7
billion in research and development expenditures in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Nye, executive director of VIC, the Venice Interactive
Community, said venture capital is likely to be invested more
cautiously in the near future, but it still will flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to continue to see people start
businesses. Technology is going to continue to evolve,'' Nye said.
``There's going to be entrepreneurial fervor, especially in Los
Angeles in the content arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists have invested based on emotional reactions
to a company in the past, Nye said. But they're finding emotion
isn't the best guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to pour money into these companies, but if
they're going to go out of business, what's the point?'' he said.
``A lot of (venture capital) firms are investing in the
infrastructure tools and the services _ things that help make the
Internet work, things that help wireless technology run. Those are
very smart plays for the VC community.''

CALIFORNIA STILL NATION'S HIGH-TECH POWERHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ California's booming high-tech industry has
grown to nearly twice the size of its nearest competitor, and
high-tech salaries are nearly double the average for other workers
in the state, said a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state had an estimated 834,000 high-tech workers in 1998,
making an average of $67,000 annually, according to a study by the
American Electronics Association and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
That's 92 percent more than other California private sector workers
earn.
</P>
<P>
   The study, Cyberstates 4.0, found that California added more
than 193,000 tech jobs between 1993 and 1998, the most recent year
for which job data are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news is quite good for California. It shows that the state
remains a technology powerhouse for the country, and the data
really bears that out,'' said Mark Albertson, the American
Electronics Association's senior vice president for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really shows the tremendous strength the high-tech industry
has within the economy, and it underscores its importance to
California and the rest of the states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of technology industries in the Cyberstates study
included companies in three broad categories: Electronics
manufacturing, communications services and software and related
computer services. The study's definition excludes biotechnology,
wholesale and retail trade in technology goods and temporary
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the high-tech work force surged to 5 million in
1999, adding some 1.2 million workers since 1993, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico added new high-tech jobs between 1997 and 1998.
California, Texas, Virginia, Colorado, and Georgia led the nation
in high-tech job creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever, we're seeing high-tech growth in all
50 states,'' Albertson said. ``That is remarkable when you think of
how far the industry has come over a relatively short period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which gives a state-by-state breakdown of the
technology industry, also found that California exported $53
billion worth of high-tech goods, which make up 54 percent of the
state's total exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, by far and away, our largest export sector. It really
is helping drive our success in recent years,'' said Ted Gibson,
chief economist for the California Department of Finance. ``Just
about everything they do, whether it's producing a good or
producing a service is sold outside the state's borders. That's
what makes an economy work: You've got to make goods and services
that you're able to sell elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital and research and development are healthy in
California as well, the study shows. The state leads the nation
with $16.9 billion in venture capital investments in 1999 and $41.7
billion in research and development expenditures in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Nye, executive director of VIC, the Venice Interactive
Community, said venture capital is likely to be invested more
cautiously in the near future, but it still will flow.
</P>

Angeles in the content arena.''

OPPOSITION DECLARES VICTORY IN DOMINICAN ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 2nd and 6th grafs with updated vote totals; SUBS 7th graf
with three new grafs on reaction to voting)   
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Tantalizingly close to an
outright majority, Hipolito Mejia declared himself the winner of
Tuesday's presidential elections, vowing to ensure that the
Dominican Republic's poorest residents no longer remain bystanders
to the economic boom of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   His exuberant declaration _ which came more than 12 hours before
the electoral council said Wednesday night that he had 49.85
percent of the vote with 99 percent of the ballots counted _ sent
thousands of supporters to the streets waving the party's white
banner as they danced to a symphony of honking horns.
</P>
<P>
   In a gleeful jab at their rout of the ruling Dominican
Liberation Party, whose policies of privatization and modernization
have been slow to benefit many of the country's poor, Mejia's
supporters triumphantly brandished straw brooms, cutting the air
like sabre-waving conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, an agronomist, businessman and cabinet official in the
late 1970s, insisted that the government had to increase spending
on health, education and housing, as well as find ways to help
beleaguered farmers. He said the time had come to make sure that
the country's phenomenal economic growth of approximately 8 percent
in recent years provided tangible benefits to the majority of its
citizens. He also invoked the memory of the late Jose Francisco
Pena Gomez, who had been his party's beloved leader for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we will do will be for the benefit of the hungry masses
of the country,'' he said at an early morning meeting with his
party's leadership. ``What Pena wanted, we will fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   The premature celebrations were criticized by supporters of the
Dominican Liberation Party, who had wanted their candidate, Danilo
Medina, to face Mejia in a runoff. While Mejia's supporters had
taken to the streets, the final tally was delayed as exhausted
members of the electoral council took a five-hour break to get some
sleep. The Dominican Liberation Party, or PLD, and the Social
Christian Reformist Party of the country's longtime former
president, Joaquin Balaguer, garnered 24.9 and 24.6 percent of the
vote respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory mood, however, turned violent Wednesday night
when shots were fired near the headquarters of the Dominican
Liberation Party. Witnesses said the shots came from a car that was
flying the banner of the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Security
men from the Liberation Party returned the fire. No one was injured
and the car sped off after glancing off a parked car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mejia made a mistake by proclaiming himself the winner so
early,'' said Julio Cesar Quello, a vice secretary for the PLD.
``Now their people have been drinking all day and they are beyond
his control.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's supporters said their candidate's wide margin should be
acknowledged by their opponents as a de facto victory and that they
should spare the country the time and expense of a June 30 runoff
by conceding defeat. Late Wednesday night, Dominican Liberation
Party supporters were still waiting for the final tally before
making any announcement about their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Several times throughout the day, Mejia insisted that he would
reach out to his opponents' supporters and include them in his
government. But in a televised interview, Mejia also said his
background put him in a good position to reassess the effects of
the current government's economic priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to confront the corruption and lack of planning,'' he
said. ``My strength is in finance and management and the reordering
of public affairs. I expect to be an institutional president who
will not go outside of the legal framework. I will properly manage
the finances of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some officials of the opposing parties said the vote
was affected by mismanagement by electoral officials who had
misdirected voters to incorrect polling places, teams of
international observers said they had not detected any
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one observer said it was ``unconscionable'' that
the tally had been delayed so long.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dominican economy was the fastest growing in Latin
America last year, the policies of the current president, Leonel
Fernandez, had alienated many voters who felt they were being
harmed. Supporters of Medina acknowledged that the benefits of
Fernandez's policies have trickled down slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government process of privatization was necessary,'' said
Felix Rodriguez, an elementary school teacher and PLD supporter.
``But it affected hundreds of families who were not able to find a
place in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Medina was also hurt by his own perceived colorlessness,
failing to inspire enthusiasm among some members of his own party,
who would have preferred another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is an economy that under Leonel Fernandez grew to be an
example for Latin America, so why did the government's candidate
not rise higher?'' said Bernardo Vega, a former Dominican
ambassador to the United States. ``When Danilo spoke, he did not
excite the people. His speeches were more like he was talking to
the Chamber of Commerce about foreign investment and
macroeconomics, and the masses did not want to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   What mattered most to Mejia's supporters was the sorry state of
their personal economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich say there is economic growth,'' said Felix Bonilla, a
chauffeur. ``But the only thing growing are their pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most jubilant of Mejia's many supporters were women
and homemakers, many of whom had turned out in large numbers on
election day to put an end to what they said were years of high
food prices and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Espinosa, a nurse who said she could not find a hospital
job, sat outside her beverage stand a few feet away from Mejia's
party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people wanted a real government to bring them work, not
just pretty words,'' she said. ``The women have seen how there has
been inflation in the kitchen and in caring for their children. We
deal with that and we saw we were on the precipice. If you do not
have enough to feed your children, there is nothing you can change.
But you can change the government.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CAN RILEY GIVE WHAT HEAT NEEDS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Pat Riley walked into his team's locker room on
Wednesday morning and talked the brave Game 5 talk, as only he
could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love these games,'' he announced to his team, sounding like
Robert Duvall smelling napalm in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The war to defend home court was a go. Game 5 simply had to be
won. The Heat was on for the coach's alter ego, his beleaguered
boss, Riley the organization almighty.
</P>
<P>
   It was time, once and for all, for Alonzo Mourning to justify
Heat president Riley's anointing of him as a franchise player. Time
for Dan Majerle and Tim Hardaway to show they had something left in
their once golden strokes. Time for Anthony Carter and Bruce Bowen
to say thank you, Riles, for this ticket to the big time. They all
owed him and they all saved him from having to go back to New York
on Friday night to face humiliation and elimination on the Madison
Square Garden floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made shots,'' Riley said with the coolness of a coach who
had diagrammed them all, after the Heat held serve, won Game 5 by
87-81 here on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle made two late fourth-quarter 3-pointers, one from so far
out it looked as if it had an American Airlines boarding pass. The
well-traveled Bowen stuck a three-ball from the left corner with 35
seconds left and the Knicks down three. Hardaway dragged his
painful foot through a 10-point, 2-assist bonus of a third quarter
and the rookie Carter made more improbable plays. Jamal Mashburn
continued his breakout spring and Mourning, well, the defensive
player of the year managed to not foul out until less than a minute
remained and the Heat at least was in position to win.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knicks are one defeat away from losing it all to Riley's
roster of has-beens and wannabes, to a team 99 percent of New York
was so sure was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rhetorical bromides aside, more playoff series are won on the
telephone lines than the front lines. While no one ever doubted
Riley's ability to motivate his team to play and play hard, we
waited for evidence on Wednesday night that a Miami group shaped in
the image of his blue-collar core could stare down its former
reflection, reshaped and upgraded, and not blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to get over the hurdle and if it's New York, it's
New York,'' Riley said. ``We have a good team. We have built a good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   He, more than anyone, realized the time had come for his team to
prove it by holding serve at home, or shut up for good. Riley had
already tried talking and taunting his team past the Knicks. He
betrayed his friendship with Jeff Van Gundy for a desperate plea
two years ago. He's railed against Mourning's fraternizing with
Ewing. He had to apologize Tuesday for his bad joke about sending
the Gestapo after relocated Knicks fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get later in the series, it really comes down to
performance,'' he finally admitted. ``The players have to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   And these are the players he acquired, after leaving New York to
run his own show, the fashion step for the power coach. From that
particular species, we have already seen the crashes on different
levels this year of Jimmy Johnson, of Rick Pitino, of Bill
Parcells. Say this for Phil Jackson: he resented coexisting in
Chicago with Jerry Krause, but he didn't let front-office control
stand in the way of his chance to coach Kobe and Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   The one-man operation has not exactly produced electrifying
results. Coaching is like deadline writing, the emotions running
too high and the perspective too narrow to make the appropriate
revisions. So while Riley the coach has worked wonders in Miami,
Riley the personnel maven has left questions that still must be
answered, in all likelihood, right back here Sunday in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there could be something to that,'' Riley said
recently, when asked if he, as president, may have undermined
himself as coach. ``But we tried to acquire Mitch Richmond. We
tried to acquire Latrell Sprewell. We stepped up to the plate and
were told no, no, no, no.''
</P>
<P>
   For those scoring at home, it still takes four ``nos'' for
elimination from this round. The Knicks are in trouble, as deep as
it gets in a seven-game series. They were out rebounded again on
Wednesday night by 10. Allan Houston was locked up again by
Majerle. With all that, they have lost three games by a combined 11
points. Bill Russell's blessing aside, Mourning still can't get
through a hot playoff night without punishing himself with silly
fouls. The Heat survived on Wednesday night, answered the
questions, but just for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Riley the coach smelled blood. Riley the recruiter was relieved.

L.A. MAYOR SAYS FEDS WON'T SUE CITY OVER LAPD REFORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Staff Writer Alexa Haussler contributed to this story) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The U.S. Justice Department has backed off its
threat to sue Los Angeles and will work with city officials to
reform the LAPD while preserving local control, Mayor Richard
Riordan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't going to be any lawsuit,'' Riordan said in an
interview with the Daily News. ``Washington doesn't want a lawsuit
with the (Democratic National) Convention coming up; the city
doesn't want a lawsuit. I think we can work things out
constructively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let them run the department, but we're not
scared to have other people come in to help either.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, the Justice Department's acting civil rights
chief who is spearheading the federal effort, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokeswoman Kara Peterman said the government's
position is consistent and that it wants to work out a ``voluntary
settlement'' that would avoid ``contested litigation.'' The
department remains authorized to sue if the negotiations fail,
Peterman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear, however, whether the Justice
Department would consider voluntary compliance without a consent
decree signed by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Justice Department threatened to sue, alleging
a ``pattern and practice'' of civil rights by the LAPD, a majority
of the City Council declared it would support a consent decree that
could lead to appointing a federal monitor of the department and
make it subject to review by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of losing a measure of local control over the
LAPD prompted criticism and led Riordan to meet with Lee and with
``numerous other people,'' before reaching his conclusion that the
threat of litigation has been eased.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my judgment, of which I'm totally confident,'' Riordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor declined to disclose who on the federal side of the
matter had offered the assurances.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's comments came hours after Lee met for the first time
with the city's negotiating team in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, in a brief interview with the Daily News, confirmed the
talks would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed procedural items and we will meet again,'' Lee,
the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, said as he
was leaving the downtown Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who rocked city leaders with a May 8 demand for a consent
decree in lieu of a lawsuit alleging a ``pattern or practice'' of
police civil rights violations, declined to say whether the
department has modified its position.
</P>
<P>
   A source, however, said federal officials during the negotiating
session seemed emphatic about getting the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn said after the meeting that he's still
assuming the threat of a lawsuit is real, even as he expressed
optimism both sides were committed to a cooperative effort in
addressing LAPD reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking him at his word,'' Hahn said of Lee's initial
threat of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I also think they're interested in working cooperatively
toward a mutually-acceptable resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   A source said the city left open all its options during the
initial negotiating session by requesting that Lee detail the
LAPD's deficiencies as a condition for talks on remedies
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Martin, the mayor's chief of staff and his designee on the
negotiations team, said the federal team promised to clarify their
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll hear more specifics,'' Martin said. ``They've
indicated they'll provide us with more specifics. But I've heard
from other (jurisdictions) these specifics are not always
forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's notification to the city that it faced a civil rights
lawsuit accused the LAPD in broad terms of a pattern of ``excessive
force, false arrests, and unreasonable searches and seizures.''
Much of the investigation was founded on the LAPD's own internal
reviews, punctuated by the Rampart corruption scandal, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish deferred comment to the
Mayor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members, who ultimately would decide whether to
contest the Justice Department in any legal proceedings, were both
optimistic and a bit bewildered by the mayor's pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
   East Los Angeles Councilman Nick Pacheco said he would embrace
an agreement in which local control of the LAPD is a condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this'll be good for the city for us to get into some
sort of relationship that's going to make things happen,'' Pacheco
said. ``I'm not interested in turning over the management, the
discipline or the deployment of our police officers to an outside
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said he was
caught off guard by the mayor's remarks, and was concerned about
Riordan working within the city's negotiating parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything going on to undercut the working group,
then I have a substantial difficulty with that,'' Ridley-Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, representing 9,500
police officers, on Wednesday objected to the negotiations because
the union doesn't have a seat at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not sit idly by while our careers, reputations and
working conditions are negotiated away by people unfamiliar with
the nuts and bolts of real police work,'' PPL President Ted Hunt
said.

`UNDERDOG' ROLE WELCOMED

<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Clip and save the following, because you
might not see it again: The Los Angeles Lakers not only acknowledge
that Portland has become the favorite in the West, they seem to
endorse the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as athletically, we all know that they're a superior
athletic team than we are,'' Kobe Bryant said Wednesday. ``As a
matter of fact, they have better players than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Trail Blazers meet Saturday at Staples Center to
open the Western Conference finals, a meeting that has long seemed
predestined. The Lakers won the regular season with a 67-15 record,
and the Blazers' 59-23 mark was second best in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   They split the season series at two games apiece, and each won
on the other's home floor. But the Lakers have suffered more
setbacks in the playoffs than the Blazers, and Portland boasts a
deep roster that Lakers coach Phil Jackson has termed ``the best
team money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge,'' Bryant said, ``because even though we have
home-court advantage, we seem to be the underdogs right now, which
is perfect for me, it's perfect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the Lakers' first battle cry in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff reported to me today that basically on TNT and TBS
and whatever else that the (Blazers are) odds-on favorites; the
experts say that Portland's got the depth and the matchup
strengths,'' Jackson said. ``I think Portland underachieved this
year. This is a team we thought we were going to have to win
probably 65 games to win first place. And they fell off and had a
little spell in March after we beat them up there (Feb. 29). Yet
they rallied, came to life during the playoffs, played real well.''
</P>
<P>
   HOME COOKIN': So far, the Lakers have made their home-court
advantage hold up _ they are 6-0 at Staples Center in the
postseason, including series clinchers over Sacramento and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Portland is actually the last team to beat the Lakers at full
strength here, on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's difficult to shoot in the building,'' Bryant
said. ``Earlier in the year, we had trouble shooting in the
building because of the dimensions of it. Other than that, I think
our energy is just a lot higher here at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our home. That's what we've kind of been trying to
build up to early in the year, having Staples become like our home
and have people come into the Staples Center feeling intimidated
and scared to play because we've defended our home court all year
long.'' &QL;

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FIRED UP BY THREAT OF BRUSH FIRES
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With wildfire season starting next week, several
homeowner groups said Wednesday that firefighters are not prepared
to stop a brushfire of New Mexico proportions and must lease
water-dropping planes sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic wildfire that consumed Los Alamos in New Mexico
should serve as a wake-up call for officials in California,'' said
Gordon Murley, president of the San Fernando Valley Federation,
which represents 20 homeowner groups in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said they are prepared for this brush fire season,
which will begin May 25 in Los Angeles and is expected to be
particularly severe because of two years of less-than-normal
rainfall after an El Nino winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's a concern because the weather forecast is for
above-average temperatures throughout most of the summer,'' said
Herb Spitzer, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County Fire
Prevention Bureau's Forestry Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This forecast looks more severe and potentially more
aggressive for wildfires.''
</P>
<P>
   However, firefighters said the SuperScooper water-dropping
planes are not always the best weapon and would not have helped in
New Mexico because of high winds there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 100 percent prepared. If for some reason there is a
wildland fire, we are ready 365 days a year to deploy helicopters,
camp crews, fire engines, bulldozers,'' said Battalion Fire Chief
Thomas Page, the director of the Air Operations section of the Los
Angeles County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hillside dwellers disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want an armamentarium that will keep fires very small,''
Murley said during a news conference with representatives of other
San Fernando Valley homeowner groups.
</P>
<P>
   Murley called on state and local officials to use SuperScooper
firefighting planes from spring to the fall, rather than only
during the fall months when fires typically are the worst. The
SuperScoopers can dump 1,600 gallons of water and return for more
from oceans, lakes or reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many homes do you have to burn down before you could have
bought one airplane?''
</P>
<P>
   The SuperScoopers have been used in recent wildfires including
the Old Topanga blaze, and the county and city are expected to
lease two of them again this year. During the past fire season, the
planes' stay in Los Angeles was extended through January because of
the hazardous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This year is expected to be at least as dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't received the rain. We think it's prudent to be
prepared. We could start getting fires here,'' said Louis Blumberg,
a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   The state will officially open its fire season Monday, which is
about the same as last year. Los Angeles city and county fire
departments will declare their fire season next Thursday, also
about the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern, fire officials said, are the communities
bordering the Santa Monica Mountains and Angeles National Forest,
and steep inaccessible hillsides filled with dry chaparral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The green grass is drying out. It's like a fuse that is easily
ignited and can quickly spread the fire,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters argued that while the SuperScoopers are helpful in
some fire battles, they are not always useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any tool you have. They are good for certain
applications: for flatland fires where there's no wind. They have
some difficulty in mountainous terrain where there is some wind,''
Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer added that helicopters are more effective for use in
winds.
</P>
<P>
   And the SuperScoopers are pricey to lease from Quebec, Canada,
officials said, at a cost of $9,511 daily just to be idle at Van
Nuys Airport. If they go into use, an additional $544 per hour
charge is added, along with fuel and oil costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so expensive. During the rainy season, there's nothing
for them to do,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowner groups countered that fire officials wind up spending
more money in cleaning up fire catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably spend more in a year cleaning up after fires than
buying a fleet of SuperScoopers,'' Murley said.
</P>
<P>
   And what kind of price tag can you place on human lives, the
homeowners asked.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Morris, whose home is nestled in Topanga's Fernwood
section, said he's unsure whether he'd be able to escape flames. He
also called for improved year-round fire protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am terrified that we are as vulnerable as Los Alamos. We
need more protection,'' Morris said at the morning news conference
in Sylmar. ``Mother Nature doesn't read the calendar. A fire can
break out at any time.''

FANS LEAVING THEIR SELF-CONTROL AT TURNSTILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two nights ago, some funny fellows at Wrigley Field
rapped Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter on the head, ran off with his
ballcap and instigated a melee in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The National League game between the Cubs and Dodgers needed a
10-minute timeout before things settled down. Thus, Dodgers
outfielder Gary Sheffield was talked out of his fighting ``Iron
Mike'' pose and a trifecta of so-called fans were hauled off to the
hoosegow.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later that night, the Dodgers' Todd Hundley hit a
game-winning homer and we were left to ponder whether or not:
</P>
<P>
   A. Fans are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   B. Players are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   C. Sports is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   D. The world at large is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is probably all of the above, unless you're the prime
minister of Turkey, who only Wednesday was forced to call upon
violent rioters in Copenhagen to settle down in time for the UEFA
Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports should be an initiative for friendship, not for
fighting,'' Turkish leader Bulent Ecevit said after Turkish and
British soccer fans clashed in bloody fights.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship, not fighting. This is an excellent concept,
something that was perhaps idealistically scribbled on a stone at
Mt. Olympus before the first Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the modern age _ edgy, with more attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps when the Prime Minister returns to Earth, he'll take a
look at sports sections more closely and see that, like our larger
society, sports is reflecting a more antagonistic, us-vs.-them,
self-righteous mindset.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mindset that comes from all quarters, including fans,
players, owners, the media.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, unlike what happened between soccer ``fans'' in
Denmark, no knives were wielded at Wrigley Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   However, the free flow of beer, testosterone and a few
temptingly low brick walls around the visiting team's bullpen no
doubt lend to the occurrence of such messy scenes.
</P>
<P>
   As ticket prices rise, as athletes make more money, as the
divide between players and fans widens, the flashpoints for
``combat'' can flare up.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the real question is: What were Kreuter and his
teammates doing running after the idiot pranksters in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   As Cubs manager Don Baylor put it: ``You can't go into the
stands. No matter what they throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, baseball's executive vice president of baseball
operations, Sandy Alderson, emphasized this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is never any excuse for going into the stands,''
Alderson said. ``It is not acceptable; it exposes players and other
uniformed personnel to risks and liabilities. At any level, it is
not a tolerable response.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tough to expect all sports fans to behave with decorum and
civility. And as the Jackson 5 used to sing: One bad apple (or
three or a dozen) don't spoil the whole bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the actions of a few ugly ``fans'' can mar a game or
series.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Philadelphia, a bunch of bozos dumped beer on the
court as Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the 76ers and
Pacers wound down. The ugliness continued until 76ers coach Larry
Brown grabbed the microphone and asked for order to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Philly is to sports civility what Bobby Knight is to
sports civility.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Brotherly Love is, after all, a town that cheered
Michael Irvin's career-ending injury; that booed Santa Claus; that
made battery-throwing an art form; that hurled a full beverage cup
at an opposing coach recently as he attempted to congratulate the
Flyers on advancing in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia does not have a corner on boorish behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman may be retired from professional sports, but his
provacative, me-first, push-the-envelope, whatever-it-takes-to-win,
borderline-psychotic tendencies are still around.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker and Bobby Knight share discouragingly similar
inabilities to see how their actions _ and how their stunning lack
of true contrition _ adds to the level of intolerance or
combatitiveness in sports.
</P>
<P>
   But with each incident, fans grow increasingly more skeptical of
where the line on civility and decorum is drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they've done much to honor that line. In the past nine
months, we have witnessed: Houston Astros right fielder Bill Spiers
being attacked from behind by a fan at Milwaukee's County Stadium;
Denver Broncos defensive back Dale Carter sporting a blackened
right eye after being hit by a metal object thrown by a (BEGIN
ITAL) Broncos (END ITAL) fan; and, of course, a fan run to the
mound at Dodger Stadium to moon Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to fans' skepticism, anger and resentment, players
retreat deeper into their well-paid, exclusive cocoons. In turn,
they grow more wary and testy of taunting fans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, league officials are forced to bolster rules and step
up security forces. This way, when the next skirmish takes place,
prescribed penalties can be handed down.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, baseball's new penalty czar, Frank Robinson,
executed his respected authority by fining a record 16 players and
coaches for a total of 82 games for monster brawls between the
Tigers and White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was given tremendous credit for coming down so hard, so
fast. Baseball needed to crack the whip, get everyone in line.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, like the NBA, NFL, NCAA and everything else out there
charging fans big money, needs to affirm that law and order exists
in its house.
</P>
<P>
   Though it does nothing to lower ticket prices or player
salaries, it might do something to help bolster fans' faith in and
respect for the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, they used to play basketball in cages.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to separate players and angry fans that way,
although higher walls and chicken-wire covers on visiting team
bullpens are good ideas.

DISARCINA'S STATUS: SURGERY STILL AN OPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Shortstop Gary DiSarcina met with Anaheim Angels
manager Mike Scioscia, general manager Bill Stoneman and trainer
Ned Bergert for nearly an hour in Scioscia's office before
Wednesday's game to discuss DiSarcina's options.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder, is
considering whether to have surgery on the shoulder. Surgery would
likely cause him to miss the rest of the season. If he decides to
rehab the shoulder without surgery, there would be no guarantee of
a full recovery and the timetable for his return would be unknown.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina saw a vascular specialist and an orthopedic specialist
in Chicago this week, but the Angels are not releasing the results,
calling the tests inconclusive. But it is apparent DiSarcina is
aware of the nature of the injury because there are no plans to see
any other doctors, and the decision is now in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you miss games and have to go on the DL, it's a
concern,'' DiSarcina said. ``But now there's more concern than I
originally thought.''
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that DiSarcina has a muscle tear in the
back of the shoulder, but that might be only part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I make a decision, there's not much to talk about,'' he
said. ``I'm not at that point (surgery) yet. It's in the mix. I
don't want to say something now and change my mind later.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Finally called up: The Angels called up Keith Luuloa from
Triple-A Edmonton to back up starter Benji Gil at shortstop. Luuloa
has spent the past six-plus seasons in the Angels' minor-league
system but had not reached the big leagues until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He was passed over twice previously this season when DiSarcina
went to the disabled list. The first time, the Angels called up
Keith Johnson, even though Luuloa was starting at shortstop at
Edmonton. The second time, the Angels called up Trent Durrington,
who is a second baseman but was already on the 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first move was kind of mind-boggling,'' said Luuloa, who
is one of three Hawaiian-born players in the majors. ``I was
playing every day, and (Johnson) hadn't played yet. I was unsure of
what was happening. The second one, I understood because there was
no roster spot open.''
</P>
<P>
   Luuloa, who was hitting .241 with two homers and 13 RBI for
Edmonton, can also play third base, second base and left field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Belcher update: Pitcher Tim Belcher threw off the mound
Wednesday for the first time in nearly three weeks. Belcher, who is
recovering from offseason elbow surgery, threw fastballs only for
10 minutes and said he felt fine. He'll throw off the mound again
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never be able to show up at the park and fire (the
ball),'' Belcher said. ``My elbow will never be 100 percent again.
But I'm still confident I can come back and be healthy and
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Dubious ranking: When the Orioles' Cal Ripken grounded into a
6-4-3 double play in the third inning Wednesday night, it marked
the 320th time in his career he has grounded into a double play,
tying Hank Aaron for the most in major-league history.

THEY HAVE NO GROUNDS TO REVOLT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ It's time for the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors to wake up and not smell the coffee.
<P>
   They vote to protect the civil rights of the fat, the skinny,
the non-traditionally-aligned-of-sexual-or-ientation and other
persecuted minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the city's smallest, most misunderstood minority:
the java-free?
</P>
<P>
   As Matt Berryhill points out, the entire world discriminates
against the nondrinker of coffee. It is such a marginalized group
that its existence is not even acknowledged. There is not even a
common word or term for these people, like teetotalers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every business provides coffee for its employees, usually
for free. If you don't drink it, you're not only on your own for
refreshments, you're out of the office social/gossip loop, and
guess who they're talking about 'round the coffeepot. Mr. Smug with
his hoity-toity metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   You stop by Jiffy Lube, hey, have a cup on us. No, sorry, we
don't provide free soda, sport drinks or Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Want to get together? Let's go have coffee. You don't drink
coffee? Well, call me when you start, we'll get together.
</P>
<P>
   At gatherings and meetings, in the waiting rooms of your doctors
and shrinks, there's never a complimentary help-yourself pitcher of
margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   No waitress ever hovers over your table asking if she can top
off or freshen up your Clamato juice. But coffee, she'll pump it
into your mug through a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Paul Quihillalt (cq)  &LR; predicts the next group
seeking protected status will be unphotogenic columnists.
</P>
<P>
   At least I drink coffee.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST, WE HAD the telecommuter, working out of his or her home
office, swinging deals in his or her underwear, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the evolution of cool is Starbuck Chuck. He
turns business wheeling and dealing into performance art. It's a
bold new world of self-importance.
</P>
<P>
   At the Carmel Roasting Co., Daryl Glen observed a 30ish man with
a neat goatee, wearing bathroom slippers and what looked like
jammie bottoms. He sat at a table, his laptop up and humming,
sipping from his to-go cup and yammering on his cell phone about
magazine advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But he got some bad looks from customers who were contemplating
their novels, so he took his phone out to the sidewalk, where he
paced and dodged dog-walkers as he conducted his meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Either a New Wave hipster or a guy whose wife and boss both
kicked him out.
</P>
<P>
   THE INVASION of SoMa by the dot-commers is not only running some
old traditional businesses out of the neighborhood, it's also
chasing away some New Agers who are providing vital services.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dalldorf, publisher of Celebrator Beer News, notes that the
popular 20 Tank Brewery, at 316 11th St., just across from Slim's,
is closing soon. He says the place is going great, but not great
enough to cover the 350 percent rent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Mourns Tom, ``Do not go gentry into that good night ...''
</P>
<P>
   And tanks for the memories.
</P>
<P>
   THIS COULD be your big break. Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``Nutcracker'' is being shot around town, starring
David Hess, whoever he is, and featuring former local DJ Darian
O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
   Friday (1 to 7 p.m.) they're shooting at Harry Denton's
Starlight Room, high atop the lovely Sir Francis Drake. If you show
up in semi-formal attire, you might wind up as background in the
flick.
</P>
<P>
   It will cost you $25, since it's a charity/fund-raising thing,
but remember that the cast members of ``Friends'' will each make
$750,000 per episode, and you're only a heartbeat away from that
kind of action.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUMMY in ``The Mummy'' movie wasn't brought back to life
with burning tania leaves, as reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's  &UR; tanna  &LR; smoke that gets a mummy up and shuffling,''
corrects Michael Conklin.
</P>
<P>
   Tanna leaves can either be ``smoked'' or drunk as tea. Huang-po
Chen adds, ``Tania was not smoked or drunk, she was kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   FOR A REAL San Francisco experience, there's always Vegas and
its S.F. knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   My travel guru, Seymour Seitz, reports that the Postrio in Las
Vegas' Venetian hotel features legendary North Beach bartender
Cassidy Feggan. And the Bellagio hotel has an Aqua, general-managed
by Tony Angotti, formerly of Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It was Angotti who once said of the proposed casino on Alcatraz,
``Can't think of anything sorrier than a seasick slots loser.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MOST depressing thing about the movie ``Battleship Earth''
is the scenario that 1,000 years from now, our planet will have
done some serious backsliding in personal grooming and hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the critics are trashing the movie, although for a
sci-fi cartoon it's really not bad, and John Travolta is a great
supervillain. You do have to get beyond a few quirks, like cavemen
becoming overnight fighter-pilot aces.
</P>
<P>
   I had one problem. Travolta and his evil alien cronies, who are
bigger and stronger than the earthlings, keep grabbing them by the
neck and choking them, and I kept expecting the president of
Indiana University to appear and give Travolta one last chance to
clean up his act.

SENATE PANEL WANTS INSURANCE CHIEF APPOINTED, NOT ELECTED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Over the objection of some consumer groups, a plan
to return the position of state insurance commissioner to an
appointed post was unanimously approved Wednesday by a state Senate
committee.
</P>
<P>
   If ultimately approved by voters on a statewide ballot, the
constitutional amendment would make the state's top insurance
industry regulator an appointee of the governor, as was the case
before 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authority to impose fines on the people (the commissioner)
regulates and simultaneously receive campaign contributions from
those entities, I submit to you, is a conflict,'' said state Sen.
Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, the author of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Speier said the idea for the measure stemmed from investigations
by the Legislature and the attorney general's office into the
actions of the current commissioner, Chuck Quackenbush, who Speier
said has received $6.4 million in contributions from insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, a Republican, has been under fire for allowing
insurance companies to duck as much as $3 billion in fines by
contributing $11.6 million to a nonprofit foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer has gone to court to block further
spending by the foundation, which was ostensibly created to aid
victims of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, but has yet to spend any
money on victims.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the foundation has spent $6 million. Half it went to
earthquake preparedness television commercials featuring
Quackenbush, and the remainder to a variety of
nonearthquake-related entities, including $263,000 that went to a
football camp attended by two of Quackenbush's children.
</P>
<P>
   Speier has another bill to ban creation of such foundations
without court or legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, a constitutional amendment returning the
commissioner's post to an appointed position would not affect
Quackenbush, since the amenment would only take effect after his
term expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Speier's proposal to make the commissioner a gubernatorial
appointee was called ``misguided'' by a representative of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created by the backers of Proposition 103.
Approved by voters in November 1988, Proposition 103 rolled back
insurance rates by 20 percent and made the commissioner's job an
elected post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the opportunity to elect two different
commissioners,'' said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the group. ``It
has turned out that one of them is particularly corrupt. If you had
a rash of pickpockets, you wouldn't outlaw wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Speier argued that only 12 insurance commissioners
nationwide are elected and that the commissioner's job is largely
regulatory in California.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers created the Department of
Managed Care to regulate health maintenance organizations last
year, Speier said, they didn't make that regulatory post an elected
position.
</P>
<P>
   Her argument won support from Republicans on the Senate
Elections and Reapportionment Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor ought to appoint all these regulatory positions,
and the governor ought to be held accountable, whoever that
governor is,'' said state Sen. Chuck Poochigian, R-Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment, SCA 19, must be approved by two
more Senate committees and win a two-thirds vote of the full Senate
and Assembly before it can be placed on the next available
statewide ballot.

 ACLU SUES STATE OVER PUBLIC SCHOOL CONDITIONS  &HT;     By MEREDITH MAY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing cases of children studying in moldy, rat-infested
portables  &LR; portable classrooms without books or trained teachers,
the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state of California
Wednesday, claiming it has failed on its promise to provide an
equal education for all public school children.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing 46 children in 18 urban school districts
across the state said low-income children of color are getting
shortchanged because they do not have the basics enjoyed by their
suburban peers _ textbooks to take home, teachers with experience
and bathrooms that work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not sleuths. We didn't have to hire private
investigators to find these conditions in schools,'' said Mark
Rosenbaum, lead attorney and legal director of the ACLU's Southern
California office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is well known to the state, and that is the basic
problem. There is no accountability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court
asks for a court order requiring the state to provide an immediate
infusion of books and supplies, credentialed teachers and a
maintenance overhaul to all California schools lacking bare
essentials, in addition to the specific districts listed in the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit cites educational troubles in schools in San
Francisco, Oakland, San Pablo, Richmond, Fresno, Monterey Park and
Los Angeles. One student in Los Angeles said he has watched 20
movies in class this year, including ``The Sixth Sense'' and
``Nightmare on Elm Street.'' Other classrooms relied on history
texts that say the Soviet Union is still in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys want the state to come up with a basic set of
requirements each child must have to learn, then inspect and ensure
those standards are met, similar to a settlement the ACLU worked
out with the state in March over rundown conditions in the Compton
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the ACLU sued the state in 1997 for failing to
improve the rock-bottom Compton district, four years after bailing
it out with a $20 million loan and the appointment of a state
administrator. The state pledged to fix bathrooms within 24 hours
of reported problems, broken windows within 72 hours, ensure
textbooks in all core classes, and that teachers earn state
credentials within two years of being hired.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, state Superintendent of Public
Instruction Delaine Eastin said she was not ready to talk about the
lawsuit, because her legal staff had not had the opportunity to
examine the claims and meet with the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis referred all calls to Eastin's office.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis will send a record $3.6 billion to the state's
8,000 schools this year _ half of that with no strings attached _
ACLU attorney Catherine Lhamon said it is too little, too late to
solve inequities that have bankrupted a generation of low-income
children.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to students such as Laurel Clemens of Kennedy High
School in Richmond, who has had a dozen advanced placement (AP)
English teachers in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole class refused to take the AP English exam because
they didn't feel they were prepared,'' said Laurel's mother,
Michele.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Shannon Carey tried unsuccessfully to get her fourth-and
fifth-graders at Stonehurst Elementary School in Oakland exempted
from the standardized state test this year because of their stress
and wasted learning time.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, rain dripped on their heads, and her class
was moved to a hallway, then the auditorium and finally a portable
with a noisy special education class. The students have not had the
peace of mind to study, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Williams, 12, added his name to the lawsuit, saying he is
not learning anything by doing homework of photocopied worksheets
at Luther Burbank Middle School in San Francisco. There is no text
to refer to or help him study at home for tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In social studies class, we don't even have books, so we just
read the newspaper or watch current events on TV,'' he said. ``And
there are ants crawling all over the water fountains, and ceiling
tiles falling from the gym roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Lili Malabed and her colleagues at Bryant Elementary School in
San Francisco also lack books and run into problems when they
exceed their monthly copier budget trying to make homework
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a public school kid when Prop. 13 passed (in 1979), and
I remember all the doomsday predictions about the future of public
education back then, but I had no idea _ no idea _ it would be this
bad,'' she said. &QL;

 AUTO BOOM MAY ADD TO CHINA'S POLLUTION  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ On the outskirts of this booming metropolis, where
skyscrapers and industrial parks and freeways march toward the
horizon, there is a grand vision of China's future, and it looks a
lot like Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it prosperity, some call it nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it involves lots of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most little-noticed yet potentially far-reaching
effects of China's expected entry into the World Trade Organization
is likely to be a sharp expansion in car ownership among the
nation's 1.3 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   In China, autos remain relatively few, and bicycles still rule
the road in many places. But the prospect of a quantum leap in car
ownership is exciting consumers and stirring debate among Chinese
authorities about its possible impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, which long ago embraced the auto as way of
life, the prospect of China joining the club has prompted alarm
from environmentalists, who say the WTO deal could worsen China's
horrendous pollution levels and contribute to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Few people dispute that WTO entry will mark a historic switch to
car culture for China.
</P>
<P>
   Under the WTO terms negotiated last November by U.S. and Chinese
diplomats, China's import tariffs on autos will drop from 80-100
percent to 25 percent, and foreign automakers will be allowed to
both set up full-service operations (currently they are limited to
sales only) and make car loans.
</P>
<P>
   It is this last concession that may count most.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, about 85 percent of all cars are sold on
credit, but in China the government channels nearly all credit to
state industries and leaves almost none for consumer loans _ a
legacy of Marxist-Leninist resource policies that emphasized
building up heavy industry and the military. As a result, most
Chinese cars are owned by companies or the state bureaucracy, not
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   For many Chinese, the WTO will mean a new way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting a trend, common in Western countries, for rich
people to move out of downtown, buy a car and move to the
suburbs,'' said Zang Xinmin, a top Shanghai city official.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, it will be common for people to drive 60 miles
to work, just like in California.''
</P>
<P>
   This evolution to auto-based transportation, Zang admitted,
could ruin Shanghai's urban plan, which has tried to balance mass
transit and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Shanghai has become a futuristic showcase
for Chinese planners. The once-rural Pudong area, across the
Huangpu River from downtown, is now covered by miles and miles of
skyscrapers, industrial parks, broad boulevards and freeways. The
area is home to 1.5 million of the city's population of 13 million,
up from virtually zero a decade ago, and is scheduled to grow to
more than 6 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven brand-new ``satellite cities,'' a recently opened
airport, two metro lines with nine more planned _ as well as
hundreds of miles of new freeway with hundreds more on the way _
all testify to what foreign experts call a model for how to manage
China's historic economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Zang acknowledges that the new highways may be insufficient, and
more may have to be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans have not taken into account the WTO terms, and we
may have to revise them,'' he said. ``But that is not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many officials argue that it is indeed a big challenge, one that
requires more government attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will be able to stop the increase in private auto
ownership'' under WTO membership, said Li Bingdi, vice president of
the Chinese Academy of Urban Planning and Design, a Beijing-based
government agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cities, it will have a big impact on the environment. There
is a serious debate in China. Many of us think that instead, auto
ownership should be limited and mass transit should be
prioritized.''
</P>
<P>
   A major player in the internal debate is China's powerful auto
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Auto manufacturing is officially designated one of the nation's
four ``pillar'' industries, to be defended at all costs. The
nation's 122 car, truck and motorcycle firms say that if stiffer
pollution controls are adopted under the WTO regime, foreign firms
will have a major competitive advantage thanks to their long
experience with the issue _ and will drive domestic ones into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, China still has a long way to go before it
approaches the auto saturation level of the United States.
Shanghai, with a population of 13 million, only has 600,000
vehicles. Los Angeles County, in comparison, has 6.3 million
registered vehicles for its 9.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   There are no projections available for post-WTO auto sales, and
foreign auto firms are hesitant to talk about the subject for fear
of arousing Chinese opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reno, who opened General Motors' auto loan department in
Shanghai last year in anticipation of the WTO move, said the extent
of the sales boom depends on how the Chinese government implements
the complex financial fine print in the WTO's provision on auto
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is in the details, but (WTO membership) certainly
will spur sales growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This growth is likely to worsen China's air pollution, which is
as thick as pea soup and among the world's worst. In the 1980s and
1990s, the government pursued a growth-at-all-costs strategy,
allowing pollution levels in major cities to rise to global
records.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, however, when the government formally embraced
environmental protection, it has pulled out the stops in its
propaganda machine to rally the public behind the new goal.
Billboards are everywhere on urban streets and rural highways
across the nation, advocating forest protection, water cleanup,
recycling and nearly every imaginable ``green'' activity.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and foreign environmentalists have praised government
actions such as these:
</P>
<P>
   -- Pollution-generating factories were moved out of inner
cities.
</P>
<P>
   -- All automakers were forced to install fuel injection and
catalytic converters in new cars.
</P>
<P>
   -- Leaded gasoline has been banned in 50 cities. A nationwide
ban takes effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   -- The so-called Euro 1 vehicle emissions standard has been
adopted. It is equivalent to U.S. standards established in the
early 1980s. Beijing has adopted the Euro II standard, equivalent
to U.S. standards of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the recent gains have been erased by the sheer
impact of tens of millions of Chinese joining the middle class as a
result of the economic boom. Car ownership has grown by 15 percent
annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when they were getting a handle on industrial and
residential pollution, the number of vehicles has started to really
expand, so air quality has gotten better _ but not by much, even
though they're working like crazy to improve it,'' said Todd
Johnson, an environmental economist at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. environmental groups say that in drawing up the WTO
agreement, American diplomats ignored green issues.
</P>
<P>
   They note that in the long negotiations prior to November's
accord, U.S. officials held out for the auto loan concession _ and
treated it as a deal-breaker. A tentative agreement in April 1999
was rejected by President Clinton partly because it did not include
the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States could have used the WTO agreement to
stimulate the transfer of pollution control expertise, technology
to control chlorofluorocarbons and other environmental issues,''
said Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has many people who are seriously concerned about the
levels of pollution, which are grim almost beyond fathoming.
Instead, we're helping them buy cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say the WTO deal's slighting of environmental
issues also misses a highly profitable opportunity for America's _
and especially California's _ tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's environmental and energy technology industries
are the world leaders, and it's in our interest across the board to
speed the adoption of this technology in China,'' said Hal Harvey,
president of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco group working
with Chinese officials and scientists on energy-efficient
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the only U.S. car models sold in China are large,
fuel-guzzling sedans and sport utility vehicles, rather than
smaller, more environmentally friendly cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade could help the Chinese environment, slow global warming
and boost our own economy, but U.S. diplomats just haven't
understood that yet,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised a recent initiative by the California Energy
Commission and the U.S. Energy Department to share technologies
with Chinese officials, calling it a useful first step.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harvey and other experts caution that to clean up the
country's environmental mess, the Chinese need political will _ and
lots of money _ as much as high-tech devices.
</P>
<P>
   Although vehicles are the main source of air pollution in
Chinese cities and the fastest-growing source nationwide,
coal-burning industries account for the largest portion.
</P>
<P>
   Refitting these industries with green technology would send a
strong signal that the government intends to back up its
environmentalist rhetoric with hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts doubt that will happen anytime soon. Environmental
officials in Beijing said last month that merely to bring the
largest Chinese cities' air quality standards up to U.S. levels of
the mid-1980s would cost $40 billion.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal drop-steps his way into the lane and
flicks a one-handed jumper in off the backboard as if he were
tossing out a crumpled wad of paper.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But could he have moved so easily against the similarly enormous
Arvydas Sabonis? Could he have found room to move with Rasheed
Wallace closing?
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen steps back and nails a series-clinching
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   But would Ron Harper have given him the room? Would Kobe Bryant
have long since flown in circles and pump-fakes around Pippen,
rendering him dizzy and shaken when the last minute arrived?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry injects energy and athleticism. But would Brian
Grant have beaten him pillow-soft?
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire speeds through defenses. But would he be able
to outquick Bryant?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers strut through another home-court triumph. But the
Trail Blazers own a victory at Staples Center and know they can
come back for more.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers prove themselves too young and athletic for
the Jazz. But the Lakers are every bit as young and athletic. The
Blazers have no one to match up with Bryant. The Lakers have no
answer for Wallace. The Lakers have the NBA's best record and its
Most Valuable Player. The Blazers have rolled through the playoffs
more impressively.
</P>
<P>
   For every weakness, there is a strength; for every answer, a
question.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the Lakers have gone, the Trail Blazers have followed.
A championship won without a victory over the other would not be
tarnished. But it could never be as complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the series we predicted all year long,'' Lakers coach
Phil Jackson said of the NBA Western Conference finals, which begin
Saturday in Los Angeles. ``This is the one that's been going on
here from day one in the Western Conference. It's fitting it should
be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   More than fitting, the Western Conference title could be worth
the NBA championship. If the Lakers and Trail Blazers were hesitant
to make that claim, there is evidence to support such an
assumption.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had the league's best record at 67-15. The Blazers
were next at 59-23, and they have the best record in the postseason
this year at 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   They split their four games this season, each winning once on
the other's home court. In four games against the Lakers, the Trail
Blazers averaged 89.8 points. In four games against the Blazers,
the Lakers averaged 89 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a great series,'' the Lakers' Harper said.
``This is going to be a fun series. These are two teams that had a
fun year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Portland's Greg Anthony, ``The showdown will be here. I
think it will be everything everyone expects.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers expect an emotional, physical series. Though this
might not qualify as any sort of revelation, it could be a key to
their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to go out and fight,'' Horry said. ``You
never know what can happen in a series. You have to jump on a team
early and keep them down. You're going to have two teams, No. 1 and
2, battling hard. Everybody's going to have their emotions out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than O'Neal and their oversized starting backcourt, the
Lakers in general and Horry in particular are not terribly
physical. But the Lakers have proved to be at their best when
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   If the first two rounds of the playoffs have shown anything, it
might be that the Lakers do not often feel threatened. They were so
far ahead of the field in the regular season that they headed to
the playoffs carrying the label of unbeatable. But they have been
beaten _ twice by Sacramento and once, in an ugly rout, by Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers insist, however, that their image should not be
damaged. But regardless, they say, they don't need the image to win
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always going to judge you, especially here in LA,''
Horry said. ``You can't really fault us for losing on the road.
It's the playoffs. Since we won at home, we're supposed to go on
the road and have a cakewalk. People forget that people have pride.
They have their crowd behind them. It's different. Your comfort
level is different on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do is defend our home court, go out, play hard
and do what we have to do. People are like, when we lose a game
that it's the end of the world. Everybody loses a game once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Harper maintain, however, that the Lakers are not
yet the sort of experienced, honed team that can go through
playoff-caliber competition without hitting a few potholes. Harper
says the Lakers still need more killer instinct. Jackson cites
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play one good team every four games in the NBA, you
can rise to the occasion playing that team and run off a couple
strings during the course of the year,'' Jackson said. ``I know it
looks that way. We had some (winning) streaks of 18, 19, 16 games.
That makes for a dominant season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs, you're playing good teams. We (Jackson's six
world-champion Bulls teams) were much more mature as a basketball
club. That takes some time.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Jackson and Harper seemed also to be saying that the
Lakers exposed nothing more than a weakness in concentration. Up
2-0 on the Kings and 3-0 on the Suns, they seemed to lose interest
and perhaps struggled to get it back. That should not be a problem
against an opponent they truly respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we set goals, we accomplish them,'' O'Neal said.
``Whenever we're put to the task, it will carry us through. We
don't have it all the time. You have to develop that (mean streak).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be pumped up to play Portland. We want to do the same
thing we've been doing, take care of business at home, get one or
two at their place, and we'll be fine. We match up with them very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The mean streak _ Jackson called it a sense of urgency _ showed
defensively. It could almost make the series with Portland take on
the look of the low-scoring Eastern Conference slugfest between the
Heat and the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Tuesday if the Lakers would have to shoot better than
36.3 percent _ their figure in the series clincher against Phoenix
_ to beat the Blazers, Jackson replied: ``No. Did you see Portland
play?''
</P>
<P>
   But before it could be assumed Jackson was seeking to stick it
to the Trail Blazers, or even playing his latest mind game, he
rushed to defend Portland as his team must in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played two games (against Utah), the last two, that
weren't so pretty themselves,'' Jackson said. ``But that's what
happens when you get to slugging it out in the playoffs. Playing
the same team over and over again _ soon it becomes
confrontational. It becomes a real struggle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers have shown an ability to take over games on
the defensive end, most stunningly against Phoenix on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers pounced on the Suns' guards when they came around
screens, a favorite Portland tactic. They challenged shots and
attacked passers. When Rodney Rogers headed for the hoop in the
third quarter with the game very much decided, O'Neal slammed him
so hard the 76ers might have been fined another $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were more aggressive on screens,'' Jackson said. ``We
played through on picks. We challenged the ball and made passes
difficult. We had our hands in the face of shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers do not really have an answer for the Trail
Blazers' strength, Wallace and Grant rotating at power forward.
LA's weakness was clearly exposed by the Kings' Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' Cliff Robinson was more of a jump shooter. But Sabonis
is one of the few centers big enough to battle O'Neal defensively
yet deft enough offensively to bring him away from the basket,
removing his ability to shut down the lane as he did Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal averaged 20.5 points and 13 rebounds, both well below his
season averages, against the Trail Blazers. Sabonis averaged 10.8
points and seven rebounds against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith
</P>
<P>
   But for all their depth, the Trail Blazers really do not have an
answer for Bryant. Pippen is still disruptive in passing lanes,
though he is not near the defender on the ball that he was in the
Bulls' early championship runs. Steve Smith does not have the
quickness to defend Bryant away from the basket. Bryant averaged
24.3 points against the Trail Blazers this season, making 55.6
percent of his shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blazers contend the numbers and matchups are not the
point. While the Lakers must get big performances from O'Neal and
Bryant, Portland can get scoring from a wide variety of sources,
making individual statistics misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen disappeared offensively in the middle three games of the
Jazz series, but he was the offensive star and late-game hero in
the clincher. The Lakers did beat the Trail Blazers in their Feb.
29 showdown for first place in Portland, but that was with Grant
out with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure we're going to go with depth,'' Smith said. ``What
helps for us (is if) you take away one thing, you've got to give up
something. You want to double-team me, you've got to give up a jump
shot to some big man or to other guys who can shoot. If you want to
trap the pick-and-roll, (Sabonis) can hit the jump shot. If you
want to play Rasheed by a single coverage, he's going to score. We
go to whatever the go-to play is or wherever we see a
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is exactly that mix of strengths that makes this year's
Western Conference finals so intriguing.

GALAXY TIED IN SAN JOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ Life with Luis Hernandez will add excitement and
energy when the Mexican standout makes his anticipated debut with
the Los Angeles Galaxy Saturday at the Rose Bowl against D.C.
United. However, life without Hernandez, Clint Mathis, Joey
Franchino and Roy Myers proved too much for the Galaxy in San Jose
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing constant San Jose pressure, the Galaxy managed
to keep their unbeaten record intact, thanks mainly to the
goalkeeping of Kevin Hartman, who was challenged constantly for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman matched a career-high 10 saves, allowing the Galaxy to
escape Spartan Stadium with a 0-0 draw after 90 minutes and two
overtimes in front of 12,692.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hartman was superb,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid.
``Defensively, we have to play tough right now because we're in a
series of games where we're playing Wednesday, Saturday, Wednesday
and trying to work on a new forward combination with the arrival of
Hernandez. But yeah, Hartman made a big difference, he really
stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, who was the outstanding goalkeeper in the MLS in 1999,
hasn't been challenged much this season, but he earned his salary,
especially in the last 20 minutes, coming up with three huge saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up quite a few chances,'' said Galaxy defender Greg
Vanney. ``We were too spread out, guys weren't getting close to
guys or getting enough guys forward. Kevin's not asked to make that
many saves every night, but tonight he was and came through for
us,''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy had their chances too, but they couldn't find a
rhythm offensively or defensively.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Galaxy's (5-0-5, 20 points) third consecutive tie,
dropping them behind Western Division leader Kansas City (8-0-2, 26
points), which beat D.C. United 2-0 Wednesday. San Jose (2-5-3)
failed to win for the fifth consecutive match.
</P>
<P>
   The turf was noticeably long at Spartan Stadium, which proved to
be a neutralizer for the Galaxy's speedy attack. San Jose officials
said recent rains allowed the turf to get thick, but Schmid didn't
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they own lawn mowers in San Jose, but it's an
embarrassment,'' said Schmid. ``Maybe they have to keep it that way
because of some disease in the grass or the city of San Jose
requires it too be that long. But, certainly, it's an embarrassment
to force teams to play on a field with grass that high. If they
want to make the game slow down and look less entertaining, then
you leave it long. Obviously, it was left long to slow us down.''
</P>
<P>
   After Schmid started to cool down, he praised his team for
remaining unbeaten despite the loss of three starters and all the
distractions his team faced the last week and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything our team has gone through, the guys have been
amazing with their morale and what they've been able to sustain,''
said Schmid. ``Every week we're throwing guys up there like Zak
Ibsen and Adam Frye who haven't played forward before.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief pause, Schmid took a stab at MLS in the wake of
losing three starters for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we've fallen back in the pack (of MLS teams) and that's
what they (MLS) wanted,'' said Schmid. ``I'm sure it makes everyone
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen nearly finished a Cobi Jones cross in the eighth minute,
but he misfired from close range to spoil an early chance.
</P>
<P>
   After the Galaxy controlled the first 10 minutes, San Jose
started applying pressure. Earthquakes midfielder Richard Mulrooney
shot from 20 yards, but Hartman tucked it away, making a diving
save in the 12th minute.

JURY HEARS OF NIGHT FOUR SISTERS DIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ A 15-year-old boy testified Wednesday that his
mother sealed windows and doors at their Santa Clarita house
northwest of Los Angeles before smoke from a fire killed his four
sisters in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In shocking testimony, David Nieves said he obeyed his mother,
Sandi Nieves, when she told him and his sisters to sleep in the
kitchen for their first-ever slumber party.
</P>
<P>
   As the children dozed off, David saw his mother use wooden
dowels to block kitchen windows and a sliding glass door, the boy
told a San Fernando Superior Court jury at his mother's murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up coughing _ I couldn't breathe because smoke around
me was stinging my nose and eyes,'' said David, who was 14 when the
fire occurred in Seco Canyon on July 1, 1998. ``There was a lot of
coughing from me, my sisters and my mom. I asked my mom if we could
leave and go outside but she said, `No. It could be coming from
outside.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman asked
the boy why he stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed her, and I trusted her,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves, 36, faces the death penalty if convicted of any of the
four counts of first-degree murder and special circumstances for
the death of her daughters.
</P>
<P>
   She is also charged with the attempted murder of David and with
arson.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend she killed to exact revenge on two
ex-husbands who were fathers to the children, including the four
killed _ Nikolet Amber Nieves, 12; Rashel Hollie Nieves, 11; Kristl
Dawn Folden, 7; and Jaqlene Marine Folden, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves' attorneys contend she was despondent over financial
matters, including her failure to become a police officer. And she
does not know what happened that night or who started the fire,
according to Los Angeles County Deputy Public Defender Howard Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Waco has repeatedly complained that he has been barred by police
and prosecutors from interviewing David prior to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager said he has met many times with authorities and
admitted that police and prosecutors let him know what types of
answers and questions they expected.
</P>
<P>
   David said he does not know who set the fire. However, he said
he saw a gasoline can in his mother's bedroom, the one prosecutors
say she used to start the fire.
</P>
<P>
   David testified he objected to sleeping in the kitchen, but that
his mother insisted.
</P>
<P>
   When he woke up the first time, he said, his mother made Nikolet
throw up where she was sleeping rather than go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us to put our faces into the pillows and covers to
breathe,'' David said. ``I thought that it would prevent us from
breathing in the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   David said he passed out but awoke later, went to the bathroom
to vomit and found that the carpet was burned on several floors,
including in the children's bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind was blank and I didn't know what to think,'' he said,
adding that when he looked at his sisters, ``they were laying there
with foam coming out of their mouths. I thought they had just been
drooling that night, so I laid down and passed out.''
</P>
<P>
   David said he asked his mother what was going on when he awoke a
third time. ``She didn't give me an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   David said he sat on the living room couch with his mother until
paramedics arrived. They took him outside and said his sisters were
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said David, who remained straight-faced and
unemotional throughout his testimony.

ANGELS RALLY PAST ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ For the second time in less than a week, Scott Spiezio
won a game for the Angels with a hit, his ninth-inning single off
Baltimore Orioles closer Mike Timlin scoring Tim Salmon with the
winning run in a 8-7 Angels victory before 17,697 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio broke his bat on the game-winner _ not quite the same as
his game-winning homer Sunday, but just as effective nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from deficits of 3-0, 6-3 and 7-4. Darin
Erstad, who had his 22nd multihit game of the season, had a two-run
single in the eighth inning to tie the game at 7. Troy Percival
pitched the ninth to get the win.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus also had two hits for the Angels, including his 11th
home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, Angels pitcher Scott Schoeneweis said he
didn't read the sports section of the newspaper. ``I read the money
section and the front page,'' Schoeneweis said after going 4-0 in
April.
</P>
<P>
   He might want to include the help-wanted ads in the classified
section, considering the way he's pitched lately.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Schoeneweis' spot in the rotation is safe, what with
injuries, illnesses and lack of production besetting other
starters. But he is not getting the breaks he got in April, though
he was spared his third consecutive loss Wednesday because the
Angels rallied to tie the game in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis gave up seven runs (six earned) and 10 hits in
six-plus innings. After going 4-0 with a 3.43 ERA in his first six
starts, he is 0-2 with a 10.38 ERA in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''His command has not been quite as crisp his last couple
outings,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said before the game. ''The
teams he's faced were disciplined clubs, and he got behind in the
count.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Schoeneweis gave up six runs in an 8-2 loss to the
Mariners, and nine runs in a 13-11 loss to Texas going into
Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are adjustments he's going to have to make,'' Scioscia
said. ``He's still getting a feel for that. That's what experience
does for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles jumped on Schoeneweis right away, as Brady Anderson
and Mike Bordick opened the top of the first with singles. Delino
DeShields followed with a grounder to short, but he beat out the
relay to first and stayed out of the double play, which proved to
be the key to the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle drove in the first run of the inning with a
sacrifice fly, then Jeff Conine and Cal Ripken added RBI doubles
for a 3-0 Orioles lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels matched the three in the bottom of the first, but
missed out on a chance for more. Erstad doubled and scored on a
double by Adam Kennedy. Then Kennedy scored when Mo Vaughn reached
on an error by Conine at first.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon drove in Vaughn with a double to tie the game at 3.
One out later, Glaus and Scott Spiezio walked to load the bases.
But the inning ended abruptly when Bengie Molina grounded into an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis found trouble in the second inning by walking
Charles Johnson and allowing a single to Rich Amaral. Anderson then
laid down a bunt that was fielded by Schoeneweis, who looked at
third, but then threw late to first, loading the bases with none
out.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis nearly got out of it, getting Bordick and DeShields
to pop out. With the count 2-2 to Belle, Schoeneweis threw a pitch
at the knees and on the inside corner, but homeplate ump Rich
Rieker called ball- three.
</P>
<P>
   Belle hit a slow roller to third where Glaus tried but failed to
bare-hand the ball. Belle was safe at first with an infield single,
and with the runners moving on the 3-2 pitch, two scored to give
the Orioles a 5-3 lead.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHARLES Barkley has hobbled off into the sunset, his putter in one
hand and a cocktail in the other. For 16 seasons, the Chuckster did
everything a basketball player could possibly do except make
himself a beloved presence in a visiting arena or win a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   His Utah peers, John Stockton and Karl Malone, are assured of
the same fate. Although both are under contract to return to the
Jazz next year and will presumably come back _ considering the
level they performed at this season, why not? _ their chances of
ever claiming an NBA title have most surely slipped from slim to
none.
</P>
<P>
   Portland killed their lingering hopes Tuesday night, eliminating
Utah 4-1 in the Western Conference semifinals. Thus, Stockton
stands 0-for-16 and Malone 0-for-15 in the banner-hanging
department.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's probably nothing Utah's management can do, short of
arranging a hit on Shaq and Kobe, to give Malone, 36, and Stockton,
38, any kind of viable opportunity for another championship run in
2000-01, much less beyond. It's over, and it's rather sad, no
matter how angry the Mailman and his trusty sidekick have made us
in Houston over these many years.
</P>
<P>
   They've plunged numerous daggers through the Rockets' hearts,
none more hurtful than the nothing-but-net Stockton trey at the
buzzer to terminate Houston's playoff run three springs ago one
round shy of a desperately longed-for summit meeting with Chicago.
Goodness, how we loathed Stockton for that shot.
</P>
<P>
   And also Malone, on general principle, for all the bruises he
left on our heroes with his lethal elbows. Stockton's Clark Kent
persona and squeaky-clean image belied a clever mean streak, too.
Pound for pound, he has long set the most painful pick in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if we're going to lament the imperfect Barkley's empty
trophy case _ please don't, he requests, because he refuses to _ it
seems only fair that we feel a measure of compassion for the great
Jazz duet.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon and then Clyde Drexler would be made whole
during Michael Jordan's dropout seasons, banishing Utah en route
both times. But when the Jazz returned the favor back-to-back in
1997 and 1998, the colossus of Jordan had returned to thwart them
at the finish line. Although Utah stayed competitive in both Finals
against the mighty Bulls, you know what's said about coming close.
Either you win or you don't, and they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, Barkley, Malone, Stockton, Olajuwon and Drexler all came
into the NBA in 1984 or 1985 as first-round draft choices. Each
will enter the Hall of Fame the moment he becomes eligible. But
obviously, Michael's majesty dwarfed that of the others, and his
six championships personally ensured Barkley, Stockton and Malone
would be shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, opposite of Sir Charles, is on the record as saying that
never claiming a ring will haunt him to his dying day. Stockton,
always taciturn, ever inscrutable, has long declined to verbalize
whatever pain he feels. But a defining image of his frustration
would be displayed the night Utah bowed to Seattle in the 1996
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz was aboard its private jet awaiting takeoff. Box
lunches were served, and the players, having accepted their fate,
had begun joking and laughing among themselves. Except for
Stockton. He suddenly bolted from the plane, then walked 30 yards
across the tarmac, where he stood with his hands in his pockets
staring into the night.
</P>
<P>
   From the day Stockton became Utah's full-time point guard, it
was evident he and Malone would develop a special yin-yang
chemistry. But the Jazz's supporting cast has always been flawed in
some way. For all of Stockton's playmaking pizazz and Mailman's
multitasking, it took Utah five seasons to finally escape the first
round, then seven more to reach the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Malone holds the record for most times being voted to the
All-NBA first team _ 11. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who held on for
20 seasons, and Wilt Chamberlain, who played mostly in the
no-defense era, have scored more points in the NBA's history. This
season, Malone was still able to average 25.5 points and 9.5
rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, of course, holds the career assist record, and despite
the miles on his undersized body, he continues to run an offense as
efficiently as any point guard 10 years his junior. Jason Williams
throws more showboat passes in a single game than Stockton will in
an entire season, but which of them would you rather have surveying
the court, ball in hand, with the clock ticking down?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jazz has stumbled collectively, Malone and Stockton
should hardly be branded failures individually. Genius can be its
own reward, and sometimes that must suffice.

DON NELSON TO COACH MAVERICKS NEXT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Don Nelson will return as the Mavericks' coach next
season, with a formal announcement coming by the end of this month
or early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said yesterday that he has talked to
Nelson about returning, but the details have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see Nellie leave with a ring under his belt, and I
think we can get there,'' Cuban said from London, where he is
vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has coached 22 seasons in the NBA, but has never taken a
team to the NBA Finals. However, with the Mavericks improving in
the second half of the season, Cuban said the team is ripe to take
the next step _ but only with Nelson as its coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought there was someone better out there, I would tell
him so and we would go after them,'' Cuban said. ``But I don't
believe there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said the Mavericks' top players _ Michael Finley and Dirk
Nowitzki _ want Nelson to return. The Mavericks won 16 of their
final 21 games last season, and had the NBA's best record in April
at 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks finished 40-42, their best record since 1989-90,
when they were 47-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to build on \R16-5/40-42\S ,'' Cuban said. ``I expect
this team to improve, and I expect us to make it to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the Mavericks' April 19 game against Minnesota was
his final one as a coach. He wanted to return only as general
manager. He has been vacationing at his off-season home in Maui,
Hawaii, and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is expected back today. Cuban, meanwhile, said he won't
return to Dallas until the end of the month. At that time, he plans
to resume contract negotiations with Nelson, who turned 60 on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One source expects Nelson to return as coach. ``Nellie loves
money, and Cuban has a lot of it,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he was impressed with Nelson's performance in the
second half of the season. He said he expects to have a business
relationship with Nelson ``for a long, long, long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie has been my partner in this effort,'' Cuban said.
``It's important to me that he gets the chance to build upon last
season's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie is a Hall of Famer, and he deserves the same respect
and reverence I give the players. More importantly, I think he is
an incredible coach, and the players want him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban would not say whether newly hired assistant coach Sidney
Moncrief will eventually succeed Nelson as the Mavericks' head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie likes what he brings to the mix,'' Cuban said. ``He
knows Nellie and his systems, and he can contribute from his own
experience as a player in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to groom all of our coaches to contribute in new ways,
and give them all a chance to gain new responsibilities. Sidney
Moncrief will get those chances as well.''

famous. There is little to hint of the fierce battle for control of
one of France's major tourist attractions that is going on behind
the scenes. By Suzanne Daley.

   TAIWAN-VICE-PRESIDENT (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Annette Lu says Taiwan
is an ``independent sovereign state.'' She thinks President Clinton
ought to invite the leaders of Taiwan and China to hash out their
differences at the White House. And when asked whether there are
two Chinas _ a proposition that outrages Beijing and sends most
officials here into semantic contortions _ she does not miss a
beat: ``I would say so.'' Is it any wonder that the new government
of the president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, seems eager to silence its
outspoken vice president-elect? By Mark Landler.

   INDIAN-SCHOOLS (Macy, Neb.) _ Even in a nation used to hearing
stories about battered public schools, those in Indian country
stand out. Last year, the average student here at the Omaha Nation
Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national
standardized tests, and almost half scored below the 10th
percentile. The obstacles the Omaha Nation School wrestles with are
echoed in Indian schools around the country. Now, the White House
and others are starting to go after this problem. By Pam Belluck.

lowering sodium intake along with a high calcium diet known as DASH
is effective in combatting hypertension. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ Confirming a long-standing trend
in crime and society, a new Justice Department report shows a
continuing, steep drop in killings attributed to domestic violence,
particularly among blacks. Among blacks, the biggest drop is for
men killed by women, which has actually gone down about 71 percent
since the 1970s. (The number for women and men used to be about
even.) But there is one disturbing trend to emerge from the
department's annual report _ the numbers for white women have gone
up slightly. The face of domestice violence in America is now
largely a problem of attacks on white women, a major shift that
sociologists and law enforcement officials are just starting to
grapple with. By Fox Butterfield.

mouths. Wallman, a former securities regulator with an appetite for
reform, is increasingly irritated by the burdens the typical mutual

   ELEPHANTS-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ Last month, delegates met to
consider revisions to the treaty governing trade in endangered
species. Four southern African nations wanted permission to sell
their stockpiles of ivory, amassed mostly from culling herds of

revenue back into conservation programs. The southern African

declining industrial base and notoriously cold, snowy winters,
Buffalo has had its share of image problems for years. But local

<P>
   The seizure of Foday Sankoh is a heavy, but not necessarily
fatal, blow for the Revolutionary United Front which, hours before
its leader was taken, was skirmishing with British paratroopers
only a dozen miles from Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's capture undoubtedly deprives the Sierra Leonean rebels
of their leader and most charismatic commander, who was technically
vice-president of the coalition government of Tejan Kabbah set up
following the September 1999 Lome peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from clear Wednesday night whether the eight-year
civil war was finally drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   One theory was that the rebel effort will now disintegrate and
factions of the RUF will switch allegiance to the government.
Others fear a new commander could emerge, and that the savage,
anarchic struggle will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relations between Sankoh and his troops are complex,'' one
diplomat said, acknowledging the fluidity of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sankoh was taken into custody _ possibly betrayed by some
of his nominal supporters _ rebel strength was put at 10,000 to
15,000, plus unknown numbers of child soldiers and other
sympathizers. This is well down from the estimated 45,000 army
whose units came within an ace of capturing Freetown 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-dawn clash between paratroopers and some 40 rebels,
coupled with a second attack on United Nations peacekeepers at Port
Loko north of Freetown, suggests that, far from being on the
retreat, as some reports had suggested, the RUF continues to be a
threat to the capital, and more than a match for many of its
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the presence of British troops, and a U.N. force
beefed up by the arrival of Nigerian troops, several bargaining
chips remain in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate consists of the 350 U.N. peacekeepers held
hostage upcountry. It is not known whether these are being held by
one group or by separate, perhaps rival, rebel units.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF still controls the diamond mines in the north and east
of Sierra Leone, the country's economic lifeblood. It also has
bases in neighboring Liberia, whose president Charles Taylor will
be a vital party to any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. envoy, the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson, is heading
to West Africa to meet Taylor and other regional figures. But the
Sankoh episode could make it harder to secure the hostages'
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a stumbling block in the negotiations,'' a
spokesman for Taylor said. ``Sankoh was a key part of the Lome
agreement.'' &QL;

 By BARRY JAMES  
 c.2000 International Herald Tribune  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   PARIS _ It has been little more than a week since the FBI opened
an Internet site to enable people to report fraud and crime on the
World Wide Web, and already it is inundated.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.ifccfbi.gov, received 3,700 complaints in its
first three days, ``which was surprising considering the system is
not well known,'' said the FBI deputy director, Thomas Pickard, at
the world's first international conference on cybercrime here.
</P>
<P>
   Although major villainy like child pornography on the Internet
and rogue programs like the ``ILOVEYOU'' virus grab the headlines,
Pickard's observations were a reminder that like an iceberg, the
vast majority of cybercrime is invisible.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it, he said, is $300 scams that victims put down to
experience and never report or that get low priority on police
blotters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of detection is a major problem, which is aggravated by
lack of awareness on the part of potential victims,'' the Japanese
chief delegate, Toshinori Kanemoto, told the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is about time that governments as well as industry
act to implement a policy for education and awareness building
about Internet security.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickard said the new reporting center on the Internet should
help the FBI track down crooks who operate across state and
national boundaries _ like the scam artist who he said sold
``autographed'' Mickey Mantle baseball cards to uncounted numbers
of sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd been real, I'd probably wanted to have bought them
myself,'' Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the true impact of crime on the Internet. For
example, estimates of the damage caused by this month's e-mail
virus varied widely. ``We were surprised at the very high valuation
put on those losses,'' said Henri Serres, whom the French cabinet
appointed as its data security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the virus attack was a warning of the
damage that could be caused by ruthless criminals, and could be
positive if it made people more conscious of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The conference here is a first attempt to identify the problem
in its global dimensions and offer some solutions for the July
conference of industrialized nations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day Paris meeting, ending on Wednesday, brings
together government officials, law enforcement officers and
representatives of private industry from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers delegates a chance to discuss divergent
approaches to the problem. While the United States favors a
hands-off approach and the greatest possible degree of
self-regulation, the Europeans see more room for government action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our common interest to restrain the excesses of an
unfettered freedom,'' said the French prime minister, Lionel
Jospin, in his opening remarks to the conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans also distrust what they see as a cowboy attitude
toward privacy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, rejected
the notion that private data about consumers should be freely
traded, or that merchants or governments should have unrestricted
power to snoop into private lives.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that societies must preserve their fundamental values
and be vigilant that ``the new technologies do not become a
universal instrument of control and enslavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology industry representatives were dismissive of a
European Union proposal that Internet operators, such as service
providers, preserve customer and traffic data for three months in
case it is needed in crime investigations.
</P>
<P>
   David Aucsmith, chief scientist at Intel Corp., said the sheer
volume of data flowing around the Internet made it practically
impossible to store everything.
</P>
<P>
   Serres said government involvement in the Internet would not be
so necessary if industry did more to create a secure environment,
which Aucsmith described as ``a partly correct statement'' since
companies have been trying to get people online and make the
Internet as user-friendly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is natural tension between security and ease of use,''

the subject at Poitiers, France, in November.

   He said France would support a convention on cybercrime drafted
by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, which proposes permanent
points of contact between governments to deal with the problem and
establish extradition procedures. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ It has been little more than a week since the FBI opened
an Internet site to enable people to report fraud and crime on the
World Wide Web, and already it is inundated.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.ifccfbi.gov, received 3,700 complaints in its
first three days, ``which was surprising considering the system is
not well known,'' said the FBI deputy director, Thomas Pickard, at
the world's first international conference on cybercrime here.
</P>
<P>
   Although major villainy like child pornography on the Internet
and rogue programs like the ``ILOVEYOU'' virus grab the headlines,
Pickard's observations were a reminder that like an iceberg, the
vast majority of cybercrime is invisible.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it, he said, is $300 scams that victims put down to
experience and never report or that get low priority on police
blotters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of detection is a major problem, which is aggravated by
lack of awareness on the part of potential victims,'' the Japanese
chief delegate, Toshinori Kanemoto, told the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is about time that governments as well as industry
act to implement a policy for education and awareness building
about Internet security.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickard said the new reporting center on the Internet should
help the FBI track down crooks who operate across state and
national boundaries _ like the scam artist who he said sold
``autographed'' Mickey Mantle baseball cards to uncounted numbers
of sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd been real, I'd probably wanted to have bought them
myself,'' Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the true impact of crime on the Internet. For
example, estimates of the damage caused by this month's e-mail
virus varied widely. ``We were surprised at the very high valuation
put on those losses,'' said Henri Serres, whom the French cabinet
appointed as its data security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the virus attack was a warning of the
damage that could be caused by ruthless criminals, and could be
positive if it made people more conscious of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The conference here is a first attempt to identify the problem
in its global dimensions and offer some solutions for the July
conference of industrialized nations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day Paris meeting, ending on Wednesday, brings
together government officials, law enforcement officers and
representatives of private industry from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers delegates a chance to discuss divergent
approaches to the problem. While the United States favors a
hands-off approach and the greatest possible degree of
self-regulation, the Europeans see more room for government action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our common interest to restrain the excesses of an
unfettered freedom,'' said the French prime minister, Lionel
Jospin, in his opening remarks to the conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans also distrust what they see as a cowboy attitude
toward privacy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, rejected
the notion that private data about consumers should be freely
traded, or that merchants or governments should have unrestricted
power to snoop into private lives.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that societies must preserve their fundamental values
and be vigilant that ``the new technologies do not become a
universal instrument of control and enslavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology industry representatives were dismissive of a
European Union proposal that Internet operators, such as service
providers, preserve customer and traffic data for three months in
case it is needed in crime investigations.
</P>
<P>
   David Aucsmith, chief scientist at Intel Corp., said the sheer
volume of data flowing around the Internet made it practically
impossible to store everything.
</P>
<P>
   Serres said government involvement in the Internet would not be
so necessary if industry did more to create a secure environment,
which Aucsmith described as ``a partly correct statement'' since
companies have been trying to get people online and make the
Internet as user-friendly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is natural tension between security and ease of use,''
he said, while acknowledging that as far as security goes ``we
could have done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement said that France would make combating cybercrime one
of the priorities of its six-month presidency of the European Union
starting in July, and would organize another major conference on
the subject at Poitiers, France, in November.
</P>
<P>
   He said France would support a convention on cybercrime drafted
by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, which proposes permanent
points of contact between governments to deal with the problem and
establish extradition procedures. &QL;

HALAMA BRILLIANT AS MARINERS BLANK TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Meanwhile, it was a rather notable night for John
Halama as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the Mariners signed Rickey Henderson, Halama
pitched his best game of the season and second career shutout to
beat Minnesota, 4-0, Wednesday and complete Seattle's three-game
sweep of the Twins. If any coaches want to teach young players how
to pitch, a videotape of Halama's game would be a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Halama, 7 years old when Henderson stole his first base in the
major leagues in 1979, held the Twins to four singles, walked no
one and faced only 29 batters, two more than the minimum. He threw
just 87 pitches, 57 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, 87 pitches. And if that doesn't sound impressive,
you weren't watching Halama's previous start when he threw 84
pitches and retired only 12 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was simply an outstanding job,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``He was throwing strikes, changing speeds, using both sides
of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The best game of Halama's career? ``It's a short career,'' the
pitcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and Halama has struggled at times with his control, as most
inexperienced pitchers do. He walked six in his previous start,
against Oakland, including four in the fifth inning when he didn't
retire a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said he hoped Halama learned something from the poor
outing, and the lefty did. Facing a less disciplined lineup than
Oakland's, he allowed only four Minnesota batters to reach base
safely and only one runner to get to second base _ and that was on
a balk with two outs in the ninth inning. Two of the four batters
who singled were quickly eliminated on double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I didn't want to walk anybody,'' said Halama, who
improved his record to 5-0. ``I wanted to get ahead of hitters and
make them put the ball in play right away. I would rather take a
beating out there than walk anybody. I really worked on locating
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come a long way since last year as far as his command,''
Minnesota DH and ex-Mariner Butch Huskey said. ``He showed a little
bit of command last year, but when he can throw his curveball for
strikes like he did tonight, that's impressive command. He kept us
off-balance all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama struck out only two batters, but that's not his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You strike out people and your pitch counts gets up there. I
try to stay away from that,'' Halama said. ``I just wanted to put
the ball in play. Whether they're groundouts, flyouts or home runs,
I just want to make them put the ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama got all the run support he needed from familiar faces.
Alex Rodriguez extended his hitting streak to 13 games with two
singles and scored a run. John Olerud singled home one run and
doubled home another. Edgar Martinez homered well over the left
field fence to increase his team-leading RBI total to 45.
</P>
<P>
   So all in all, it was the sort of night when Seattle appeared to
need little additional help, let alone perhaps one of the greatest
leadoff hitters in history.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Seattle doesn't play the Twins every night, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had lost five of their past seven games and their
division lead before the series, but, as usual, the Twins proved
the perfect tonic for a struggling club. Not only did they never
lead in the series, they never came close. They lost 14-0 Monday
night, trailed 9-1 in the fourth inning Tuesday and never got going
against Halama Wednesday night. Martinez in particular hammered the
Twins, homering three times and driving in nine runs.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended Seattle's longest stretch so far without a day
off, and despite some rocky moments, the Mariners wound up in
pretty good shape. They went 7-6 in the 13 games and finished it
right where they began it _ in first place with a 1{-game lead.
Seattle has Thursday off, then begins the Rickey Era during a
three-game series against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an excellent leadoff hitter,'' Halama said. ``His record
speaks for itself as far as what he'll do out there on the field.''

<P>
   PARIS _ The British government's decision to equip its air force
with European-made missiles and military transports was a major
setback for the Clinton administration's hopes of getting European
support for flagging U.S. defense industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe Wins,'' Le Monde newspaper said jubilantly in a
front-page headline Wednesday, describing the deal as proof that
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has rallied to more
independent defense capabilities in Europe, a theme long championed
by France.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the outcome more broadly, British and other European
analysts drew different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the deal underlines mounting transatlantic
competitiveness in armaments as Europe puts together stronger
companies through cross-border consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed that Britain's involvement in defense matters in
the European Union will require France and Germany to do more to
modernize their own military forces _ or risk seeing Britain revert
to closer ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In offering to buy Airbus Industrie military transport aircraft,
a project still on the drawing board known as A400M, the Blair
government stipulated, as Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said in
Parliament, that ``we hope that we can sign a contract for the
A400M urgently, but this must be based on realistic figures for
purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   London has thus confronted Paris and Berlin with the need for
big investments fast to build the European cargo plane. France and
especially Germany may be unable to afford both Airbus's civil
project, a superjumbo to compete with Boeing's 747, and the
military transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may turn out to be an opportunity for the U.S.
suppliers,'' an industry source said. Lockheed-Martin has C-130Js,
the new Hercules, already in service with the Royal Air Force, and
the British announcement Tuesday included a lease for giant C-17
Globemasters, widening Boeing's presence in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the setback for Washington was unmistakable. It
was only the second time that the European members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization have purchased a non-U.S. weapons
system for themselves. The first was the British-German-Italian
Tornado warplane developed in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   That was the predecessor of Eurofighter, which will now be armed
with the Meteor air-to-air missile manufactured by a branch of
European Aerospace, Defense &AMP; and Space Co., a multinational
consortium in which French and German companies have a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of the deal _ for the missile and for cargo
planes to be built by Airbus _ go beyond the $7 billion price tag
on Britain's purchases. Commercially, the potential global market
will be worth 10 times that figure, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing disappointment, the Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said
that ``it was a setback in that we had offered the British an
opportunity to work cooperatively.'' Raytheon Co., the U.S.
competitor, had promised to improve its air-to-air missile with a
major British work share.
</P>
<P>
   But British officials privately said that the Clinton
administration had brought too little influence to bear, too late,
to forestall a European surge in defense industries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies, including Raytheon, seen as unchallengeable two
years ago as they emerged from massive consolidation, have shown
signs of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Blair aide said in private, London shares doubts
in Europe about President Bill Clinton's power to deal with
Congress on export controls for U.S. technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteor missile, as standard European equipment in the
future, will not necessarily impair European warplanes' ability to
fight alongside U.S. aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, its technical prowess is designed to compensate
for weaknesses in the Eurofighter warplanes, which lack advanced
features, notably stealth, of current U.S. aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the deal will be felt primarily in terms of
heightened transatlantic industrial rivalry, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a European tilt in this order, but it does not mean
that Britain has adopted a permanent industrial policy based on
some political bias in favor of Europe,'' according to Charles
Grant, head of the Center for European Reform, a think tank in
London. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: OF WAR AND TRUTH
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 21.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One cool and bright Sunday morning in February
1991, some pilots and soldiers of the 101st Airborne (''Screaming
Eagle'') Division joined in an outdoor religious service at their
forward base in Saudi Arabia, some 10 miles from the Iraqi enemy
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, the 101st mounted what remains the biggest
helicopter assault in the annals of warfare. In 100 hours of
one-sided combat, the division reached the southern bank of the
Euphrates River, having taken thousands of Iraqi prisoners without
losing a single Screaming Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The 101st had been led to expect fierce resistance by Saddam's
Revolutionary Guards, with many combat causalities. It was with
those anxieties in mind that Maj. Sonny Moore, the brigade
chaplain, asked his camouflaged flock to open their Bibles to the
Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Moore read: ``And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with
fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over
his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,
stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.''
</P>
<P>
   That desert observance came to mind the other day as I read
Seymour Hersh's 25,000-word report in the New Yorker magazine on
the actions of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) in the
waning days of the Persian Gulf war. Along with the 101st (Air
Assault) and 82nd Airborne Divisions, the 24th comprised the XVIII
Airborne Corps. With help from the French, this force mounted the
famed ``left hook'' against the hapless Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hersh's article ran, retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who
had commanded the 24th in the Gulf war, and who now commands the
anti-drug program in the White House, mounted a pre-emptive strike.
He alleged to New Yorker editor David Remnick that Hersh was
concocting a false revisionist history of how the war had ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue that carried Hersh's account of alleged U.S.
war crimes, Remnick wrote: ``The United States government, in its
determination to avoid the chaos and protest of Vietnam, controlled
reporters' access to the Gulf battlefield to an unprecedented
degree. ... (Reporters), to their dismay, found themselves forced
to do their reporting from briefing rooms in Saudi Arabia and the
Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sad and true. Yet, with pluck and luck, journalists eluded
military minders and found their way to the war zone. Some
divisional commands, notably the Marines and the 101st, even
welcomed our presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unsettling that we cannot come to closure on a chapter
of history as recent as the Gulf war,'' observes Daniel Schorr,
senior news analyst for National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, if Hersh could have been there among the
warriors, rather than having to marshal their recollections nearly
a decade later, he would have been able to write an unquestionably
definitive account. Had more reporters been on the scene, it's
quite possible that some events might have unfolded differently.
</P>
<P>
   Even though such an open coverage policy serves the national
interest, it has yet to be adopted. If I'm around for a future
conflict, I'll be sure to carry the Bible that Moore inscribed to
me in the desert as a ``special man on a special mission.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush's gamble with your retirement
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the details will redeem it, but at first blush George W.
Bush's much-touted plan looks more likely to deform than to reform
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the pending GOP presidential nominee with boldness in
taking on the issue outside the usual formulas. The baby-boomer
crush can't be willed away by ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   Without substantial change, the Social Security Trust Fund will,
by current estimates, be exhausted by 2037. Revenues into it could
cover only about 70 percent of the obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Any fix will be painful. Either benefits will have to be
reduced, or payroll taxes increased or benefit ages raised or some
combination of all-of-the-above. Or...
</P>
<P>
   Or the program will have to be radically refigured to somehow
sustain retirement incomes levels otherwise. Bush is proposing
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would let workers use 2 percent _ for starters _ of their
Social Security payments for private investment. If the economic
winds prove fair, and if they invest either cannily or luckily,
most workers should be able to retire with maybe $300 a month more
than they would get from straight Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck in stock or money markets could financially strand
retirees. Bush says he would hedge the system against that, but in
a bit of a political shell game, he is withholding those and other
details until specific legislation is drafted after, he says, he is
elected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you will have to make Bush president to see just
what he's talking about. Buying a pig in a poke is an inelegant but
apt description of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush is certainly not talking about is reforming Social
Security. Even if most workers came out a bit ahead, taking away 2
percent of payments into the system would hurry the fund's fatigue
to 2023.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, by holding current and imminent retirees harmless,
Bush is betting the appeal to young workers will draw him more
votes than fiddling with the system will cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Could be. Young workers have grown up with overnight wealth
popping up all around them like morning geysers. Why put money into
some stodgy old trust fund when you could be soaring?
</P>
<P>
   And they have been soured on Social Security by longtime
opponents of it claiming it's so doomed they'll never get a dime
back, when in fact the system can be sustained indefinitely with
periodic _ though, as noted, sometimes ouchy _ updatings, as we
have been doing all along.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, it is worth remembering, is not an investment
scheme. It is an insurance policy, with emphasis on the ``social.''
It hedges all of us _ and indemnifies the society we share _
against the possibility and consequences of dire elderly poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It has succeeded magnificently. There still are elderly poor,
but the desperate poverty of the aged that once shamed the nation,
and the lifetimes of anxious uncertainty that accompanied that, are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to be said for the ``security'' in Social
Security, too.

NOT SEEING EYE TO EYE ON GUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those moms marching against America's gun culture on Mother's
Day called to mind a session I had with a pistol-packing
optometrist a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All I wanted was an eye exam and a prescription. What I got in
addition to those services was an earful of his waxing hot about
his misinterpretation of the Second Amendment and the wonders of
his new laser-sighted 9mm security blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other gun fanatics around the country, the
good eye doctor insisted that the Constitution's authorization of
armed state militias gave him the right to keep arms. He had bought
deeply into the National Rifle Association's Second Amendment
mumbo-jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature, of course, had provided him with a legal
way to carry his handgun from place to place concealed. He didn't
need a permit to have it in his office, although his wearing it in
a holster there under his smock was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He unholstered the weapon and let me heft it right there. It
felt good, that piece. Well-balanced. Not too heavy, but worthy of
a manly grasp. Nothing like the unwieldy .45 I had wielded so
ineffectively in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just line up the red dot where you want to hit and squeeze. Go
ahead,'' he said. I heard the click and imagined the devastation.
It was exhilarating. I just knew that I could really blow away some
menacing tin cans with that fancy hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, however, was also a little scary. It is, after
all, a bit unsettling to have a guy who is armed and waiting for
Armageddon about to fuss around with your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't bother at that time to try to explain to him the
historical context in which the Second Amendment evolved _ how it
has no relevance to individual gun ownership today and very little
relevance to anything else now that the National Guard has replaced
the state militias.
</P>
<P>
   My well-protected optometrist went on to tell me about how he
made his corner of that shopping strip safe, how the police didn't
worry about that area because they knew he was there and that he
had taken the training that gave him the license to tote heat.
</P>
<P>
   Since that eye care center was located on a thoroughfare that
bordered a predominantly African-American neighborhood and a
Hispanic neighborhood, I wondered about the roots of the eye
doctor's motivation for packing iron while dilating pupils.
</P>
<P>
   But I concluded that he wasn't a racist. He would be an equal
opportunity shooter if the occasion arose. That was what really
troubled me about him. I suspected that a threatening intruder
would make his day.
</P>
<P>
   I could not help but speculate about how many more people in the
states that allow individuals to carry concealed or openly have
that same kind of mind-set. I suspected that he was not unique. But
I didn't leap to the hasty conclusion that a large percentage of
the licensed-to-carry crowd are bent that way.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that episode today, I have concluded that my erstwhile
(meaning not anymore) optometrist was a victim of the gun
industry's successful campaigns during the past half century to
glamorize and glorify its products.
</P>
<P>
   The gun folks have been abetted enormously in their brainwashing
efforts by the movie industry, which has made gun violence a
pervasive element of its repertoire and has made killing seem
almost casual behavior, devaluing human life and transforming
characters who mow down scores of other fictional people into
heroic figures.
</P>
<P>
   Gun industry snake-oil pushers also have succeeded in wrapping
their products in bunting by knowingly perpetuating the Second
Amendment fraud and thereby persuading gun enthusiasts that they
are upholding some grand constitutional principle by opposing gun
control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It is well, then, that the Million Mom March has not ended with
the events of last weekend. A Million Mom March Foundation is to be
formed to keep up the pressure for more gun control legislation and
the enforcement of that already on the books. At the same time, the
foundation will provide the public with information on how its
representatives in Congress stand on gun issues and the extent of
their support from the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's educational efforts will ultimately prove more
significant to the cause of curbing gun proliferation in this
society than the actual legislation that Congress now is
considering as a result of the march.
</P>
<P>
   Such pressure will go far toward deglamorizing guns, dispelling
the gun culture mystique and reducing the number of guns that are
available to tempt troubled children, criminals, emotionally
damaged grownups and oddballs like my erstwhile optometrist.

   BEIJING _ The way Chinese factory workers see it, lay-offs loom
inevitably in their future, regardless of any vote by the U.S.
Congress or whether China joins any world trade bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run factories they work at are dinosaurs left-over
from the era of the planned economy and will most likely not make
it in the era of global economic competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only result from joining (the World Trade Organization) is
China will lay off a huge number of workers,'' said a 43-year-old
worker at the Beijing Textile Machine Factory, who declined to give
his name. ``I'm already facing being laid off. Joining WTO will
only make it sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Congress prepares to vote on permanently normalizing
trade relations with China _ which President Bill Clinton says is
necessary to allow the United States to benefit from a far-reaching
trade accord securing China's entry into the WTO _ all that
laborers here see is a rapidly-changing economy that is leaving
them behind as it further opens its 1.2 billion-consumer market to
the world.
</P>
<P>
   What were once pillars of the Marxist economy are now just dead
weight as China readies itself to join the ``club'' of global
trading powers. The government has been aggressively pushing
state-owned enterprises to either shut down or make a profit and
has closed thousands of money-losing factories.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million textile workers have already lost their jobs
in the last two years. With reforms in other industries, such as
steel and coal mining, the number of laid-off workers will reach 12
million by the end of the year, according to government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Such wrenching change has been difficult for millions of
middle-aged workers in China who came of age in the era of the
``iron rice bowl'' and still look to Chairman Mao Zedong for
ideological guidance. The state provided not just a job but took
care of their housing, medical care, schooling and food
distribution as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Textile Machine Factory looks as though its walls haven't
been painted nor its machinery updated since it opened in 1958. The
only way it has kept itself alive is by slicing off its property
piece-by-piece and going into the lucrative real estate market. A
few of its buildings are rented to an exclusive private school
where diplomats and expatriates send their children. Another large
block has given way to three high-rise apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its laid-off workers have gotten janitorial or other
temporary work in these new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew when he would be laid off, the 43-year-old
worker, who has been at the factory since he was 18 and makes about
US$50 a month, replied: ``That's in the hands of the factory
officials. One day they'll tell you they don't need you and just
kick you out and send you home.''
</P>
<P>
   His bitterness is mild compared to the anger of other workers
around the country who haven't been paid in months or even years.
Scattered protests and other disturbances have been reported with
growing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   One worker tried to give an American reporter the upside of
globalization. Liu Jiuwang, 44, who has been painting machines at
the factory for 20 years, said accession in the WTO would be good
for Chinese consumers as they could buy a wider variety of goods at
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``More foreign brands will enter China, and I can choose whether
to buy products from Japan or Singapore or Malaysia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a monthly salary of US$60, it is unlikely Liu can often
take advantage of such a selection. He said it will take him two
years to save for a computer for his teen-age daughter ``if we're
not picky about what we eat or drink.''
</P>
<P>
   With their future uncertain, many workers did not seem ready for
the new world economy. A 48-year-old worker who has been at the
textile machine factory for 30 years said he didn't know what he
was qualified to do after he is laid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My niece works at (a high-tech) company,'' said the worker,
who declined to give his name. ``Her generation thinks we should do
it all. But my generation thinks we shouldn't do any of it. We're
different generations. We have nothing to talk about. We grew up
under Chairman Mao's principles.''

&HT;     NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF, UNLESS YOU'RE A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STACIE ORSAGH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Like many kids, Mia Balderas sleeps in her own
bedroom, with a nightly routine of story time, prayer and turning
on the night light.
</P>
<P>
   But as shadows creep across walls and tree branches scrape
against the house, her 5-year-old imagination runs wild.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason parents find themselves back in the bedroom to
read one more story, tuck the kiddo in one more time or bring
another glass of water to a suddenly thirsty child: fear. Fear of
the bogeyman, fear of noises or simply fear of the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents remember encounters with the bogeyman or in the
Mexican-American culture, El Cucui, the fictitious monster that
lurks under children's beds. Now parents must help their own
children cope with certain fears.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling fear is a normal part of children's development and
should not be seen as unusual, said Ed Gerwell, a San Antonio
psychologist who treats both children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear teaches young children to avoid certain dangers in
reality,'' he said. ``The unknown is an insecurity in children;
they don't have adult capabilities and experiences of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Not being able to control things is a struggle for children, and
parents are key to alleviating these qualms. According to Gerwell,
insecurities need to be conquered for the child to be successful in
overcoming the fears, and parents are the security blankets
children look to for comfort. Children look to parents to protect
them, said Roger Tripp, a licensed professional counselor at
Christus Santa Rosa Hospital in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is most important for parents to act in control of the
situation,'' Tripp said. ``Telling the child, `I am here, I will
help,' will reassure them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parental attitudes set the stage for children's reactions. Anger
toward a child makes him or her more uneasy, Gerwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child is already afraid. If a parent gets angry it only
scares the child more,'' Gerwell said. ``This tends to make the
child feel like he is doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rene and Liz Balderas try their best to help Mia and her two
younger sisters cope with the nightly apprehensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia doesn't know about the bogeyman or the cucui, but she
feels very threatened at times,'' Rene Balderas said. ``A fear
still exists within her, regardless of what we have and have not
told her. I guess it is real easy to believe in bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerned parents have discovered that following a routine
alleviates the stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just throw her in her room, turn off the light and
say goodnight,'' Rene Balderas said. ``It is a slow transition, we
wind down for bedtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming fears helps children develop a sense of independence
and self-sufficiency. Once children learn to hone their self-help
skills, self-confidence grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that parents avoid ridiculing the child.
Approach the feelings as very real,'' Gerwell said. ``At times they
are struggling and these fears are very real, very potent.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the challenge with the child and not leaving her
suspended in the fear will give the child more confidence, Gerwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing between genuine fear and not wanting to go to bed
can be tricky but setting bedtime rituals can help. Gerwell
explained there is no harm done in returning to the bedroom to
check on the child, but the parents need to be careful how to
approach the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can create more of a problem by taking them into your
bedroom,'' the psychologist said. ``You need to handle it
reasonably and keep them in their environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it can be more serious than expected. If a child is
seriously impaired because of certain fears, a professional should
be contacted. Fears could be coming from real situations that
parents may not be aware of.

&HT;     ASKING QUESTIONS IS A TWO-WAY STREET IN JOB INTERVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How can you go into a job interview, give all
the right answers and still come out a loser? Maybe you didn't ask
the right questions.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who don't ask any insightful questions can come
across as uninterested or self-absorbed, which is hardly what you
are trying to convey to an interviewer. Besides, you should want to
know the answers to certain questions merely for the sake of
self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five questions you should get answered before accepting
any job offer:
</P>
<P>
   What do people dislike most about working there? So that you
don't come across as negative, this might be something you want to
find out through networking rather than your official interviews,
but you ought to know about the main skeletons in the company
closet before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Is management arrogant? Is back-stabbing common? Is there high
turnover or are there lingering disputes? Do people laugh when you
mention work-life balance?
</P>
<P>
   The company might well be wonderful, but if all you hear are
positives, you are getting snowed. If you don't think so, consider
San Francisco. It's one of the world's favorite cities, but any
resident could quickly list a dozen of its faults, including the
San Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's perfect. No company is, either.
</P>
<P>
   Think about one question you can ask the interviewer that shows
that you've done your research and thought about how you could help
the company. The more insightful the question, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: This should be a question that shows you've done your
research _ not that you haven't. If the answer to the question
could be found easily by checking the company's Web site, it's the
wrong question.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful, too, that the question doesn't come across as
arrogant, as if the company should have implemented some policy
three years ago. You want to come across as sincerely interested,
not smug.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you were going to work for a car maker. ``Is the company
planning to add an SUV to its line?'' might be a good, sincere
question. ``Why doesn't the company sell an SUV?'' asks the same
thing, but can come across as judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   Does the company value diversity as much, or as little, as you
do? Again, this might be something you'll answer more through
networking than through your formal interviews.
</P>
<P>
   If diversity is important to you, try to talk with high-ranking
women and minorities to learn about the corporate culture. If you
can't find any of them, you might already have your answer.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are high-ranking minorities and women, don't just
assume that the company values diversity. If you shove everyone
into the same mold, you don't have a diverse organization, no
matter what your employee demographics say.
</P>
<P>
   Are people from different backgrounds encouraged to share ideas,
or is everything run from the top down? Does the company encourage
flexibility and work-life balance, or is everyone single, under 30
and working 80 hours a week?
</P>
<P>
   Diversity can come in a lot of forms, and so can bigotry. Some
people would never think about saying an ethnic slur, but wouldn't
think twice about stereotyping dot-commers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some people think diversity is an overblown
buzzword. If you are more comfortable around people who think and
act the same way you do, you might prefer an organization that
downplays diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the company be 10 years from now? You can land a job
with a lot of companies, but don't count on a career unless that
company has a plan for the future. If no one can tell you how the
company will be stronger 10 years from now than it is today, stop
and think about whether you might be in a dead-end career.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you should turn down the job, but don't think
it will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Do you understand exactly what the company is offering? In the
era of stock options, this is a more crucial question than it used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   How much extra value are those options adding? Do you get to
keep them if you leave the company? What happens to them if you are
laid off? What happens if the company gets sold instead of going
public? Are you protected if the company runs out of cash?
</P>
<P>
   Before you leave your current job for the new one, make sure you
have the offer in writing. That provides at least a little
protection from any misunderstandings.

 &HT;    `Chicago Hope,' `Now and Again' get ax
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ CBS will put a big bet down on Bette Midler in the
fall, giving the star her own sitcom at 8 p.m. Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   The downside: ``The Bette Show'' has to go up against ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish `Millionaire' wasn't there. So does Bette,'' Leslie
Moonves, president of CBS Television, said Wednesday. ``We think
she's big enough to hold her own.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Bette Show,'' Midler plays an entertainer named Bette
Midler who is very much like herself, but with a college professor
husband and a teenage daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming on CBS this fall, in a schedule announced Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Fugitive'' (8 p.m. Fridays), a revival of the old TV
series (and film). Tim Daly (``Wings'') plays Dr. Richard Kimble,
and Mykelti Williamson (``Forrest Gump'') is Lt. Philip Gerard, the
cop trying to capture him as he hops from city to city. The pilot,
produced by Warner Bros., is reportedly the most expensive TV pilot
ever made, at more than $6 million for the action sequences. (Drama
pilots generally cost in the $2 million range.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Yes, Dear'' (8:30 p.m. Mondays), a sitcom about two young
couples with different views on parenting (one's neurotic, one's
blase). No big names (Anthony Clark, Jean Louisa Kelly) in this
one.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``C.S.I.'' (9 p.m. Fridays), a crime drama with William
Petersen (``To Live and Die in L.A.'') and Marg Helgenberger as
forensic investigators.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``That's Life'' (8 p.m. Saturdays), which Moonves calls a
``charming and whimsical'' hour drama about a 30-ish New Jersey
woman (Heather Paige Kent) who leaves her blue-collar life to go to
college. Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino play her parents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The District'' (10 p.m. Saturdays) stars Craig T. Nelson
(``Coach'') as the police commissioner of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Welcome to New York'' (8:30 p.m. Wednesdays), a comedy about
an Indiana weatherman trying to hold his own at a New York
television station. The show loosely parallels David Letterman's
life, and comes from his production company.
</P>
<P>
   One surprising renewal on CBS' schedule is ``City of Angels,''
the Steven Bochco hospital drama with a predominantly
African-American cast. As the only black drama on television,
``Angels'' was No. 2 this season among black households (UPN's
``The Parkers'' is No. 1), but still has not caught on with white
viewers. Despite lukewarm ratings, Moonves renewed the show, and
will move it to 9 p.m. Thursdays. ``Obviously there's a lot of
attention being paid to it, but it's a good show or it wouldn't be
on our schedule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gone from the CBS schedule: ``Chicago Hope,'' the long
troubled medical drama; ``Now and Again,'' the quirky Friday night
romantic drama that never quite caught hold with audiences;
``Martial Law,'' the kung fu series starring Sammo Hung; ``Early
Edition''; and ``Ladies Man,'' the Monday night sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ellen DeGeneres Show,'' a sketch-variety show similar to
the old ``Carol Burnett Show,'' is still in development. Moonves
said it will be a midseason replacement show.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be no remake of ``The $64,000 Question'' in an attempt
to jump on the ``Millionaire'' bandwagon. Moonves said the pilot
``just wasn't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Movies and miniseries coming next season on CBS include:
``Blonde,'' a semifictionalized life of Marilyn Monroe, based on
Joyce Carol Oates' novel; ``An American Tragedy,'' a look at O.J.
Simpson's ``Dream Team'' of lawyers (in which Simpson barely
appears), produced by Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana
(``Homicide''); ``Haven,'' a true story starring Natasha Richardson
as an Oskar Schindler-type who rescued 1,000 people during the
Holocaust; and ``Jewel,'' an adaptation of Bret Lott's best seller
(and Oprah Book Club pick) starring Farrah Fawcett and Cicely
Tyson. The previously announced live staging of ``On Golden Pond''
with Julie Andrews and a docudrama about the Elian Gonzalez case
are also in the works for next season.
</P>
<P>
   New shows for Pax TV
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling Pax TV network said Wednesday it would introduce
three new series later this year. ``Mysterious Ways,'' co-starring
Rae Dawn Chong, is about a professor driven to uncover the
mysteries behind uncanny occur-
</P>
<P>
   rences. ``The Rumfords'' is believed to be the first prime-time
series to mix cartoons and live-action comedy. ``Encounters With
the Unexplained'' is a reality series that explores some of the
mysteries of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus will star in ``Doc,'' a
series about a country doctor who moves to Manhattan, but it won't
debut on Pax until next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and UPN deliver their new schedules today.

&HT;     GRILLS: KEEPING UP WITH THE JONESES' MAY COST MEGABUCKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MALTA, N.Y. _ John Michaels is designing the ultimate barbecue
station.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels, the president of a home-building company, is in the
process of outfitting his Lake George summer residence with
state-of-the-art gas and charcoal grills.
</P>
<P>
   He has selected the top-line Beefeater gas grill, a
stainless-steel model from Australia that is the sport-utility
vehicle of outdoor grills. It has four separate 18,000 BTU
cast-iron burners and includes a wok burner. Michaels is having the
grill, which retails for as much as $3,569, built into stonework on
his deck.
</P>
<P>
   But he figures he will do most of his cooking in the Big Green
Egg, a new heavy-duty ceramic smoker and grill that uses lump
charcoal. A clay material product made in Atlanta, the Egg is
designed for slower cooking at lower temperatures. It costs
approximately $500, depending on the size.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels, who estimates his new barbecue station is going to set
him back $6,000 or so, intends to include a refrigerator cooler for
clams that will also be built into the stonework.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my regular house, I do almost all of my cooking with gas,
which I associate more with suburbia. But at the camp, I prefer to
use charcoal as much as possible,'' he said. ``The cheaper model
grills work all right, but you end up replacing them every few
years. In the long haul, this will save me money, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In the age of conspicuous consumption, high-end grills are in _
and getting higher and higher every year.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least a half-dozen different companies making
super-premium outdoor grills that cost $2,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back yard has become a very big investment area for
families,'' said Donna Myers, a spokeswoman for the Barbecue
Industry Association and publisher of The Backyard Barbecuer
newsletter. ``One thousand to $2,000 grills are not considered even
very expensive anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for a moment, the possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Williams-Sonoma 48-inch stainless-steel grill cart, which
comes with an electric plug-in rotisserie. Cost: $4,995.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Grand Cafe 3000, by Grand Haul. It features cast brass
burners and infrared flavorizer bars, along with a built-in side
burner. Cost: $2,489.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bulky DCS (Dynamic Cooking Systems), with its
porcelain-plated grill grates, 693 square inches of cooking area
and 79,000 BTU. Cost: $4,465.
</P>
<P>
   _ The premium grill from Weber, the Budweiser of barbecue
companies. Weber-Stephen Co.'s Summit 650 is so powerful it uses
only natural gas to fire up the six burners stoking 75,000 BTUs. It
will handle everything from turkeys to baking a cake. Cost: $3,389.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Myers notes that the high-end market constitutes a
small percentage of the more than 8 million gas grills sold
annually in the United States (compared with 5 million charcoal
grills, a complete reversal from a decade earlier, when charcoal
outsold gas almost 2-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   There are many gas grills available for under $200, but the
fastest growing segment of the market, according to Myers, is
grills that sell for $400 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   Ducane makes a solid grill in the $600 range, and the Weber
Genesis line is in the same ballpark. As are many others.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the grills that sell for almost 10 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Just think, Father's Day is right around the corner. And you
still have time to get to the bank and take out a second mortgage,
if a top-line grill is what you are after.

&HT;     FOR A NEW TWIST ON NOODLES, TAKE A HINT FROM GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LISA STEVENS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight for dinner, you're in for a German treat.
</P>
<P>
   Spaetzle, a staple of southern Germany, is taking center stage
as the side dish. Forget the rice and potatoes. These tiny noodles
or dumplings made with flour, eggs, water and salt, are so
delicious, they'll fly off your plate. In fact, the literal
translation of spaetzle is ``little sparrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The dough can be firm enough to roll out and cut into strips or
soft enough to be pressed through a sieve or colander. Add spaetzle
to soups or serve as side dish to beef, poultry, pork or fish. The
noodles are great for soaking up meat juices, sauces and gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Toss with butter or sour cream, pan-fry with a little butter and
onion or saute the spaetzle in olive oil and chopped garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Other serving suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheese spaetzle: Heat cooked and well-drained spaetzle in a
frying pan with butter. Stir in 4 to 5 tablespoons of Swiss cheese.
Top with sliced onions browned in butter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spaetzle and eggs: Brown cooked spaetzle in butter. Beat two
eggs, add chopped herbs (such as thyme, chervil or parsley) and
pour over spaetzle in the frying pan. Stir and heat until the eggs
are set.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kraut spaetzle: Drain 1 1/2 pounds sauerkraut. Mix sauerkraut
with a small chopped onion and brown in frying pan with butter. In
a separate pan, fry 1 cup cooked and well-drained spaetzle until
golden brown. Just before serving, combine all the ingredients. Top
with bacon bits, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mushroom spaetzle: Toss warm spaetzle with sauteed sliced
mushrooms. Sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spaetzle Italiano: Saute prosciutto, pancetta or pepperoni
cubes in butter. Add spaetzle and heat thoroughly. Serve with
tomato sauce.

CONCEPTUAL ART FINDS A HOME ON EBAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all heard plenty about the eBay hucksters, the folks who
try to pawn off just about everything but a bridge in Brooklyn.
Last week, it was the sensitive guy hawking the ``100 percent
genuine raft used by Elian.'' This week, it's the henpecked
``husband'' unloading a painting because his ``wife'' hates
abstract images that resemble the work of modern master Richard
Diebenkorn (wink, wink).
</P>
<P>
   I mean, really. Would you offer $135,805, sight unseen, to an
art dealer who goes by the name ``golfpoorly?''
</P>
<P>
   The eBay con artists get all the attention, but what about the
lesser-known eBay artists? That's right. There is a new breed of
artist using the Internet auction site as a forum for creative
expression. Their work is hard to categorize; it's a combination of
conceptual art and performance art, sort of like a digital
happening in cyberspace. Where else can an artist reach a potential
audience of millions? What better place to make a wry comment on
our materialistic consumer culture?
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, sometimes it's hard to tell the serious artists from
the salesmen. Consider Lot 31: a postcard of a goat nursing a baby.
Was this recent sale an artist's attempt to exorcize childhood
scars or simply somebody getting rid of tacky stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Cyber artist Jeff Gates is definitely earnest about his auction
oeuvre. Last year, he posted an unusual item on eBay: his
demographics. Art world folks were impressed with his statement
about the value of art and the nature of privacy, but serious
bidders had no interest in the statistics of a middle-aged artist
and bureacrat. So Gates, who heads the new media initiative at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art, turned the original
auction page into a framed art print and tried to sell that. Alas,
no takers. But Gates made his point. ``I'm interested in
advertising and how things get branded and sold,'' he says. In a
world where everything is up for sale, including our personal data,
how do we place a value on art?
</P>
<P>
   And what is art, anyway? Some eBay artists are using the
Internet to thumb their noses at the art establishment. The
collaborative RTMark, best known for switching the voiceboxes in
Barbie and GI Joe dolls a few years back, was invited to
participate in the Whitney Biennial this year; the group auctioned
off four tickets to the glitzy Whitney gala and then used the
proceeds ($8,400) to fund its anti-corporate activism.
</P>
<P>
   A group of students at the California Institute of the Arts got
some unexpected results when they tried a similar form of
experiment. The artists, who called themselves Akshun, auctioned
off their space in the school's art gallery on eBay last fall. They
were simply critiquing the elitist gallery system; they didn't
expect to stir up trouble with the State Department. It turns out a
group of dissident artists in North Korea were the lead bidders for
the space. The only problem? The sale was illegal under the Trading
with the Enemy Act. Sweet irony, that.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual artist Cary Peppermint (yes, that's his real name)
hasn't exactly created an international incident with his eBay
experiments, but he is deliberately provocative. In one piece, he
claimed to be auctioning off nude photos of his ex-girlfriend. As
the auction proceeded, he posted titillating (but not quite nude)
photos on the site. The model in the photos wasn't really his
ex-girlfriend, but Peppermint says he felt guilty anyway, as if he
had exploited someone. ``I ended up operating under the thesis that
whoever fakes an illness, ends up staying in bed,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Peppermint is continuing his eBay exploits; earlier this year,
he auctioned an item called ``Use Cary Peppermint as a Medium.''
For $107.50, the winning bidder, artist Tim Whidden, received the
right to tell Peppermint what to do in a performance piece. So a
few weeks ago, Peppermint masqueraded as Whidden at a lecture at
Bard College; in front of a rather perplexed audience, he gave a
long tirade about Jennifer Love Hewitt before he was interrupted by
the real Tim Whidden.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about artists dissing the art establishment,
and it seems somehow appropriate to throw such statements into the
digital bazaar, along with the gizmos, the gadgets, and the garage
sale leftovers. But let's not take this too seriously and start
using the language of the art world to describe this passing fancy
as an emerging school of eBay art. ``It's a temporal aesthetic,''
explains Peppermint. ``I'll walk away when the time is right.''
</P>

   Oh my goodness. Another Internet ``first!'' The folks at
www.AtomFilms.com have launched a ``total immersion'' film; called
``The Arrival,'' the film uses a technology that enables viewers to
choose the camera angle as they watch. It's still fairly primitive;
as you watch the film, it's easy to spend the whole time looking
out the window of a car or gazing at the floor. The film does have
a cute surprise ending; let's just say it concerns the death of Old
Media.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, www.Ifilm.com has recast itself as a search engine
and portal for online film in an attempt to differentiate itself
from other entertainment sites. The site will provide a guide to
its competition, including Atom Films, Shockwave, DEN, Wirebreak,
and Urban Entertainment.

   They call this convergence? A squishy foam foot that you can
squeeze during periods of high anxiety? Fox.com sent over this
little toy to promote its new Web site, www.peggysfeet.com. The
site was a companion to Sunday's episode of ``King of the Hill,''
which is about, well, Peggy Hill's big feet. The site is mildly
amusing, but it isn't exactly a major breakthrough in the merging
of the Web and television. But the foam foot is cute: I wonder how
much it will sell for on eBay?

MICROSOFT'S SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; sometimes use this space to defend Microsoft Corp. against
the US Justice Department. I do so for three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --Much of the case against Microsoft is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   --To the extent that the company has done wrong, dismantling it
is a grossly disproportionate response.
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, why bother? If Microsoft continues its recent
idiocies, it will end up eviscerating itself.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the antitrust case, which the company could have
settled painlessly a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Love Bug virus that attacked millions of
Microsoft-based computers worldwide, because Microsoft
intentionally left dangerous security holes in its products.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Microsoft's legal threat against Slashdot, one of
the Internet's most respected technology sites. The company's
behavior is as clueless as it is brutish. Here's the story:
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about the free Linux operating system, the most
famous open-source product, but there are many others. Kerberos,
for instance, is a data protocol designed to let people communicate
with computer networks without worrying their data might be
intercepted by bad guys. It was created at MIT, which freely offers
it to any software companies that want to add it to their products.
Kerberos has become quite a hit with businesses that rely on
versions of the Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, sensibly enough, added Kerberos support to its
high-end corporate operating system, Windows 2000. But in standard
Microsoft fashion, the company also wanted to ``improve'' it, by
adding features to Kerberos that would make it work better with
other Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   People in the open source software community howled, and not
without reason. According to the notorious ``Halloween documents''
leaked to the public in 1998, Microsoft considered this very tactic
to undermine the popularity of open source software products like
the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could add open source features to its own products,
but make changes in them. The open source features would still work
with other companies' products, but would work even better with
other Microsoft products. This would give Microsoft customers a
reason to stay loyal.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department, suing Microsoft for antitrust
violations, said the Kerberos move was an unfair tactic to maintain
Microsoft's dominance of the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   They're correct, except for the ``unfair'' part. Microsoft has
every right to improve on existing products in ways that give them
an edge on rivals. As long as Microsoft's Kerberos still works with
other versions, I figure they're in the clear.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Microsoft promised to publish the details of its
changes to Kerberos. That would give other software makers a chance
to make their products compatible with Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's Kerberos document featured a bizarre legal
notice that said, in effect, ``Everything you read here belongs to
Microsoft. Don't try it at home.'' Microsoft published the data as
a ploy to show its ``openness,'' but ordered open source
programmers to act as if they'd never seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the popular Slashdot Web site published the
Microsoft document with the copyright warning removed, Microsoft
e-mailed Slashdot and threatened to sue if the offending materials
weren't removed. So far, Slashdot has refused. Perhaps it's eager
to see if Microsoft, a company on the verge of being ripped apart
for antitrust violations, would be stupid enough to pick a fight
over Kerberos.
</P>
<P>
   For a mature response to open source software, consider IBM
Corp.'s decision to offer Linux on its S/390 mainframes, the
machines that run banks, factories and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   IBM will provide full corporate-grade support for Linux running
on its top-of-the-line hardware. Big Blue has had to upgrade Linux
to work on mainframes, but it's giving away its improvements at no
charge. Indeed, IBM has teams of programmers writing new and better
open source software, and giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   It's not altruism, of course. IBM makes its money selling
computer services, and can afford to give away software to get a
foot in the door. It's the same gambit Microsoft used with its Web
browser. Microsoft was right to do it, no matter what the courts
say. And IBM is right to embrace Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft reacts to the open source challenge with an
unseemly blend of spite and panic. When you're as self-destructive
as Microsoft has been in recent years, a court-ordered breakup
begins to seem almost academic.

THE REAL TERRORIST THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The primary terrorist threats to the United States,'' reports
the State Department in its latest survey of global terrorism,
``emanate from two regions, South Asia and the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline the point, the trial of two Libyan agents
accused of blowing up a jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988
opened just two days after the new report was released. Of the 270
victims murdered in the bombing of Pan Am 103, 70 percent were
American. Wednesday, President Clinton confirmed that agents of
Osama bin Laden plotted last December to bomb large crowds of
Americans celebrating New Year's Eve. The State Department's
conclusion that Americans are most at risk from terror groups
operating out of the Middle East or South Asia must seem a grim
statement of the obvious to anyone who follows the news.
</P>
<P>
   But not to Ali Abunimah. Writing on the op-ed page of The New
York Times last week, the vice president of the Arab American
Action Network cited ``the government's own data'' to prove the
government wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 169 specifically anti-American attacks on foreign soil
in 1999,'' Abunimah wrote, ``96 were in Latin America, 30 were in
Western Europe . . . nine in the . . . former Soviet Union, and 16
in Africa. Only 11 were in the Middle East, and just six in Asia.''
Yet Latin American terrorists, he noted, ``get less attention than
groups with Arab or Muslim orientations.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is good reason for the focus on Arab and Muslim
terrorists: They pose by far the greatest danger to American life
and limb.
</P>
<P>
   Every terror attack is an outrage, but the most frightful are
the ones that result in casualties _ human beings killed and
maimed. It is true that many anti-American attacks occur in Latin
America. Hostages have been kidnapped for ransom; oil pipelines
have been bombed. But in very few of those attacks have any
Americans been hurt. Terrorism from the Middle East and South Asia,
by contrast, is the terrorism that puts Americans in the hospital _
or the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1999, 67 US citizens were killed in
international terrorist attacks, according to the State
Department's annual chronologies. (Attacks by American
perpetrators, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, are omitted.) Of
those victims, 87 percent were murdered by terrorists based in the
Middle East or South Asia. Over the same period, 1,299 Americans
were wounded in terrorist incidents. Fully 99 percent were attacked
by terrorists from the Middle East or South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   (It isn't only Americans who are threatened by these terrorists.
Almost 75 percent of all deaths attributed to international
terrorism since 1993 were caused by groups from the Middle
East/South Asia. Those groups were likewise responsible for 87
percent of all attacks that left victims wounded.)
</P>
<P>
   But statistics are hardly necessary to prove that the terrorism
deadliest to Americans comes, in Abunimah's phrase, from ``groups
with Arab or Muslim orientations.'' Just run through the list of
lethal attacks; invariably the butchers were Muslim and/or Arab.
Pan Am 103. The World Trade Center. The Marines in Beirut. The 19
US airmen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Leon Klinghoffer on the Achille
Lauro. Robbie Stethem, the Navy diver on TWA 847. The 12 Americans
_ and 212 Africans _ blown up at the US embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The only notable exception to this bloody list is Oklahoma City.
Yet, oddly enough, Oklahoma City was the one atrocity Abunimah
mentioned in his column. Why? To make the claim that Arabs and
Muslims ``have too often borne the brunt of government suspicion
and media stereotyping,'' since in the first hours after the Murrah
Building was bombed, there was some speculation that Islamic
extremists might have been responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly unjust suspicion and stereotyping should be condemned.
``Muslim'' and ``Arab'' are not synonyms for ``terrorist.'' But
given the awful toll of victims killed and wounded by Muslim and
Arab terrorists, surely the vice president of the Arab American
Action Network would want to denounce their crimes as vehemently as
possible. Surely he would want to make it clear that Arabs and
Muslims in America are horrified by terror committed by evil men
claiming to act for the sake of Islam or the Arab people.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Abunimah says nothing at all about the Arab/Islamic
terrorism that has shattered so many lives _ except to warn against
``overreacting'' to it. If Abunimah is scandalized by the savagery
of terror organizations like Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, or
the Osama Bin Laden network, he gives no hint of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a much longer version of his essay that he disseminated
online, Abunimah disputes that Hezbollah is really guilty of
terrorism, excuses Iran's support for terror groups, and says he is
``deeply skeptical'' that Bin Laden is a terrorist mastermind. It
is no surprise that he also holds that terrorism out of the
Arab/Muslim world is not that big a threat to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   If only someone would tell the terrorists. ``To kill the
Americans and their allies, civilians, and military,'' proclaimed
Bin Laden in February 1998, ``is an individual duty for every
Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do
it.'' Six months later, the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam were blown to bits.

NEXT STOP: GIBSON'S 1.12 ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ On the eighth date of Pedro's Baseball Tour, the star
of the show arrived at work as he normally does. He was
well-dressed: black shirt, black pants, and a gray jacket. And
after being told, teasingly, that his short afro was similar to
Fred Sanford's, he teased his own hair until it was slicked back
into a style that a young Billy Dee Williams once perfected.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez looked good at SkyDome, even though he didn't
feel it. ``A bad day,'' he replied, when asked to critique his
performance. ``A bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   If Martinez continues to have bad days like this, he will easily
win his second consecutive Cy Young Award and first MVP trophy. He
shut out the Blue Jays for seven innings, striking out six. He hit
two batters, walked three, and never allowed anyone to reach third
base.
</P>
<P>
   You could say he played to the crowd of 20,078. They were quiet
and so was he. This was the mellow side of Pedro. There was not
much tension in the temperature-controlled air. Maybe if the dome's
roof had been left open, the outside chill would have made fans
squirm a bit more. But you often got the feeling you were in an
antiseptic pitching laboratory, observing the work of the famous
scientist, Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won the game, 8-0, and finished their two-city road
trip with a 6-1 record. Martinez is now 7-1 with a 0.90 earned run
average. He has allowed one run in his last 32 innings. He said he
knew in the bullpen that his fastball wasn't working, so he would
have to rely on his other pitches. That's exactly what he did, and
the Blue Jays still couldn't handle it. Dave Stewart, Toronto's
assistant general manager, anticipated a great Martinez
performance. Stewart, one of the best pitchers of the late 1980s
and early '90s, said that he believes Martinez can finish with an
ERA below 1.12. The last man to do that was Bob Gibson, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   And (itals)this(unitals) was a bad day?
</P>
<P>
   No one left the park asking for refunds. The only consistent
noise came from a fan sitting on the first-base side. He yelled
insults at Martinez in the first. He softened his criticism in the
third. By the fifth, he was as quiet as the Toronto bats. He
finally resigned himself to watching science like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez looked Raul Mondesi up and down and noticed that the
slugger's body language seemed to say ``I'm having trouble seeing
the ball.'' So he threw Mondesi vexing curveballs and struck him
out. Long before that, Martinez went to the bench and sat next to
his big brother, Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you feel?'' Ramon asked his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good. Actually, I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon didn't completely agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a little slow,'' he said. ``You need to pick up the
tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   So Martinez decided to work quicker. On a ``bad'' day, the
advice was helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things a lot of people might not understand,'' Pedro
Martinez said. ``Those are big reasons I would like to have Ramon
all the time. (Pitching coach) Joe (Kerrigan) never said anything
to me. Ramon picked it up right away. He said, `You have to pick up
the tempo and get a groove going. You might feel great today, but
you're not looking too good. So you have to pick up the tempo, get
a little rhythm going. Get them to swing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Martinez spoke of a flawed release point. There were
glazed looks as he explained his technical breakdowns. Really, a
lot of people with backstage passes for the Martinez Tour couldn't
see what the major problem was. They just wanted to see the small
man with the minute ERA.
</P>
<P>
   There was such a media overflow that Martinez had to hold a
press conference in a football locker room. He is such an
attraction now that he is affecting how you approach your weekly
schedule, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   You probably know that he next pitches Tuesday. What are you
doing Tuesday? If there is a man or woman you want to impress, you
might want to consider taking them to see Pedro at Fenway. You'll
invite them to see Pedro, they'll see that Pedro is cool and, since
it was your idea, you will be cool, too. Trust me. (I should be a
dating counselor.)
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is pitching on the 28th of this month and will
certainly be featured in some pre-Memorial Day parties. He will
most likely pitch June 8 at Fenway against Einar Diaz and the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man people want to see. Even on bad days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about guys who can match `it,' there are
only two guys in the game who can do `it': Randy Johnson and
Pedro,'' Stewart said. ``So if you're asking me if anybody has a
chance, I say yes. Those guys are the only two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is Gibson's 1.12. It is a body-of-work accomplishment. It
says, simply, that you were very good every time you took the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the talent for it,'' Stewart said. ``Just look at the
talent. You can take him back to the 1960s and he would be one of
the best. You can put him in the year 2020 and he is going to be
one of the best pitchers there. No doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is that good, even on his worst days.

 BAY STATE YOUTHS, PARENTS FEEL JOY, PAIN OF GAME-SHOW MANIA  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SANDY COLEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For much of the increasingly game-show-mad nation, it
was the kiddie version of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' But
for students at the Sage School in Foxborough, it recently became a
bittersweet lesson in the pain of losing and labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters for Fox-TV's ``Battle of the Child Geniuses: Who Is
the Smartest Kid in America?'' _ which aired last week with 10- to
12-year-olds competing for bragging rights and $300,000 _ came to
the area earlier in the spring on a nationwide search for
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Academically gifted students at the Sage School got a sharp
taste of what it's like to go brain-to-brain with equally
intellectual peers.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen pupils tried out. Four passed a required written test
with college-level questions given by the show's production staff
members, who came to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``After taking the test, there were a lot of tears because they
figured out they didn't do as well as they thought they would,''
said Diane Asci, a spokeswoman for the show. ``We reassured them
that this is only a game; it's nothing like a college transcript.
This is just for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   After the four finalists did taped interviews, just one was
chosen to appear on the show: Eric Bair, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of 10 million viewers, Bair (who was not
available for comment) lasted 10 minutes before he was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   No one was forced to try out for the show, school officials and
parents point out. And, they emphasized, the tryout was just for
fun. Still, academically gifted students (they hate the word
``genius'') set extremely high expectations for themselves. When
they fall short, there is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Sage principal Katherine Windsor said the game-show tryout was
nevertheless a learning experience. ``It allows us to process with
our children what happens when you are disappointed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, in its search for contestants, the Dick Clark-owned
production company that created the show sold it to schools as
simply a search for ``America's brightest'' children. Later on,
however, the show was retitled, ``Battle of the Child Geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network Web page played up that angle even more,
challenging Web site visitors to take the qualifying test that
``would leave most adults crying for their mommies!''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Anne Smart said she might not have wanted her son,
Michael, to compete for a spot on the show had she known the word
``genius'' would be in the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that label,'' she said. ``We want him to feel as
much like a normal child as anyone else . . . That label means a
person who knows the answers to all the questions all the time and
that you'll always do well. That's not something you want to put on
a 10-year-old child.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was one of the four finalists, Michael seems to have
kept the experience in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous. I knew it didn't have to do with school or
anything,'' he said. The qualifying test ``was a fun test because I
knew it wasn't going to matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And Michael made the decision to try out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we went into it as a family was it will be a great
experience and what happens, happens. We didn't put a lot of weight
to it,'' Anne Smart said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Stearns's son took the test but didn't make the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test was really, really hard. I didn't think it would be
that hard,'' said 11-year-old Brian Stearns, who said he was
disappointed but would try out for the show again if producers
return.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rosenstein, executive director for the National
Association For Gifted Children, said there's nothing wrong with a
little competition, since the world revolves around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the child lost at baseball or football would anyone be
upset? Academic competitions aren't all that different,'' he said.
``Kids win and kids lose. Parents have to understand what they are
getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``what you don't want to do is exploit children,''
Rosenstein said. ``You don't want to use bright kids to do a TV
show if a child can't get something from it _ win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Alioto is glad her son, 11-year-old Matt, made the list of
potential contestants. She said she would have cheered him on if he
made it _ but after hearing about the show, she is equally happy he
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buildup to it, the commercial and the music that was used,
it was daunting. To me they were emphasizing the wrong thing and
putting all this pressure on the kids watching and the kids in
it,'' said Alioto, who said she tries to teach her son the
difference between being a smart person and a wise one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a society of who's the best? Who's the brightest? . . .
What does that say about everybody else?'' she said. ``I'd rather
he be happy and kind than the smartest person in the world.''

HUGH HEFNER UNLIKELY TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ A van pulled up to the Pimilco stakes barn Wednesday
morning bearing a thoroughbred named Hugh Hefner, who had been
shipped from California to race in Saturday's Preakness. The
question is: Why?
</P>
<P>
   It might be harsh to call Hugh Hefner a lowly ``Cal-bred'' _ but
not by much. He has won two races, both restricted to horses bred
in his home state, has a career record of 6-2-2-0, and a mere _ for
this level _ $167,055 in earnings. He appears to have a bit of
talent, but why the Preakness?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make some money,'' said trainer Marty Jones.
``We think he can run good, and Eddie owns the stallion and the
mare. It would be a real big score if his horse jumps up and wins
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie,'' is Ed Nahem, who owns Hugh Hefner as well as his
sire, Bertrando, handicap champion in 1993, and his dam, Personal
Victory. Nahem exited the van resplendent in a black-and-white
print shirt and Panama hat. His attire befits a man who made his
money as an art and antiques dealer, lives in Hollywood, and calls
his stable, modestly, King Edward Racing Stable. And, yes, he is a
friend of Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   But racing isn't a beauty contest, and being surrounded by
glamour isn't going to do Hugh Hefner, the horse, any good when the
gates open for the Preakness and real stars, such as Kentucky Derby
winner Fusaichi Pegasus, take over the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had put the Preakness in our long-term plan,'' said Jones.
``We thought he'd win the Snow Chief (a stakes race for California
breds at Hollywood Park April 30), but he finished second. After
that we hemmed and hawed, but we thought he'd run a big race,
anyway, and we'd give him a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hugh Hefner captured the Cal Sire Stakes at Santa Anita in
October, Nahem and Jones, who is the son of retired trainer Gary
Jones, decided to enter him in the $1 million Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Gulfstream Park. The move turned into a disaster, as
Hugh Hefner finished 13th in a 14-horse field at 50-1. The only
thing about the appearance that caused a stir was when Hugh Hefner,
the human, showed up. Don't expect him at the Preakness, however;
there's not enough glitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse has come a long way in the last couple of months,''
said Jones, who trains approximately 20 horses, many of them owned
by Nahem. ``He's a lot better than he was in Florida. He's matured,
and the blinkers (which were added after the Breeders' Cup) have
helped him move forward. We didn't get a chance to see the real him
in Florida. Whether he can make a difference in the Preakness, I
don't know. But the owner was very involved in the decision to come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Preakness is a difficult goal in any year, but this
year there is real bear in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusaichi Pegasus is a super horse,'' said Jones. ``If he goes
out there and runs his race, we're all running for second money.
But he's a horse, and the favorite doesn't always win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is easy to criticize Hugh Hefner, he does have good
early speed and will be a pace factor over the mile and
three-16ths. The problem is Preakness entrants Hal's Hope and High
Yield have as much, if not more, speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a speed horse,'' said Jones, who has given Victor
Espinoza the mount. ``There is a lot of speed in this race, but we
won't take him out of his style. He'll be on the pace. The break is
always important to our horse. He has to break cleanly to have a
chance. Hopefully, he'll get out good, and get a good position. I
hope they don't go that fast (the Derby horses, led by Hal's Hope,
blazed 6 furlongs in 1:09 4/5). I hope the jockeys can slow it down
a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're asking for a lot here. It's a very tough
race. He's going to have to improve significantly just to be
competitive. But, hey, anything can happen. He's a nice horse, he's
doing well, and we want to give him a chance.''

REVEALING DINOSAURS' SOFTER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Spielberg should consider remaking ``Jurassic
Park.'' It turns out the velociraptor _ the nasty little dinosaur
with the sharp teeth, hook claws, and taloned feet _ had feathers.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence sits just a few blocks from Spielberg's Central
Park West apartment, at the American Museum of Natural History in a
display of dinosaur bones from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   Other images have also been dispelled.
</P>
<P>
   The oviraptor _ once thought to have snatched other dinosaurs'
eggs (its name means ``egg thief'') _ now turns out to have sat in
a nest, hatched eggs, and protected them from predators. Other
species of dinosaurs may have nurtured their children.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the show _ with all its wishbones, head-crests,
peculiar nasal passages, and especially those nests and feathers _
strengthens the growing notion that many kinds of dinosaurs did not
become extinct but evolved into birds.
</P>
<P>
   Why they had feathers is unclear; they couldn't fly. Mark Norell
and Michael Novacek, the museum's chief paleontologists and
co-leaders of the Gobi dig, say the feathers might have been
insulation. Novocek speculates ``they might have been for some
sexual ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this suggests that dinosaurs were gentle. ``They're
mean,'' Novacek emphasized. ``They're just also fairly elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   These scientists speak more confidently than anyone could have a
few years ago, because the Gobi _ a 500,000-square-mile stretch of
barren sand and mountains that they have been exploring for 11
years now _ turns out to be the world's greatest treasure-trove of
fossils from the Cretaceous Era, the late phase of dinosaur rule 80
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On display until Oct. 29, when they go back to Mongolia, are the
fossils of whole skeletons: grown dinosaurs, baby dinosaurs, even
dinosaur embryos _ all as discovered, most of them intact. ``We're
trained to look for chunks of fragments, pieces of a jaw or a tail,
and to be very content with that,'' Novacek said. ``Complete
skeletons _ you just don't find that.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't mere bragging. Charles Scheff, curatorial associate
at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, who has seen
the Gobi collection, Wednesday called it ``an unparalleled
excavation'' that ``throws a whole different light'' on dinosaur
anatomy and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The bones are in such pristine condition because they have been
under deep sand dunes, beneath the reach of scavengers. Apparently,
they were buried alive in a avalanche brought on by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   They are being found now because only in the past 10 years has
Mongolia, situated between Russia and China, reopened its borders.
In the 1920s, the Gobi hosted great dinosaur digs by Roy Chapman
Andrews of the Museum of Natural History. Then Stalin forced the
expulsion of foreigners. Although nominally independent, Mongolia
was closely aligned with the Soviet Union; when the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991 and democratic reforms spread, the new Mongolian
government invited the museum back in.
</P>
<P>
   The show's centerpiece is the ``fighting dinosaurs,'' possibly
the most famous fossils ever, unearthed by Polish and Mongolian
scientists in 1971 but never before seen in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the complete skeletons of a velociraptor and a
protoceratops, locked in combat. The velociraptor is jabbing its
foot into the neck of the protoceratops, which is biting the
velociraptor's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also built dioramas of how various dinosaurs may
have appeared. They look like birds _ strange birds, but birds.
</P>
<P>
   The show appears at a fertile time for dinosaur fans. Chicago's
Field Museum Wednesday unveiled ``Sue,'' the largest Tyrannosaurus
rex ever assembled, from bones found in South Dakota. This week,
Walt Disney releases its computer-animated film, ``Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials here say the timing is happenstance. The
exhibit was planned months ago, as part of a Mongolia Festival
organized by that country's UN mission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is tempting to view the show's revisionism as part of
broader trends. In the 1920s, when Andrews unearthed some of these
species, a brute form of Darwinism prevailed and dinosaurs were
considered pea-brained monsters who beat the daylights out of one
another until their own stupidity rendered them extinct. So, when
Andrews saw the fossil of a dinosaur clutching some eggs, he took
it for a thief and called it ``oviraptor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a more relativistic age, when we shirk from judging
primitive cultures on our own terms, and when dinosaurs are seen as
victims of a meteor, is it mere coincidence that the oviraptor
emerges as a caring mom?
</P>
<P>
   Norell insists it's pure science. Modern methods reveal that the
embryos inside the eggs are of the same species as the dinosaur on
top, and new fossils show the dinosaur clutching the eggs in a
manner clearly protective, not aggressive.

INSIDE.COM HOPES MEDIA TYPES WILL DIG IN FOR DATA, DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past six months, the media world has been abuzz about
Inside.com, an online entertainment news service. Members of the
media, after all, can't resist a good story about, well, members of
the media. And Inside's cofounder Kurt Andersen has certainly
raised interest and eyebrows with his knack for the controversial
quip: He's been going around calling the competition ``a skeptical
dinosaur'' and claiming in print that raising money for the venture
was ``as easy as getting laid in 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   But after all the verbal fisticuffs and foreplay, most folks
were caught off guard when a ``sneak preview'' of the site appeared
quietly last week with little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   So what's inside Inside.com? In its first few days, the site
broke the story about salary negotiations with the cast of
``Friends'' (which is of life-or-death importance to six actors,
their network, and their fans) and published a report on a power
shakeup at the Washington Monthly, no doubt of interest to a small
circle of true insiders. The site also offered an astrological
forecast for Napster cofounder Shawn Fanning (a Sagittarius, for
those who care) and let users vote on who has more power, Steven
Case or Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those features _ the silly and the serious _ are still
displayed prominently on the site, which is so laden with headlines
and charts that it's hard to tell what is old news and what has
been recently updated. The design is a murky sea of black and gray
reminiscent of those ``dinosaurs'' called newspapers; the home page
is as busy as a lottery outlet on the eve of a mega-jackpot
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   And the entire venture is something of a gamble. The burning
question here is: Will anyone be willing to pay for this mix of
news, gossip, data, and horoscopes?
</P>
<P>
   Its high-profile editors Andersen (cofounder of Spy and former
editor of New York) and Michael Hirschorn (former editor of Spin)
are betting that people in the entertainment industry will pay $199
a year (or $19.95 a month) for access to the site. Yet the common
wisdom is that nobody pays for content on the Internet, unless it's
pornography or The Wall Street Journal, respectively, of course.
The online magazine Slate scrapped its subscription attempt after a
year, and it is still losing fistfuls of money. Likewise, online
publications like TheStreet.com and and Salon.com haven't exactly
made a killing after lackluster initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   So why should Inside.com succeed where others have failed? In a
word: data.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the dish and the dirt, Inside aims to crunch numbers
that are of particular interest in the entertainment business. ``We
want to go way off the deep end with the depth of our data, so that
you could roll around in the stuff for hours,'' says Hirschorn.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, users can roll around in yesterday's Nielsen ratings,
last weekend's box office grosses, and last week's Internet traffic
figures from Media Metrix. The site also publishes actual sales
figures from Barnes and Noble, which were featured on the site this
week, along with a news item about the book chain's latest Internet
strategy. So far, most of this data is available in other places,
but Hirschorn says that Inside is building gigantic databases and
that the site will eventually offer more extensive data.
</P>
<P>
   But is that enough to make industry insiders subscribe?
Certainly, thousands of media types hustled to sign up for the
30-day free trial, even though technical problems made it necessary
to fill out the registration form several times. Slate editor
Michael Kinsley was one of the first media people to check out the
site, and for now, he's giving it the benefit of the doubt. ``I
wouldn't say it's a sure thing, but they could succeed where we
failed,'' he says, pausing. ``On the other hand, Warren Buffet's
famous line when someone said that they had learned from their
mistakes was that the idea is to learn from other people's
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But still, the founders didn't have any trouble raising $28
million in venture capital (and if Andersen is to be believed, they
had a darn good time getting it). They also attracted a staff of
seasoned reporters from top print publications; natch, they all
have stock options in the parent company, Powerful Media Inc. The
staff has broken a few stories and turned out straightforward
stories, but so far, the site lacks the edge and the attitude one
might expect from the cofounder of Spy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoops are terrific, but paying your investors from scoops
could be a formidable challenge,'' says Steven Gaydos, executive
editor of Variety, Inside's chief competitor. ``I remember the old
Jimmy Durante line, `Everybody wants to get in the act.' God love
'em. That line was quoted in Variety in about 1932.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, media types wanted at least a look at the act. When the
site appeared a week ago without any advance notice, it was
instantly bogged down with traffic _ and technical glitches. Since
then, features like the Inside Dope and the Daily Digest have been
updated, but many of the stories on the home page haven't changed
since Day One.
</P>
<P>
   And the failure to update the site could be a make-or-break
factor in the subscription model. ``Most news sites start out very
different from each other in the morning, but by the afternoon,
they are all the same,'' says Richard Tofel, vice president of
corporate communications for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which publishes the
Wall Street Journal. ``That's not a great recipe for convincing
people to pay.'' WSJ.com has 438,000 subscribers who pay $29 to $49
a year for access to the site, which is updated round the clock
with reports from the Dow Jones news service.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal has a captive audience of business readers, many of
whom are able to expense their subscriptions. You could argue that
Inside.com has a similar audience: Media moguls have an
unquenchable thirst for news and gossip about their own. Just
witness the pre-launch hype for Inside.com. ``It was
embarrassing,'' admits Hirschorn.
</P>
<P>
   Whether insiders will pony up for the Inside dirt is anyone's
guess, but people are paying attention. James Ledbetter, New York
bureau chief of The Industry Standard, put it this way: ``Even if
they fail, it's going to be fun to watch.''

HANGING WALLPAPER IS AN ART, NOT A SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing about hanging wllpaper is that it is instant.
</P>
<P>
   Once up, it is there for all to see and enjoy; there is nothing
you have to touch up, paint, stain, varnish, or do.
</P>
<P>
   It is the be-all and end-all of decorating, and really can be
kind of fun. It is not science. But don't let anyone tell you it is
not an art.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll have to do a few things before getting to the
fun part. For instance: remove the old paper, wash off all the old
paste, and prepare the wall. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shop alone &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first fun part of the project is picking out the paper. This
is best done alone. Picking a pattern and color by committee or
with a spouse is not worth the aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of papers _ and coverings _ is huge. Most
manufacturers are calling their product wallcoverings, because many
are not paper at all.
</P>
<P>
   There are patterns and colors for every taste and every foible.
Designs are whimsical, funny, colorful, elegant but never serious,
sober but never dour, cartoony, thematic. You name it, there is a
covering out there to fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the borders, in just as great a variety as the
coverings themselves. Not to mention matching fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Wall coverings are expensive, so it's a good idea to do one
room, not trying to redo the entire house in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   How much to buy: Determine the area of the wall to be covered
and divide by 32, which is the number of square feet in a single
roll. For instance, suppose a wall is 8 feet high by 10 feet long,
multiply 8 by 10 to get 80 square feet. If there are four such
walls in your room, multiply the 80 by 4 to get 320. Divide by 32
to get the 10 rolls that you need. Add two rolls for waste and good
measure. When measuring, ignore windows and doors in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Coverings are sold in double and triple rolls, but don't worry
about buying too much; it is better to buy too much than too
little, because you can return unused rolls. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The tough part: stripping &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now for the tough part: removing the old paper. If the old paper
is sticking properly, you may not have to remove it. You can
usually apply one layer over one layer; there is no rule of thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers are strippable; that is, you can grab a corner and
pull it off dry. Wall-Tex coverings and other non-paper coverings
can come off this way.
</P>
<P>
   But many papers need to be stripped by steaming or wetting. You
can rent a steamer that will make short, neat work of removal. Or,
use hot water with a stripping additive. Put down tarps to protect
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, here's the rub: Most modern coverings are vinyl-coated and
impervious to water or steam. So they must be scored, to allow the
steam or water to penetrate to the paste. One way to score paper is
to scrape the wall with a hand saw, making many marks, one for
tooth in the saw. Stores sell scoring tools.
</P>
<P>
   If the wallpaper is painted, you also have to score the paint
film to allow the steam or water to penetrate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pray for plaster &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before starting, hope that the wall under the old paper is
old-fashioned plaster, or a plaster skimcoat. Coverings will come
off easily from these finishes. But it is almost impossible to take
the paper off plasterboard or drywall if it has not been painted,
without creating many gouges and torn drywall paper. If that
happens, the only thing to do is fill them with joint compound and
sand smooth. Then paint the walls, to avoid future disasters.
</P>
<P>
   There are many tools out there for stripping paper. Usually a
wide putty knife will suffice, but in stubborn cases, and where you
need more precision, a razor-blade scraper will work best.
</P>
<P>
   After removing the paper, wash walls to remove excess paste. If
the paste is vinyl, it will be hard to remove, so you must make a
detergent solution and wash vigorously. Scraping the softened paste
with a wide putty knife hastens removal.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can get to the fun part. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A battery of tools &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You need a battery of tools: tape rule, scissors, utility knife
with spare blades, long straight edge, long spirit level, pasting
table, marking pencil, and a smoothing brush. If you are using a
paste, you need a paste bucket and a pasting brush.
</P>
<P>
   What about pre-pasted coverings? In the early days of pre-pasted
papers, they were not very reliable, and old-time paper hangers
used paste anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the papers have come a long way in 40 years, and pre-pasted
papers are quite reliable, needing only wetting to activate the
paste. A wetting tray usually accompanies pre-pasted paper, or you
can buy your own.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're ready.
</P>
<P>
   But first, be sure to size the walls with a glue size. It's a
glue, applied to the walls to make the new paper more easily
adjusted, make it stick better, and make it easier to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Always hang paper vertically. In houses, ceilings and floors are
seldom level, so do not line up the paper with either, nor with a
corner, which is unlikely to be plumb (vertical). Intead, line it
up vertically to itself. To do this properly, the first strip must
be vertical. Then, all others will be.
</P>
<P>
   Start hanging paper in a corner, one behind a door, because when
you go around the room and come to that corner with the paper, it
won't match. But it won't show.
</P>
<P>
   To hang the paper vertically, measure the width of the strip;
say it is 24 inches wide. Measure 23 1/2 inches from a corner and
make a mark on the wall at ceiling level. Make a vertical mark from
that mark to the floor. Use a spirit level to make sure the mark is
true.
</P>
<P>
   This technique allows the paper to turn the corner by half an
inch; any more and you will get wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Cut strips of paper a few inches longer than the height of the
wall. Wet the prepasted strip according to instructions. If the
paper is not prepasted, use the paste recommended by the maker.
</P>
<P>
   Lay the strip face-down on the pasting table, and paste the
bottom half or two-thirds. Then fold the bottom half over on
itself, and bring the top half or so onto the table for final
pasting.
</P>
<P>
   Any flat surface will make a good pasting table.
</P>
<P>
   When you hang the paper, apply the top securely, smoothing off
in the right position, then unfold the bottom and apply that. Trim
top and bottom with a utility knife. When the knife tears the paper
instead of cutting it, change blades.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth off the paper with the wide smoothing brush, working out
bubbles. If the bubbles persist, pull up the paper where necessary,
but not the entire strip, and start smoothing all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe the strip with a wet sponge to remove any paste that got on
the face of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Keep hanging strips, and be sure to line up the pattern. Hang
strips until you come to a window. Then, apply a strip, letting it
overlap the window frame, and cut it roughly around the window,
leaving plenty of fudge paper. Then you can tuck the paper against
the window casing, and cut it to fit. Do the same along the top and
bottom of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Do the opposite as you approach the other side of the window. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Turning the corner &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you come to a corner, you will discover a narrow space,
narrower than the width of the strip. So, cut the strip vertically
as wide as the space plus half an inch. Hang the strip. Save the
piece you cut off; it will match the part that turned the corner.
Make sure that this strip is vertical; check it with the spirit
level.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, there is always one more thing. Paper manufacturers also
make borders, for use as cornices and crown molding at the top of
the walls, and sometimes as a chair rail.
</P>
<P>
   Use 'em or not.
</P>
<P>
   When you finish with the last piece, there is nothing else to do
but clean up and enjoy your magnificent job.

CHRYSLER'S PT CRUISER LOOKS LIKE A HOT ROD, BUT ISN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a startled bellow that emanated from deep in the
recycling shed at my local landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, will ya look at that!'' cried Alice, major domo of
all we recycle or discard in my little town.
</P>
<P>
   I have driven Jaguars and Porsches and Mercedes Benzes to the
landfill, cars that approached six figures in cost. Alice never
looked up. That was until I rolled in with the Chrysler PT Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Alice was not alone in her attraction to the hot little car
because there is no defined demographic slice drawn to the Cruiser.
It draws admirers the way a magnet draws iron filings, pulls them
across generations, from spirited automotive enthusiasts and those
who rarely glance at cars except as things of utility.
</P>
<P>
   It's a retro rig, reminiscent of the 1930s and '40s _ ``An Al
Capone car,'' Alice called it, though I look at it and see 1930s
Chrysler Airflow: upright windshield, high roof, high doors,
bulging fenders. The PT Cruiser _ minivan, truck, car depending on
your own point of view _ is a rounded departure from a trend,
breaking away from the boxy minivans that have become so uncool the
way the Airflow streamed away from the rectangular cars that were
so prevalent before its appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If the New Beetle was, well, the new Beetle, then the PT Cruiser
is the new minivan.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a minivan feel when you sit inside. High seats (and a
remarkable driver's seat that goes straight up and down for better
view), a nose that slopes away so you feel you are looking down at
the road, and a cavernous feel inside a cabin that is as
utilitarian as you will find. Chrysler claims it has 26
configurations and I couldn't find them all, but know this: The
rear seats split 65/35; you can fold them down; you can take them
out; the rear window ledge drops when the seats are folded down to
form a flat cargo area; the front passenger seat folds down and you
can carry 8-foot two-by-fours, a ladder, or skis in the space.
</P>
<P>
   It's got storage bins where most cars don't even have places.
Pockets and nets and sliding drawers throughout. It's almost as if,
inside, you are sitting in an appliance rather than an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   All this, while maintaining a retro feel with oval inserts in
the dash that match the exterior color, a tall, white-knobbed stick
shift in the standard, black-on-white gauges, and sturdy pillars
rising to a high ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Most switches are at center dash, even the switches for the
front windows (odd, I thought). Switches for the rear windows are
on the back of the center console (odder, I thought, and
inconvenient for the driver who has to reach back for them).
</P>
<P>
   There is ample leg- and headroom and the rear seat is a
veritable couch. The front buckets could use a bit more length
under the thigh, but they were firm and well sculpted and held well
on the sides in corners. Not, of course, that you'll be rolling
your PT Cruiser at high speeds on twisting roads. It's not made for
that. It's a cruiser with a small ``c'' in the performance sense.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a 2.4-liter, DOHC, four-cylinder engine that used about
21 miles per gallon in 10 days of testing. It's no rocket off the
line, and though it looks like a hot rod, it's not. What it is is a
front-wheel-drive transporter that felt remarkably like Volkwagen's
New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   As tall as it sits, it cornered quite well, with limited sense
of body roll. Fully loaded (two adults, three children), its engine
was not challenged on steep hills and it held its own in speedy
commuter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumbles that Chrysler will be offering a turbocharged
version of the Cruiser and that added touch could make this a
superb little car. As it is, I can just picture the aftermarket
aficionados lined up to take a crack at the fine base Chrysler has
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension in the PT Cruiser is independent up front with
struts, coil springs, and antiroll bar. The rear (avoiding struts
that would intrude on interior cargo space) has a rigid axle with
trailing arms, antiroll bar, and coil springs.
</P>
<P>
   At a base price of somewhere under $16,000, it is a fine
purchase, though I'd certainly fork out the extra dough for ABS and
traction control. There is also word that some dealers (will they
never learn?) are gouging on the price despite warnings from
headquarters that they shouldn't be. If you run into gouging, let
me know.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler plans to sell 150,000 PT Cruisers in the first model
year, and should have no problem doing so. Before the first one
ever hit a showroom they had nearly 400,000 inquiries from
prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   What Chrysler is selling here is not a feat of engineering. It's
Neon-based but better than the Neon, though certainly not as hot a
car as it looks. Its performance is just OK, and I cannot imagine
it with the automatic transmission. The long-throw, five-speed
standard is just the tranny for this rig and I suspect an automatic
would plod when coupled with this engine and the ton-and-a-half the
Cruiser weighs.
</P>
<P>
   No, what is being offered is an image, a feel, a sense of the
past with a great whiff of today's technology and dependability
tossed in.
</P>
<P>
   It may look hot, but this is about coolly cruising the open
road, windows down, radio blasting, a highway happening that
crosses generations. It is about rolling into a burger joint on a
hot summer evening, sticking a surfboard over folded-down seats and
heading for the beach, or cruising dark stretches of road until you
find that all-night diner.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a rig that can haul all you need for your college
dorm room, transporting kids and groceries in a
soccer-field-to-supermarket shuttle on a Saturday morning, about
nostalgia that won't break down.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? Go ask Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --The yoke-like door handles, front and rear, that you can grab
with a whole hand. No looking for just the right cranny in which to
slip two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --Nice armrest folds down for the driver. Why no armrest for the
front-seat passenger?

PUTTING UP WITH PEOPLE WE DON'T LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us are compelled, daily or at least occasionally, to be
in the company of people we dislike, even hate. Relatives.
Co-workers. Roommates. Friends of friends. Assorted others. Jon
Hess is the first person to make a study of how we manage to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was amazing that no one has studied this
before,'' Hess said from his office at the University of
Missouri-Columbia, where he is an assistant professor of
communication. ``I searched the entire literature of relational
maintenance, and I couldn't find anything on the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Relational maintenance. It's Hess's area of expertise. Most of
the research in the field, he said, has been on intimacy and
friendship and maintaining good relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about people we don't like?'' he said. ``There are a
certain number of relationships that we have to maintain whether we
like it or not. Getting along with people you like is easy. Getting
along with people you don't like is more difficult. I was surprised
by the amount of stress people said they feel in these
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess surveyed 185 students, ranging in age from 17 to 50, only
one of whom claimed she couldn't think of anybody in her life she
didn't like. He compiled more than 30 ``distancing behaviors,''
which his subjects said they practice to maintain relationships
with people they dislike. He calls them ``distancing behaviors''
rather than ``techniques'' or ``tricks'' because he didn't want to
address the question of whether the behaviors were intentional or
instinctual. He may pursue that subject in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at some of Hess's results, it occurred to me that he
could have reached many of the same conclusions by watching Regis
and Kathie Lee for a week or two. But I suppose that wouldn't have
passed academic muster at the journal Human Communication Research,
in which his paper, ``Nonvoluntary Relationships With Disliked
Partners,'' will be published this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of the most frequently mentioned ways his
subjects avoid interacting with those they don't like:
</P>
<P>
   --Engaging in an activity while with the disliked person.
</P>
<P>
   --Interacting with the person only in a group.
</P>
<P>
   --Lying about personal matters to avoid intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   --Avoiding asking or answering personal questions.
</P>
<P>
   --Humoring or tolerating the person.
</P>
<P>
   --Speeding up interactions.
</P>
<P>
   --Ignoring the person.
</P>
<P>
   --Avoiding joking and light conversation.
</P>
<P>
   --``Zoning out,'' i.e., not paying attention to the person.
</P>
<P>
   Hess denied that his interest in this subject has anything to do
with his own relationships. Was he telling me a lie to avoid
questions about his personal life? He doesn't know me well enough
to hate me. But if he did know me, could I deduce from his response
that he didn't like me?
</P>
<P>
   ``That gets tricky,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Insecure people might be supersensitive to what they erroneously
perceive as subtle signals that they're not liked, whereas someone
who's genuinely disliked might be the sort of person who's
impervious to even the most obvious clues.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said there are many reasons people might distance
themselves that don't indicate they dislike you. They could be
tired or not feeling well. They could be shy or preoccupied. Or
they might be maintaining a professional distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's being distant, you can't be sure they don't like
you,'' Hess said. ``But it could well be a clue.''

&HT;     A FOND FAREWELL FOR CHILDHOOD AND `90210' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRISTI L. GUSTAFSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For 10 seasons, they've looked good, bed-hopped
and driven expensive foreign cars. They've dated, graduated, been
hired and fired, survived shootings, diseases and family strife.
</P>
<P>
   They're the gang on ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' and I've spent
nearly half of my 22 years watching them. But that all ended when
``90210'' made its long goodbye Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The series became a ritual for me from the first episode. I sat
on the edge of my best friend's waterbed _ right there in Averill
Park, N.Y. 12018 _ in anticipation of what she predicted would be a
``hunk-filled'' show after seeing the first advertisement. Because
of its title, I thought it was a police sitcom (where's Eddie
Murphy?), but humored her and watched the show's premiere.
</P>
<P>
   This was anything but an hour of boys in blue. Instead, these
kids were everything my 12-year-old self wished I could be when I
grew up. They were, in a word, glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   My friend and I were perfectly situated in the show's
demographic. The characters, four years older than we were, made
the challenges and traumas of our still-distant high school years
seem as enjoyable as a cruise down Rodeo Drive in Mondale, the
classic Mustang owned by Brandon (Jason Priestley).
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, their friendships remained intact despite
lying, cheating, betrayal and worse. They dealt with issues I never
had to face in my rural high school: racism, condom distribution,
violence, where to get the BMW fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty)? The at-times
resident villain who left ``90210'' after the fourth season is
still committing evil: She failed to return for a guest appearance.
She was replaced by Valerie (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen) and shortly
after, Gina (Vanessa Marcil), but neither stirred things up and
created as much controversy as Brandon's twin.
</P>
<P>
   ``90210'' has had many brag-worthy special appearances. Hilary
Swank appeared in one story arc, long before she forgot to thank
her husband after winning the Oscar. The long list of guest stars
included Burt Reynolds, Matthew Perry, Barry Bonds, Dom DeLuise and
Vivica Fox, while musical performers such as the Rolling Stones,
Christina Aguilera, the Goo Goo Dolls and, yes, Debbie Gibson also
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday nights became sacred. I would take the phone off the
hook _ not that my friends would dare call _ and when I got a
part-time job I made sure the schedule never interfered with my
midweek view into the lives of the West Beverly High students. I
couldn't risk taping the show, unless I watched it before school.
Everyone, from my peers to the teachers, would be talking about
what they had seen the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Before I go any further, I'd like to make a few things clear: I
know the acting on ``90210'' wasn't top-notch. OK, at times it was
flat-out bad. I figured out early on that these characters' lives
were more unrealistic than Michael Jackson's.
</P>
<P>
   But I still became a loyal fan and follower from that first
season, the days when Brandon and Dylan's (Luke Perry) sideburns
were as coveted as a chance in the hot seat on ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   What was it that kept us glued to the set for all these years,
following the lives of a bunch of rich and often stuck-up kids
living in an endless summer without bad hair days, acne or peer
pressure? You could say it was a show about hair. And you could be
right.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more. Maybe it was wish-fulfillment: the sun and
the warmth, the beautiful bodies and faces, the fashion, the nice
cars and prosperous parents, the comfort and cool of the Peach Pit
After Dark _ the club that's somehow able to snag top performers
like Collective Soul and the Barenaked Ladies. For an hour each
week, it could all happen.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite paradise. There were two cancer scares, several
rapes, drug and alcohol abuse, among many other things. Still,
these traumas were usually solved within an episode or two, and few
things _ no matter how tragic _ were mentioned again (unless it was
an anthology episode).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the one problem the gang can't get around:
growing up. Finally, the tan, buff California kids are facing the
real world. They're almost all paired off, responsible or
career-minded (Dylan excepted). Boooooorring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beverly Hills 90210'' has come to its end. Its heroes and
heroines have reached a point in their lives where there are very
few fresh shocks left. After near-death experiences, pregnancies
and miscarriages, car crashes, AIDS scares, infidelity and enough
one-night stands to fill 10 sleazy motels, there's nothing left but
the rigors of early middle age. Do we really want to see these
characters start to go bald?
</P>
<P>
   We already have. We don't want to go there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I watched, needing answers, closure. I wanted to feel as
if I'd have a chance to bid a proper farewell to my former role
models. But my VCR might get hold of the final episode before I do.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I'm not in high school anymore. I've graduated from
college, too _ where the campus didn't begin to buzz until after 9
p.m. on Wednesdays. I do not want to be these people when I grow
up.
</P>
<P>
   I am grown up, and it's time to say goodbye to my childhood.

<P>
   James Levine's idea of a great gift for mothers is simple:
involved fathers. As director of the Fatherhood Project at the
Families and Work Institute in New York, Levine, 54, has spent more
than a quarter-century trying to persuade men to assume more active
roles as parents. Levine, a graduate of the Harvard Graduate School
of Education, returned recently to give a talk on the subject at
the Harvard Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What advice about paternity leave would you give British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose wife, Cherie, is pregnant with
their fourth child?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Levine laughs.) Politically, I'd tell him that it would be
very smart for him to take some time off because it will only breed
good will. As a husband, he'd better do it unless he wants a
festering argument with his wife. And as a father, I would say that
no man who has ever taken time off at the birth of a child, that
I've interviewed, has regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   From what I understand of the Blair case, there's this sense
that the government can't function without him, that he's
indispensable. If an organization is well-run, nobody should be
indispensable. But unfortunately, the prevailing view is that men
have to be heroes, that the team can't function without one man.
The Michael Jordan mentality. It may be true of the Chicago Bulls,
but it's probably not true of the British government, or most
companies, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Surveys show that most men don't take advantage of paternity
leave or part-time schedules. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. For fear they will in some way be penalized. I'm sure there
are cases where that is true. But in my book (``Working Fathers:
New Strategies for Balancing Work and Family''), I give an example
of a guy at Lotus who took a leave when his baby was born and was
promoted on his return.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen any data showing men who took time off were put
on a ``daddy track'' and penalized. But the fear is widespread and
it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Men are afraid they won't be
moved up if they do it, so they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you and your wife deal with work/family issues when
your children were young?
</P>
<P>
   A. My daughter is 29 now and my son is 24. When we got married,
my wife and I agreed we would share child care, and we had the
advantage of having work that was flexible. We were both at
Wellesley (College) when the children were very young. And when we
moved to New York, there were periods when she did more and periods
when I did more. When she went back to graduate school, to get a
doctorate in psychology, I was doing more.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, we've gone through the experience of having my
wife's parents becoming ill and dying. I actually had more
flexibility in my work than she did, so during the week, I would go
out to Long Island and help care for them. The idea was that we
both were going to take care of them. As baby boomers move into the
sandwich generation, elder care is going to be an even bigger
challenge than child care for companies to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a number of surveys, both men and women say they don't
have enough time to spend with their children. What's the solution
from your point of view?
</P>
<P>
   A. We find that working parents universally feel guilty that
they're not spending enough time with their kids. But when you ask
the children, as Ellen Galinksy (Levine's colleague at the Families
and Work Institute) did in a recent national survey of children
ages 11 to 18, most say their parents are spending enough time with
them.
</P>
<P>
   The real deficit I see is that working parents are not spending
enough time with one another. It's like traveling on an airplane
with small children; in the case of an emergency, you should put
the oxygen mask on yourself first. The same is true for frazzled
working parents. You can't take care of your kids unless you take
care of your relationship. I find that men and women are giving
lots of attention to their workplace and children, but not to each
other. And that becomes a huge source of stress. If you stop paying
attention to one another, then little disagreements turn into big
fights and that spills over onto the kids.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest sources of tension for parents with young
children is around bedtime. Bedtimes often stretch out till 10 p.m.
and by that time, parents are absolutely frazzled and don't have
time for each other. One solution is to set a firm limit on
bedtimes and say to your kids, ``Mommy and I need some time for
ourselves. So you have to go to bed now.'' One of the things that
makes kids feel best is to know that Mommy and Daddy really are
together.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your work, you've found that men are reluctant to talk
openly about these issues. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is one of the perennial riddles of life. It's like,
``Why are men the way they are?'' I think we are just socialized to
get up in the morning, put our pants on, go to work, and don't
complain about it. The result is that a lot of guys are carrying
around this work-family conflict, which I call the invisible
dilemma. They all have it, but they don't talk about it. So when we
do these Daddy Stress/Daddy Success seminars at companies around
the country, one of the greatest benefits for these men is hearing
other guys talk about it and realizing they're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   There really is a huge interest and appetite among men to
discuss these issues, but they're not going to show up unless you
specifically target them. At Texas Instruments, where I did a
seminar a few years ago, they sent out a message on their e-mail
and within a few hours, they had 75 to 80 men sign up and they had
to close it off because there was no more room. At Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, we had over 200 men, and they held it in an auditorium. At
these seminars, we do a little work/family stress test and it's
amazing how high the level of stress that men report. It's
comparable to what women feel.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I advise management that, just because men aren't
telling you they have these issues, doesn't mean they don't. They
do. Everyone has to take some responsibility here, at the corporate
level and at the spousal level. Men shouldn't assume that taking
time off will hurt them, and women have to challenge their husbands
to ask for the time off. We have to break the silence around this
issue.

<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ The Senate is expected to vote
Thursday on a July 2001 deadline for withdrawing American ground
troops from Kosovo. The legislation is an $8.6 billion military
construction measure, which also carries $4.7 billion for U.S.
operations in Kosovo, anti-drug efforts in Colombia and other
defense programs that have been labeled emergency spending. By Eric
Schmitt.

<P>
   NH-DEATH-PENALTY (Concord, N.J.) _ The New Hampshire Senate on
Thursday is expected to pass legislation, already approved by the
House, to abolish the death penalty. While the governor is expected
to veto the measure, and nobody is on death row in the state, the
move is part of a growing national reconsideration of the fairness
of capital punishment. No state has abolished the death penalty
since the Supreme Court permitted its reinstatement in 1976. By
John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in `f' news category)
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-TYCOONS-INTERNET (Hong Kong) _ From Taiwan to Thailand,
some of Asia's most powerful families have started a blizzard of
online ventures. Whether their core businesses are in property,
telecommunications or banking, Asia's tycoons are seizing on the
Internet in hopes of expanding their reach and making even more
money. At the same time, however, the Internet is transforming the
way business is done in East Asia. With its emphasis on speed,
openness, and collaboration, the Internet is challenging
traditional Asian values of prudence, financial opacity, and family
control. Decisions, which used to be made by the patriarch behind a
veil of secrecy, are being pushed down the ranks as Asian companies
embrace Silicon Valley-style management. So despite their
chameleon-like adaptability, Asia's tycoons may have trouble making
the leap into cyberspace, critics say. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPINES-TECH-TALENT (Manila) _ The Philippines may be the
place that gave birth to the ``I love you'' virus that shut down
hundreds of thousands of computers around the world. But it is also
where one of the first patches to prevent the virus was developed.
Indeed, the whole episode has swung spotlight on the country's
swelling pool of high-tech talent. European and American employers
are increasingly seeking out computer savvy Filipinos. And there is
now a surprisingly lively Internet start-up scene in a country
where the average annual income is a little more than $1,000 and
where fewer than 1 percent use the Internet. By Wayne Arnold.

Justice Department's review of Worldcom's proposed $115 billion
acquisition of Sprint. By Stephen Labaton.

   3M-SCOTCHGARD (Chicago) _ Followup on 3M's announcement that it
will stop making and selling most Scotchgard products because of
research that shows that a chemical ingredient lingers for years in
the environment and the human body. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   BOO-BANKRUPT (London) _ The decline and fall of Boo.com, an
online fashion sportswear retailer that opened for business just
six months ago. The collapse of Boo.com, the first major failure of
a European Web retailer, came after the company failed to secure a
further $30 million from its investors, which included J.P. Morgan,
Benetton and Bernard Arnault. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-EUROPE (Undated) _ European Union antitrust investigators
raid Coca-Cola Enterprises in London and at its Belgian unit as
part of an investigation into possible abuses of dominant position
in its distribution practices. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in `e' news category or as indicated)
</P>
<P>
   GUGGENHEIM-1900 (New York) _ The Guggenheim's ``1900: Art at the
Crossroads'' is a wacky exercise in historical simulation, the
excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so
many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you
consider eBay a place. But the show no doubt will be as popular in
New York as it was in London. There is no underestimating the
public's taste for kitsch. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE-IMMERSION (Undated) _ Five years ago, at a stationery
store on the Left Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished
in my pants pocket for some francs and walked toward the counter, a
smile of fear frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out
this sentence to the old woman at the counter: ``Je voudrais
acheter le magasin, s'il vous plait.'' The common word for magazine
is magazine (mah-gah-ZEEN), not magasin (mah-gah-ZAA). I had asked
to buy the shop. And so it went. For 10 days in Paris I was a
helpless prisoner of my past: four years of undistinguished high
school French and one semester at college. I could make my way
through a French newspaper, but conversation was out of the
question. Until now. No longer the 98-pound-weakling of
bilingualism, I have persuaded myself that it is possible to
function confidently, perhaps even thrive, in another culture. I am
a graduate of language immersion. By Stephanie Strom.

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Simon once sang, ``These are the days of miracle and
wonder,'' and though in the auto industry it is engineering rather
than miracle that gives us our wonder, there is still room for
wonderment to emerge on its own in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   And in that vein, I wonder:
</P>
<P>
   --Why Saab, as it produces such fine cars and continues to give
them grace and horsepower, has yet to come out with an
all-wheel-drive vehicle. Volvo's gone there. Audi's gone there.
Porsche has harnessed its 911 Turbo with AWD. Everybody seems to be
going there, and as manufacturers manage to squeeze ever more
horsepower from high-revving, smaller engines, front-wheel-drive
cars, Saab's selling point in days gone by, can't handle the power
without torque steer. AWD is the way to go and Saab ought to be
going there with select models.
</P>
<P>
   --Why it works with consumers when manufacturers attach designer
or outdoor outfitter names to special models. We had the Eddie
Bauer Ford Explorer. Chevrolet's new Avalanche pickup truck/SUV has
a North Face model. And Subaru has just unveiled an L.L. Bean
Outback _ big jump from hunting boots to cars but they've done it.
If Volkswagen manages to produce a new version of the Microbus _ as
it is attempting to do _ can a Peter Max model be far behind? And
will some school bus manufacturer give us the Ken Kesey edition?
</P>
<P>
   --How Pat and Mary Brooks, both in their mid-50s, are doing as
they attempt to drive a 1949 Buick Super ``Woody'' Wagon ``Around
the World in 80 Days.'' The Iowa couple are in a fleet of 40
vintage vehicles that left London earler this week in what is being
called the first motor rally to circumnavigate the globe. They're
all due back in London on July 18. Where do you find Buick parts in
Rangoon?
</P>
<P>
   --Why everybody _ save Jaguar, thank the Lord _ seems to have an
SUV, or several SUVs, in the works. Even Porsche, apparently afraid
consumers will add a competitor's SUV to their garage as a second
car instead of a second Porsche, will build an SUV. I just don't
see it.
</P>
<P>
   --How car companies come up with the names of the colors in
which they'll bathe their cars. Volkswagen brings that to mind this
week with two new colors for the New Beetle: Vapor and Reflex.
Vapor is a variation of blue, and I guess I can see that. But
Reflex is a tint of yellow. VW is calling the new colors so cutting
edge that you will be able to order Beetles in these colors only
over the Internet. Vapor. Reflex. How long before we get an SUV
coated in Imposing, or an overpowered sports car called Skittish? I
saw a diaper-yellow Toyota MR2 Spyder recently that I'd definitely
call Recoil.
</P>
<P>
   --How many of the popular Chrysler PT Cruisers survive intact
and how many get the aftermarket treatment. Already, an aftermarket
outfit called Performance West has come out with a ``PT Bruizer''
that adds racing seats, mesh grille, and a supercharger attached to
the original engine that boosts it from 150 to 210 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   --If Ford will ever get its act together on the Mustang Cobra,
ballyhooed and long awaited, but plagued by engine problems. Word
is, it will manage to produce around 300 SVT Cobra Rs _ billed as a
$55,000 match for the Porsche Boxster S and the ultimate Pony Car.
Not everyone is going to want to spend $55,000 on a Mustang, so
let's hope Ford gets its act together on the lesser model of the
Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   --And not to pick on Saab, but I still wonder why it never
produced the 900 Turbo 16 EV-1, which back in the mid-80s looked
like a cross between a Sonnett and a Datsun Z. It was a 2+2 with
nearly 170 horsepower _ and with added horsepower and AWD, would
look good even today as sports coupes abound.

LEARNING, AT LAST, HOW TO LET LOVE IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My brother made plans to spend some time with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take the dogs for a walk on the beach and get a chance
to talk without other people around,'' Ken said. Since he did this
without any prompting from me, I was flattered in an uneasy sort of
way. In the past, we've been so busy judging each other that we've
tended to avoid one-on-one conversations, but we're moving into a
new stage of our relationship now, and even I could see this was an
important step.
</P>
<P>
   Ken showed up on a Saturday afternoon, and as we stood in my
driveway, my neighbor David came out of his house with his dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to walk the dogs. Want to come?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda,'' my brother whispered from behind me, ``what are you
doing? I wanted us to be together without anyone else there.''
</P>
<P>
   I apologized. I was able to cancel the invitation, but not to
keep from hurting Ken's feelings. I couldn't believe my own
perversity.
</P>
<P>
   I'd shrug my impulse off as a simple act of friendliness if I
didn't know that my mind has this habit of trying to avoid
responsibility. In some recess of my psyche, I had to know what I
was doing, which was pushing Ken away and dampening his enthusiasm
for a more intimate relationship. I'd dashed cold water on his
overture, but why?
</P>
<P>
   Some part of it is habit, I think. We get used to the particular
distance we maintain from others and resigned to the grip of the
familiar. The relationship may not be as pleasurable, alive, or
satisfying as it might be, but it's predictable in its frustration
or aggravation or sadness. There's a certain comfort in the
thought: Nothing will ever change . . . and so I don't have to
change either. This eliminates the chance of bumping up against
some new shortcoming, having to reexamine past judgments, or,
worse, having to admit you've been unfair in the past.
</P>
<P>
   I also felt a certain indignation: Who did my brother think he
was, changing rules in midstream? I felt a certain unease: What was
he looking for? I felt a certain fear: What if he were
disappointed? As the story unfolded, I've come across two other
questions that took me by surprise. Could I respond? Am I capable
of loving Ken back?
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened next. My brother attended our family
Passover Seder two weeks later. A few of us were in the kitchen
cleaning up, and Ken said to my husband, ``I love my sister.'' I
stopped and turned, dishcloth in hand. ``I love your sister, too,''
my husband said. Immediately my heart began pounding and my mouth
went dry. It would have been no big deal if they'd said they
appreciated my cooking or had thanked me for directing our Passover
play, but this wasn't gratitude, an emotion I'm comfortable with.
They were saying they loved me.
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath. I deliberately tried to allow all that
love in. After all these years of being a wife and mother, you'd
think I'd be an old hand at this, but being the target of approval
and affection makes me uncomfortable. Intellectually I was pleased.
I knew in my head that Jack and Ken meant what they'd said, but
emotionally I hit a wall I seem to have built to keep love out. I
think I'm good at giving love, at saying the words and performing
the acts that demonstrate the depth of my caring, but when I'm the
object of love, there's a flatness where joy ought to live, a
``does not compute'' sign right where I ought to be turning
cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   I dismiss the love others so generously give me. As soon as it
gets inside, I negate it.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable, I suppose. I was told I was loved as a
child, but what I felt was anxious and unprotected and unsafe. I
never responded with a flood of soothing emotion, or a feeling of
total relaxation, or a warmth in my bones and blood and brain. I'm
also a carbon copy of both my parents, who fiercely refused to
accept love themselves. Is that reversible? Can you learn to feel
loved as an adult? Is the ability to receive love like a dormant
seed that can withstand any drought until rain finally falls, or
has some window of opportunity closed forever in my soul?
</P>
<P>
   I have a pretty good idea of my shortcomings and my strengths,
but I suspect my entries in both categories are irrelevant when it
comes to how satisfying or frustrating it feels to be in a
relationship with me. There's a paradox in my life, an insight that
makes it imperative that I break this pattern: If you polled the
people who care about me most, you would probably find that my
least lovable trait is how stubbornly I resist their loving me.

AT KERR HALL, FRESHMEN SAY NO TO ALCOHOL, DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hip-hop briefly blares from a room the size of a
spacious walk-in closet. A couple stands whispering intimately on
the stairwell between the fifth and sixth floors. A pair of female
friends giggle as they take turns talking on a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   This is about as exciting as it gets one weekday evening at Kerr
Hall, a Northeastern University dormitory filled with 120 freshmen
who have signed a ``lifestyles agreement'' pledging not to use
tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. If they do, they're out.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking state laws and campus policies against alcohol, drugs,
and noise may be the unwritten rule at other residence halls, but
not at Kerr, where sounds, as well as substances, fall under
scrutiny. Quiet time here begins at 11:30 p.m. on weeknights and
1:30 a.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go over to the other dorms at night and it's louder,'' says
Kerr resident Lea Swink, 18. ``People run through the hallways.
There's banging. There's loud music. The floor is shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Swink, who saw high school friends almost lose their lives to
drugs, is one of an increasing number of students nationally
seeking haven in substance-free dormitories. They're young people,
like Swink, who have witnessed the destruction of drugs and
alcohol. They're athletes seeking a healthy environment and
students who have tired of the excesses found in other dorms.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr Hall, which is also known as the Wellness Hall, opened in
1990 in a small housing complex with 69 students. The dorm soon
moved to larger building. By last fall, it was housing its full
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago only a smattering of universities across the
country offered such living quarters. By last year, 62 percent of
the schools responding to the Harvard School of Public Health
College Alcohol Study said they offered alcohol- and drug-free
housing.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike in the past, students choosing to live in places
like this are no longer met with taunts of ``loser,'' according to
Kerr Hall residents and university officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear the nerd thing or the geek thing,'' says Jeannie
Lawton, a residence director who oversees Kerr Hall and other
residences at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of their peers and they're doing this and it's OK
they're choosing it,'' she says. ``There've been no incidents that
I know of in the last three years where someone has said, `I've
been beaten or I've been verbally abused' because of their choice
to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Swink's roommate Megan Peterson puts it this way: ``It's not
like high school where they make fun of you. It's your choice,
whatever you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sommer, 19, transferred to Kerr Hall, the only dorm on
campus that doesn't allow smoking, because he couldn't endure
living with a roommate who smoked. Meaghen Shaw, 19, is on the
track team and wants to stay away from any substance that will
compromise her physical performance.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's roommate, Sarah Dobson, 19, has a more sobering reason
for staying clean. She saw the devastating effects of drinking at
the age of 7 when her older brother battled alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Melanie Grandy, a 20-year-old transfer student from
Colby College, have simply experienced the hedonism of living in
liberal housing and have had enough. Colby's environment was so
permissive, Grandy recalls, that students were having keg parties
in the basement of her dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got really boring after a while,'' she says, then asks
rhetorically: ``Is there anything else we can do at school?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, say residents of Kerr Hall. Grandy spends her free time
visiting the Museum of Fine Arts, wandering along Newbury Street
and going to dinner parties. ``Filling up Friday and Saturday
nights is not a problem,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The dorm holds programs on eating disorders, stress relief,
campus housing options, and relationships. There are outings to
baseball, hockey, and basketball games. There's even a trip being
planned to New York.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Kerr Hall residents also go to clubs and attend
parties. What happens if someone offers a drink?
</P>
<P>
   Swink says she simply answers, `` `No, I'm not drinking
tonight.' And they never really question it. They never push me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even from the cocoon of Kerr Hall, Swink has seen the groups of
drunken students who wobble home from parties, grabbing onto each
other to keep from falling. She knows students who eagerly search
for people over 21 to buy them liquor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they have this freedom,'' she says. ``It's all a game.
It's like, `Look what I did.'' And their Mom and Dad are not around
to say, `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Kerr Hall may not experience as much vandalism or noise as
other residence halls, it's not without its minute dramas. The loud
hip-hop music coming from one open-doored room gets knocked down a
few decibels as soon as Michelle Baker, 21, a fourth-year student
working as a resident assistant, casts a disapproving glance at the
offender during her evening rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Baker points out portions of the 6th floor walls scarred by a
student's punches. She also checks the garbage cans on each floor
for beer bottles. Because of Northeastern's housing crunch, some
residents didn't chose to live in a substance-free dorm. A few
subsequently moved out when other housing became available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some obviously do'' drink, says Baker, ``but they're usually
smarter about it than the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, is not smart enough. This school year, about
five people were transferred from Kerr Hall to less restrictive
dorms because they had violated the ``lifestyles agreement.''

SPRING, SPORTS _ STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Little League season in full swing, Day Thomson finds
herself increasingly anxious at her son's games. ``He feels kids
are mad at him if he messes up. He's starting not to want to go and
to have what I think are mythical stomachaches,'' she says. ``My
heart bleeds for him.''
</P>
<P>
   That his team is 0-3 so far doesn't help. Unlike his younger
sister, who cheerfully says of her losing soccer team ``We
stink!,'' and then talks about how much fun it is to play with her
friends, Thomson's son is losing enthusiasm for the team and the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20 million children in the United States play
organized sports. That's terrific: ``Children learn life lessons
from sports,'' says child psychologist and researcher Shari Young
Kuckenbecker. ``They become socially skilled from teamwork and
cooperation, and they develop habits that will keep them healthy
and fit as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not so terrific is that 30 to 40 percent of them drop out
each year, never to return to sports at all, says sport
psychologist and professor Ron Smith of the University of
Washington. Of those who start an organized sport before they are
6, 70 percent drop out by 13, says Fred Engh, president of the
National Alliance for Youth Sports, an advocacy organization for
safe and fun sports.
</P>
<P>
   Concern that youth sport programs are inappropriate and turning
kids off has fueled a spate of books, the most recent of which is
Kuckenbecker's ``Raising Winners'' (Random House). It's also
fueling a nationwide examination of youth sports:
</P>
<P>
   In southern Maine, middle schools recently voted to eliminate
all end-of-the year tournaments. The National Middle School
Association is also eyeing a no-tournament policy and discussing
restructuring middle-school sport programs so children of all
ability levels can participate. At the American Youth Soccer
Organization, a recent recommendation to coaches urges short-sided
play, so that teams are smaller (three players per team for 5- and
6-year-olds, five players for 7- and 8-year-olds, seven for 9- and
10-year-olds) and thus offer more learning opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reordering the priorities
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who runs a program that's trained 20,000 coaches in
developmental approaches, predicts nothing short of a sea change.
``There's an increased awareness that what kids need
developmentally from sports isn't what they are getting,'' he says.
He is coauthor of ``Way to Go, Coach!'' (Warde).
</P>
<P>
   The problems begin early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four- to 7-year-olds join a team because they like the
activity but mostly they want to be with friends. Sports is social
for them,'' says Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Parents tend to have a different agenda, typically hoping early
team participation guarantees an edge, if not stardom and a
scholarship, down the road, he says. That leads to a competitive
atmosphere, sometimes as early as third grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you have tournaments, championships, and traveling
teams, it's inappropriate pressure and not as much fun for kids,''
says Connecticut sport psychologist Shane Murphy. He is the author
of ``The Cheers and the Tears'' (Jossey Bass).
</P>
<P>
   What he prefers to see in soccer or baseball, for instance, is
what he calls progressive play, where children are on the same team
for a year or two but rotate from one coach to another to work on
specific skills. There might be minigames to hone skills but no
playoffs or tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pressure points
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are several kinds of pressure kids feel:
</P>
<P>
   --Social. Even a team's weakest player who gets little playing
time will enjoy a team as long as it's fun to be with the coach and
teammates, says educator Ed Brazee of the University of Maine, a
specialist in middle-school sport education. ``Kids are happy just
to be in the mix,'' he says. But if star players are allowed to
dominate and weaker ones feel left out not just of the game but
also of the socializing, it stops being fun. It's also no longer
developmentally appropriate for any of them, even the stars. ``It's
one of the reasons it's so important for coaches to work to create
respect for each kid and team spirit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   --Physical. A child of any ability level continues to have fun
as long as she is learning new skills and seeing improvements. ``It
doesn't matter if she's a nonstar as long as she has a sense of
accomplishment,'' says Kuckenbecker. What tends to happen, however,
is that less-talented kids don't get appropriate help with skills
and lose a sense of personal accomplishment while talented kids are
pushed beyond their developmental levels. In one study of 1,100 6-
to 8-year-olds, Engh says, 49 percent were unable to perform
minimum skills of catching, throwing, or kicking. In other words,
he says, ``half the kids don't have the skills they need to play
the game we design for them.'' Engh is the author of ``Why Johnny
Hates Sports'' (Avery, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   --Parental. Six- to 9-year-olds typically don't pay attention to
how much time they're on the bench or what the score is. Parents
do. When we complain about lack of playing time, unfair coaching,
or poor playing by another child, we color our child's ability to
go back to that team as a full team player, says Kuckenbecker.
Murphy says star players feel an additional pressure: ``Even if
you're very supportive, when you get up at 5 a.m. and drive 45
minutes for a traveling team, a child can't help but conclude,
`This is very important to Dad.' Because all kids want to please
their parents, that translates to, `Am I good enough for Dad?' ''
That worry can eventually overwhelm their emotional coping skills.
</P>
<P>
   When children feel these pressures, they get bored or unhappy
and want to quit. That's not necessarily bad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Variety of experiences
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's developmentally in the best interest of a child under 10
to experience a variety of sports,'' says Murphy. The more sports a
child plays, the more diverse are his social experiences and
physical opportunities. It also makes him better able to know what
he really likes and where his skills lie.
</P>
<P>
   Engh sees no reason a child under 10 shouldn't drop a sport,
even mid season. ``If he's unhappy, let's say because the game
feels dangerous, it's a kind of emotional abuse. What's the
point?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Kuckenbecker agrees it's OK to move from sport to sport, but not
mid-season. The best life lessons can get learned when the going
gets tough, she says. Ask enough questions to figure out what is
making him so unhappy: ``Tell me about the coach''; ``Tell me about
the kids.'' Then help him learn from it: ``I know you like to be
the best. You're best in lots of things and you're good at this. No
one can be best at everything, but you can still learn a lot. I
admire someone who does that.''
</P>
<P>
   At any age, a child will have bad games. Getting into the car
with her after one of them can be tough: Depending on how invested
we are, we have our own feelings to deal with, not to mention her
mood, which can be ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get into a play-by-play of the game,'' says Murphy.
``When a kid blows it, she knows it. Going over it only makes her
feel worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Take your cues from listening and watching her. Kuckenbecker
shares a strategy she used with her three daughters: ``Sometimes
the best thing to do is put your arm around her and say nothing.''
Later, give her a chance to vent: ``I can see you're upset. Tell me
about it.'' Validate her judgment _ ``OK, you blew it, you passed
to your opponent'' _ and empathize: ``I know how lousy you feel.''
The more skilled a player, the more likely she is to be unhappy
because she knows what she should have done.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big picture
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kuckenbecker tells parents to focus on the big picture, not on
the specifics: ``I really liked the effort you made in the first
quarter,'' or, ``You looked really strong when you made that play
at first.'' A favorite message of Murphy's is ``All kids make
errors/all teams lose. The difference between a good player/team
and a bad one is learning from mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most kids move on quickly from error and loss. When frustration
spills over into other activities, ``help them distinguish between
emotion and behavior,'' says Murphy. ``Just because he has negative
feelings from the game doesn't give him the right to torment his
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do good feelings entitle him to act like a brat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing worse than a kid who scores the winning goal
and thinks he's so cool, he hands his sports bag to Mom to carry.
And then Mom carries it! That's what really gets me!'' says
Kuckenbecker. ``These kid are not royalty,'' she reminds parents.
``Our obligation is to support the kid who feels low and temper the
one who's feeling too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Day Thomson's son, meanwhile, is starting to feel differently
about the season. In one recent game, he made a great play. The
team still lost, but it didn't seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
NURTURING GOOD SPORTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --De-emphasize winning by asking, ``Did you have fun?'' If she
offers the score, fine; if not, don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   --Remind the star who's gloating at his three-point winning
shot, ``You made that shot and it was great, but don't forget the
whole team played a great game just to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   --Be gently honest with the nonstar who complains that he spends
too much time on the bench: ``Some of these kids have already gone
through puberty, they're bigger and stronger.'' Or: ``You haven't
played for as many years. You're still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   --Before a game, remind her of previous successes. Research
shows that being in a positive mood helps the brain connect with
peak motor performances, which makes a person play better.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't ignore it if your child throws equipment, uses bad
language, etc. Tell him: ``I know you may have some feelings
welling up inside you, but that's not acceptable behavior. You need
to find some other way to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   --By middle-school ages, specializing in a sport can lead to an
imbalance and oversaturation. If she plays soccer from September to
June and wants to play in the summer, that's fine, but stay away
from a camp where soccer is what they do all day.
</P>
<P>
   --Help a nonstar feel good about himself by finding something
he's doing better today than he did two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   --It's up to a coach, not a parent, to tell a child what he did
wrong in a game or a play.

STAIN, DON'T VARNISH, OAK THRESHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How can I treat the new oak threshold on my front entry? Can
I varnish it?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD GATELY, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Do not varnish it. If you do, it will look great for a few
months, then will likely fade and peel, requiring regular
maintenance. Instead, paint on a semitransparent stain. It comes in
earth colors, so pick a color, apply one coat, and forget about it
for three years. Then, if it shows wear, clean it and apply another
coat. Just one coat is needed each time, and there's no peeling.
The stain will dry overnight.
</P>
<P>
   While semitransparent stain is designed for exterior house
walls, it can be used for thresholds and outside decks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My condo is in an old school, in a street-level basement with
no part underground. I am getting a lot of moisture; the rug feels
damp, and rust spots are appearing, from metal chairs on the rug.
How can I dry things out?
</P>
<P>
   PAT ERVIN, Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The key is to dehumidify. In summer, or at least in April,
May, June, September, and October, ventilate the condo by leaving
windows open (and secured) to allow water vapor buildup to
dissipate. That vapor comes from breathing, cooking, and washing,
but also from ground moisture rising through the concrete floor
until it meets the cool rug and condenses into water. The rug is
not at fault; it allows water vapor to go through it, which is
good; if it were a vapor barrier, it would trap moisture under it,
making things worse. In July and August, when it is humid all over
the Northern Hemisphere, venting will not do much good; that is
when you use a dehumidifier. The situation should not be as bad in
winter, with the heat on.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rust spots, you can get those out with a product
called Whink, sold in hardware stores and supermarkets. Then put
rubber cups or other nonrusting protection on the chair legs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My basement shower drain backs up just a few times each year,
but without warning. The toilet and sink are not sluggish. There is
no backup anyplace else in the multilevel house. The backup is
enough to cover the bathroom floor, and the water, which is really
sewage, gets under the marble threshold and soaks the rug outside
the bathroom. The plumbing goes to a sewer line in front of the
house. A plumber took a look and could not figure it out. Can you?
You're my last chance. The drain is buried under the concrete slab.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way to prevent the water from getting out of the
bathroom? It is only 1/4-inch deep and does not go over the marble
threshold, but under it. I am getting tired of cleaning and
disinfecting the rug whenever this occurs. I never hear any
gurgling when the drain drains. It never occurs when someone uses
that shower.
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATE, in Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a guess, but I think it is due to the design of the
drain: I think the shower drain is going into the main drain at
right angles to the main or nearly so, not gradually as it should.
Then, when water from other drains (not the shower) flows past this
shower drain, some of it backs up. This could happen when large
amounts of water are going down the main drain, as from a
dishwasher or washing machine that pumps the water out. It also
could happen when water running down the shower drain collides with
water flowing in the main.
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, a fix is difficult because the drain should be
dug out of the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you might be able to keep the water in the bathroom
during a backup by sealing the marble threshold. To do so, lift it
and apply an adhesive caulk, near the edges of the threshold so
that it oozes out when you press the threshold back in place. This
assures a tight seal. It is a jury rig, but may help until you fix
the backup.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Last month, on ``The Tonight Show,'' host Jay Leno
asked guest Rosie O'Donnell about her start in comedy. O'Donnell
told the story of how she she lied to the manager of a Boston
comedy club in the early 1980s, and told him she was a headliner
from New York. The manager was glad because their scheduled star
was so drunk he couldn't perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was that?'' asked Leno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy B,'' O'Donnell replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' said Leno, ``Teddy B.''
</P>
<P>
   Teddy B is Teddy Bergeron and they both knew Teddy's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long and complicated,'' says the Wellesley-born Bergeron,
who has alternated appearances in comedy clubs with trips to
alcohol rehab for the better part of two decades. ``But I think I'm
finally on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with dates at Nick's Comedy Stop together with sets in New
York at Stand Up New York, the Comedy Cellar, and Dangerfield's,
Bergeron, who once glimpsed stardom, is mounting another comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever said there are no second acts in American life was
wrong. Bergeron has made it through a hellish second act. And he's
in the middle of the third. Many of his friends, in and out of show
business, hope it is a comedy, not a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Through several interviews with Bergeron and many of his friends
and colleagues, a portrait emerges of a comedian nearly done in by
depression, alcohol, and, some say, success.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't begin that way. On Sept. 13, 1983, a bright and
youthful Bergeron made his debut appearance on ``The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson.'' Bergeron took to the TV stage as if he
were born to it. His timing was impeccable, his delivery assured,
his material timeless. When Carson invited him to the couch to sit
with Liberace, it seemed as if the Boston comic's future was as
bright as could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't red hot, he was white hot,'' says performer Bruce
Smirnoff, who has known Bergeron since they both started out in
comedy in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, after refusing to return calls from the three
major networks, all of which wanted to sign him up, and snubbing
the William Morris Agency and a hive of other talent
representatives, Bergeron dragged himself into the Improv in
Hollywood. Network executives had staked out the club, waiting to
put in their bids. But when Bergeron showed up, hardly anyone
recognized him. He was drunk, disheveled, and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe it was the same guy,'' says Smirnoff.
``Forty-eight hours after being one of the hottest talents to debut
on `The Tonight Show' he was worse than a pariah.''
</P>
<P>
   Life on the road _ the only life a stand-up comic knows _ is
filled with isolation and loneliness, and every night there are the
sound and smell of alcohol. It was tough for Bergeron.
</P>
<P>
   He racked up so many DUIs that he says he can't drive in any
state in the union. Once, after he showed up intoxicated in a Texas
club, the owner had him jailed for fraud. Within minutes, dressed
in orange prison garb and cardboard slippers, he had his fellow
inmates in hysterics. The guards, sensing there might be trouble,
pulled out their billy clubs and moved on Bergeron. Within seconds,
he had them laughing uproariously. They let him out.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, police arrested him again. Public drunkenness.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the 1990s, Bergeron (no relation to former
Boston TV host Tom) spent more time in recovery than he did on
stage. At various times he lived on his mother's couch, at the
Homeless Veterans Shelter in Government Center, the Pine Street
Inn, and on Revere Beach. He begged for money. He wandered through
bars in Boston downing other people's unattended drinks. Bergeron
even knew the alcohol content of various mouthwashes and cough
syrup. It got so bad that a Los Angeles acquaintance recalls a time
when Bergeron poured high-octane gas through a loaf of bread to get
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed he couldn't take success,'' says Smirnoff. ``That
was the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an enemy that Bergeron is ready to take on again _ and
this time he thinks he has the weapons to win.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at Nick's Comedy Stop, Bergeron gave an appreciative
audience a glimpse of his talents. From his patented parody of the
Roman gladiator movies (a character from ``Spartacus'' goes to a
singles bar) to jokes about alcoholism that cut close to his own
story, the 47-year-old veteran seemed as vigorous and fresh as if
he were just starting out. As with most great comedians, most of
the comedy comes in the telling, not just the tale. His skit about
a tone-deaf pitchman for a book promising instant piano and
songwriting skills remains as absurdly funny today as it did on the
Carson show.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the side, he had placed an inconspicuous tape recorder
that he uses to record each performance. While the audience howled
their appreciation, Bergeron wasn't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give it a C-plus,'' he says. ``I don't like a stage that
high. It puts you above the audience and I'm not really comfortable
with that. I like to interact with the audience.'' On his way home
that night (he recently rented an apartment in Quincy), he listened
to the tape _ carefully dissecting the timing, the response,
perhaps finding a word here or there or a rhythm that would punch
everything up a notch or two _ searching for any tiny detail that
would help him to get back on top.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, at the Pilsudski Polish American Club in
Southbridge, Bergeron is on the dance floor. The audience surrounds
him on three sides and he is on their level. The way he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   Later, over coffee, Bergeron tentatively takes a few
uncomfortable steps into the past. He is as nervous as he is before
a performance. His eyes stare off to the side and he's a bit jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tossed out of four high schools,'' he says. ``There was
never anything in the schools for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year stint in the Army, where Bergeron put on shows
at Fort Dix, N.J., during the latter stages of the Vietnam War, he
entered Bunker Hill Community College, where he performed and
produced a mock version of ``The Tonight Show'' in 1974. ``We had
400-500 people at those shows,'' he says. ``They were good.''
</P>
<P>
   After several days with Bergeron, one thing is clear. When he
has a microphone in his hand, he is transformed _ and it is amazing
to see. Even though he is a veteran performer with more than 20
years in the business, he is as nervous as a novice before a show.
Whether performing at Dangerfield's on New York's East Side or at a
Little League benefit in Central Massachusetts, he gets jittery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always like this,'' he says. ``Always.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to the promising comic? Why has life been so
difficult?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the environment that fed Bergeron began drying
up. During the 1980s comedy boom, it seemed that every Chinese
restaurant had a small stage and ``gong shows,'' contests that held
out a bit of prize money for contestants who didn't get gonged by
the audience. A comic could make a couple of hundred bucks a week.
But the early '90s hit comedy hard. Clubs closed up and those that
stayed open cut their rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy never fit into real life,'' says his friend and fellow
entertainer Dave Andrews. ``He was the black sheep of the family.
There was pressure on Teddy from the beginning. For a long time
Teddy was depressed and angry. He hated everyone. I just hope he
stays the course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think alcoholism is a disease,'' says Bergeron, who
has tried everything from group therapy and Alcoholics Anonymous to
the Seventh-day Adventists. ``The disease I had was depression. It
was terrible and it went away with a few drinks and a performance.
If I wasn't depressed, the alcohol never would have gotten to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time in my life everything was in a big fog,'' he
says, between sips of coffee. ``I was chasing rainbows. It was all
blurry.''
</P>
<P>
   While some friends and club owners got fed up with Bergeron's
irresponsible actions _ borrowing money and not repaying it and
showing up drunk for comedy dates _ others didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Clarke, Lenny's brother, was one of the ones who was
always good to me,'' says Bergeron. ``I could always count on him.
And the guys at Nick's helped me. And now, Kelly and Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Larry are Kelly Jones and Larry Lee Lewis. Jones, who
fell in love with Bergeron a couple of years ago in Maine, and
Lewis, a good-natured entertainer and former stripper's agent who
cut a deal to produce Bergeron's work and provide financial
assistance, are the comic's biggest fans. They form a support group
that Bergeron never had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the guy,'' says Jones. ``He's been through a lot, but
we've been working together. When he's not drinking, he's the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he's the funniest guy I've ever seen,'' says
Lewis. ``I know he's going to make it and we'll all profit from it.
He's just too good not to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, at New York's Comedy Cellar, Jerry Seinfeld,
who was in to do a set, stayed late to see Bergeron. After the
show, just before Seinfeld hopped into his double-parked Porsche,
he told Bergeron that he loved his act. A few nights earlier, Robin
Williams saw Bergeron at Stand Up New York and said pretty much the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Bergeron appreciates the response, he knows that a
few kind words won't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to keep working,'' he says. ``I'm working.
Making money. It means everything to me. It is what I am.''

<P>
   Say the word ``rhododendron'' and many people think of a
blob-like evergreen with pink June flower trusses that's overlarge
and overplanted. Sadly, rhododendrons have suffered a bad rap
because a limited number of bor-ing old varieties dominate the
suburban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   So what's so great about rhodies?
</P>
<P>
   Low maintenance tops the list. Forget about fertilizing or
deadheading. Water them the first year until they're established.
Then ``you don't have to look at them again unless a tree drops on
them,'' says C.J. Patterson, a member of the Massachusetts Chapter
of the American Rhododendron Society.
</P>
<P>
   But of course you'll want to look at the flowers, which bloom in
shades of blue-lavender, purple, red, orange, or yellow (as well as
pink). Though most tolerate shade, not all are large or evergreen.
And many deciduous types, which are called azaleas, keep blooming
long after June; few other shrubs come in as many colors and sizes,
and with as many bloom times.
</P>
<P>
   Rhododendrons are, in fact, the perfect shrub for older or
overcommitted gardeners who don't want to get on their knees
anymore to weed out and divide perennials, but who want to keep
collecting new plants for the thrill of variety.
</P>
<P>
   A new propagation method called tissue culture is bringing more
varieties of rhododendrons (and other plants) to market sooner.
``It now takes 10 years to get a new cultivar into the trade
instead of 40,'' said Patterson. ``But people still don't realize
what's available.''
</P>
<P>
   The society's plant sale, featuring many new and rare
rhododendrons at very reasonable prices ($8-$35 for small plants),
will help change that. It will be part of an all-day conference May
27 aimed at introducing nonmembers to all aspects of rhododendrons.
The event will include a flower show where blooms of many of the
varieties for sale will be on view, as well as lectures on such
topics as selection, buying, and planting based on local
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Species azaleas, grown from seed from wild plants, are also much
more available than they used to be and are prized for their subtle
delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes more sophistication to appreciate wild azaleas, and
their new popularity shows that American gardeners are learning how
to see,'' says Patterson, whose favorite rhododendron is a wild
Japanese species, R. metternichii var. hondoense, which has
silver-white new leaves with a pink stripe down the middle. ``They
look like bunny ears.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Planting secrets
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trick to success with rhododendrons is to plant them right.
People often plant them too deep, says Dick Brooks, a former
president of the national organization. ``I had a rhododendron I
didn't like, so I tossed it, and it happened to land in my woods
right side up and put down roots. Today it's the happiest
rhododendron in my garden.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a great increase in southern-grown container plants at
home and garden megastores. ``One problem is that they're often
grown in a soilless mix which forms a dry core around the plant
that refuses to absorb water, so the plant dies of thirst. When you
take them out of the pot you have to wash off as much of the
soiless mix around the roots as you can with a jet of water from a
garden hose before you plant them,'' says George Hibben, who has
planted 150 rhododendrons in his garden.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Hibben uses clippers or a knife to butterfly and splay
pot-bound roots like a leg of lamb to get them heading outward.
Such roughing up sounds brutal, but it benefits most plants whose
roots have reached the walls of a container and started circling
around.
</P>
<P>
   Hibben makes a mix of half garden soil and half pine bark
minichips to replace the soilless mix. ``Don't use mulch, use
chips. And don't use peat moss because once it dries out, it
resists rewetting just like the soilless mix.'' He digs a hole
twice the diameter of the container because rhododendrons are
shallow-rooted and spread outward rather than down.
</P>
<P>
   Hibben then builds a cone in the bottom of the hole, using his
bark-chip/soil mix, and fills the hole with water. After the water
sinks in, he sets the rhododendron on the cone so it is raised 1
inch higher than the surrounding garden and spreads the roots out
over the cone.
</P>
<P>
   Hibben finishes by filling in the hole with more bark-chip/soil
mix, watering again, and then mulching around the plant with a
2-inch layer of pure bark chips. He's always careful to leave a
couple of unmulched inches around the shrub's trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greer's Guidebook to Available Rhododendron Species and
Hybrids'' is a good beginner's guide to the rhody universe. It's
available at the Society book sale for $20 or from Greer Gardens,
1280 Goodpasture Island Road, Eugene, OR 97401-1794; telephone
541-686-8266.

STATE STREET, ABOVE THE CLOUDS, HAS INVESTORS SMILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a tough time for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have lost their luster. The Federal Reserve is
raising interest rates, all but guaranteeing the economy will slow
down. So where do you go to find companies that will perform well
in a difficult environment?
</P>
<P>
   For many investors, the answer seems to be State Street Corp.
Its stock is up more than 50 percent this year, and this week it
hit an all-time high of $116. The stock closed Wednesday at
$112.4375.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 analysts and money managers gathered at State Street
headquarters in Boston Tuesday to hear the company tell its story.
They liked what they heard. It is the story of a financial services
company that is growing rapidly but has very little exposure to
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the few financial stocks that can boast
accelerating revenues and lessened credit risk,'' said Steven
Wharton, an analyst with Loomis Sayles who attended the
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   State Street long ago stopped being a bank. Over the past 20
years it has morphed into a company that provides a range of
services to pension funds, mutual funds, and other institutional
investors. It is a hard business to understand and explain.
</P>
<P>
   The results are much easier to describe: State Street does well
year after year. The company has reported double-digit growth in
earnings per share for the past 22 years. Itsearnings have risen an
average of 18 percent annually for the past five years and 17
percent over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Does the word ``consistent'' come to mind? A $1,000 investment
in State Street stock in 1985 would be worth $28,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   The stock began running up in March and got another pop in April
when State Street announced its earnings had risen 24 percent in
the first quarter, well above Wall Street estimates. The 24 percent
growth also caught investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've traded in our eight-cylinder car for a 12-cylinder car,
and we're firing on all 12 cylinders,'' chief financial officer
Ronald O'Kelley told reporters the day the earnings were released.
</P>
<P>
   State Street is benefiting from a variety of global trends: the
increase in stock trading, increased stock volatility, the growth
of 401(k) style pension plans, and the never-ending need for faster
and better information.
</P>
<P>
   State Street supplies a big percentage of the mutual fund prices
printed each day in the Globe and other newspapers. The trend
towards daily pricing is spreading globally, and the time needed to
process trades is shrinking. Cranking out all those numbers
requires an enormous investment in computing power. It is an
investment that many firms don't want to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are asking themselves: Where can I go to
avoid investing zillions of dollars in systems?'' said Jean Melo,
chief investment officer at Vaughan Nelson, a Houston
money-management company.
</P>
<P>
   The answer for many is State Street. On Monday, Pacific
Investment Management Co., a large West Coast money manager, agreed
to outsource all its accounting and record-keeping services to
State Street.
</P>
<P>
   State Street has been trying to get Wall Street to think of it
as a technology company, rather than a financial services business.
It has tried, with modest success, to get technology analysts to
cover the company.
</P>
<P>
   One small coup: Wired magazine this month has a glowing piece
about State Street's computer operations. That kind of buzz makes
it easier to hire young techies. More importantly, technology
stocks command much higher price/earnings multiples than financial
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What are the risks for State Street? The biggest would be a
global slowdown in trading or a major global correction in stock
prices. The company figures that for every 10 percent decline in
stock prices, its revenue falls 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, during the biggest corrections in recent years _
the selloffs following the Asian and Russian financial crises _ the
losses from falling prices were more than offset by gains from
increased volatility, O'Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk: State Street stock has had a big run-up. Analysts
say the once-undervalued stock is trading for something like a
reasonable price. ``I would not be surprised to see it take a
breather,'' said Steven Wharton of Loomis Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of those attending Tuesday's session came away
impressed and upbeat about State Street's future. Said Thomas
Goggins, one of the managers of John Hancock's Financial Industries
Fund, ``I didn't hear anything that would prevent them from having
excellent quarters for the rest of this year.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Mainly, it's fun,'' says Angela White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love margaritas!'' adds her roommate, Karen Walicki.
</P>
<P>
   The two Northeastern University sophomores, both 21, are talking
candidly about their drinking. They drink regularly, though, they
say, rarely excessively. It's a way to let go after exams or to
loosen up and meet new people.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they've seen peers out of control at bars or parties. And
yes, they're aware that tragedy, like the 1997 death of MIT
freshman Scott Krueger, can come from college drinking. But tell
them a recent Harvard study's definition of a binge drinker and
they're brought up short. A woman who finishes four or more drinks
in a row at least once in two weeks is a binge drinker, according
to the researchers, as is a man who has five drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of describes what we do,'' says White, flashing a look
of disbelief at her roommate. They belong to the 44 percent of
college students the Harvard School of Public Health survey
identifies as binge drinkers, but the label, White and Walicki say,
just doesn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the person,'' says White, ``and it's about
balance. If you can go out and drink and get your work done and the
drinking isn't a chronic thing where you have to get drunk all the
time, I don't think drinking is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This, then, is their drinking story.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karen Walicki grew up in Middleton, N. Y. ``I didn't drink at
all in high school. I never went to parties. I was a big nerd.''
She began drinking wine during her first year at a community
college, before transferring to Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   White, meanwhile, grew up in Canada outside of Toronto, where
the minimum drinking age is 19. She had her first drink, a beer,
she says, when she was 16 and in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The two met and became friends last year and now share an
off-campus apartment with two other students. Walicki is majoring
in physical therapy. White's major is cardiopulmonary science. They
don't drink much on weekdays, they say. Maybe a beer while watching
television. Or they'll have a drink if they go out to dinner on a
weeknight.
</P>
<P>
   It's toward the end of the week when the imbibing begins. If
flush with money, they'll wander down to clubs on Boylston Street,
such as the Cactus Club. Closer to home, they go to Our House.
``Some of our friends are 19, so we might go to the clubs on
Thursday when our friends can get in too, when it's `18-plus,' ''
says White.
</P>
<P>
   What about fraternity houses?
</P>
<P>
   Both wince. ``I've only been to one frat party in two years
here,'' says Walicki.
</P>
<P>
   ``None,'' says White.
</P>
<P>
   A typical night out might start with a ``warm-up'' drink in the
apartment. It's cheaper to get started that way. Then around 11
o'clock they'll head out in a group. ``There's usually at least
four of us and we don't go with guys, although sometimes we run
into people we know,'' says White. They favor beer and mixed
drinks, like margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   The point? To have fun. ``To go out and meet other people,''
says White, ``like people who live around the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Walicki: ``It's mainly to get out and away from school and
your major. In school, all you talk about is classes and I can't
take it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The booze and bar scene accelerates socializing. It's a fast,
high time that contrasts sharply to the slow motion and more inward
social scene they say they'd find at a coffeehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more likely to talk to you if they've had a couple
of drinks,'' says White.
</P>
<P>
   There are indeed times when they get ``trashed'' or ``wasted.''
Maybe it's right after exams and weeks of studying when, notes
White, ``it's time to break out.'' Maybe it's to celebrate a
birthday or other special occasion. That's when a morning hangover
is the memento of the night before. ``The next day you say, `I'm
never drinking again,' '' says Walicki.
</P>
<P>
   On those nights, says Walicki, the drinking ``gets more
hard-core _ like doing shots.'' The last time that happened was in
April when Walicki took White out to celebrate her 21st birthday.
The evening went like this: The roommates had their first drink at
Friday's with three couples and then, says Walicki, the couples
``pooped out on us.'' (``The last time we go out with couples,''
laughs White.) The women headed over to the Cactus Club for several
rounds of drinks with names like Long Island Iced Tea and Kamikaze
and at least one shot of tequila. It was a night of mixing liquors.
</P>
<P>
   They hooked up ``with some dude,'' says White, but even though
he treated them to a drink they didn't like the way he hovered.
``We were trying to get away from the guy,'' says White. So they
left. Their new companion followed and joined them in a cab. The
women headed over to Punter's, a bar popular with Northeastern
students, and, as they expected, they ran into ``guys we knew and
the guy following us kind of just got scared off.''
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m. the roommates were back at their apartment, staring
mindlessly at the TV and crashing.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, says Walicki, ``needless to say, I didn't feel
well.'' The night, all in all, was fun and a success, even if they
spent part of it eluding a persistent suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Overindulgence is about the only thing they sometimes regret.
``Mainly I might feel sick, but we don't really ever get that out
of control,'' continues Walicki. Over time they seem to have
developed ground rules for ensuring their safety, and neither has
ever had a regrettable sexual liaison stemming from too much booze.
``Usually we make sure if one of us says, `I'm gonna drink
tonight,' another one of us will stick to one or two drinks to
watch out, and make sure it goes okay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at the clubs,'' adds White, ``can be grabby and
aggressive, and we're always looking out for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Walicki nods and offers an example: ``If I see some guy seems to
be bothering her, or putting his hands on her and trying to kiss
her, I'll jump in and get her away. I might start dancing with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other rules: ``If four of us go out together we come
home together,'' says White. ``No one brings any one home.
Basically we don't pick any one up at bars.'' It's not as if they
hashed out these strategies ahead of time. They say it simply
developed this way naturally, a reflection that ``we all kind of
come from the same family types.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just our understanding, to respect each other and
trying to be safe,'' says White.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking, they say, is fun. If it's not chronic and extreme
drinking, what's the big deal? Says Walicki: ``My mom says, Don't
give me a reason not to trust you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' says White. ``My parents know I drink, but they
also know I'm pretty much under control, that my priorities are
right, that school comes first.''

WHY DO SOME UNDERTAKE NOCTURNAL AMBLINGS? EXPERTS ARE IN THE DARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In July 1969, about the same time Neil Armstrong took man's
first steps on the moon, I engaged in an unusual little excursion
myself. I was 11 years old then and at Boy Scout camp. On my first
night in the wild, I woke up barefoot and alone in the middle of
the Minnesota woods, dressed only in my underwear, with not a clue
as to how I got there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really done it this time,'' I said, or something to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rather lonely, unnerving feeling, as you might expect.
Somewhere in those woods was the tent I had abandoned in my sleep.
How long I stumbled around in the darkness before I located another
tent, I don't really remember. A long time, it seemed. I do recall
that a fellow Scout seemed surprised to find me at his tent door,
in the middle of the night, in my underwear, asking to borrow a
flashlight. I doubt anyone has been more happy to feel the inside
of a sleeping bag than I was when my impromptu wilderness hike came
to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only the most perilous of the nocturnal ramblings
of my boyhood. There were several others, maybe dozens, up and down
the stairs at home, for the most part. Once I ended up in a
neighbor's garage. Then there was the night, again in the summer of
1969, again the first night of a summer camp, when I felt a tugging
at my shoulder as I slept in the bottom bunk of a crowded
dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy. Buddy,'' another camper whispered, somewhat
desperately, but trying to avoid waking the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' I replied, groggily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in my bunk,''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in my bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   I pondered this for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I said. ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   I slipped out of his bed and he slipped in. Somewhere, in the
darkened dormitory, there was an empty bunk with my name on it. To
this day, I have no recollection how I might have found it.
</P>
<P>
   The other day at the office, we were swapping sleepwalking
stories. I'm rather proud to say that not one could hold a candle
to mine.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   EYES OPEN, MIND MOSTLY ASLEEP: What could possess a boy to
undertake an unconscious ramble in the north woods? My inquiry
might be a bit tardy _ by 30 years or so _ but having been recently
reminded of that singular adventure, I decided to try to find out.
After several calls to sleepwalking experts across the country, the
answer was this: No one really knows.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say, almost apologetically, that there has been little
research on the topic, that is, the sort of sleepwalking undertaken
by about 15 percent of all children, and 10 percent of all adults.
It's just not that big a deal, they say, hardly worth millions in
medical research dollars that could be spent on more pressing
issues. Most kids who sleepwalk outgrow it, and don't hurt
themselves or others. Most sleepwalking is not linked to other
psychological problems. ``Benign'' is the word most commonly used.
(Tell this to an 11-year-old who wakes up in his underwear in the
middle of the woods.)
</P>
<P>
   So, where the causes of sleepwalking are concerned, we are left
with best guesses. The prevailing theory is that sleepwalking
events most commonly occur during Stage 3 sleep, a phase somewhere
between nodding off and the famous REM (rapid eye movement) phase,
when we dream. In Stage 3, a person is completely out, his mind and
body both pretty much gone. Zonked, I believe, is the clinical
term. The sleepwalker, for some reason, apparently suffers a
partial interruption of this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like you activate mobility, but you don't engage
the mind,'' says Edgar Lucas, a sleep expert in Fort Worth.
``You've awakened the motor system, but the brain stays in a
primitive, deep, nonfunctioning state. We don't have any idea why
that occurs. We do know that you may change from one stage to
another on a normal night, and do that 50 to 75 times.''
</P>
<P>
   The sleepwalker wanders with his eyes open, to the bathroom, for
cookies, to catch reruns of that night's Sportscenter, but has no
recollection of that activity. Sleepwalkers generally do not run
into walls or trip over furniture, ``so apparently the visual
system does have some input,'' Lucas says. ``But the blank stare
that you get says the person is not hearing what you're telling
them. They're operating at a very primitive level.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to sleepwalk is likely genetic, experts also say.
Stress can increase the likelihood of sleepwalking episodes. It was
probably no coincidence that my summer camp wanderings took place
on the first night away from home. Athletes are more prone to
sleepwalk on the night before a big game. Alcohol doesn't help.
Sleep deprivation either.
</P>
<P>
   But again, in almost every case, sleepwalking is no big deal.
Parents are advised to pick up objects that sleepwalking children
could stumble over. A night light or two would help. Gentle coaxing
is generally all that's needed to get a sleepwalker back in the
sack. Experts particularly caution parents against overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want this child to think they've got some kind of
morbid psychological problem,'' Lucas says. ``Assure them that they
will outgrow it. Treat it as a normal variation that can occur in
some kids.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   FOR SOME, A NIGHTMARE: As long as we're on the topic, there's
another sleep disturbance worth mentioning, one that resembles
sleepwalking but isn't. It is called REM sleep disorder, a
potentially dangerous malady in which sleepers can act out dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that during REM sleep, our brains are more active
than during wakefulness. It is then that dreaming occurs.
Fortunately, every muscle except those used in breathing are
briefly paralyzed during the REM state. That paralysis often
produces the terrible dream sensations of being unable to run from
an attacker, or sinking in quicksand. But the benefits of REM
paralysis far outweigh the fright.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few individuals who, for some reason, fail to
paralyze the body when they go into a dream episode, or only
partially do so, and when those individuals go into dreams they can
act it out,'' Lucas says.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Lucas recalls, dreamed of running down a hillside
and attempting to leap a hedge. He landed on his dresser and
knocked out his front teeth. Another saw snakes in a dream, and
hurt a foot kicking a wall. A third dreamed of steer-wrestling, and
his wife became the steer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a hammerlock on his wife and threw her down,'' Lucas
said of the patient, who was strongly encouraged by his spouse to
seek medical help. ``The thing is, most often this happens to older
men who are fairly docile and good-natured _ the last guys you'd
suspect would do something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The condition is treatable with medication, Lucas says, a muscle
inhibitor that helps keep the rodeo out of the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   JUST WALK ON BY: I am grateful for this information. For years I
wondered if my strange, zombielike adventures as a child
foreshadowed Norman Bates-like behavior later on. But no. A normal
variation in childhood, I'm now told.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I would have been glad to have this reassuring knowledge
that night in the woods, or in the dormitory, or that late night
around the same boyhood time when my next-door neighbor heard
something in her garage. Upon investigating, she found me rummaging
around, again in my underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Tim,'' she said, quite kindly. ``What are you doing
here?''
</P>
<P>
   At the time I had no good answer. Now I do. Today I could say,
``A partial interruption of Stage 3 sleep. But don't worry. It's
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would have explained everything.

&HT;     BIG LABOR'S ANTI-CHINESE BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ In a matter of days, Congress will vote on
whether China should have permanent normal trade relations with the
United States. My first thought is about the history behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There are strange bedfellows on both sides. In favor of China
getting what was once called ``most favored nation'' trade status:
the Democratic president, his vice president (also a presidential
candidate) and some Democratic representatives; a majority of
Republicans in Congress; leaders of business and agricultural
interests; and the probable Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side: organized labor, environmentalists, human
rights activists, many congressional Democrats, anti-Communist
conservatives and hate-mongering Reform Party presidential hopeful
Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   It is the opposition of organized labor that evokes the
historical lesson for me.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back about 125 years right here in San Francisco. ``The
Chinese of America,'' a book by Jack Chen, is my guide.
</P>
<P>
   A depression was on hand, following the euphoric and expansive
economy of the 1860s. Included was completion in 1869 of the
transcontinental railroad, which Chinese laborers helped build.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the new railroad brought to California from the East
Coast thousands of white Americans seeking work. Throw into the mix
thousands of Chinese workers whose jobs _ building the railroad _
were eliminated. Unemployed and frustrated, white workers and their
newly formed ``anti-coolie'' organizations (the United Brothers of
California, the Anti-Chinese Union of San Francisco and the
California Workingmen's Party) went looking for a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Gompers, the legendary president of the American
Federation of Labor, wrote in his pamphlet ``Some Reasons for
Chinese Exclusion'': ``. . . racial differences between American
whites and Asiatics would never be overcome. The superior whites
had to exclude the inferior Asiatics, by law, or if necessary by
force of arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Denis Kearney, founder of the Workingmen's Party, ``pledged to
fight against corrupt government, capitalists and monopolists, but
mostly he attacked the Chinese immigrants for working for
starvation wages and robbing Americans workers of jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Kearney who invoked in San Francisco's torchlight rallies
the famous lines ``The Chinese must go!'' And ``They are stealing
our jobs!''
</P>
<P>
   That battle cry symbolized the anti-Chinese political campaign
that spread from San Francisco all the way to Washington, D.C.,
culminating in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to May 2000. The Chinese Exclusion Act has long
been repealed. Chinese-Americans have become an integral part of
America. Some are members of labor unions that may or may not
oppose the China-trade bill. The successors to Gompers no longer
scapegoat ethnic Chinese workers in this country.
</P>
<P>
   How they feel about Chinese laborers in China is another matter.
American labor leaders are in high dudgeon over Chinese laborers in
China who they feel will steal jobs from American workers if
Congress grants China ``permanent normal trade relations.''
</P>
<P>
   American labor leaders don't trust the captains of American
industry they feel will export jobs to China and other less
developed countries. That is not altogether fanciful paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization has meant, among other things, capital chasing
cheap labor _ wherever it is. But globalization has also embraced
market economic principles. Even the leaders of communist China use
capitalistic methods to uplift the country's historically
impoverished millions.
</P>
<P>
   While seeking to protect American jobs, American labor leaders
are missing a salient point. If China gets permanent normal trade
relations status, American companies will benefit because China's
huge market will be more open than it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   That means more export business for American companies, which
means continuing work for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ethnic Chinese people in this country and in China
are better off than we were in the late 19th century, I am chilled
by the faint echo of anti-Chinese scapegoating embedded in the
politics of contemporary American labor leaders.

`DINOSAUR' ROCKS: DIGITAL WIZARDRY WILL AMAZE YOUNG AND OLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Walt Disney Pictures decided to venture into the uncharted
waters of feature-length computer animation, it stuck out a
tentative toe by approaching the brightest minds already in the
field. This led to a brilliant collaboration with director John
Lasseter and Pixar Animation that produced both ``Toy Story''
movies and ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House of Mouse is never truly content unless all
production can be done within the comforting shadow of its
omnipresent ears, so Disney took the next step and created its own
digital studio.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Dinosaur,'' opening Friday, and it's one of the
most visually stunning breakthroughs in computer animation since
the medium first reared its clunky, complicated, cubist head.
</P>
<P>
   Combining computer-generated characters with live-action
backgrounds and enhancing the mix with special-effects wizardry,
``Dinosaur'' has a breath-taking scope and vision all its own,
almost a perfect marriage of fact and fantasy. For devotees of
digital animation _ still very much in its infancy _ the
improvements on display here in texture, musculature and facial
articulation are staggering. But to the film's inevitable audience
of wide-eyed, slack-jawed young viewers, the leathery, lumbering
characters are simply awesome.
</P>
<P>
   The story, as if this thing really needs one, centers on a young
iguanodon called Aladar. With Disney's inimitable knack for
unforgettably stirring ``Once upon a time ...'' beginnings (see
``The Lion King'' or ``Tarzan''), the tale begins with a pteranodon
snatching Aladar from his herd while the dino is still in his egg
and _ after staggering aerial views and a sweeping score _
eventually depositing him in the back yard of a group of
inquisitive lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   Far from his own kind, the lonely young reptile (given voice by
D.B. Sweeney) is raised as part of a family of monkeys, which
includes the motherly Plio (Alfre Woodard), the grandfatherly Yar
(Ossie Davis) and the equally lonely, unattractive hairball of a
monkey, Zini (Max Casella).
</P>
<P>
   The happy clan is driven from their island paradise by an
onslaught of fiery meteors in a sequence spectacular enough to
rival the explosive climax of six Jerry Bruckheimer actioners
combined. While the gang explores the desolate regions of a distant
shore, Aladar finally encounters his own kind in a massive herd of
migrating creatures in search of a Utopian nesting ground.
</P>
<P>
   He wastes no time in befriending the herd's weaker misfits, a
Mrs. Potts-type character called Baylene (Joan Plowright), the last
of the mammoth brachiosaur species, and an aging styrachosaur named
Eema (Della Reese). Aladar stern rejection of the herd's ``survival
of the fittest'' credo catches the attention of an attractive
female iguanodon named Neera (Julianna Margulies) but also puts him
at odds with her brother, Kron (Samuel E. Wright), the cold-hearted
taskmaster leading the migration.
</P>
<P>
   But Aladar and company have concerns bigger than Kron. With no
water in sight, marauding raptors waiting to attack and a pair of
blood-thirsty carnotaurs in pursuit, the little group discovers
that if they are to pull through, they'll have to do it together.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who caught the soaring opening sequence in theaters _ it
was distributed as a teaser trailer _ might be caught off guard
when the creatures of ``Dinosaur'' actually start talking. It's a
crucial moment in the film, and after the captivating but entirely
mute introduction to the story, it's a bit jarring. But even Disney
would be hard-pressed to pull off a feature done entirely in
pantomime. It's a credit to the talents of the vocal performers
that the characters shine through so well, all without sacrificing
the dignity or believability of the creatures speaking.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this isn't a nature documentary, despite its slavish
attention to detail. It's a Disney film, which means audiences
should be able to suspend disbelief long enough forgive the movie
its more fantastical moments. Sure, real dinosaurs probably didn't
have the ability to problem-solve or form interspecies support
groups or _ with brains the size of walnuts _ ``talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But realism is a relative term, so put away your persnickety
paleontologic complaints and sit back and enjoy ``Dinosaur'' for
what it is: an amazing entertainment.

 &HT;    Jerusalem's Arab market _ get your bargains here!
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ From inside his shop in the ancient walled Old City
at the crossroads of the world, Sammy Zatar spits salted watermelon
seeds to the floor and watches the full spectrum of humanity stroll
by.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning until late at night, the parade never
stops. In the space of a half-hour last month he watched a bearded
and bowlegged Arab dwarf push a wheelbarrow full of butchered sheep
heads past two Eastern Orthodox nuns dressed head to toe in black
and white.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, three 6-foot-something blonde Scandinavian women
almost tripped over a group of short, dark, barrel-chested
Colombian pilgrims kneeling on the floor, intently studying sets of
bongo drums. Four teenage Israeli soldiers with black machine guns
slung across their backs squeezed past two Yeshiva students dressed
in the black and white clothes their ancestors began wearing in
16th-century Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Zatar, 42, moustached and bemused, watched it all with an
expression that seems perpetually on the cusp of a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He has been here since he was 12 years old, when he dropped out
of school to help his father in this store. Store may not be the
right word; it's a shop, really, a glorified stall abutting
hundreds just like it. The walls are so close together a tall man
can touch both sides with his arms outstretched _ if, that is, he
can find any empty wall space. Drums, jewelry, dresses, menorahs,
bowls, cups, candles, Turkish coffee pots, sabers and stuffed
animals hang off hooks from the ceiling. Some are stacked
precariously on shelves. The walls are almost hidden.
</P>
<P>
   As is the tension. Certainly it's here. Passing through this
beehive of a market made of scores of crooked and twisted alleys
running for hundreds of yards are pedestrians who believe some of
the people they are shopping next to should be resettled _ or even
eradicated. More than 200 Israeli security cameras installed for
the Pope's visit in March tape every move of shoppers and
shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If a Holy War erupts, chances are good it will start here, in
Jerusalem, and the heart of Jerusalem is the Old City, and the
heart of the Old City is the Arab market. In the heart of the
market is where Zatar spits his watermelon seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Within half a mile of where he stands, churches, mosques and
synagogues mark the places where traditions say Jesus rose from the
dead, the Prophet Mohammed arrived on his flying horse Buraq from
Mecca and ascended to heaven, and God spoke to the Jewish patriarch
Abraham. Crusades have been waged and blitzkriegs launched to prove
these stories true.
</P>
<P>
   Within blocks of Zatar's shop, world history has lurched in
dozens of directions, sometimes at knife point, sometimes elevated
by mystical ideas delivered by prophets. A bronze plaque on the
cobblestones proclaims in English, Hebrew and Arabic that the
stones of the alley were laid by the Romans in the third century
but the market itself likely predates Christianity. Indeed, the
durability of the market is proof that while religions come and go,
armies win and lose and dynasties rise and fall, shopping and
haggling remain eternal.
</P>
<P>
   And eternally challenging. To sell anything in this little
laboratory of humanity a salesman first has to understand his
customers. A dozen languages are spoken at every turn. Asked the
tools of his trade, Zatar pointed to his head. He speaks not just
his native Arabic, but Hebrew, English, Spanish, French, German
and, though he doesn't include it on his litany of languages, a
little Afrikaans.
</P>
<P>
   How much is a little? Enough to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: She's blond and attractive and walking down the
slightly sloped bustling alley when she hesitates, just a bit, to
look more closely at a necklace hanging on a dusty black velvet
display at the edge of Zatar's shop.
</P>
<P>
   Though she could easily be Scandinavian or German or Dutch or
American, Zatar calls out in Afrikaans and the woman looks up and
smiles. Bingo. He says something else and she laughs. Zatar is over
to her side in an instant, taking her by the arm and insisting she
enter his shop, share his coffee, talk about that beautiful
one-of-a-kind necklace he has now placed in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, after she's paid $18 _ down from an asking
price of $50 _ she is asked what her new friend said to make her
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hello, my name is Dennis and I play tennis and I
think you are the most beautiful woman in the world,' '' she says,
smiling. ``What could I do? How many times does someone say that to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in the Arab market, if you're a woman, the odds are
pretty good you'll hear something like it at least once. Here,
salesmanship is practiced the old-fashioned way, with drama,
conversation and more drama. Necessity dictates shop owners sell
the sizzle, not the steak. Almost anything Zatar sells, a stall 50
feet away offers as well, and maybe cheaper. To make a sale is to
make a friend, and to do that, Zatar tries to figure out what
nationality people are, what language they speak and what he can
say that will make them laugh _ or at least acknowledge him _
before they have passed the 10-foot-wide entrance to his shop and
moved into the next guy's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Zatar is a master. Sometimes he is blunt: ``Poland, Poland!
Poland! He yells to a group of Slavic-looking tourists. ``Russia,''
one yells back. ``Ah! Russia Russia, Russia'' he yells in response,
undaunted, trying to get them to look back. Nope. Too late.
</P>
<P>
   Other times he is suave: ``I love the woman from Espana!'' he
coos in Spanish to a dark-haired woman he is guessing is Spanish.
Oops, Italian. ``She should be Spanish,'' Zatar mutters.
</P>
<P>
   The dance of a sale here is sometimes delicate and sometimes
rude but always theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are making me poor!'' he cries to one German tourist who
refuses to pay $40 for a curved, foot-long dagger. ``I have a
family to feed,'' he pleads with Japanese teenage boy to whom he
sells a plastic bongo drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, come to my house for dinner tonight,'' he begs his
South African friend.
</P>
<P>
   How many dinner invitations has he offered in his 30 years in
the souk (Arabic for market)? ``A thousand a day, but to her I
meant it the most,'' Zatar says. ``She is my favorite.'' None has
ever come home with him, though he insists his wife and six
children would love the company.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you bargain with a man like Zatar? ``Cheerfully,'' he
says. ``And then be a good guy, pay me what I want.'' Indeed,
Americans often do. Americans _ who typically have their
nationality written all over them in brand-name shoes, pants and
shirts _ usually have little or no experience haggling and are
among the worst bargainers in the market. Germans run a close
second. Jews from the former Soviet Union _ and Israel is flooded
with them _ are among the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Jacobson is proof. Jacobson lives in Pittsburgh but
grew up in Azerbaijan. She is looking for a dress to bring back
home, something unusual, she says. Her mother, Rachel, waits
patiently outside the shop _ it's too small to wait inside _ while
Jacobson tries on dresses. As a doctor in Baku, Rachel Jacobson
earned $180 a month and learned to make it stretch. She passed her
savvy on to her daughter, along with her philosophy on haggling:
``Life is not to work and get nothing.'' If her daughter has a hard
time bringing Zatar down to a reasonable price, Rachel Jacobson
says she will lend a hand.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no need. The long, purple, handmade velvet dress
that Zatar originally asked $50 for is finally purchased _ after 30
minutes of courtship _ for $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's good,'' Zatar says as Jacobson and her mother walked
away. Then with a shrug, ``I invited her to dinner but she didn't
come.''

<P>
   _ Look impoverished, like a hostel-dwelling archaeology student.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go to a store where prices are fixed to see how much things
cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never offer a price. Just indicate his price has to be lower.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep various amounts of small bills in different buttoned
pockets _ $5 in one, $20 in another _ so you can pull it out like
that's all you have.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't feel guilty. You don't want it, end of story.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be bulldozed by someone shouting at you. Tune him out
and concentrate on the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you really want something, don't show it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decide immediately what you will pay. Street salesmen are
quick to take advantage of indecision.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you don't want something, just say no. Do not say, ``No,
it's the wrong color,'' or ``No, it's too big.'' The seller thinks
this means yes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first price is typically double or triple or more of what
the seller will accept. Don't think that first inflated price
indicates what the object is worth, what the seller is willing to
accept or what you should offer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remarks of quality and rarity by the seller should be ignored.
Determine for yourself how well-made something is.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wondering how low the salesman will go? Walk out. You can
always come back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men traveling with women should defer to their almost
invariably superior sense of how to get a bargain.

 &HT;    A hard knock life
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sonny Liston was white America's
stereotypical nightmare: a large, illiterate black man who came
through the door promising pain and delivering retribution. He had
a long police record, he terrified black people, especially Floyd
Patterson, as much as white, and he didn't give a damn what anybody
thought of him.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he was asked what he thought of when he was fighting.
``Kill him,'' he said. ``I always say kill him when I'm in the ring
with a white boy. You got to knock 'em out to win. You won't get
the decision. I try to knock 'em all out, white or black.''
</P>
<P>
   All his life, Liston was in trouble with the law, but it was
usually fairly small-time stuff _ suspicion of theft, failure to
appear on a summons, speeding, larceny. There were also a couple of
thefts, and the pistol-whipping of a cop, not to mention the
occasional rape. During one five-year period, he amassed 14
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   He first put on boxing gloves while in prison, which he always
said he rather liked _ Sonny even scared the other convicts. He had
fists that measured 14 1/2 inches around, and he didn't beat his
opponents, he decimated them. As with the young Mike Tyson, the
aura of fear around Liston meant that lots of opponents were
defeated before they got in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Tosches' hyped-up style works well with certain kinds of
biographical subjects _ gangland stuff, especially. But Tosches
does Tosches whether it's appropriate to his subject or not, as
with his strenuously high-voltage biography of Dean Martin, a man
who broke a sweat only on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   But Tosches and Sonny Liston? That's a marriage made in pulp
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' is less a conventional biography
than a study guide for someone else's more comprehensive book.
Tosches firmly establishes that Liston was completely the creature
of Frankie Carbo _ a pal of Bugsy Siegel's and a stone killer _ and
Blinky Palermo. The mob had so much of Liston that he actually
owned only about 10 percent of himself.
</P>
<P>
   He also lays out Liston's drinking problems and his abuse of
women, whether prostitutes or other men's wives.
</P>
<P>
   Tosches believes that Liston threw both his fights with Cassius
Clay, and, looking at the films, it's hard to disagree. In the
first fight, this one-man wrecking crew gives up his title sitting
on his stool. His shoulder was hurting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second fight, we were asked to believe that Liston was
knocked silly by a little uppercut that wouldn't have fazed Jerry
Quarry, a punch thrown by a man who was never, at any time of his
career, a brutal knockout puncher.
</P>
<P>
   (There's one great line of dialogue, from a mobster who tells
Tosches that ``this guy didn't just take a dive _ he did a one and
a half off the high board.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Tosches ignores a valid counter-argument: Why would the Mob
have preferred Clay to Liston? Sonny may have been a thug, but Clay
was about to become Muhammed Ali and embark on a turbulent
socio-religious odyssey that meant he vacated the title for years.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Liston died sometime on the last week of December 1970 _
his body wasn't discovered for a week _ from what was a probable
drug overdose. Officially, he was 38, but he was almost certainly
at least 45, and maybe older. There have been suspicions of foul
play over the years, but Tosches doesn't seem to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' doesn't attempt to reclaim or
justify Liston, a man who was closer to the dark soul of boxing
than Ali. Tosches does assert something that's unassailably true,
about the way Ali co-opted dozens, even hundreds of mostly white
writers over the years:
</P>
<P>
   ``His tiresome and trying wit, his harmless and drably colorful
shows of playfulness, and his affected audacity were perfectly
suited for the media of the day . . . he became the darling of a .
. . white intelligentsia who sought meaning and metaphor in boxing
. . . Many of these writers, who could write no better than they
could fight, found in him a willing and suitable accomplice in
their conceits of the intellect and their deceit of themselves and
others. It was through Clay, and with his implicit approval, that
they were enabled to play out the marked deck _ the dream cards of
manliness, racial understanding, provocative sensibility, and bond
between writer and warrior _ that in reality were less of the soul
than of fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosches has nailed something here, even though his
crystal-meth-and-bourbon prose style is as strenuous an attempt at
blue-collar authenticity as white boys with Ivy League educations
fluttering around Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' is valuable as a corrective to 30
years of Ali worship, but it's occasionally derailed by Tosches'
compulsion to out-write Thomas Wolfe:
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in this world was free: and all, slave and master,
victor and vanquished alike, were one, as chaff from the threshing
of man against man, the threshing not only of man's will to
enslave, but of will itself, and of willfulness itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's possible that some grad student is going to read this,
clutch his chest and fall to the ground uttering low moans of
animal pleasure, but this is outrageously overheated, hammy
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath Tosches' literary affectations is a good, clean,
valuable book struggling to breathe.

 &HT;    Ragin' Cajun talks politics, cooking and Sopranos in book
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ You would expect a book by James Carville to be
outspoken to the limit, especially if the subject is politics. If
so you won't be disappointed with Corporal Cueball's latest:
``Stickin' _ The Case for Loyalty.'' (Simon &AMP; Shuster)
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprising, however, is the fact that ``Stickin''
reveals a serious and semi-intellectual side of the well-known
Clinton mad dog strategist, who has become a celebrity in his own
right with his full-steam ahead and take-no-prisoners attitude
during his many TV appearances since Clinton was elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Carville turns his wrathfully articulate distaste on Ken Starr,
Revs. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and other far-right spokesmen
as a guest on most Sunday TV talk shows and other public
appearances, not hesitating to call them as he sees them in no
uncertain terms.
</P>
<P>
   The title of this book refers, primarily I suppose, to
Carville's loyalty to President Clinton during his series of
attacks the past few years, including the Republican impeachment
attempt and the endless series of charges brought by Ken Starr's
gang of prosecutors, and others around the country who seem to have
an obsessive hate for the twice elected Democrat president.
</P>
<P>
   But the native of Carville, Louisiana, also discusses loyalty in
general as a philosophical view of life and relationships inside
and outside one's family. It is a thoughtful and interesting book,
as well as a colorful and insightful view of politics, local and
national.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the jacket blurb declares, it wouldn't be a Carville
book if it didn't include some recipes for some good home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Republicans Carville has some kind words for his
political enemies. For instance, he praises Reagan for ``sticking
by'' some of his associates when they encountered misfortune. In
this section of the book, Carville declares: ``Whatever the rights
and wrongs of David Stockman's actions, Reagan didn't fire him.
Now, at the risk of horrifying some of you, I'm going to concede
that there are occasions Republicans have stuck with a person.
Michael Deaver was deputy White House Chief of Staff until he quit
in May 1985...He became a lobbyist and had big legal problems when
he was charged with lying to a congressional subcommittee and a
federal grand jury. He had had a close relationship with the
Reagans for 20 years and they stood by him. Nancy Reagan was
especially close to Deaver. As the New York Times commented at the
time: 'That the relationship continues might come as a surprise in
light of Mr. Deaver's precipitous decline in influence in a city
with scant sympathy for those who fall from power if not from
grace.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carville even has a section on Shakespeare, the Sopranos and
Andy Griffith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every decent dramatic book,'' Carville writes,
``movie or play, is going to have a theme of conflicted loyalty.
Loyalty, or rather disloyalty is the very essence of drama...Take
all the stories in the Bible. Everyone who gets in trouble has been
disloyal to God. Look at Adam and Eve. When the deluge came and
Noah and his family were saved, there was a very, strong
message....Be loyal to God. (Of course, if we lived in Kansas, the
story is not a story, it is news, as it was literally true. It took
place three weeks ago last Thursday just before Star Wars Episode 1
opened. So take apart any great story and there's loyalty at it's
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Corp. Cueball goes on to declare that ``one of the reasons
Shakespeare is the greatest writer of all is that he covers
absolutely everything somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies and TV series about the Mafia are always popular, says
Carville, because their central theme is almost always about family
loyalty. ``The new family is (the TV series) The Sopranos, a show I
like myself. David Chase, the creator, when asked why people like
these stories, was quoted as saying, ``It has to do with loyalty.
And people identify oddly with The Family, which is odd when you
think about it. But I guess someone sitting at home watching an
informer get strangled with a length of phone wire thinking, 'Yeah,
Uncle Jimmy was a bit like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   I recommend this book, even if you're a Republican. Democrats,
of course, will enjoy it even more.

 &HT;    `Little Prince' to look (and sound) a little different
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Harcourt Brace will be bringing out a new
translation of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's enchanting ``The Little
Prince'' this summer. The original translation dates from World War
II and was done about the time the author disappeared over the
Mediterranean. The book has been selling about 200,000 copies a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers have commissioned Richard Howard to do the new
translation, and he's tried to get away from the slight stiffness
in the original (``Come, let us go look at a sunset now'') without
getting slangy.
</P>
<P>
   While they were at it, Harcourt digitally remastered
Saint-Exupery's original illustrations to clean up the grime of
nearly 60 years of printing plates.
</P>
<P>
   For loyalists, Harcourt will keep the original translation in
print for a while and will also reprint the author's other books,
while Da Capo will issue Stacy Schiff's 1994 biography.

<P>
   Amid all the loose talk about Stephen King's online short story
``Riding the Bullet,'' lost in the backwash was the fact that St.
Martin's has been trying simultaneous print and digital publication
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   At the present time, 130 St. Martin's titles are available for
downloading, among them Donald Spoto's biography of Jackie Kennedy
Onassis and a forthcoming release of a collection of short stories
by Trevanian.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful of the e-books have sold between 500 and
1,000 copies apiece, with the next most popular selling about 250
copies. St. Martin's is sufficiently encouraged as to be aiming for
simultaneous digital and paper publication for all their books.
</P>
<P>
   You'll note that these sales figures don't come close to the
400,000 copies of the King story that Simon &AMP; Schuster moved,
suggesting that the sales of ``Riding the Bullet'' had more to do
with its exclusivity and King's renown than the wrinkle of
downloading new fiction.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's sales figures indicate they're nowhere near making
any money on e-publishing, but nobody wants to have his nose
pressed against the store window if digitalization wipes out
conventional commerce in 10 years' time.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, e-publishing means a smaller overhead compared
with conventional publishing, so the conglomerates are undoubtedly
hoping for a miracle sooner rather than later.

   SCI-STRESS-WOMEN (Undated) _ A new study that reviewed dozens of

<P>
   ASIA-TYCOONS-INTERNET (Hong Kong) _ From Taiwan to Thailand,
some of Asia's most powerful families have started a blizzard of
online ventures. Whether their core businesses are in property,
telecommunications or banking, Asia's tycoons are seizing on the
Internet in hopes of expanding their reach and making even more
money. At the same time, however, the Internet is transforming the
way business is done in East Asia. With its emphasis on speed,
openness, and collaboration, the Internet is challenging
traditional Asian values of prudence, financial opacity, and family
control. Decisions, which used to be made by the patriarch behind a
veil of secrecy, are being pushed down the ranks as Asian companies
embrace Silicon Valley-style management. So despite their
chameleon-like adaptability, Asia's tycoons may have trouble making
the leap into cyberspace, critics say. By Mark Landler.

   PHILIPPINES-TECH-TALENT (Manila) _ The Philippines may be the
place that gave birth to the ``I love you'' virus that shut down
hundreds of thousands of computers around the world. But it is also
where one of the first patches to prevent the virus was developed.
Indeed, the whole episode has swung spotlight on the country's
swelling pool of high-tech talent. European and American employers
are increasingly seeking out computer savvy Filipinos. And there is
now a surprisingly lively Internet start-up scene in a country
where the average annual income is a little more than $1,000 and

 &HT;    Tricks of trade yield bargains in the bazaar
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The arena is the souk, or market, and the
sport is haggling, the greatest international competition outside
of soccer. The prize: some unusual something at an incredibly cheap
price.
</P>
<P>
   But few Americans know how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if it's the great Covered Bazaar in Istanbul
or the Khan al-Khalili, the enormous market of Cairo, the ritual of
negotiation is a must and the rules are the same. Back and forth,
back and forth until a figure is agreed upon. In the right spirit,
this can be more fun than sightseeing, and you get to know your
opponents along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips learned the hard way:
</P>
<P>
   Before you leave home, find out the best things to buy at your
destination _ wooden masks and sculptures in Africa, 18-karat gold
jewelry in Bahrain, alexandrite in Egypt, silver in Oman, and just
about anything in the Covered Bazaar in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, look like a tourist of impecunious means, a
struggling archeologist at best. Wear dusty and worn clothing and
no jewelry. Vendors are quick to notice an American's expensive
jogging shoes and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a store where prices are fixed, and see how much things
cost before you go to a market. In Istanbul, go to a big carpet
store and pay attention to free demonstrations of how to tell a
hand-made from machine-made rug, then go to the bazaar or a
small-town market and buy a rug for much less.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb is to offer a third of the price and don't
go much beyond half. On rare occasions, it's worth it to go higher
for something that would be valuable back in the states.
</P>
<P>
   Keep various amounts of small bills in different pockets. If you
have $5 worth of currency in one pocket and the item you want is
$15, pull out the bills and say ``this is all I have.'' It cuts out
a lot of haggling time.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get emotionally involved. Salesmen often will try to make
you feel guilty. ``I showed you all of this and now you won't
buy,'' they'll say with hurt verging on disgust. Don't fall for it.
He showed it to you, you didn't like it and now you want to see
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be bulldozed by someone shouting at you. Well-mannered
American women, particularly those stepping off tour buses at
tourist attractions, are prime prey. If they see you as a weakling,
they'll try to bully you. Tune out the hawking and concentrate on
the wares.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want something, don't show it. Keep easing out the
door until you get your price.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to leave if you and the seller hit a deadlock;
you can always come back. It's a good way to see how serious he is
about the price.
</P>
<P>
   Decide quickly what you will pay for the item. Street salesmen
are quick to take advantage of indecision.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want something, just say no. Do not say, ``No, it's
the wrong color,'' or ``No, it's too expensive.'' The seller thinks
this means yes. Say no and walk on.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the salesman's family, his business and town. This
won't help you get a better price, but you'll learn a lot about the
people you came to visit, which is really more important than what
you buy.

BACK TO THE BEACH: A NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE REVISITED

entertainment column.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Bryan Brown,
Rachel Ward and Armand Assante in scenes from ``On the Beach.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's 2006, and a nuclear holocaust has wiped out human life in
virtually the entire world. Only in Australia do people still
survive, playing out the string in a bleak countdown until trade
winds carry the deadly radiation their way, spelling the inevitable
end for the human race.
 &HT;    Sound familiar? It should.
 &HT;    In 1959 producer/director Stanley Kramer and an all-star cast
that included Ava Gardner, Gregory Peck and Fred Astaire brought
the same story _ Nevil Shute's novel ``On the Beach'' (1957) _ to
the big screen. Now Showtime cable network is updating the tale in
a three-hour-long movie that will air on May 28.
 &HT;    This time around, Armand Assante has the Peck role, Australian
actor Bryan Brown steps in for Astaire and Rachel Ward _ Brown's
real-life wife _ has the daunting task of making us forget Ava
Gardner's performance as Moira Davidson, the Australian adventuress
searching for true love as the curtain falls on the human race.
 &HT;    Shute wrote his novel in 1956, at the height of the Cold War.
The United States and the Soviet Union were nose-to-nose in a
nuclear stalemate, as American kids practiced safety drills in
their classrooms while their parents built concrete fallout
shelters in their backyards. The end of the world was a common
collective nightmare, even before the Cuban missile crisis of 1962
made it an any-minute-now scenario.
 &HT;    But surely times have changed. Nowadays the world is at peace,
so why reinvent this dark tale of gloom and doom?
 &HT;    ``Ninety percent of the time I keep the thought in my head that
it can't possibly happen and this is a nice old tale,'' says Jerry
Offsay, president of programming for Showtime. ``But unfortunately
I wake up and read that bombs are in the hands of the Russian
republics that don't have enough money and are thinking of selling
them to (accused terrorist Osama) Bin Ladn. And I read about China
stealing nuclear secrets.
 &HT;    ``So we believe this story is still relevant today,'' he says,
``and that this is the ultimate cautionary tale, hopefully
incredibly unlikely but clearly plausible.''
 &HT;    This time out the nuclear exchange is between the United States
and China, triggered by a crisis over Taiwan. Australian
screenwriter David Williamson, who wrote ``Gallipoli'' (l981) and
``The Year of Living Dangerously'' (l982), centers the story around
a love triangle which poises Moira between cynical Aussie scientist
Julian Osborne (Brown) and Dwight Towers (Assante), commander of an
American submarine, who has steered his vessel into Melbourne and
placed it under Australian command.
 &HT;    Towers and Osborne are then assigned to a desperate mission to
track down a faint radio signal that has been picked up from
Anchorage, Alaska. Are there survivors up north, or is it a cruel
red herring?
 &HT;    The story is less about that last-chance mission than it is
about the way in which the central characters have to learn to face
death, in their own ways and with their own senses of dignity.
 &HT;    Which is, of course, the point. Faced with the daunting task of
getting audiences to spend more than three hours watching the
ultimate in depressing tales, the producers opted for uplift over
despair.
 &HT;    ``The thing that made me want to tell this story was not the
fear of nuclear holocaust,'' says Brown, the Sydney-based actor who
has been involved in the remake for nearly a decade. ``For me,
that's the backdrop against which the human spirit thrives in this
state. This is a real positive story about how three people at the
end of the human race have to come to a decision about how they are
going to end those last days and what the end of the race means to
them. And they sort of come to it with massive dignity.
 &HT;    ``And I believe that the human spirit at its best is so
wonderfully dignified,'' he says. ``For me, this is a very positive
story.''
 &HT;    Throughout, the remake is gripping. Though the subject matter is
the ultimate nightmare and some of the scenes are heartbreaking,
once you start watching you won't be able to stop.
 &HT;    Needless to say, dealing with such profound issues led to a good
deal of soul-searching among the cast and crew during the weeks of
location filming in Australia.
 &HT;    ``It was the subject of conversation the whole time,'' Ward
says. ``What would you do in this situation? How would you choose
to lead what's left of your life? Would you go somewhere with your
family? Would you carry on as usual? Would you live in denial? What
would you do?''
 &HT;    Not everyone faces the end with dignity. There are harrowing
scenes of rampant lawlessness in the streets of Melbourne, as
society begins to come apart at the seams. Looting, killings and
sexual excess are rampant, while long lines of people wait to pick
up the poison kits that will let them end their lives when the
ravages of radiation sickness set in.
 &HT;    The end of the world finds people behaving as they always have,
in short, only more so.
 &HT;    ``Those who firmly believe in contributing to society and
maintaining civilized behavior would adhere to that to the very
end, I think,'' Brown says. ``There would be a willingness among
many to surrender life before abandoning morality and decency.''
 &HT;    The most decent of the decent here is Towers, who has lost
everything he holds dear _ his wife, his family and his faith in
his country. Having been part of the nuclear war machine which
ultimately brought about disaster, he struggles with a unique sense
of personal guilt.
 &HT;    ``To reconcile with his conscience, with his shame, he must
admit he was an accomplice in a terrible sin,'' Assante says
thoughtfully. ``He must accept that all of it was wrong. But once
that's done, how does he, how does anyone move on from that
dangerous precipice? How do you forgive yourself for your sins and
find a way to believe again in love and hope and redemption?''
 &HT;    That's a question which didn't go out of style with the Cold War
... and, Ward adds, the Cold War itself isn't as dead as some
people would like to think it is.
 &HT;    ``I think we all live in subconscious fear of something going
wrong with the world's nuclear arsenal,'' she says. ``This movie is
a poignant, timely wake-up call. Let us not forget _ this threat
exists.''

 Restaurant Workers' Hearing at Risk: Tests show that for those  who
work long shifts, the clatter's the matter  By Miriam Morgan 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Noisy restaurants may harm the hearing of their
employees, according to a new study by two University of California
at San Francisco audiologists.
<P>
   The researchers found that bartenders, servers and other wait
staff who spend eight hours at a time in noisy restaurants _ those
with decibel levels of 85 or higher _ may be at the same risk of
hearing loss as those who work in noisy factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noise levels can be high enough at peak hours so that workers
need to be taking hearing conservation measures,'' said UCSF
Director of Audiology Robert Sweetow, who is co-author of the study
with staff audiologist Lisa Tate. The report appears in the current
issue of Audiology Today.
</P>
<P>
   Diners do not run the same risk because they do not spend enough
time in noisy restaurants, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetow and Tate measured the noise levels of five San Francisco
restaurants for an hour using an instrument that allowed the
researchers to extrapolate the measurements to eight hours. The
restaurants, which the researchers did not name, ranged from 50.5
decibels to 90.1 decibels. The highest levels at any one time
ranged from 85.5 to 109.8 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   The California Office of Safety and Health Administration
restricts noise levels at industrial sites and factories to 90
decibels in an eight-hour shift. Workers cannot spend more than two
hours a day in a place where noise reaches 100 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such regulations for restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Health-related hazards are nothing new for restaurant workers.
Until smoking was banned five years ago, many workers complained
about the dangers of secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, concerns about noisy restaurants have surged.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '90s, restaurateurs and architects say they began to
pay more attention to noise levels. And two years ago, The
Chronicle began measuring restaurant noise levels and including the
levels as regular components of dining reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of concern centered on diners, but now, the
audiologists say, workers should start to be aware of their
surroundings, too.
</P>
<P>
   Because servers cannot do their job wearing earplugs, Sweetow
suggests that workers in high-decibel environments take five- to
10-minute breaks each hour. That alone can provide significant
relief.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a way to step off the floor every hour simply is not
practical, some waiters and managers counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is physically impossible to schedule those sorts of
breaks,'' said Evan Chevalier, manager at LuLu (which measured last
June at more than 80 decibels _ one of the noisiest restaurants in
San Francisco). ``You can't tell a table their waiter is out taking
his decibel-reduction break.''
</P>
<P>
   Most waiters at LuLu work four- to six-hour shifts a day, he
said, and routinely get a break from the noise by stepping into the
back for a glass of water.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hill, co-owner of the new Mission Street restaurant Dine,
admits that noise can be a problem, but points out that his
employees already take frequent breaks and work short shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a closed kitchen. It is quiet in there. And that's
where they do all their ordering and hang out.'' Plus, he said, the
peak noise time is relatively short _ generally from 7 to 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hill is taking measures to lessen the noise level of his
restaurant (it measured between 75 and 80 decibels last month). He
has added foam padding under each table to absorb the sound bounced
back from the floor, and new acoustic ceiling panels are being
installed in July.
</P>
<P>
   At Garibaldis cq no apostrophe  &LR; on College (which measured 75 to
80 decibels in 1998), bartender cq  &LR; Suriyan Edwards said he and
other staff deal with bursts of intense noise by ducking into a
small room where the wine is stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet in there,'' said Edwards during a post-lunch lull
at the Oakland restaurant yesterday. He said the noise has not
caused him any pain or hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Co-owner Ann Hurley says none of her employees have complained
about noise-related health problems and said that the highest noise
levels come during the height of the lunch and dinner crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst time is from 7 to 8 p.m.,'' she said. ``And then it
just dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cass Calder Smith, a San Francisco architect who designed LuLu,
Black Cat, Rose Pistola and the new Azie, also points out that
owners and designers are becoming more sensitive to the noise
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's clear that acoustics matter, and clients are willing
to spend more money on keeping noise levels comfortable,'' he said.
He points to the increased use of carpeting, and new materials like
fiberglass acoustical ceiling panels that can be custom-painted to
blend in with the design.
</P>
<P>
   At Azie, his latest restaurant (which measured at 75 to 80
decibels in February), live DJs and a powerful sound system that
can be adjusted for different parts of the restaurant provide
distraction from the usual clatter. But it also adds to the overall
noise level.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, noise is the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noise creates the atmosphere,'' said Azie General Manager
Joseph Hargrave. ``And I notice the servers really pick up when the
music is going.''

 &HT;    Music to paint by, and wise avoidance of auto repair
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I took off a few days recently to catch up
on honey-do's around the house: touching up woodwork inside and
out, washing windows, doing yard work and minor repairs. The first
order of business was to find appropriate music by which to paint.
</P>
<P>
   That's important. Music is absolutely necessary for painting,
which is a mindless activity that requires patience, some skill and
a high tolerance for noxious fumes.
</P>
<P>
   I made a part-time living in college as a painter, one of many
offbeat jobs I held to keep the wolves from the door. I delivered
pizzas, worked as a dog catcher, movie projectionist, unloaded
grain from a rail car, swept up chicken feet at a processing plant,
cooked steaks, spent another month working at a hatchery making the
daily run to the landfill with 55-gallon drums filled with baby
chicks deemed unfit to live, ran a record store and shot wedding
pictures. Usually I held more than one part-time job at a time.
Sounds hard now, but it didn't seem so at the time. My GPA suffered
but not enough to matter.
</P>
<P>
   The older I get the less willing I am to hire someone to perform
a task I can do myself. This is not because I am a skinflint. Far
from it. But I figure the money I save by mowing my own yard,
painting the trim, or cleaning the carpet can be spent to buy a
cool tool for the woodshop, maybe a few CDs, or another book.
</P>
<P>
   There are several areas that are strictly off limits. Plumbing
is one of them. Every time I have attempted a plumbing repair, it
has ended up costing me more than if I had called the plumber in
the first place. The other day, the garbage disposal was hung up.
Turned out three pennies were jammed inside. Not real complicated,
but it means each penny will cost about $15 by the time I pay the
service call. How three pennies, now rather mangled, got into the
garbage disposal is beyond me. Children are likely the key culprit.
They're always guilty of something.
</P>
<P>
   I'm willing to dabble in electricity to a limited extent. I can
install a ceiling fan, replace a light switch or wall outlet, but
anything more complicated than that requires someone with a
license. Electricity bites.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mess with cars, since I attempted to change the oil in
my 1978 Toyota 20 years ago and unwittingly drained the
transmission fluid instead. The first clue should have been when I
went to fill the crankcase back up with oil and it would hardly
take a quart. The second clue came when the transmission blew up
about 50 miles later. The result: A $600 lesson that God did not
intend me to be an auto mechanic, money that would have paid for
approximately 40 professionally done oil changes at 1980 prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chainsaws make me nervous. I am willing to cut down small trees
that have no chance of falling on anything important. But ever
since I worked at the Round Rock newspaper with the man who wrote
the screenplay to the ``Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' I have not felt
the same way about chainsaws, which is the national tool of Deep
East Texas. Any tree bigger in circumference than a baseball bat is
best left to professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But stick a paint brush in my hand, and I'm heck on wheels,
honest genes from being the oldest son of a sign painter. But the
music has to be just right. For the latest foray, the soundtrack to
``Phantom of the Opera'' was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one was home but me, I cranked the sound up to
mega-decibel levels and drifted back a few years. It was a magical
night spent with my daughters in London watching a live performance
the day after after having toured the original Opera Garnier in
Paris, which formed the setting for the original book.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to the two-hour set twice, and the time flew. So did
the paint. Luckily, there are several products on the market that
clean up latex paint if it ends up in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've returned to work with everything crossed off my list of
to-do projects. No doubt a new list is being compiled as we speak.
It's good to be able to relax again.

 &HT;    Nader at it again for the Green Party
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This time, according to Ralph Nader and the
Green Party, he's serious.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the consumer advocate who forced Chevrolet to kill off
the Corvair automobile back in the 1960s, made a half-hearted run
for the presidency four years ago as a favor to the Green Party
folks. He said he'd spend no more than $5,000 and didn't campaign
much.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, got less than 1 percent of the vote for his effort.
But this year, Nader is going all-out. He's raising money. He's
trying to get enough support to qualify for federal matching money,
which requires raising $5,000 in each of 20 states in contributions
of less than $250. He's even going out and making speeches, as he
did during a Texas swing in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party's message, Nader told a crowd in Austin, is
``very simple. It's to make the sovereignty of people over the
sovereignty of global corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he expect to win? No, if moving into the White House next
January is the goal.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader hopes to make enough of a ruckus charging that both
the Republican and Democratic parties are lackeys for corporate fat
cats that he can elbow into the presidential debates. There, he'd
stress the Green Party's environmental and other issues, such as
universal health care, public financing of elections and a living
wage. He says Microsoft honcho Bill Gates alone makes more money
than America's 120 million poorest folks.
</P>
<P>
   Nader and his backers will campaign in all 50 states and hope to
get on the ballot in at least 45. So far, they've qualified for 16
states. If Green Party candidates do well enough, they can get
automatic ballot status in some states for the next election. And a
5 percent showing nationally would give the party's nominee federal
matching money in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Ann McGeehan, director of elections for the Texas Secretary of
State's office, said the party must gather petition signatures from
37,380 registered voters who did not vote in this year's party
primary elections to qualify for the Texas ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens couldn't start collecting signatures until after the
March 14 party primary elections, and the petitions must be
submitted to the secretary of state by May 30. Party leaders hope
to get at least 60,000 signatures to be sure they have enough valid
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for ballot status in Texas would allow the Greens to
field candidates in any race. The party hopes to field candidates
for four statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Getting more than 5 percent of the vote in any of those races
would automatically qualify the party to be on the ballot in 2002.
And they stand a good chance in at least three _ two Railroad
Commission seats and a Supreme Court seat _ where Democrats fielded
no candidates against Republican incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   While the Green Party might not have a huge effect on the
presidential election in Texas, where Gov. George W. Bush is the
Republican nominee and expected to win handily, Nader and the
Greens could cut into Democratic nominee Al Gore's lead in
all-important states such as California, where the Greens hold
three dozen local offices.
</P>
<P>
   Nader isn't the only person vying for the Green Party
nomination, to be decided at the party's convention in Denver on
June 24-25. Others interested include Jello Biafra, former lead
singer of the rock group The Dead Kennedys, who ran unsuccessfully
for mayor of San Francisco.

 Restaurant Workers' Hearing at Risk: Tests show that for those  who
work long shifts, the clatter's the matter  By Miriam Morgan 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Noisy restaurants may harm the hearing of their
employees, according to a new study by two University of California
at San Francisco audiologists.
<P>
   The researchers found that bartenders, servers and other wait
staff who spend eight hours at a time in noisy restaurants _ those
with decibel levels of 85 or higher _ may be at the same risk of
hearing loss as those who work in noisy factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noise levels can be high enough at peak hours so that workers
need to be taking hearing conservation measures,'' said UCSF
Director of Audiology Robert Sweetow, who is co-author of the study
with staff audiologist Lisa Tate. The report appears in the current
issue of Audiology Today.
</P>
<P>
   Diners do not run the same risk because they do not spend enough
time in noisy restaurants, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetow and Tate measured the noise levels of five San Francisco
restaurants for an hour using an instrument that allowed the
researchers to extrapolate the measurements to eight hours. The
restaurants, which the researchers did not name, ranged from 50.5
decibels to 90.1 decibels. The highest levels at any one time
ranged from 85.5 to 109.8 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   The California Office of Safety and Health Administration
restricts noise levels at industrial sites and factories to 90
decibels in an eight-hour shift. Workers cannot spend more than two
hours a day in a place where noise reaches 100 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such regulations for restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Health-related hazards are nothing new for restaurant workers.
Until smoking was banned five years ago, many workers complained
about the dangers of secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, concerns about noisy restaurants have surged.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '90s, restaurateurs and architects say they began to
pay more attention to noise levels. And two years ago, The
Chronicle began measuring restaurant noise levels and including the

&HT;     TOURISM REMAINS ROBUST IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNY STRASBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco continues to attract affluent
travelers as the city also reaps benefits from rebounding Asian
economies, according to survey results released by the San
Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   One in 10 hotel guests in San Francisco last year reported a
household income above $190,000, the bureau's latest numbers show.
The city's leisure travelers, who stay in hotels as well as with
friends and relatives, report average incomes of about $63,000
compared with the $50,000 national average.
</P>
<P>
   And to put overall visitor spending in perspective: On any given
day in 1999, there were about 146,000 out-of-town visitors in San
Francisco. Over the course of the year, they collectively spent
about $8,300 for every San Francisco resident, the bureau's study
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is San Francisco's top revenue-generating industry,
pouring $6.55 billion into the economy last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, hotel occupancy has been climbing steadily in San
Francisco even considering the addition of thousands of rooms in
the region. There are 31,101 rooms in the city, according to the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, San Francisco had a record 80.7 percent hotel occupancy
rate, continuing its track record of topping the national average
by anywhere from 3 percentage points to 9 percent percentage
points, depending on the month, said David Bratton, marketing
research manager for the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel guests spent about $233 per day, including on the cost of
the hotel, with rooms averaging $155 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau President John Marks said the single greatest challenge
facing San Francisco's tourism industry is expanding the runways at
San Francisco International Airport, a hotly contested issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely adamant about the reconfiguring of
runways,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's telephone and hotel guest surveys highlighted
several other points:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1999, visitor volume rose 1.6 percent over 1998, to 16.8
million travelers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Visitor spending stayed flat; a decrease in spending by
day-trip visitors from the San Francisco Bay Area was offset by an
increase in what hotel guests spent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Out-of-area visitors brought San Francisco its bacon: Those
travelers accounted for $5 billion out of the $6.55 billion in
total spending.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 57 percent of visitors were male and 43 percent female,
influenced by the male-dominated meeting and convention business,
bureau officials said.

TECH-SAVVY BOOK OFFERS VETERANS, ROOKIES A GUIDE TO INVESTING

<TEXT>
<P>
   The fast-paced growth of new technologies, combined with low
unemployment and a vibrant economy, have bolstered interest in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much new about the buying and selling of shares, but
the advent of the Internet has heightened the average investor's
savvy about specific companies and industries and the economy as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the stream of technical jargon and broker
lingo can be intimidating. What many people are looking for is a
secure way to participate in this fast-paced field and a chance to
benefit from some of the big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Whether investors choose to work with a traditional broker or
trade electronically, the bounty of financial news and research
available online is an asset to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Markman's ``Online Investing'' (Microsoft Press, 352 pages,
$24.99) offers clues to using those tools. Markham caters to the
veteran investor who lacks online experience and the tech-savvy
stock market rookie.
</P>
<P>
   For either kind of investor, Markman notes, choosing the right
stocks at the right time will never be effortless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job isn't as easy as doing nothing,'' Markman writes.
``But the digital age has improved and simplified few spins of the
life cycle more than the task of investing. I'd argue that human
relationships aren't better on the Net, and neither are sports,
art, or religion. Yet finding and rapidly assimilating financial
acumen is the kind of computational endeavor that is actually
better accomplished on the Internet than on paper, on the
telephone, or in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ideas he covers are the basic how-to's of investing.
But the advantage is that he takes those fundamentals and shows
investors how to use them to make better decisions by sifting the
wealth of financial information available online.
</P>
<P>
   Markman offers detailed descriptions of several model
portfolios, including momentum models, growth investing models and
value investing models.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know what those are, don't worry. Markman explains
the various risk and benefit factors in a clear, easy-to-read
style.
</P>
<P>
   Markman, managing editor for the MSN MoneyCentral Investor Web
site and former executive news editor at the Los Angeles Times,
uses the MoneyCentral site in most examples using stock screening
engines and generating models. Readers should remember that other
sites are available.
</P>
<P>
   Markman guides readers through various ways of researching
stocks online. He gives concise reviews of several news and
financial sites, as well as newsletters, online bulletin boards and
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   A section on finding Securities and Exchange Commission
documents online also gives readers clues about mining the often
weighty and cumbersome documents for useful information. He even
includes a clever tip on how to use a simple word-processing
program to pinpoint changes in second versions of multipage
filings.
</P>
<P>
   For prospective investors who are looking for more in-depth
analysis, Markman reviews the full range of quantitative measures
used to gauge company performance and stock values.
</P>
<P>
   He also discusses the role of analysts and which firms post
their reports online.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes time to buy, Markman offers several ways to
manage a model-based stock portfolio depending on the amount of
time the investor wants to spend tracking the market _ ranging from
a few hours a year to daily review.

   CLEANUP TIPS
</P>
<P>
   1. Plastic (polyethelene) cutting boards are more sanitary
because they are more impervious and you can put them in the
dishwasher. _ Marie Rama, co-author, ``Cooking for Dummies''
</P>
<P>
   2. Sanitize hardwood cutting boards from time to time by heating
in the microwave 60 seconds on high._ ``What Great Chefs Know That
You Don't''
</P>
<P>
   3. When wrapping leftovers, the hardest part is getting the
plastic wrap off the roll in a flat, smooth piece. It helps to
store the box of plastic wrap in the refrigerator. _ ``What Great
Chefs Know That You Don't''
</P>
<P>
   4. Keep a box of facial tissues near the stove to wipe up small
spills. They are quicker and cheaper than paper towels. _ Diana
Sturgis, quoted in ``1,001 Secrets of Great Cooks''
</P>
<P>
   5. If your lasagna spills over onto the oven floor, sprinkle
with salt, lift out what you can with a metal spatula and wipe the
rest with a sponge. _ James Beard, quoted in ``1,001 Secrets of
Great Cooks''
</P>
<P>
   6. Small self-closing plastic bags help with cleanup and
storage. Use them to soften butter or chocolate in a bowl of hot
water. Remove, knead until mixed, then remove from the bag by
snipping a small opening in one corner and squeezing out. They are
also indispensable for storage of small amounts of leftover tomato
paste or chopped onions or peppers.
</P>
<P>
   7. Clean as you go _ keep sink full of warm, soapy water and
pause once in a while to wash up.
</P>
<P>
   8. If you don't want to keep the sink tied up with soapy water,
wash items individually with one of the detergent-filled brushes.
</P>
<P>
   9. Line roasting pans with aluminum foil for easier cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   10. If your oven is not self-cleaning, try this: Preheat oven to
200 degrees, then turn oven off. Pour (apple) cup ammonia into a
small bowl and place on the center shelf of the oven. Close door
and allow to remain overnight. Open a window, then open oven door
and air out for 30 minutes. Wipe up the mess with warm, damp paper
towels.

<P>
   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's that feeling? It's nice, but unfamiliar. Oh my gosh, I'm
being pandered to!
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, I've been cajoled, flattered and importuned
(not to mention insulted, ignored, bored and patronized) by
politicians. But getting pandered is a whole new experience. The
main difference is that political pandering goes beyond ego massage
to give you something you really want, usually money.
</P>
<P>
   To what do I owe the honor? Answer: I work on the Internet.
Therefore I am ``providing Americans with more freedom'' and
``creating new jobs and new opportunities for all Americans'' and
walking on water while turning it into wine and so on.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, don't thank me. That's a job for House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, who last week unveiled his ``eContract 2000'' _ some
flattering blather plus 10 bits of hard-core pandering. The
eContract is, of course, an hommage to the Contract With America
that God gave to Newt Gingrich in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Crude materialists might suppose this is just about campaign
fund-raising. But it is not. Politicians of both parties sense the
spotlight focusing elsewhere and, like old vaudevillians, are
trying to sing and dance their way back in.
</P>
<P>
   They start by humbly proclaiming their own tiny irrelevance to
this huge force transforming our blah, blah, blah, and then they
proceed to wrack their brains for legislation that will make them
relevant.
</P>
<P>
   The denizens of e-world tend to agree about our own importance
and the irrelevance of politics and government, but we are not
above accepting or even soliciting a pander now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's ``eContract'' naturally promises to ban (for five years)
all state and local taxes on Internet transactions. ``Big
government bureaucrats see (Internet shopping) as another
opportunity to levy a tax,'' the document explains. Since there is
no plausible argument why a purchase should be exempt from sales
tax just because it is over the Internet, the eContract makes none.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it explain why Republicans _ who haven't yet called for
the nation's nuclear arsenal to be turned over to the states, but
almost _ think state sales taxes, of all things, are a matter about
which Washington should get to decide. Or why state legislators are
``big government bureaucrats'' who must be crushed by the feds in
this case, but wise Solons who will save us from federal
overreaching on every other issue.
</P>
<P>
   Or why, if ``We assert that freedom is the answer, not
government intervention,'' the government should intervene to give
retailers on the Internet an artificial price advantage over
retailers with stores you can walk into. Or why, if the Internet is
so miraculous and powerful, it should need this kind of unfair
advantage. (Or why freedom will stop being the answer in five
years.)
</P>
<P>
   Here we have a pander of laboratory purity. There is no other
reason for it. Its biggest beneficiaries won't even ask for it. At
an MSNBC ``Silicon Valley Technology Summit'' in February, Jeff
Bezos of Amazon, Meg Whitman of eBay and Jerry Yang of Yahoo!,
among other e-commerce heavyweights, all told Tom Brokaw they're
prepared to pay sales taxes like everyone else, though some clung
to the five-year moratorium fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Not every pander is so pure. But most proposals for the
government to help the Internet enjoy the same self-contradiction:
The Internet is the most powerful social force to come along for a
millennium or so, and yet it is so weak and feverish that Dr. Pol
is needed to write a bunch of prescriptions and hope the patient
will pull through.
</P>
<P>
   Rhetorically, Armey's eContract is all about getting the
government out of the way. But at least half of his Ten
Dotcommandments actually are forms of government activism.
</P>
<P>
   That alone doesn't make them unwise. Of all 10, some are wise,
some are not, and some are carefully worded to be meaningless.
(Dick Armey is against ``excessive regulations.'' You?) Together,
these political promises demonstrate the foolishness, if not the
dishonesty, of the cheap anti-government rhetoric that accompanies
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preventing frivolous lawsuits'' means having the federal
government crush the traditional freedom of states to make and
administer their own tort laws. ``Protecting intellectual property
rights'' means taking away people's freedom to make and sell copies
of software or music or e-books if someone else happens to own the
rights. Sensible limits (and national standards) on lawsuits is a
good idea, and copyright protection is essential. But both involve
the exercise of federal power to limit individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Not clear what's involved in ``modernizing our education
system'' (another traditional state matter) or ``expanding digital
opportunities'' or ``promoting workplace flexibility'' or
``promoting basic research.'' No doubt nothing as straightforward
as federal spending or regulation. I smell a lot of tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   But a tax credit skews private incentives and loses the Treasury
money just like direct spending. And ``promoting'' something may be
different from requiring it, but it is still government
interference that is supposed to improve the purely private sector
result.
</P>
<P>
   But these are all quibbles. Speaking, if I may, for all
cyberworkers and cyberbosses, we could always use another tax
credit or three, even though we hate government and politicians as
much as the next guys (biotech). Internet to Congress: Pander away.

CONDOLEEZZA RICE: GEORGE W. BUSH'S CELEBRITY ADVISER 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The iron rule of presidential campaigns is that aides should
never overshadow their candidate _ especially when he has a
lightweight reputation. George W. Bush's campaign tries to hide
consigliere Karl Rove. Bush economics adviser Michael Boskin is
nearly invisible. And when was the last time you read a profile of
Paul Wolfowitz, one of Bush's foreign policy honchos?
</P>
<P>
   But the rule does not apply to Condoleezza Rice, W.'s other
foreign policy adviser. While almost no one has heard of Gore's
foreign policy counselor Leon Fuerth, everyone knows Condi. When Al
Gore delivered a major foreign policy speech earlier this month,
Bush didn't answer it himself. He dispatched Rice. Her picture, not
Bush's, appeared opposite Gore in The New York Times. Columnists
gush over her. Newspapers and network news programs profile her.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is allowed to overshadow Bush because she is exotic: a
black, female, conservative foreign policy expert. She stands out
in Bush's army of white men, proves that his campaign is not just
about good ol' boys.
</P>
<P>
   But her celebrity obscures how unexceptional she is. Her ideas,
work, and style place her in the absolute mainstream of Republican
thought. She is Brent Scowcroft in the body of a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters portray Rice's ascent as more unlikely than it is,
noting that she grew up in Jim Crow Alabama and lost a childhood
friend in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing. But Rice's family
belonged to Birmingham's bourgeois elite. Her Republican father was
a university administrator, and her mother taught music and
science. It was understood that she would pursue a high-powered
career.
</P>
<P>
   Rice aspired to be a concert pianist, but at the University of
Denver she found herself enthralled by an international relations
class taught by Josef Korbel, Madeleine Albright's father. This led
Rice into Soviet studies, where she pursued a doctorate and
specialized in military affairs. Early on she decided that national
interest and the balance of power, not humanitarian principles,
should determine U.S. policy. In 1981, at the age of 26, she landed
a professorship at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1985 conference, Rice bowled over Republican foreign policy
eminence Brent Scowcroft with her tough questions and confident
manner. He became the first in a series of foreign policy mentors:
George Shultz and President George Bush would follow. In 1989,
National Security Adviser Scowcroft hired her as his Soviet
analyst. She served three years, abetting the Soviet Union's end
and Germany's reunification, meeting Mikhail Gorbachev, and
impressing her bosses with her keen pragmatism and collegial
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   After the National Security Council, she returned to Stanford
and became its provost, the youngest person ever to hold the job,
as well as the first woman and the first African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President George Bush brought Rice and George W.
together at his Maine vacation home. They hit it off. She soon
resigned as provost and became Governor Bush's chief foreign policy
adviser. Rice supervises Bush's foreign policy cabal, which
includes Wolfowitz, Robert Zoellick and Richard Perle. (Even Gore
advisers concede she has assembled ``a pretty good team.'') Rice
polishes Bush's speeches, advises him on policy specifics, serves
as his sounding board.
</P>
<P>
   Rice rejects the notion that she is the brains behind Bush's
foreign policy. She says that Bush has ``good instincts'' about the
subject, and she argues that even experts would have flunked the
international relations pop quizzes he tanked in the fall. Still,
it's easy to see her fingerprints on his statements. She wrote an
article for the January/February Foreign Affairs outlining many of
Bush's themes. Blasting the Clinton administration for its bobbing,
purposeless foreign policy, she insisted that America pursue its
``national interest'' rather than squishy notions of
humanitarianism and international law.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should treat China and Russia as competitors
rather than partners, strengthen the military but use it less, and
firm our ties to regional allies such as Korea and Japan, she
wrote. We should avoid humanitarian interventions unless _ and this
is a big wiggle _ there is good reason for them. We should push
free trade and economic liberalization everywhere _ especially
China _ because this invariably leads to political liberalization.
We should deploy a national missile defense and scrap treaties,
such as the ABM treaty, that impede the national interest. Above
all, the United States must be more ``resolute'' and certain in its
aims.
</P>
<P>
   Her philosophy is not the cold warrior ethos she was raised on.
According to friend and NSC colleague Philip Zelikow, who
co-authored a book on German reunification with Rice, the end of
the Cold War helped open her thinking. Like many analysts of her
generation, she focuses more on economics, conceives of the world
in multipolar rather than bipolar terms, frets more about rogue
states, and hews less to ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who favor a values-laden foreign policy criticize
Rice for her willingness to work with undemocratic regimes, notably
China. Republican isolationists suspect she is too willing to send
American troops overseas. In short, she occupies the solid middle
of the Republican foreign policy spectrum. (Rice's and Bush's views
differ surprisingly little from Gore's. All support the Kosovo
intervention, trade with China, engagement with Russia, and the
primacy of Israel's security in the Middle East.)
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about Rice's work for Bush is not her
advice _ he could hear much the same thing from Perle or Richard
Cheney or others _ but her friendship. She really likes Bush, and
he seems to reciprocate. They share deep religious faith _ both are
evangelical Protestants. Both are sports fans and exercise
fanatics: During one early meeting, Bush consulted with Rice while
she ran on a treadmill. Both are loose and funny but capable of
hardheaded pragmatism when it's required. ``We have very similar
personalities,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rice admirers tout her for secretary of defense in a Bush
administration, others for secretary of state. But many peg her as
national security adviser. That, after all, is the foreign
policymaker who works most directly with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would be at the center and close to Bush,'' says a friend
of hers. ``Bush would feel more comfortable in the White House with
her around.''

 &HT;    Fate, dangerous vocation bring sorrow for the Pettys
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In their lifetimes, Lee, Richard and Kyle Petty,
grandfather, father and son, drove, or have driven, in 2,191 NASCAR
automobile races. In his lifetime, Adam, son, grandson and
great-grandson, drove in one. When he died last month, Lee Petty
was 86 years old. When Adam died on the track at Loudon, N.H., last
week, he was 19. Of such is the capriciousness of tragedy, of such
is the injustice of death.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Petty was the past, the foundation of stock-car racing's
model family. Adam Petty was the future, a loss not just to racing
alone, but to man in general, for he was as straight-laced as they
come, clear-eyed, clear-headed, ``a lad of mettle, a good boy,'' as
Shakespeare wrote it. Born to be the next ``King,'' succeeding to
the title held by the grandfather Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is no more but in spirit, erased from this earth in the
most foul of fates.
</P>
<P>
   In time, these old eyes have seen one Petty or another suffer
through a series of horrendous crashes on the track. In June of
1949, I watched Lee Petty drive in the first NASCAR race ever run,
at a crude oval gouged out of red dirt, with jerrybuilt stands and
the fancy name of Charlotte Motor Speedway. One publication
reported that he finished 17th. He never finished.
</P>
<P>
   He had driven to the race in the family Buick from the home near
Randleman, not with sons Richard and Maurice, as in another report.
``I had two buddies along to help in the pits,'' he said a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the family Buick failed, he came to rest on a little rise
across the track, opened the door and sat there in a pose similar
to Rodin's ``The Thinker.'' Asked also years later what he had been
so deep in thought about at the time, he answered, ``I was thinking
what I was going to tell my wife where I'd been when I got home.''
</P>
<P>
   The seed was sown. The Pettys were rooted in racing. Twice, Lee
would win the national championship before there was a Winston Cup.
Seven times, Richard would win it. He was the first driver whose
winnings totaled a million dollars. It was a cause for celebration,
in 1974, if memory serves, after 15 years of hard riding. Now, they
let that much money slip through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   One time, at old Lakewood Speedway, Richard thought he had won
his first race, but crusty old dad roared into Victory Lane, such
as it was, beside him and challenged the scoring. Lee had it right.
Richard had to wait another day to win the first of his 200.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's career came to an end when he went over the wall at
Daytona in 1961. Miraculously, he survived, and, after four months
in a hospital, tried to drive only six more times. He then hung it
up and turned to bossing Petty Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Richard became the star: ``King Richard.'' It was a money-making
amalgamation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard's flirtations with death were many. He had a serious
crackup at the present Lowe's Motor Speedway and suffered a broken
shoulder. He has been upside down at Darlington. Twice in his last
season, he came hurtling down the stretch, at Daytona and Atlanta,
in a ball of flames, his car disintegrating, pieces of metal flying
in the air. Again, fate was on his side. No serious injury. The
message was there, though, and he gracefully retired while still in
one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's career has been less victorious, with his many
distracting ventures, and Adam became his project, not that the kid
needed much pushing. ``All I ever wanted to be is a race driver,''
he said in a television interview. ``I wouldn't know what to do in
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm, beautiful smile was there. Sincerity etched in the
boyish face. Not many brothers would let a 14-year-old sister cut
his hair, which he did before Montgomery Lee left for England with
her dad for an equestrian event. It was on that journey that the
devastating news reached Kyle and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a son in the prime of life is a crushing blow, and I can
speak to that. To lose a bright, wonderful, well-mannered son just
beginning to blossom in his father's image, is deeper than
heartbreak. Death has no conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Making headlines
</P>
<P>
   The future of Petty Enterprises: No one is sure how Adam Petty's
death will affect the future of Petty Enterprises, which has been
the biggest name in racing since NASCAR was founded. Richard Petty
already had moved out of the picture earlier this season. Kyle has
had a solid Winston Cup career, but he's spent the last three years
splitting time between his own driving and overseeing Adam's
blossoming career. Kyle says he won't run in The Winston this week
and will make a decision on the Charlotte 600 later.
</P>
<P>
   Bet the house on Humpy Wheeler: Lowe's Motor Speedway President
Humpy Wheeler has predicted the winner of The Winston eight times
in the last 12 years. This year, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is the choice.
``Some people may think I'm going way out on a limb, but The
Winston is the type of race that was made for Earnhardt Jr.,''
Wheeler explained. ``It's a no-holds barred, stand-on-the-gas race
that fits perfectly with his mentality and his driving style.''
Dale Jr. is not a surprise pick, considering he is the only driver
to win two races on the major-league circuit this season.
</P>
<P>
   Another penalty for ``bad'' gas: The funny gas continues to show
up in NASCAR, despite the strict penalty handed to Jeremy
Mayfield's team for rules violations. Chevy No. 3 crew chief David
Lackey and owner Ken Alexander were penalized for using
``unapproved'' fuel at the Richmond Busch race.

   An interview with Johnny Benson
</P>
<P>
   By Rick Minter
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last season, Johnny Benson gave up a ride in a
Roush Racing team car to drive for a relatively new team, Tyler Jet
Motorsports. Some questioned the move, but Benson nearly won the
Daytona 500 in his first points race in the No. 10 Pontiac. He is
21st in points with one top-5 and two top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever have second thoughts about leaving Roush Racing
to drive for an unproven team?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. I knew I needed to make a change. It ended up being a
pretty good situation. I had been over and walked through Tyler
Jet's shop a couple of times and it was a pretty nice place. They
were doing a lot of quality work over there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've driven for multi-car teams and now a one-car
organization. What size team is best?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two-car teams are the best scenario. Two can work together
without too many conflicts. I'm not opposed to more than two, but
two is the best.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you hope to have accomplished at the end of this
season?
</P>
<P>
   A: You always hope you can win a race _ that's what this sport
is about. We hope to finish in the top 10 in points. It's going to
be awfully hard after missing the race at Atlanta, but it's still a
goal and we'll try to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the rules for determining provisional starting posititions
need to be changed?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on which side of the fence you're on. Being 11th
in points at Atlanta and having to go home is a pretty tough deal,
but you know the rules going in. At that point in the season,
provisionals were based on last year's points, and I wasn't there,
and it was the team's first full year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are your thoughts on the death of Adam Petty?
</P>
<P>
   A: To have someone so young with such a bright future ahead of
him die like this is a hard thing to swallow. My dad raced, and
that's how I got into this sport. It's hard to explain why we love
racing, and at times like this it's even harder. It's so rare for
this to happen in NASCAR because they have made the cars so safe in
recent years. Sometimes you get lulled into thinking it can never
happen.

</P>
<P>
   The iron rule of presidential campaigns is that aides should
never overshadow their candidate _ especially when he has a
lightweight reputation. George W. Bush's campaign tries to hide
consigliere Karl Rove. Bush economics adviser Michael Boskin is
nearly invisible. And when was the last time you read a profile of
Paul Wolfowitz, one of Bush's foreign policy honchos?
</P>
<P>
   But the rule does not apply to Condoleezza Rice, W.'s other
foreign policy adviser. While almost no one has heard of Gore's
foreign policy counselor Leon Fuerth, everyone knows Condi. When Al
Gore delivered a major foreign policy speech earlier this month,
Bush didn't answer it himself. He dispatched Rice. Her picture, not
Bush's, appeared opposite Gore in The New York Times. Columnists
gush over her. Newspapers and network news programs profile her.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is allowed to overshadow Bush because she is exotic: a
black, female, conservative foreign policy expert. She stands out
in Bush's army of white men, proves that his campaign is not just
about good ol' boys.
</P>
<P>
   But her celebrity obscures how unexceptional she is. Her ideas,
work, and style place her in the absolute mainstream of Republican
thought. She is Brent Scowcroft in the body of a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters portray Rice's ascent as more unlikely than it is,
noting that she grew up in Jim Crow Alabama and lost a childhood
friend in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing. But Rice's family
belonged to Birmingham's bourgeois elite. Her Republican father was
a university administrator, and her mother taught music and
science. It was understood that she would pursue a high-powered
career.
</P>
<P>
   Rice aspired to be a concert pianist, but at the University of
Denver she found herself enthralled by an international relations
class taught by Josef Korbel, Madeleine Albright's father. This led
Rice into Soviet studies, where she pursued a doctorate and
specialized in military affairs. Early on she decided that national
interest and the balance of power, not humanitarian principles,
should determine U.S. policy. In 1981, at the age of 26, she landed
a professorship at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1985 conference, Rice bowled over Republican foreign policy
eminence Brent Scowcroft with her tough questions and confident
manner. He became the first in a series of foreign policy mentors:
George Shultz and President George Bush would follow. In 1989,
National Security Adviser Scowcroft hired her as his Soviet
analyst. She served three years, abetting the Soviet Union's end
and Germany's reunification, meeting Mikhail Gorbachev, and
impressing her bosses with her keen pragmatism and collegial
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   After the National Security Council, she returned to Stanford
and became its provost, the youngest person ever to hold the job,
as well as the first woman and the first African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President George Bush brought Rice and George W.
together at his Maine vacation home. They hit it off. She soon
resigned as provost and became Governor Bush's chief foreign policy
adviser. Rice supervises Bush's foreign policy cabal, which
includes Wolfowitz, Robert Zoellick and Richard Perle. (Even Gore
advisers concede she has assembled ``a pretty good team.'') Rice
polishes Bush's speeches, advises him on policy specifics, serves
as his sounding board.
</P>
<P>
   Rice rejects the notion that she is the brains behind Bush's
foreign policy. She says that Bush has ``good instincts'' about the
subject, and she argues that even experts would have flunked the
international relations pop quizzes he tanked in the fall. Still,
it's easy to see her fingerprints on his statements. She wrote an
article for the January/February Foreign Affairs outlining many of
Bush's themes. Blasting the Clinton administration for its bobbing,
purposeless foreign policy, she insisted that America pursue its
``national interest'' rather than squishy notions of
humanitarianism and international law.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should treat China and Russia as competitors
rather than partners, strengthen the military but use it less, and
firm our ties to regional allies such as Korea and Japan, she
wrote. We should avoid humanitarian interventions unless _ and this
is a big wiggle _ there is good reason for them. We should push
free trade and economic liberalization everywhere _ especially
China _ because this invariably leads to political liberalization.
We should deploy a national missile defense and scrap treaties,
such as the ABM treaty, that impede the national interest. Above
all, the United States must be more ``resolute'' and certain in its
aims.
</P>
<P>
   Her philosophy is not the cold warrior ethos she was raised on.
According to friend and NSC colleague Philip Zelikow, who
co-authored a book on German reunification with Rice, the end of
the Cold War helped open her thinking. Like many analysts of her
generation, she focuses more on economics, conceives of the world
in multipolar rather than bipolar terms, frets more about rogue
states, and hews less to ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who favor a values-laden foreign policy criticize
Rice for her willingness to work with undemocratic regimes, notably
China. Republican isolationists suspect she is too willing to send
American troops overseas. In short, she occupies the solid middle
of the Republican foreign policy spectrum. (Rice's and Bush's views
differ surprisingly little from Gore's. All support the Kosovo
intervention, trade with China, engagement with Russia, and the
primacy of Israel's security in the Middle East.)
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about Rice's work for Bush is not her
advice _ he could hear much the same thing from Perle or Richard
Cheney or others _ but her friendship. She really likes Bush, and
he seems to reciprocate. They share deep religious faith _ both are
evangelical Protestants. Both are sports fans and exercise
fanatics: During one early meeting, Bush consulted with Rice while
she ran on a treadmill. Both are loose and funny but capable of
hardheaded pragmatism when it's required. ``We have very similar
personalities,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rice admirers tout her for secretary of defense in a Bush
administration, others for secretary of state. But many peg her as
national security adviser. That, after all, is the foreign
policymaker who works most directly with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would be at the center and close to Bush,'' says a friend
of hers. ``Bush would feel more comfortable in the White House with
her around.''

 &HT;    Fate, dangerous vocation bring sorrow for the Pettys
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In their lifetimes, Lee, Richard and Kyle Petty,
grandfather, father and son, drove, or have driven, in 2,191 NASCAR
automobile races. In his lifetime, Adam, son, grandson and
great-grandson, drove in one. When he died last month, Lee Petty
was 86 years old. When Adam died on the track at Loudon, N.H., last
week, he was 19. Of such is the capriciousness of tragedy, of such
is the injustice of death.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Petty was the past, the foundation of stock-car racing's
model family. Adam Petty was the future, a loss not just to racing
alone, but to man in general, for he was as straight-laced as they
come, clear-eyed, clear-headed, ``a lad of mettle, a good boy,'' as
Shakespeare wrote it. Born to be the next ``King,'' succeeding to
the title held by the grandfather Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is no more but in spirit, erased from this earth in the
most foul of fates.
</P>
<P>
   In time, these old eyes have seen one Petty or another suffer
through a series of horrendous crashes on the track. In June of
1949, I watched Lee Petty drive in the first NASCAR race ever run,
at a crude oval gouged out of red dirt, with jerrybuilt stands and
the fancy name of Charlotte Motor Speedway. One publication
reported that he finished 17th. He never finished.
</P>
<P>
   He had driven to the race in the family Buick from the home near
Randleman, not with sons Richard and Maurice, as in another report.
``I had two buddies along to help in the pits,'' he said a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the family Buick failed, he came to rest on a little rise
across the track, opened the door and sat there in a pose similar
to Rodin's ``The Thinker.'' Asked also years later what he had been
so deep in thought about at the time, he answered, ``I was thinking
what I was going to tell my wife where I'd been when I got home.''
</P>
<P>
   The seed was sown. The Pettys were rooted in racing. Twice, Lee
would win the national championship before there was a Winston Cup.
Seven times, Richard would win it. He was the first driver whose
winnings totaled a million dollars. It was a cause for celebration,
in 1974, if memory serves, after 15 years of hard riding. Now, they
let that much money slip through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   One time, at old Lakewood Speedway, Richard thought he had won
his first race, but crusty old dad roared into Victory Lane, such
as it was, beside him and challenged the scoring. Lee had it right.
Richard had to wait another day to win the first of his 200.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's career came to an end when he went over the wall at
Daytona in 1961. Miraculously, he survived, and, after four months
in a hospital, tried to drive only six more times. He then hung it
up and turned to bossing Petty Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Richard became the star: ``King Richard.'' It was a money-making
amalgamation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard's flirtations with death were many. He had a serious
crackup at the present Lowe's Motor Speedway and suffered a broken
shoulder. He has been upside down at Darlington. Twice in his last
season, he came hurtling down the stretch, at Daytona and Atlanta,
in a ball of flames, his car disintegrating, pieces of metal flying
in the air. Again, fate was on his side. No serious injury. The
message was there, though, and he gracefully retired while still in
one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's career has been less victorious, with his many
distracting ventures, and Adam became his project, not that the kid
needed much pushing. ``All I ever wanted to be is a race driver,''
he said in a television interview. ``I wouldn't know what to do in
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm, beautiful smile was there. Sincerity etched in the
boyish face. Not many brothers would let a 14-year-old sister cut
his hair, which he did before Montgomery Lee left for England with
her dad for an equestrian event. It was on that journey that the
devastating news reached Kyle and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a son in the prime of life is a crushing blow, and I can
speak to that. To lose a bright, wonderful, well-mannered son just
beginning to blossom in his father's image, is deeper than
heartbreak. Death has no conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Making headlines
</P>
<P>
   The future of Petty Enterprises: No one is sure how Adam Petty's
death will affect the future of Petty Enterprises, which has been
the biggest name in racing since NASCAR was founded. Richard Petty
already had moved out of the picture earlier this season. Kyle has
had a solid Winston Cup career, but he's spent the last three years
splitting time between his own driving and overseeing Adam's
blossoming career. Kyle says he won't run in The Winston this week
and will make a decision on the Charlotte 600 later.
</P>
<P>
   Bet the house on Humpy Wheeler: Lowe's Motor Speedway President
Humpy Wheeler has predicted the winner of The Winston eight times
in the last 12 years. This year, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is the choice.
``Some people may think I'm going way out on a limb, but The

that fits perfectly with his mentality and his driving style.''
Dale Jr. is not a surprise pick, considering he is the only driver
to win two races on the major-league circuit this season.

up in NASCAR, despite the strict penalty handed to Jeremy

   An interview with Johnny Benson
</P>
<P>
   By Rick Minter
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last season, Johnny Benson gave up a ride in a
Roush Racing team car to drive for a relatively new team, Tyler Jet
Motorsports. Some questioned the move, but Benson nearly won the
Daytona 500 in his first points race in the No. 10 Pontiac. He is
21st in points with one top-5 and two top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     GOP OFFICIAL SEES HISPANICS AS MAKING DIFFERENCE IN MIDWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT FLORES  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Hispanic voters, specifically those in the
Midwest, may be the deciding factor in who becomes the next
president, said the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single state in the Midwest is in play, and Hispanic
voters in those states may well make the difference in who controls
the Electoral College in the presidential election,'' said Al
Cardenas, who also is a Republican National Committee member.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas made his comments Wednesday during a luncheon of the
Republican National Hispanic Assembly of Texas, an outreach
committee whose mission is to recruit Hispanics into the party.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Texas Gov. George W. Bush holds leads in the South
and in some Western states, and that Vice President Al Gore enjoys
stronger backing in the Northeast and in other Western states,
Cardenas said the Midwest could be key in determining who becomes
president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential hopeful, and Gore, a Democrat,
are in statistical dead heats in virtually all Midwest states, and
Hispanic voters represent enough of the electorate in each of the
states to swing the vote in either direction, Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
   With a campaign theme that emphasizes education, Cardenas said,
the Republican Party is hoping its message will resonate with
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have the one issue that transcends all politics
... and education is going to be our legacy and entry into minority
politics,'' Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to do well in the Hispanic community, you
have to deliver financial resources and good issues, and you have
to recruit good candidates,'' he added.

 &HT;    The Winston: NASCAR'S all-star gala
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR and Winston officials do everything in their power to
make The Winston all-star race one of the most exciting events of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The non-points race Saturday night in Concord, N.C., features
the top drivers on the Winston Cup circuit. As racing officials
have done in past years, the rules have been changed to encourage
more competition at Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we all have to remember that we're in the
entertainment business, and as much as we'd like to be selfish in
the way we run races or whatever, the end result needs to be great
entertainment,'' Mark Martin said. ``And that's what we're able to
give 'em in The Winston.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Winston has increased the purse more than 30
percent to a grand total of $2 million. The winner will get a
minimum check of $500,000 and could make more through various
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston has also changed its rules on qualifying because of
the rash of injuries on pit row this season. In past years, drivers
earned their qualifying positions based on the total time of three
laps, which included one four-tire pit stop after the first or
second lap.
</P>
<P>
   This year, drivers will begin qualifying with a two-tire change
and then complete three consecutive laps in the unique time trials.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen drivers, including race winners from 1999 and this
season's first 11 races, already have made the field for the big
event. The final two spots in the 20-car field will be determined
in two qualifying races.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of The Winston Open will earn a spot in the all-star
race. The Winston Open has been reduced from 50 to 30 laps,
honoring the lengthy partnership (30 years) between NASCAR and its
primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Racing officials also have come up with another way of
qualifying one more driver. Here's how: Those who finish on the
lead lap of The Winston Open _ other than the winner _ will earn a
spot in the No Bull Sprint. The new qualifying race lasts 16 laps.
</P>
<P>
   The main event is basically the same as past years: 20 drivers
will compete in three segments of 30, 30 and 10 laps. The only new
wrinkle is that NASCAR will use a complicated formula after the
first segment to determine whether or not to invert the order of
the top 12 finishing cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston's greatest moments ...
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The last lap of the 1992 Winston race was the defining moment.
A live TNN television audience watched in disbelief as Kyle Petty
in the No. 42 Mello Yello SABCO Pontiac battled Dale Earnhardt in
the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet down the backstretch on the last lap
at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Going into turn three, Earnhardt slid
up the track and spun, forcing Petty to back off just enough to
allow Davey Allison in the No. 28 Havoline Ford to pull even coming
off turn four. They were wheel-to-wheel at the finish with Allison
taking the victory by a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Just past the start-finish line , Allison and Petty made
contact, forcing the No. 28 into the outside retaining wall and
into a shower of sparks. Allison's wrecked No. 28 went to victory
lane as he was transported to a local hospital. He returned to race
the next week in the Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 1987 running of The Winston is best remembered for the
``pass in the grass.'' Just one problem. It wasn't a pass. The
maneuver was actually a defensive move by Earnhardt. Bill Elliott
sat on the pole and dominated the first 125 laps of what was then a
two-segment all-star event. Earnhardt, who hit nearly every car on
the track that day, took over on lap 126 and held on for the final
10 laps. It was during this last 10-lap sprint that he ran all the
way into the grass in the dogleg to hold off Elliott, who was
driving the No. 9 Coors Ford. On the cool-down lap, Elliott pulled
alongside Earnhardt and turned hard into the Goodwrench Chevrolet
to show his disgust at the No. 3 car; but the Intimidator enjoyed
the spoils of victory _ the $200,000 winner's check.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 1995 Winston ushered in NASCAR's new guard. A young Jeff
Gordon in the No. 24 DuPont Chevrolet already was having success in
his third full season. Veterans Darrell Waltrip and Earnhardt
started on the front row of the final 10-lap segment with Gordon
behind on the inside of row two. The two veterans raced
side-by-side on the first lap of the final segment until they hit
turn three. Waltrip went into the corner too hot in his No. 17
Western Auto Chevrolet and slid up into Earnhardt, forcing both
cars into the outside wall. Gordon drove to the bottom of the track
and was able to hold off Sterling Marlin for the victory in the
final 10 laps. This race marked the start of the special paint
scheme era. Earnhardt's Chevy had a thank-you note to Winston
adorning the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ... and The Winston's lamest moments
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1990, Earnhardt led all 70 laps and finished .34 seconds
ahead of Ken Schrader, who was driving the Hendrick Motorsports No.
25 Kodiak Chevrolet. The day race had no lead changes. Several race
fans were spotted bringing out the cots for this snoozer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1991, Allison had the field covered and then some. Like
Earnhardt in 1990, he led every lap and finished 2.87 seconds in
front of Schrader. The cots resurfaced for this sleeper. Two
blowouts in a row in The Winston left the hierarchy scrambling to
make changes before the 1992 event. For starters, it was moved to
Saturday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Mich. _ The 2000 presidential campaign is likely to
be the last hurrah of the ``Reagan Democrats,'' the fabled swing
voters in the battleground states of the industrial Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are, quite literally, dying off,'' said Ed Sarpolus, head
of a Lansing, Mich., polling firm, EPIC-MRA. ``But they're still a
force. And while they still lean slightly Democrat, Al Gore is
going to have to battle George Bush for every one of their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle this fall will be for the votes of the children and
grandchildren, too, because the progeny are just as weak in their
party allegiance as the original Reagan Democrats. ``You now have
two more generations that have grown up in households that taught
by example, switching back and forth from party to party,'' said
Sarpolus.
</P>
<P>
   As the political label suggests, the self-described Reagan
Democrats came to prominence _ that is, to the attention of
campaign strategists and pollsters _ with the election of Ronald
Reagan in 1980 and his re-election in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Reagan Democrats were Catholic,
blue-collar, middle-class union families, once a core constituency
of the Democratic Party, largely in the industrial states of
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But they began to drift away in the late 1960s amid growing
cynicism about government and perceptions that the party was more
concerned with the rights of minorities than working families.
</P>
<P>
   They helped elect Reagan twice. Then they elected Reagan's vice
president, the elder George Bush, in 1988. But in 1992, perceiving
that Bush had little interest in their economic lot, they began
drifting back into the Democratic camp, lured by Bill Clinton's
promises to ``put people first.''
</P>
<P>
   Their return to the Democratic fold was completed in 1996 with
Clinton's re-election, dramatically illustrated here in Macomb
County, a collection of suburban Detroit blue-collar communities.
Clinton won 50 percent of the county's vote, compared to 40 percent
for Republican nominee Bob Dole, becoming the first Democrat to win
in Macomb since Hubert Humphrey in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Macomb County is legendary as the heartland of Reagan Democrats,
largely due to a study pollster Stan Greenberg did of disaffected
Democrats in 1984. Greenberg, focusing on Macomb, concluded that
``on this battlefield lay the ruins of the New Deal,'' leaving in
its place Ronald Reagan's America and all the uncertainties of a
new era.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Greenberg eventually became Clinton's pollster
and Macomb became a frequent stop for White House hopefuls. It is
the place where Bush labeled Clinton and Gore ``bozos'' in 1992,
and the site of Michael Dukakis's comical misadventures at a tank
factory in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the place where Gore, after nailing down the
Democratic presidential nomination this spring, began his series of
``school days'' _ day-long visits to schools to draw attention to
his proposed education policies.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's focus was on people like Steve and Joanna Dygar,
voters who had long leaned toward the Democratic Party but who
voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Steve was 51 years old, working as a telephone repairman, when
he first voted for Reagan. Joanna was 48, a housewife, with two
nearly grown children. Reagan ``just seemed to be a leader, strong
and kind of inspiring,'' Steve recalls. ``He cared about the little
guy. And things in Washington needed shaking up.''
</P>
<P>
   They were 63 and 60, getting ready for retirement, when they
first voted for Clinton. ``He seemed to care more about people and
families,'' Joanna recalls. ``And I thought it was time for the
younger generation to have their turn trying to straighten out
things in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 71 and 68, the Dygars are not nearly as cynical about
government as they once were. They aren't too keen on the idea of
changes in Social Security, for example, although they would like
to see more services from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``you can expect to see a big fight over Social
Security'' in this campaign, said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to union and government pension funds, the Dygars
are living off a stock portfolio that, despite the market
gyrations, is ``still more than we started with,'' said Joanna, the
family money manager.
</P>
<P>
   They give credit to Clinton for the economy. ``He did something
right,'' said Steve. But they don't extend the credit to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Dygars are officially undecided in this year's
presidential election. Steve is leaning toward Bush. He sees a bit
of Reagan in him _ ``a strong leader.'' Joanna, on the other hand,
likes Gore's experience. ``It's a safety factor,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As Catholics, they both expressed concern about the ``moral
drift'' of the country.
</P>
<P>
   And among Reagan Democrats, the blame for the decline in moral
values rests with Clinton and his marital infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should put one of those trigger safety locks on his
zipper,'' said 75-year-old John Buckley, a retired die worker and
longtime resident of Macomb County.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Reagan Democrats will punish Gore for Clinton's
indiscretions is unclear. But the lingering popularity of Sen. John
McCain, the vanquished reform candidate in the GOP presidential
contest, suggests Gore is partly blamed for the campaign finance
excesses in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's a good man,'' said Buckley. ``He just didn't
understand that you've got to get along and get into office before
you can change things.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the get-along-to-get-along nature of politics that is so
unappealing to the progeny of the Reagan Democrats, voters like
25-year-old Bill Cayl, a musician, who describes himself as ``right
square in the middle'' of the political back-and-forths of his
Macomb County family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is too much of a game,'' said Cayl. ``And while
everybody's playing the game, nobody seems to be fighting for
regular people out in the country. This country is about freedom,
but the politicians seem to have forgotten about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayl has heard the older generations in his family talk almost
wistfully of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, and he wishes he
could vote for a presidential candidate of their caliber. ``Maybe
one of these guys running now could wind up like that,'' he said.
``I just don't know.''

ALLEN'S BREEZIEST COMEDY IN YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen's delightful new comedy, ``Small Time Crooks,'' is
``Take the Money and Run'' by way of ``The Honeymooners.'' It's
Allen's breeziest comedy in years, a lighthearted romp that
combines caper high jinks and social satire in an enjoyably
satisfying manner. To paraphrase Jackie Gleason's Ralph Kramden:
It'll send you to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Allen stars as Ray Winkler, an ex-con dishwasher who's always
scheming and dreaming about a better life. His beloved wife, a
one-time exotic dancer named Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), tolerates and
humors Ray's crazy ideas, although she's not above belittling him
when he goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   Ray: ``What if I told you you're married to a very brilliant
man?''
</P>
<P>
   Frenchy: ``I'd say I'd have to be a bigamist.''
</P>
<P>
   Frenchy wishes she were married to another man when Ray proposes
his latest brainstorm. He has noticed that a pizza parlor, two
doors down from a bank, is vacant and for lease. Ray wants to rent
the store and tunnel his way to the bank. He needs Frenchy to put
up the seed money and act as a front, selling her much-loved
cookies above ground while Ray and his cronies dig through the
basement.
</P>
<P>
   Even though things don't go quite as planned, Ray and Frenchy
wind up richer than their wildest dreams. (Allen throws us a couple
of delicious plot twists that we won't spoil here.) The problem is,
once they join the nouveau riche, Frenchy wants to transcend her
working-class roots and become sophisticated while Ray just wants
to eat cheeseburgers and watch baseball on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The first half-hour of ``Small Time Crooks'' contains some
terrific sight gags and very funny broad humor, along with
hilarious supporting turns from Jon Lovitz, Tony Darrow and Michael
Rappaport as members of Ray's dimwitted gang. (Rappaport, while
digging, wears his miner's hat backward, defeating its purpose, but
looking ``cool,'' nonetheless.)
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Frenchy's sudden wealth takes the movie into some
familiar, although no less enjoyable territory as Allen drolly
examines the differences between plain and expensive pleasures.
Hugh Grant joins the fun here as another schemer, albeit a
polished, sophisticated cad, who sees an opportunity to capitalize
on Frenchy's desire for a radical cultural makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and Ullman make charming combatants; it's nice to see
Allen playing opposite an actress close to his age for a change.
Elaine May, playing Frenchy's dopey cousin, steals every scene
she's in, delivering witticisms that would dumbfound Yogi Berra.
It's a perfectly modulated comic performance, a delight in a movie
filled with a great many small pleasures.
</P>
<P>

The film: ``Small Time Crooks'' (PG; language). &QL; 
The stars: Woody Allen, Tracey Ullman, Hugh Grant, Elaine May. &QL;

(Eds: UPN fall schedule below) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a homeless person persistently rattling a battered paper
cup containing a few coins at you, UPN reminded everyone it still
exists on Thursday, with an upfront presentation in New York of its
new fall schedule. The big news is the move of ``The Hughleys''
from ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the latest prospectus on the netlet:
</P>
<P>
   -- Strong points: Wrestling, which single-handedly saved the
network. ``Seven Days'' and ``Star Trek: Voyager'' have their
adherents. Monday's African-American comedies have their teeny
niche audience.
</P>
<P>
   -- Weak points: Pretty much everything else. Wrestling hardly
raised the bar for the network in terms of ratings on other
evenings or the perception that UPN stands for anything other than
Utterly Puerile Nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   -- New this fall season: ``The Hughleys'' and ``Girlfriends,''
both comedies. ``Freedom,'' a ``Matrix''-style high-tech thriller
from producer Joel Silver (``Lethal Weapon'') and ``Level 9,''
about an elite unit fighting cyber-crime will fill out the action
slots.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prognosis: The Viacom-CBS merger may have more of an effect
on UPN's future than its programming, which seems to come and go
without much regard from the rest of the world: Now that Paramount
owns the Tiffany Network, why would it want to hold on to the
Spencer Gifts of networks? And why would anyone else want to buy
such a money pit?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the UPN fall lineup: &QL; 
Monday
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m.: ``Moesha''
</P>
<P>
   8:30 p.m.: ``The Parkers''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m.: ``The Hughleys''
</P>
<P>

FOX TURNS TO THE PROS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fox fall schedule below) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fox network, desperate to reverse the ill fortunes of the
current TV season, has turned to heavy-hitting showrunners _
including James Cameron, multiple Emmy winner David E. Kelley,
``X-Files'' mastermind Chris Carter and ``Sex and the City's''
Darren Star _ to entice viewers. The network revealed its fall
schedule Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny's Fox Mulder will be back on the ``X-Files'' for half
of next season's 22 episodes for about $350,000 to $400,000 per
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder is not expected to return to the series until the middle
of next season _ probably during February sweeps _ after being
abducted in this season's final episode, set to air Sunday. Co-star
Gillian Anderson will have a new partner next season to assist in
her search for Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the network's scorecard, along with an analysis of how
the new shows will abet current programming.
</P>
<P>
   Strong points: Fox does OK on Saturdays with ``Cops,'' and
better on Sundays with ``The Simpsons,'' ``Malcolm in the Middle''
and ``The X-Files,'' and Mondays with ``That '70s Show,'' ``Titus''
and ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Weak points: The rest of the week gives the network fits. There
was a compelling reason former Fox head Doug Herzog only lasted a
year: He yanked Chris Carter's ``Harsh Realm'' from the schedule
too quickly, engendering some bad blood with one of the network's
most successful producers, and every show introduced last fall is
but a memory. The midseason successes of ``Malcolm'' and ``Titus''
didn't come soon enough to save his job.
</P>
<P>
   The network lost two of its long-running successes this month _
``Party of Five'' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' _ and came
perilously close to losing ``The X-Files,'' as well. Oh, and
there's the small matter of chickens finally coming home to roost
where the network's cheesy reality programming is concerned with
the embarrassing Rick and Darva show.
</P>
<P>
   New this fall season: David E. Kelley now owns Fox on Mondays,
with his new teacher drama, ``Boston Public,'' opening for ``Ally
McBeal.'' James Cameron's post-apocalyptic,
battling-the-police-state thriller, ``Dark Angel,'' had better own
Tuesdays, as word is that the pilot is, befitting Cameron, the most
expensive in history for a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Ask,'' the ``Odd Couple'' update with John Goodman and
Anthony LaPaglia as housemates, gay and straight respectively, will
air on Wednesdays, followed by a family comedy that will no doubt
test the boundaries of very naughty stand-up comic Robert Schimmel.
Wednesday is also home to ``The $treet,'' a soap about the romantic
and financial chicanery of investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fearsum,'' wired paranormal shenanigans from the folks who
brought you ``The Blair Witch Project,'' and the horror anthology
series ``Night Visions,'' will haunt Friday's time slots.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling changes this fall season: ``That '70s Show'' returns
to Tuesdays _ and how a show that's been moved around this much can
survive is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason replacements: ``The Lone Gunmen,'' Chris Carter's
``X-Files'' spin-off about the loopy conspiracy theorists.
</P>
<P>
   Other programming: Throwaway specials will compete against NBC's
``Must-See Thursday'' (and, nowadays, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'').
</P>
<P>
   Prognosis: Well, it couldn't get any worse. Nights of all-new
programming are always a tough sell, and Fox has two, on Wednesdays
and Fridays. Fox hasn't had much success expanding its sci-fi
programming beyond ``X-Files'' _ and NBC couldn't interest anybody
in its Saturday night ``thrillogy'' _ suggesting that Friday night
may remain a tough sell for Fox; Cameron's contribution will likely
succeed on the strength of the name brand (as long as they don't
let him write too much!).
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Cameron's ambitious and expensive venture,
this seems a much safer production schedule than the wacked-out
adventurousness that Fox is known for (and which last year inspired
its most high-profile flameout, ``Action''). At this point, winning
back viewers is the chief directive; edgy distinctiveness will no
doubt return at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup: &QL; 
!721!Sunday
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m.: ``Futurama''
</P>

   1. THE TEN DOTCOMMANDMENTS, OR THE JOY OF PANDERING, by Michael
Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   What's that feeling? It's nice, but unfamiliar. Oh my gosh, I'm
being pandered to! To what do I owe the honor? Answer: I work on
the Internet. Therefore I am ``providing Americans with more
freedom'' and ``creating new jobs and new opportunities for all
Americans'' and walking on water while turning it into wine and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, don't thank me. That's a job for House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, who last week unveiled his ``eContract 2000'' _ some
flattering blather plus 10 bits of hard-core pandering.

   2. HAS WEB TECHNOLOGY MADE THE PRIVATE EYE OBSOLETE? by Bonnie
Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the last century, I was a licensed private eye. More
Erin Brockovich than Philip Marlowe, I didn't carry a revolver,
follow cheating spouses, or drink Jack Daniels. Still, I was the
real thing, solving cases with brains and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   But recently I wondered what effect the Internet has had on my
old profession. With a plethora of ``research'' Web sites making
the detective's job easier, does it still take a savvy gumshoe to
work a case? Or, can any Tom or Harry be a dick?

   3. CONDOLEEZZA RICE: GEORGE W. BUSH'S CELEBRITY ADVISER, by
David Plotz.
</P>
<P>
   The iron rule of presidential campaigns is that aides should
never overshadow their candidate _ especially when he has a
lightweight reputation. George W. Bush's campaign tries to hide
consigliere Karl Rove. Bush economics adviser Michael Boskin is
nearly invisible. And when was the last time you read a profile of
Paul Wolfowitz, one of Bush's foreign policy honchos?
</P>
<P>
   But the rule does not apply to Condoleezza Rice, W.'s other
foreign policy adviser. While almost no one has heard of Gore's
foreign policy counselor Leon Fuerth, everyone knows Condi.

   4. THE NEW ADULTERY RULES, by William Saletan.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics of adultery used to be straightforward. ``Thou shalt
not commit adultery,'' said the Ten Commandments. Recently,
however, public opinion has grown rather more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   While Gary Hart and Newt Gingrich were ruined by cheating, Bill
Clinton and Rudy Giuliani have gotten away with it. By a margin of
77 percent to 12 percent, New Yorkers say Giuliani's newly
disclosed ``friendship'' with Judith Nathan, a divorced socialite,
``is a private matter and has no effect on how I view Giuliani as a
Senate candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   So is adultery now OK? Not quite. Thanks to the eternal human
craving for scandal and gossip, the old strictures against adultery
haven't disappeared. They have merely evolved into a subtler, more
confused list of commandments.

   5. HELEN THOMAS, THE GRIDIRON CLUB AND THE MOONIES, by Timothy
Noah.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Helen Thomas probably didn't resign from United Press
International, which was just sold to the folks who run the Rev.
Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, for reasons having anything to
do with her earlier blackballing of William Safire from membership
in the prestigious Gridiron Club.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be a Gridiron link. Once a year, we presume,
Thomas is obliged to bring whoever owns UPI at that moment (it's
changed hands a lot in recent years) to the Gridiron dinner. As
Gridiron Queen, she would surely cringe at the thought of sitting
at one of the event's better tables with a bunch of Moonies _ maybe
even the Reverend Moon himself, who might use the occasion coyly to
decline comment, one more time, on whether he is, in fact, the
Messiah.

NO EXCUSE NOT TO REGISTER

By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to have a voice in this year's elections? Aside from
contributing a few million dollars in soft money to the party of
your choice, you need to vote to have a voice. And to vote, you
need to register. And to register, well, the Internet has a way to
make speaking up a bit easier.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, ABCNEWS.com announced that it has cut a deal
with OnlineDemocracy.com to simplify the annoying process of
chasing down a registration card.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is one of the first for OnlineDemocracy.com, the
brainchild of a Florida anti-tax activist named David Biddulph who
hopes to do well by doing good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first step,'' Biddulph said. ``Basically, we're
going to be building empowerment tools for the Internet for
improving the functioning of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Go to ABCNEWS.com's political site (or
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/Da
ilyNews/onlinedemocracy_register.htm) and you can register pretty
painlessly. For Californians, you fill out the registration
information online, then the site (snail)mails it to you on
postcard stock, to be signed, dated and (again, snail)mailed to the
Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of 21 states that won't let you print out the
filled-in card directly from your computer, Biddulph said. Four
other states _ New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wyoming and Wisconsin _
either don't require registration or allow it on the same day as
voting, and therefore don't need the service.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a big deal, but it does reduce the annoyances of
registration slightly. And Biddulph said he has talked with
California Secretary of State Bill Jones about legal and
technological changes that might make registration easier still in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think California is probably the state that's going to help
lead us into digital signatures and so forth,'' Biddulph said. ``I
met with Mr. Jones and I know in his heart he feels we should be
prudently moving forward. I do believe he's very interested in
using the technology of the Net to engage the citizenry and make it
more interactive.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there's a need for such a service. Biddulph said 16
million Americans a year register or re-register. And with election
participation rates plummeting, especially among Net-savvy youths,
a Web-enabled registration process may be the most effective way to
encourage them to get signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The service is free not only to Web users but also Web sites,
either those with co-branding agreements like that of ABCNEWS.com
or simpler affiliates' links, Biddulph said.
</P>
<P>
   His company hopes to make money in a novel way, by charging
politicians for e-mail access to those new registrants from the
site who opt to make their names available. The address information
on the registration can be used to ensure that politicians only
contact those who a) are voting constituents of their district and
b) want to be contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Biddulph said he has other plans to expand the ways e-mail and
the Internet can be used to build citizens' interest in and
connection with the people spending their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, a lot of sites will use this technology to make it
more approachable for people and their government,'' Biddulph said.
``We believe there's a lot of things an ordinary citizen can do to
make an impact.'' &QL; 
---One of the more interesting, if rarefied, publications in the
gaming business is gone, or nearly so. The last issue of PC
Accelerator, complete with a blank, black cover and the simple
words ``it's over,'' is hitting newsstands any minute now.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine tried to be ``the first lifestyle magazine for PC
gamers,'' with heavy emphasis on the high-end games, graphics
accelerators and computers of hard-core players, along with a
gratuitous smattering of photos of underdressed, overbuilt starlets
and occasional advice on the rest of the gamer's life.
</P>
<P>
   But after 22 issues, publisher Imagine Media is folding PCXL's
operations, and subscriptions, into PC Gamer magazine, and into a
new channel on Imagine's DailyRadar.com Web site. The magazine's
executive editor, Rob Smith, also will take over as editor in chief
of PC Gamer.
</P>
<P>
   At least the dead-tree publication is going out with style.
Among other dimming-of-the-day features is one about what they'd do
if they ran the gaming industry. Now there's a notion. &QL; 
---In the lead-up to last week's big E3 gaming convention, I
neglected to actually write about games that are already available.
Herewith:
</P>
<P>
   Thief 2: The Metal Age (Eidos Interactive) is an excellent
sequel to the sneaky 1998 smash hit, Thief. Once again, discretion
is the better part of valor (and gameplay) in an excellent, though
graphically aging, followup to one of the best PC adventure titles
of recent memory. Better swipe it fast (but leave some ducats at
the counter, please).
</P>
<P>
   Star Trek Armada (Activision) is a quite good Star Trek game, a
phrase that is not, despite nearly all previous evidence, an
oxymoron. The gameplay is pretty straightforward for a real-time
strategy title, with the standard gather-build-fight structure you
expect. But its deep-space setting looks terrific; it features
excellent balance between the well-differentiated races; and it is
actually, yes, a quite good Star Trek game. Be a Borg and
assimilate this one.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of games we like, during E3, the Academy of
Interactive Arts and Sciences recognized the best titles of last
year. The big winners, maestro:
</P>
<P>
   Game of the Year: The Sims, a simulation of you and me.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Game of the Year: Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings,
a simulation of life in ancient and medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   Console Game of the Year: Soul Calibur, the gorgeous fighting
game for Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Online Game of the Year: EverQuest, the fantasy role-playing
game dubbed ``EverCrack'' for its addictive qualities.
</P>
<P>
   And though it didn't win one of the big four, Final Fantasy
VIII, another great role-playing game that approaches movie
quality, took home three awards, as did The Sims and Age of
Empires. &QL;

A MOVING TRIBUTE TO THE OTHER HANK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 4 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was ever anything bad to say about Hank Greenberg, you
wouldn't know it from Aviva Kempner's worshipful documentary ``The
Life and Times of Hank Greenberg.'' More to the point, you wouldn't
want to. The sheer inspirational gratification of the baseball
legend, here enhanced by Kempner's witty, insightful and thoroughly
gripping storytelling abilities, makes this the greatest
unadulterated movie pleasure of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't know, Greenberg was the sport's first Jewish
superstar. A New Yorker who spent most of his playing career with
the Detroit Tigers, Greenberg led the team to the top of its league
through much of the 1930s and nearly matched Babe Ruth's home run
record in the process. Just as importantly, the easygoing but
stubbornly proud first baseman represented an American ideal to
generations of Jews, many of whom saw their own love of baseball
reflected in his achievements, and a validation of the very symbol
of their belonging to a society that often went to great lengths to
exclude them.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy, of course. Depression-era Detroit, the home of
conspiracy-monger Henry Ford and the virulently intolerant Father
Coughlin, was the nation's nerve center of anti-Semitism at the
time. Greenberg was not only blanketed with ethnic slurs from
competing team players, but from local hecklers in the Tiger
Stadium bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Never one for complaints or self-pity, Greenberg concentrated
with herculean effort on improving his game. It worked, along with
a certain genius for winning hearts and minds over. The Greenberg
story is full of breathtaking convergences of social history,
sports milestones and _ dare we say it _ magnificent examples of
people rising to meet their better natures.
</P>
<P>
   Kempner wisely structures the piece chronologically, in a way
that builds the tension of each season and even key games. And
while the film is undeniably hagiography at its best (if most
blatant), she is anything but solemn about the proceedings. Glowing
commentary from family members and such lifelong celebrity fans as
Walter Matthau, Alan Dershowitz and Ira Berkow are mixed with
humorous asides from cranky retired teammates and what was
apparently a female stalker, now a sweet old granny still
infatuated with her hero.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a wealth of documentary footage, wild clips
and Hollywood movie scenes that help set the tenor of the times.
The result is pure cinematic euphoria. If ``The Life and Times of
Hank Greenberg'' doesn't move you to tears of joy, you're a rock. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The film: ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' (Not rated). &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Written, directed and produced by Aviva Kempner.
Released by Cowboy Booking International. &QL;

   What's that feeling? It's nice, but unfamiliar. Oh my gosh, I'm
being pandered to! To what do I owe the honor? Answer: I work on
the Internet. Therefore I am ``providing Americans with more
freedom'' and ``creating new jobs and new opportunities for all
Americans'' and walking on water while turning it into wine and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, don't thank me. That's a job for House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, who last week unveiled his ``eContract 2000'' _ some
flattering blather plus 10 bits of hard-core pandering.

   Back in the last century, I was a licensed private eye. More
Erin Brockovich than Philip Marlowe, I didn't carry a revolver,
follow cheating spouses, or drink Jack Daniels. Still, I was the
real thing, solving cases with brains and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   But recently I wondered what effect the Internet has had on my
old profession. With a plethora of ``research'' Web sites making
the detective's job easier, does it still take a savvy gumshoe to
work a case? Or, can any Tom or Harry be a dick?

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Growing Up Brady'' is laudable for what it isn't and for what
it doesn't do, particularly when you compare it to recent
docudramas about the dysfunctional ``Partridge Family'' cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brady'' isn't a pathetic piece of self-aggrandizement by a
washed-up performer desperate to prove fans still love him. It
doesn't try to settle old scores by embarrassing cast mates or
family members who gave the actor behind the project what was
perceived as a tough time way back when, yet it doesn't offer a
wholly whitewashed portrait of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's an affectionate, not particularly judgmental look
back at an oddball time when much of America lost their senses,
particularly when it came to watching a wan situation comedy about
an impossibly squeaky-clean family. People say that our affection
for the Bradys stems from the fact that we long for their
innocence. However, I suspect the reason the series still resonates
and that the film parodies of the '90s were successful is because,
for a vast majority of the first generation that grew up watching
TV, seeing ``The Brady Bunch'' _ as kids and then as teens _ led to
our first realization that the media condescends and even lies to
viewers, a far grimmer but no less important lesson. So the Bradys
were educational, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Barry Williams' good-humored, unpretentious memoirs of
the Brady experience, ``Growing Up Brady'' has a hokey framing
device, but of course, it couldn't be any hokier than the show it
essays. The real Williams returns to the Paramount lot to have
lunch with old pal (and series creator) Sherwood Schwartz, gets a
lot of questions about whether he and Maureen McCormick _
best-known to the rest of us as Marcia, Marcia, Marcia _ ever got
it on. Standing on an empty soundstage, he delves into reverie
(and, most importantly, answers that question).
</P>
<P>
   Williams (played by Adam Brody in the body of the film) isn't
really the central character in his own story. He shares the stage
with his co-stars, particularly Robert Reed (Daniel Hugh Kelly, a
middling look-alike but a serviceable impersonation), who
vitriolically battled creator Sherwood Schwartz (Michael Tucker,
who plays his character with the same blinkered bonhomie with which
he hosts Pax's unwatchable ``Chicken Soup for the Soul'') over the
show's (using the term advisedly) ``creative content.'' In
Williams' point of view, both men were right: Reed was right to
argue that the show was junk, but given its success, Schwartz had
clearly hit upon something that didn't need tampering with. Reed's
homosexuality is discreetly mentioned and, as it should be,
shrugged off.
</P>
<P>
   He brings Florence Henderson (Rebeccah Bush) front-and-center
for a scene in which the teen-age Williams has a chaste but
nonetheless eyebrow-raising ``date'' with his TV mom (in Williams'
book, Henderson was a good deal more earthy and profane than
depicted here). He depicts the efforts of Christopher Knight aka
Peter (Ricky Ullman) and Eve Plumb, better-known as Jan (Kaitlin
Cullum), to venture into a relationship (this, too, is
significantly tidied up from the book's version of the story).
Hormones were everywhere on the set: Even Michael Lookinland
(played by the original actor's son Scott, and therefore the only
dead-ringer in the crowd) and Susan Olsen (Carly Schroeder), who
played Bobby and Cindy, respectively, ventured some experimental
pecks.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are Williams' own romantic travails with
McCormick (Kaley Cuoco). There's an amusing scene early on when he
tries to impress her by smoking; she literally blows rings around
him. Later, when Maureen comes to frolic in the Williams family
swimming pool (images of which will soon, inevitably, be
downloadable from numerous Web sites devoted to Cuoco), turns
wildly amusing as poor Barry must conceal his arousal when his
parents call the two into the living room. (Interestingly, Williams
was offended by the Marcia/Greg romance subplot in the theatrical
release ``A Very Brady Sequel,'' even though it was simply riffing
on his and McCormick's real-life tryst; the film is mild compared
to what's suggested here.)
</P>
<P>
   The cast here doesn't nail the Brady mannerisms in the hilarious
manner that the performers in the movies and the stage play in
Westwood managed; they're sort of the road-show, dinner-theater
Bradys. And the humor rarely rises above the anemically amiable
level of the series (if not the even lamer spin-offs). Still, given
how obsessed many fans of the series are, they'll likely find this
a good- natured kiss-and-tell that manages to make everyone look
good.

`CHEATERS' PROSPERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Sat., May 20) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cheaters'' may be the most honest TV movie ever to come out of
Hollywood. In a land of sliding-scale equity where convenient
connections more often serve as hard currency than actual ability,
where virtually every actor _ and now, even writers and executives
_ lies about his or her age (and experience), where David Geffen is
just the latest mogul to merit a stout biography detailing his
every unethical behavior with an obsessiveness than can only mask
admiration, ``Cheaters'' may emerge as Hollywood's ultimate how-to
film.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about Hollywood, of course, not on the surface; it
actually offers a provocative, even subversive take on a 1995
scandal at a Chicago high school, painting it, not unfairly, as a
skirmish in the class warfare battles (one character calls it,
``the ultimate Affirmative Action'').
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Daniels stars as Dr. Gerald Plecki, a beleaguered
public-school teacher who can't even rally his lethargic charges to
get worked up about Satan's stirring paean to rebellion in
``Paradise Lost.'' He also heads up the school's equally
beleaguered academic decathlon team, which is routinely hammered in
competition by the students of a more privileged school. A copy of
the upcoming test lands by coincidence in his lap and, convinced
that he's merely leveling the playing field against a bunch of
prissy, moneyed mama's boys and girls, he passes it on to his team
_ if they're interested. They are. Can they keep quiet? They can't.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, Hollywood's go-to guy when you're casting a likable,
low-key Everyman, exudes the sort of weariness a middle-aged
teacher who lives at home with his mother must experience, along
with a sort of half-Herculean effort to conceal his beaten status
from his students. He delivers his monologues condemning the social
systems that tacitly encourage dishonesty just right _ not too much
bluster, not too much soaring rhetoric, just with a vaguely
impotent frustration that circumstances have reduced him to this
level.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Cheaters'' really has no patience for are the high-minded
hypocrites who pay lip service to honesty while sticking it to the
system in their own fashion. It casts Robert Joy, adept at playing
oily, sniveling sorts, as the snooty coach of the upscale school,
and notes, with ironic satisfaction, that a highly placed executive
in Chicago's school system, after decrying Plecki's behavior, was
later found guilty of tax evasion. It also notes that 80 percent of
all high schoolers have copped to cheating, and that half of them
don't consider it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And as if the hallowed calling of journalism needed yet another
black eye, the movie thoughtfully takes an hilariously gratuitous
swing in the closing title cards: The underachieving guy who
weaseled on Plecki's team _ also among his sins is a predilection
for comic books and goofy, fashion-victim-looking hair _ plans to
become a reporter. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Cheaters.'' &QL; 
What: Docudrama about a controversial Chicago high school cheating
scandal. &QL; 
The stars: Jeff Daniels, Jena Malone, Paul Sorvino. &QL; 
Where: HBO &QL; 
When: 9 tonight; also May 23, 28, 31 and June 5, 8, 13. &QL;

   GUGGENHEIM-1900 (New York) _ The Guggenheim's ``1900: Art at the
Crossroads'' is a wacky exercise in historical simulation, the
excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so
many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you
consider eBay a place. But the show no doubt will be as popular in
New York as it was in London. There is no underestimating the
public's taste for kitsch. By Michael Kimmelman.

   LANGUAGE-IMMERSION (Undated) _ Five years ago, at a stationery
store on the Left Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished
in my pants pocket for some francs and walked toward the counter, a
smile of fear frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out
this sentence to the old woman at the counter: ``Je voudrais
acheter le magasin, s'il vous plait.'' The common word for magazine
is magazine (mah-gah-ZEEN), not magasin (mah-gah-ZAA). I had asked
to buy the shop. And so it went. For 10 days in Paris I was a
helpless prisoner of my past: four years of undistinguished high
school French and one semester at college. I could make my way
through a French newspaper, but conversation was out of the
question. Until now. No longer the 98-pound-weakling of
bilingualism, I have persuaded myself that it is possible to
function confidently, perhaps even thrive, in another culture. I am
a graduate of language immersion. By Charles Strum.

while playing himself on the animated comedy ``Futurama,'' set in
the year 3000. In Sunday's time-traveling season finale, the hero,
a pizza delivery guy named Fry, has stumbled back to his original
home in 1999, distorting history, creating a rip in the space-time
continuum and making a final big bang imminent. Gore is trying to

   &UR; BY BONNIE GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in the last century, I was a licensed private eye. More
Erin Brockovich than Philip Marlowe, I didn't carry a revolver,
follow cheating spouses, or drink Jack Daniels. Still, I was the
real thing, solving cases with brains and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   But recently I wondered what effect the Internet has had on my
old profession. With a plethora of ``research'' Web sites making
the detective's job easier, does it still take a savvy gumshoe to
work a case? Or, can any Tom or Harry be a dick?
</P>
<P>
   I fell into sleuthing after dropping out of college in the late
'60s. I started by working toll fraud for the phone company,
chasing down phony calling card charges billed to numbers
teen-agers got out of High Times magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a natural aptitude, I soon ran a thriving detective
business in the morally heedless climate of Southern California. My
specialty was ``skiptracing'' _ hunting down deadbeats who bought
cars with falsified loan applications. My targets ran the gamut:
hippies ``getting over'' with a free ride, pyramid salesmen one
step ahead of the sheriff, and hardcore con men with six months'
head start driving the bank's Cadillac Seville.
</P>
<P>
   I became a master at sniffing out leads. Ex-girlfriends, former
co-workers, landlords and neighbors all had clues. Easily 15
percent of my skips were found after a chat with their moms. Most
mothers happily gave their wayward sons' new phone numbers to a
sweet, polite-sounding girl who might be an old friend or a new
love. I once called a skip at a pay telephone he'd used to call
home collect. He regularly used that same phone booth and
unsuspectingly picked up when I rang. Unnerved at getting caught,
he personally delivered the hot Lincoln to the bank's front door.
</P>
<P>
   I kept a notebook of useful phone numbers and jargon to navigate
``the system.'' Sounding conversant and acting entitled, I asked
about their days as beleaguered key-punchers and overworked
switchboard operators read me data from unemployment claim forms,
utility bills and drivers' records. I spent a couple of weeks
following each skip's trail and charged my clients as much as $500
per car. A client once paid me $2,000 for finding a stolen yacht
anchored in the Dutch Antilles.
</P>
<P>
   Next, growing bored at high-end bill collecting, I turned my
detecting skills to complex legal cases. As with skiptracing,
getting information took imagination, shoe leather and luck.
</P>
<P>
   Long before detectives were hired to do opposition research for
their political clients, a mayor employed me to investigate public
charges that he had been shaking down municipal workers. Had they
been muscled to donate ``gifts'' for His Honor's birthday party? To
assess my client's political vulnerability, I befriended City Hall
secretaries, building-permit clerks and parking commissioners.
Grateful for cushy jobs, they'd all written generous birthday
checks. After my report, the mayor returned their money.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a corporate client believed his competitor had
rigged the bid on a state Medicaid contract. To test his
hypothesis, I read every proposal and solicitation document related
to the multimillion-dollar award. State employees who evaluated
bids, supervised contracts, or were ``non-essential'' to the
contract, were all contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Using all my sweet-talking skills, I enlisted the opposition's
employees and called officials in states where they competed for
other contracts. I became pals with folks at the attorney general's
office, who soon joined the search for suspicious patterns and odd
relationships. Enough hanky-panky finally turned up to invalidate
the rival's bid. The client's cost for my time, copying, travel,
and other expenses came to well over $30,000. If you did the same
job today with old-time methods, it would cost more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   So, has the Internet reduced Philip Marlowe's job to a series of
clicks on a home computer?
</P>
<P>
   Take my old job of skiptracing. It's no longer hard work
tracking down a fugitive's ex-neighbors to ask about his sudden
departure. Recently, working as a reporter, I used the Internet to
collect tenants' names and phone numbers for an entire New York
high-rise by clicking on the reverse field of www.555-1212.com/, a
White Pages Web page. The Web probably cuts 10 percent off the time
to locate a deadbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Online databases give detectives (amateur and otherwise) cheap
access to everything from campaign contributor lists at FECInfo to
the Swiss Bankers Association's list of dormant accounts. Looking
for background on every licensed U.S. physician? Perhaps you're
interested in workers' compensation claims or the ``accident scene
documentation'' from police files. If you're willing to spend $4 to
$50 per report, the info is yours.
</P>
<P>
   The data on these Web sites comes mostly from the same source:
you. Every time you fill out a warranty card, redeem a rebate
offer, or enter a contest, some information consolidator might be
entering your job, income, and unlisted phone number into a
searchable database.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are in on it, too. Arrest records, property taxes,
and drivers' histories are input along with the coupon collector
data. Sites such as TR Information Services sell employment
histories ($100) and long-distance call printouts ($90).
</P>
<P>
   Though many sites restrict use to subscribers with a legitimate
business purpose _ landlords, lawyers, journalists, guard
businesses and, of course, private investigators _ the armchair
dick needn't be locked out. Want to call yourself a detective? Get
a diploma through the Spy Tech Agency correspondence course for
around $150.
</P>
<P>
   Such data-rich Web addresses seem to make full-service snooping
the latest intermediary casualty. If the job is finding somebody's
long-lost friend or enemy, the Web has pretty much put the
professional bloodhound out of business. But I wondered about more
complex cases. With ready access to so much data, is there still a
job for a sweet-talking sleuth?
</P>
<P>
   After looking at a few electronic reference sites, such as DBT
Online Inc., Data-Trac Online (``a fully integrated on-line
investigation service''), and ChoicePoint Inc. (which even the FBI
uses), I borrowed a private eye friend's AutoTrackXP subscription,
which costs him $25 a month, to mount my own cyberinvestigation.
</P>
<P>
   First, I typed in ``George W. Bush,'' pretending he was my
client.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many George W. Bushes summoned forth, only one was the
same age as the Texas governor. The database had ``found'' the
right guy. In a double-click, the search service supplied me Bush's
Social Security number. But, I also learned that a 52-year-old
Houston woman has been using the same identifier. Was the governor
sharing his unique identification number with the Houston woman?
Was she impersonating him? The report gave no explanation for the
duplicate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring she was a random data blip, I eliminated the woman from
my search and ordered AutoTrackXP's $21 widest-net search choice _
called ``National Comprehensive'' _ and a few other options
including one called ``SEC Insider Trading'' on the presidential
candidate. It would have taken Marlowe weeks of legwork from
mountains of records to build the AutoTrackXP dossiers I clicked
out in less than an hour for a cost of about $125. A pre-Web-era
sleuth might have charged $5,000 to search the same archives
manually.
</P>
<P>
   My 23-page printout included the names of the former occupants
of his residence (including ex-Gov. Ann Richards), the date he
married Laura Welch, that he registered to vote in Dallas on Nov.
12, 1988, that his accountant apparently shares his post office
box, and descriptions of vehicles registered to the same box
number.
</P>
<P>
   The report listed ``business affiliations'' but no mention of
the Texas Rangers baseball team in which Bush once prominently
owned an interest. The Web resource also detailed some stock trades
from the days he was director of three publicly traded companies,
yet the ``comprehensive`` database missed a 1990 Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation of one of the stock transactions,
even though the probe was reported last year in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   To judge the precision of AutoTrackXP's info dump, I targeted a
similar search at _ me! The 20-page report included my husband's
driver's license number (and an option to search for more info
about it), my daughter's college address, and detailed data pulled
from motor vehicle departments, recorders of deeds, voter
registrations, marriage license bureaus, vessel registrations,
professional licensing bodies, and court proceedings. It even gave
the address of an apartment I lived in 25 years ago. All accurate.
</P>
<P>
   But, along with the facts was a lot of what Marlowe and I called
false leads. Data entry mistakes and omissions caused my file to be
riddled with irrelevant and misleading details.
</P>
<P>
   Data needs context. If all the world's documents were accessible
by search engine, a pro would still have to sort them out. On my
Medicaid case, those bid documents I read held many details but, to
make them useful, I wheedled the remaining puzzle pieces from the
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a useful tool, but Marlowe's job is safe. The wealth
of cyberdata doesn't tell me why George W. Bush shares a post
office box with his accountant or whether the first time he
registered to vote was really the week his father was elected
president. Luckily for Marlowe, half of what a detective looks for
isn't written down.

<P>
   The iron rule of presidential campaigns is that aides should
never overshadow their candidate _ especially when he has a
lightweight reputation. George W. Bush's campaign tries to hide
consigliere Karl Rove. Bush economics adviser Michael Boskin is
nearly invisible. And when was the last time you read a profile of
Paul Wolfowitz, one of Bush's foreign policy honchos?
</P>
<P>
   But the rule does not apply to Condoleezza Rice, W.'s other
foreign policy adviser. While almost no one has heard of Gore's
foreign policy counselor Leon Fuerth, everyone knows Condi. When Al
Gore delivered a major foreign policy speech earlier this month,
Bush didn't answer it himself. He dispatched Rice. Her picture, not
Bush's, appeared opposite Gore in The New York Times. Columnists
gush over her. Newspapers and network news programs profile her.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is allowed to overshadow Bush because she is exotic: a
black, female, conservative foreign policy expert. She stands out
in Bush's army of white men, proves that his campaign is not just
about good ol' boys.
</P>
<P>
   But her celebrity obscures how unexceptional she is. Her ideas,
work, and style place her in the absolute mainstream of Republican
thought. She is Brent Scowcroft in the body of a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters portray Rice's ascent as more unlikely than it is,
noting that she grew up in Jim Crow Alabama and lost a childhood
friend in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing. But Rice's family
belonged to Birmingham's bourgeois elite. Her Republican father was
a university administrator, and her mother taught music and
science. It was understood that she would pursue a high-powered
career.
</P>
<P>
   Rice aspired to be a concert pianist, but at the University of
Denver she found herself enthralled by an international relations
class taught by Josef Korbel, Madeleine Albright's father. This led
Rice into Soviet studies, where she pursued a doctorate and
specialized in military affairs. Early on she decided that national
interest and the balance of power, not humanitarian principles,
should determine U.S. policy. In 1981, at the age of 26, she landed
a professorship at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1985 conference, Rice bowled over Republican foreign policy
eminence Brent Scowcroft with her tough questions and confident
manner. He became the first in a series of foreign policy mentors:
George Shultz and President George Bush would follow. In 1989,
National Security Adviser Scowcroft hired her as his Soviet
analyst. She served three years, abetting the Soviet Union's end
and Germany's reunification, meeting Mikhail Gorbachev, and
impressing her bosses with her keen pragmatism and collegial
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   After the National Security Council, she returned to Stanford
and became its provost, the youngest person ever to hold the job,
as well as the first woman and the first African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President George Bush brought Rice and George W.
together at his Maine vacation home. They hit it off. She soon
resigned as provost and became Governor Bush's chief foreign policy
adviser. Rice supervises Bush's foreign policy cabal, which
includes Wolfowitz, Robert Zoellick and Richard Perle. (Even Gore
advisers concede she has assembled ``a pretty good team.'') Rice
polishes Bush's speeches, advises him on policy specifics, serves
as his sounding board.
</P>
<P>
   Rice rejects the notion that she is the brains behind Bush's
foreign policy. She says that Bush has ``good instincts'' about the
subject, and she argues that even experts would have flunked the
international relations pop quizzes he tanked in the fall. Still,
it's easy to see her fingerprints on his statements. She wrote an
article for the January/February Foreign Affairs outlining many of
Bush's themes. Blasting the Clinton administration for its bobbing,
purposeless foreign policy, she insisted that America pursue its
``national interest'' rather than squishy notions of
humanitarianism and international law.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should treat China and Russia as competitors
rather than partners, strengthen the military but use it less, and
firm our ties to regional allies such as Korea and Japan, she
wrote. We should avoid humanitarian interventions unless _ and this
is a big wiggle _ there is good reason for them. We should push
free trade and economic liberalization everywhere _ especially
China _ because this invariably leads to political liberalization.
We should deploy a national missile defense and scrap treaties,
such as the ABM treaty, that impede the national interest. Above
all, the United States must be more ``resolute'' and certain in its
aims.
</P>
<P>
   Her philosophy is not the cold warrior ethos she was raised on.
According to friend and NSC colleague Philip Zelikow, who
co-authored a book on German reunification with Rice, the end of
the Cold War helped open her thinking. Like many analysts of her
generation, she focuses more on economics, conceives of the world
in multipolar rather than bipolar terms, frets more about rogue
states, and hews less to ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who favor a values-laden foreign policy criticize
Rice for her willingness to work with undemocratic regimes, notably
China. Republican isolationists suspect she is too willing to send
American troops overseas. In short, she occupies the solid middle
of the Republican foreign policy spectrum. (Rice's and Bush's views
differ surprisingly little from Gore's. All support the Kosovo
intervention, trade with China, engagement with Russia, and the
primacy of Israel's security in the Middle East.)
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about Rice's work for Bush is not her
advice _ he could hear much the same thing from Perle or Richard
Cheney or others _ but her friendship. She really likes Bush, and
he seems to reciprocate. They share deep religious faith _ both are
evangelical Protestants. Both are sports fans and exercise
fanatics: During one early meeting, Bush consulted with Rice while
she ran on a treadmill. Both are loose and funny but capable of
hardheaded pragmatism when it's required. ``We have very similar
personalities,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rice admirers tout her for secretary of defense in a Bush
administration, others for secretary of state. But many peg her as
national security adviser. That, after all, is the foreign
policymaker who works most directly with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would be at the center and close to Bush,'' says a friend
of hers. ``Bush would feel more comfortable in the White House with
her around.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's that feeling? It's nice, but unfamiliar. Oh my gosh, I'm
being pandered to!
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, I've been cajoled, flattered and importuned
(not to mention insulted, ignored, bored and patronized) by
politicians. But getting pandered is a whole new experience. The
main difference is that political pandering goes beyond ego massage
to give you something you really want, usually money.
</P>
<P>
   To what do I owe the honor? Answer: I work on the Internet.
Therefore I am ``providing Americans with more freedom'' and
``creating new jobs and new opportunities for all Americans'' and
walking on water while turning it into wine and so on.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, don't thank me. That's a job for House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, who last week unveiled his ``eContract 2000'' _ some
flattering blather plus 10 bits of hard-core pandering. The
eContract is, of course, an hommage to the Contract With America
that God gave to Newt Gingrich in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Crude materialists might suppose this is just about campaign
fund-raising. But it is not. Politicians of both parties sense the
spotlight focusing elsewhere and, like old vaudevillians, are
trying to sing and dance their way back in.
</P>
<P>
   They start by humbly proclaiming their own tiny irrelevance to
this huge force transforming our blah, blah, blah, and then they
proceed to wrack their brains for legislation that will make them
relevant.
</P>
<P>
   The denizens of e-world tend to agree about our own importance
and the irrelevance of politics and government, but we are not
above accepting or even soliciting a pander now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's ``eContract'' naturally promises to ban (for five years)
all state and local taxes on Internet transactions. ``Big
government bureaucrats see (Internet shopping) as another
opportunity to levy a tax,'' the document explains. Since there is
no plausible argument why a purchase should be exempt from sales
tax just because it is over the Internet, the eContract makes none.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it explain why Republicans _ who haven't yet called for
the nation's nuclear arsenal to be turned over to the states, but
almost _ think state sales taxes, of all things, are a matter about
which Washington should get to decide. Or why state legislators are
``big government bureaucrats'' who must be crushed by the feds in
this case, but wise Solons who will save us from federal
overreaching on every other issue.
</P>
<P>
   Or why, if ``We assert that freedom is the answer, not
government intervention,'' the government should intervene to give
retailers on the Internet an artificial price advantage over
retailers with stores you can walk into. Or why, if the Internet is
so miraculous and powerful, it should need this kind of unfair
advantage. (Or why freedom will stop being the answer in five
years.)
</P>
<P>
   Here we have a pander of laboratory purity. There is no other
reason for it. Its biggest beneficiaries won't even ask for it. At
an MSNBC ``Silicon Valley Technology Summit'' in February, Jeff
Bezos of Amazon, Meg Whitman of eBay and Jerry Yang of Yahoo!,
among other e-commerce heavyweights, all told Tom Brokaw they're
prepared to pay sales taxes like everyone else, though some clung
to the five-year moratorium fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Not every pander is so pure. But most proposals for the
government to help the Internet enjoy the same self-contradiction:
The Internet is the most powerful social force to come along for a
millennium or so, and yet it is so weak and feverish that Dr. Pol
is needed to write a bunch of prescriptions and hope the patient
will pull through.
</P>
<P>
   Rhetorically, Armey's eContract is all about getting the
government out of the way. But at least half of his Ten
Dotcommandments actually are forms of government activism.
</P>
<P>
   That alone doesn't make them unwise. Of all 10, some are wise,
some are not, and some are carefully worded to be meaningless.
(Dick Armey is against ``excessive regulations.'' You?) Together,
these political promises demonstrate the foolishness, if not the
dishonesty, of the cheap anti-government rhetoric that accompanies
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preventing frivolous lawsuits'' means having the federal
government crush the traditional freedom of states to make and
administer their own tort laws. ``Protecting intellectual property
rights'' means taking away people's freedom to make and sell copies
of software or music or e-books if someone else happens to own the
rights. Sensible limits (and national standards) on lawsuits is a
good idea, and copyright protection is essential. But both involve
the exercise of federal power to limit individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Not clear what's involved in ``modernizing our education
system'' (another traditional state matter) or ``expanding digital
opportunities'' or ``promoting workplace flexibility'' or
``promoting basic research.'' No doubt nothing as straightforward
as federal spending or regulation. I smell a lot of tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   But a tax credit skews private incentives and loses the Treasury
money just like direct spending. And ``promoting'' something may be
different from requiring it, but it is still government
interference that is supposed to improve the purely private sector
result.
</P>
<P>
   But these are all quibbles. Speaking, if I may, for all
cyberworkers and cyberbosses, we could always use another tax
credit or three, even though we hate government and politicians as
much as the next guys (biotech). Internet to Congress: Pander away.

<P>
   LOVE CREEK RANCH, Texas _ Baxter Adams, an ex-oil field
geologist and a former cattle rancher, proudly points out several
species of native plants and trees growing between a rugged
limestone canyon wall and a small creek that is as lovely as its
name suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grand environment for plants to hide in,'' said
Adams, who rapidly evolved into an apple and maple tree grower
after he and his wife, Carol, purchased a 1,863-acre ranch near
Lost Maples State Natural Area two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steep canyons protect them from the weather, and there's
constant cold spring water,'' Adams said as he walked along the
clear waters of Love Creek Ranch, which has been compared favorably
by scientists to the popular state park a few miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a great microcosm of the Hill Country,'' said Robert
Potts, director of the Nature Conservancy of Texas, referring to
the rolling and sparsely populated country to the west of Austin
and San Antonio. ``The biology of this place is very much like the
biology of Lost Maples. Our botanists say they're kind of sister
canyons.''
</P>
<P>
   All but about 400 acres of the ranch were purchased recently by
the San Antonio-based conservation group, which plans to use the
property to raise money, educate the public and demonstrate
ecologically sensitive land-use practices in hopes of saving some
of the diminishing Texas Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Barwick, a land protection specialist for the nonprofit
organization, would not disclose the price at the request of the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land was purchased at a bargain price,'' he said. ``There
was a substantial gift from Carol and Baxter Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal completes the group's year-old mission of acquiring a
large piece of property near San Antonio with significant water
resources and a diversity of Texas flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our flagship preserve in the southern Hill Country,''
Barwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Love Creek Ranch includes almost the entire headwaters of Love
Creek and more than 2 miles of creek frontage. It also includes
habitat for three endangered species: the golden-cheeked warbler,
black-capped vireo and Tobusch fishhook cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Adams turned his attention away from the vegetation and to the
canyon wall itself, where a rusty-looking brown belt separates two
layers of rock. ``That little line right there is where it
breaks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams explains that the line represents the point of contact
between two rock formations, the Edwards and the Glenrose, which
formed separately tens of millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The upper stratum of limestone, the Edwards, is jumbled and
appears as if it were born out of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something major happened,'' said Adams, noting that the rock
was formed in tropical waters as one of the Earth's tectonic plates
moved north across the equator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful rock. I've always loved the Edwards,'' Adams
said. ``And, of course, it's one of the great aquifers of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The smooth Glenrose rock below blocks percolation of rainwater
through the Edwards. The water instead escapes into Love Creek
through numerous seeps and springs, which keep the bottom of the
canyon at least a little wet year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The creek feeds into the Medina River, which recharges the
Edwards Aquifer. That's one reason the Nature Conservancy of Texas
was attracted to the property.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that a number of native plants, including some rare
ones, can be found on the ranch only because it has not been grazed
by livestock since Adams abandoned an early attempt to introduce a
handful of heifers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rock garden when we bought it,'' said Adams, adding
that his cows nearly starved because the land had been worked too
hard for far too long. ``There just wasn't any grass on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most of the country out here it was just horrendously
overgrazed,'' he said. ``There had never been any rotation of
pastures. They started off, I'm sure, with cows and pigs and horses
and they ended up with sheep and goats.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Griffin, resource conservationist for the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, agreed that some ranchers in the region have
mistreated their land by allowing it to be overgrazed even though
it ultimately reduces their property's production and value.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said people who want to live in the country but who have
little interest in farming or raising animals are purchasing many
ranches in Bandera County. In some cases, that could help land
recover to its more natural state.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, I think things are probably changing somewhat
for the better here in this part of the Edwards Plateau,'' said
Griffin, cautioning that large, well-managed ranches are also being
subdivided into suburban ``ranchettes'' that could damage the
area's ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Sansom, executive director of the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, said ranchers and farmers are some of the best
stewards of the environment, but that many well cared for
properties are now falling into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million and a half acres of Texas farm and ranch land
disappears every year to sprawl and to inheritance taxes and other
things that cause family lands to fragment,'' Sansom said. ``The
important thing right now is to preserve some of these large
ecologically important tracts while they're still there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he would have liked to have seen Love Creek be made
into a state park.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's a lot more difficult,'' he said. ``The Nature
Conservancy is much quicker on its feet and able to do things
without so many people's approval. It would have taken forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranks 49th in per-capita spending on state parks. An
estimated 97 percent of all land in the state is privately owned,
and the Legislature doesn't provide any money to acquire public
parkland.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom said the result is that the people will never see some of
the best and most environmentally important places in Texas because
they are being altered beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can take you to some places that are no longer there because
of that,'' he said.

CULLING TROPHIES OF THE BOOM YEARS OF SAUL AND GAYFRYD STEINBERG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enough years have passed since the roaring 1980s that it's
probably time for a television miniseries on the decade. What would
furnish the sets better than the antiques in the collection of the
swashbuckling tycoon Saul Steinberg and his wife, Gayfryd, who are
selling most of their decorative arts collection at Sotheby's on
May 26th.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently the collection was in the Steinbergs'
37-room Park Avenue triplex, possibly the largest apartment in New
York, which they recently sold for about $35 million to Stephen
Schwarzman, president of Blackstone Group, the investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg acquired the triplex, built for John D. Rockefeller
Jr., in the 1970s for $275,000, Steinberg said. ``New York was in
trouble then,'' she said, ``and no one wanted to pay the
maintenance.'' The couple, working with the decorators Tom Collum
and Mark Hampton, spent the 1980s and '90s filling it with English
furniture, European artworks, silver and porcelain. The 293 lots in
the sale are expected to bring $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, looking for a brownstone, are not selling
everything, Steinberg said. ``We are keeping things that work on a
smaller scale,'' she said, including the furniture, Goya drawings
and objets d'art from what she calls ``Saul's John Soane-looking
library.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the British Neo-Classical architect John Soane, the
black library was decorated, Steinberg explained, ``with elements
from the Grand Tour, such as casts of Roman temples, rondels with
Roman gods, bas reliefs with ancient figures in procession, as well
as some 200 drawings and 250 cartons' worth of antique books.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Steinbergs are selling are the grand, overscaled pieces
that she calls ``palace furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gutsy space that called for gutsy furniture,'' she
said. ``The space demanded it. The apartment was splendid in scale,
and after Mark Hampton's work there, it looked like it should: a
very grand place so Saul's Old Master pictures could be hung
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steinbergs had different collecting interests. ``I loved
English furniture, French chairs and Chinese export porcelain,''
Steinberg said. ``Saul loved his pictures. He bought them without
knowing if we had a spare wall. He could live in a plain white room
if he had his pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they bought their antiques together, often in
London. John Hobbs, a London dealer with offices in New York, sold
them pieces and occasionally advised them on acquiring things at
auction. To him, the most important piece in the sale is a George
II rococo mahogany dressing and writing commode attributed to John
Channon, circa 1765, which the Steinbergs bought at auction in
London. A companion piece is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Channon (1711-1783) was a member of a family that made furniture
for the richest families in England. The commode is thought to be
one of a pair commissioned for Fonthill Splendens, a Palladian
mansion near Bath that was rebuilt after a 1755 fire by Alderman
William Beckford, heir to an immense Jamaican sugar fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs recalled, ``When it came up for auction at Christie's 11
years ago, Gayfryd called me about it, and I told her to buy it
because she would never have a chance to buy something
categorically by Channon again.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles Hutchinson-Smith, one of the directors of Mallett, the
London antiques shop, said he thought the two commodes would have
been placed in ``the center of the room, back to back, to make a
real statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's said the commodes were probably made for either
Beckford's bedroom or the state bedroom, where the king and queen
would stay at Fonthill Splendens.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lang, Sotheby's specialist in English furniture, said,
``It's the best example of the rococo period of this model in
England, where you really don't see such elaborate use of bronze
mounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The commode has an exaggerated serpentine top with two sets of
five drawers flanking a central niche, which has five smaller
drawers. Above the central drawers is a larger drawer with a leafy
bronze keyhole escutcheon. It is flanked by two large ormolu female
heads. They are nereids, or sea nymphs. Above the keyhole is a
bronze garland with different kinds of sea shells.
</P>
<P>
   The corners have winged satyr heads and front feet with
elaborate roroco scrolls. Between them are two scaly winged ormolu
dolphins, associated with the goddess Venus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion Channon was the genius of his century,'' Hobbs
said. ``In terms of design and workmanship he was in a class of his
own. He was so innovative he left everyone else for dead. The
commode is one of Channon's major pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs pointed out that the Steinberg commode had been ``toned
down'' sometime in the past. When it came up for sale at Christie's
in 1989, some of the mounts were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg recalled: ``We were hiking in Arizona, and John Hobbs
called to tell us to stay by the phone for the auction. We
discussed a limit on how much we would spend. Saul ended up buying
it for 1 million pounds, way above our limit. Then there was the
challenge of restoring it, which took a year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steinbergs got permission to borrow the twin at the Victoria
and Albert Museum and at enormous expense were able to recast its
mounts to replace their missing ones. ``The commode is absolutely
spectacular, even though half of it has been replaced,'' Hobbs
said. The estimate at Sotheby's is $3 million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Equally over the top are two pairs of Grimsthorpe Castle side
chairs, circa 1755. Made of mahogany with some gilding, each has a
delicate pierced back whose top rail is adorned with a Chinese
pagoda and beautifully carved cabriole legs ending in scroll-carved
toes. The four are part of a set of six; Mallett currently has the
third pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go to the extremes of luxury and fantasy,'' said Giles
Hutchinson-Smith, one of the directors at Mallett. ``The chairs
were conceived as furnishings for a Chinese room and were meant to
show off incredible prosperity and power. They were made purely for
the drinking of tea. They are incredibly important in that they
predate Thomas Chippendale's Chinese-influenced furniture. They
show the beginning of a fantasy element, which blew away the
restraint of the George II style. They are thought to have been
made by William Hallett, whom George II called his `Chinese
mongrel.''' Each pair at Sotheby's is estimated at $200,000 to
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Steinberg sale ``is extremely impressive,'' said Christopher
Gibbs, the London antiques dealer. ``It's a very unboring
collection of things. As a mixture, it was decidedly indigestible,
not calming in any way, but there are a lot of things to be
surprised by.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection goes on view Friday at Sotheby's.

NO RAINDROPS FOR REDFORD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes in Hollywood, there are happy accidents.
``Casablanca'' is one such film. If the studio had had its way, the
film probably would have been long forgotten. Instead, they got
Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and an enduring classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' might have starred Steve
McQueen or Warren Beatty instead of a guy named Robert Redford, if
the studio had its way. It took the persistence of director George
Roy Hill, with the help of Paul Newman, to get Redford the role of
Sundance. The film ``changed my life,'' says Redford on a special
DVD edition released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD, which includes interviews with Redford, Newman and
others, has some fascinating details on the making of the ultimate
and perhaps best buddy movie, which _ believe it or not _ opened to
bad reviews (critics!!!). But the public knew what it liked.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the film goes to Hill, who took William
Goldman's first script and gave it the right mix of comedy and
drama. Not only did audiences laugh at Butch and Sundance, they
cared about them. The film also played with our cinematic
perceptions of the West, beginning with a silent film and ending
with that famous freeze shot.
</P>
<P>
   With beautiful cinematography by Conrad Hall (who took home that
Oscar for ``American Beauty'' and who lends his voice to the film
commentary), this DVD is a treat for film buffs. One other note:
``Butch'' _ like ``Casablanca'' _ endured even with a silly song in
it. Art may be forever, but so is charm.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!The name's Brosnan ... : The latest James Bond adventure,
``The World Is Not Enough,'' is also out. Directed by Michael Apted
(``Coal Miner's Daughter''), the film tries to add depth and nuance
to 007's life. The results are only partially successful. Since
taking over, Pierce Bronson has added some weight to Bond without
sacrificing his cheekiness. Sophie Marceau as a complex love
interest and Robert Carlyle as a grotesque adversary are
interesting casting for the film. Even the plot, based on
post-Soviet geopolitics, is a cut above the usual Bond fare. But
when Denise Richards enters halfway through the film as a nuclear
scientist named Christmas, the move nearly nukes the movie.
</P>
<P>
   For 007 fans, James Bond Gift Set Part II was also released this
week. This is your chance to see how Sean Connery, George Lasenby
and Roger Moore stack up as the man who likes to have his martini
shaken, not stirred.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!'X'-extreme beginnings: OK, ``The X-Files'' will be back
next year in some form, but for those who want to see how it
started, the entire first season is now available on DVD. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: The Special Edition'' (Fox
Home Video) is $14.90 on VHS and $29.90 on DVD, which includes
commentary by director George Roy Hill, Hal David, Robert Crawford
and cinematographer Conrad Hall, a making-of documentary (45
minutes), interviews with Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine
Ross, William Goldman and Burt Bacharach and a DVD-ROM interactive
history of Butch and Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The World Is Not Enough'' (MGM/UA) is $19.90 on VHS and
$34.90 on DVD, which includes a making-of documentary and ``The
World Is Not Enough'' music video by Garbage. The James Bond Gift
Set II on DVD is $149.90, and includes ``Dr. No,'' ``The Man With
the Golden Gun,'' ``Moonraker,'' ``On Her Majesty's Secret
Service'' and ``The Spy Who Loved Me.'' Each has audio commentary
by the director and key members of the crew and making-of
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   -- The first season of ``The X-Files'' (Fox) on DVD is $149.98
and contains all 23 first-season episodes plus the pilot, 11
``Behind-the-Truth'' segments from F/X and interviews with series
creator Chris Carter about 12 of his favorite episodes. &QL;

IT WAS NOT TO BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time we get a good look at Ethan Hawke in Michael
Almereyda's bizarre, contemporary version of ``Hamlet,'' he's
wearing the tinted, black-rimmed glasses of an ``artiste.'' The
first person who came to my mind wasn't a melancholy Dane but a
pompous Irishman _ with the specs on, Hawke bears a faint
resemblance to Bono, the self-important lead singer of U2. This may
be a highly personal reaction, but it's appropriate because, like
Bono, this ``Hamlet'' is often pretentious, but likable in spite of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if you're in the right frame of mind, which isn't to
take this seriously but to look at it as more of an eccentric goof.
It's virtually impossible not to, with actors like Hawke, Bill
Murray, Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Venora wandering through
modern-day corporate New York, spouting Elizabethan dialogue as if
the movie were dubbed into a foreign language. Almereyda ruthlessly
trimmed Shakespeare's text, and the result is sort of like a
twisted greatest-hits package: ``Hamlet 2000 _ The Michael
Almereyda Mix.'' Some favorite moments survive the transition to
the present day, some don't, and many don't even make it into the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet is no longer a Danish prince but an American aspiring
filmmaker, played by Hawke as more surly dude than melancholy Dane.
His slain father is no longer a fallen king but the former
president of Denmark Corp.; playwright Sam Shepard, whose remote
grimness is perfect for the character, for some reason employs an
indeterminate East Coast accent in playing the father's ghost.
MacLachlan plays Hamlet's nefarious uncle Claudius, who murdered
Hamlet's father, married his mother and took over the family
business _ actions that fuel Hamlet's oft-muddled plans for
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the scissoring, Almereyda has managed to keep the
play's complicated plot of accidental deaths, intentional murders,
foolish fathers and vengeance-seeking sons intact. But in this
case, it hardly matters; what matters are the strange settings
Almereyda finds for Shakespeare's words and situations:
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet mutters the famous ``To be or not to be ... '' soliloquy
while roaming the action-movie aisles of an empty Blockbuster
Video, as the revenge drama ``The Crow'' plays on a screen in the
background (for some reason, Hawke sports a snowboard-slacker wool
cap during this and many other scenes). The play ``The Mousetrap,''
which Hamlet devises to ``catch the conscience of the king'' and
get Claudius to reveal his guilt, has been transformed into a
hilariously pretentious short film. The climactic sword fight,
which works about as well as the preposterous sword fight in ``The
Skulls,'' is interrupted by bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The actors play all this out with such straightforward
earnestness, your heart goes out to them. Murray, as the
wise/foolish advice-dispensing Polonius, comes off best, his blithe
personality meshing well with such a know-it-all character. The
normally reliable Julia Stiles, as the troubled Ophelia, comes off
worst, turning the character's hysteria into mere histrionics. As
for Hawke _ well, he's no Olivier. Or Branagh. Or even Gibson. His
natural passivity and talent for wounded romanticism would seem to
fit the role of a hero who just can't make up his mind, but his
moments of action and anger are jaggedly uneven, played not as if
he were out to avenge the death of his father but more as if he
were upset at someone for spilling Pepsi on his Nirvana CDs.
</P>
<P>
   For all that's wrong with the movie, it's strangely intriguing,
with a sort of gotta-watch-the-train-wreck appeal. Early reviews
have overreacted in so many ways, from those that call it
unwatchable malarkey to those who praise its, um,
``post-modernism'' (which must apply to a year 2000 that looks more
futuristic than the one we actually live in). They protest _ and
praise _ too much, methinks; it's merely a curiosity piece,
deserving neither accolades nor slings and arrows but simply mild
bemusement.

   When did catching a few rays become so blasted complicated?
</P>
<P>
   There are the sunscreens, sunblocks and sunless tanning lotions,
with labels promising a veritable alphabet soup of SPFs and UV
protection. Then there are the shades, umbrellas and clothing
offering an even stronger defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your dermatologist for advice and he's likely to tell you
that if you plan to spend a lot of time outdoors, you should take
precautions. Then he'll remind you that prolonged exposure to the
sun's rays is harmful. In the short term, you'll suffer a painful
sunburn. Over time, you could develop skin cancer, certain forms of
which, if unchecked, can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Scared? Confused? Don't be. Experts say protecting your skin
from the sun's damaging rays is simple. Choose a strong product
with a reliable brand name and use your skin as your indicator.

   ``My rule of thumb is that if you're using a sunscreen now and
you're still getting tan or red, it's not doing what you want it to
do,'' said Dr. Andrew Kaufman of the Center for Dermatology Care in
Thousand Oaks. ``You're either using a sunscreen that isn't giving
you the SPF protection you need, or you're not putting on enough,
or not frequently enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is trying to
simplify matters by eliminating sunscreen labels with Sun
Protection Factor (SPF) levels higher than 30 since the higher
options, they say, do not offer significantly better protection
than the others. By the end of 2002, every product stronger than
SPF 30 will carry the label 30+ and labels with phrases such as
``all-day protection'' and ``waterproof'' will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you use, skin specialists say, use a lot of it and use
it often, and don't forget to coat the kids in the stuff as well.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by Dr. June Robinson of Loyola University _
published in this month's Journal of the American Academy of
Dermatology _ concludes that parents who use sunscreen on their
children tend to let them play in the sun for longer periods of
time, thereby negating the benefits of sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   It's these same parents, the study says, who aren't using enough
sunscreen on their own skin, thereby setting a poor example for the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are parents who are trying to protect their children,
more so than themselves,'' said Robinson, adding that parents also
forget to cover all parts of their children's bodies such as the
tops of the hands and feet. ``They're trying hard, but they haven't
quite figured out how to carry the ball into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past the SPF number _ which represents the amount
of protection a product offers against harmful ultraviolet B rays _
go for what feels comfortable. Some people like a gel, spray or
roll-on; others prefer an oily lotion. Some like the standard
squirt bottle, while others prefer a pump bottle for strategic
placement. For kids, there are now several brands of sunscreen that
slather or spray on in a bright color, such as blue or green, to
help prevent parents from missing a spot. The color fades as the
sunscreen is rubbed into the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what protective product you use, skin doctors say
you should use it repeatedly. After you swim or sweat, slather it
on anew.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. County lifeguards issue their employees copious amounts of
SPF 30 sunscreen, but most lifeguards use their own, says Capt.
Steve Moseley of the lifeguard's community service division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer the greasy Aloe Gator because I know it's on there,''
said Moseley. ``Some don't like it !ital!because it's greasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguards have long been aware of the dangers of prolonged
exposure to sun rays. Which is why, he said, you're more likely to
see a lifeguard with more covered than the average ray-soakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the bronze sun god has kind of gone by the
wayside,'' said Moseley, adding that a couple of lifeguards have
died from the effects of skin cancer. ``We've become a lot more
conscious and aware _ more hats, more long-sleeved shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing certainly helps. On the beach, skimpy may be stylish,
but for health purposes, you're better off covering up with items
like hats, shirts and sunglasses. Clothes should have a tight
weave. Hold your T-shirt up to the sun. If light passes through,
it's not giving good protection. The Washington-based clothing
manufacturer Sun Precautions produces a line of clothing, called
Solumbra, that has a 30+ SPF factor built into the fabric. Company
president Shaun Hughes, who founded Solumbra after being diagnosed
with skin cancer at the age of 26, claims his clothing line offers
better protection than a 30+ SPF sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunless tanners, aka ``tan-in-a-can'' will work as long as you
take the ``sunless'' part of the label literally. They'll give you
a layer of color through a chemical called dihydroxyacetone, but
they won't protect you from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them do have SPF levels built into them, but we say
that's a convenience for the aesthetics,'' said George A. Ziets,
vice president of research and development for Bath &AMP; Body Works.
``And the quality of the formulations is getting better on those.
You go back 20 years, they were very orange and streaky-looking.
Today's are a lot more aesthetically elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't stay out of the sun, be aware that the sun's rays
are strongest between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. And give
yourself extended shade breaks if you're going to be out in the sun
for a long period of time. During the shade time, your skin can
recover, says Dr. David Chu, section chief of the division of
melanoma and surgery at City of Hope National Medical Center in
Duarte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a complete repair, but I think it does make a
difference,'' Chu said. ``It's a pitfall that parents get into,
thinking that sunscreen offers total protection from the sun. It's
not true.''

   GUGGENHEIM-1900 (New York) _ The Guggenheim's ``1900: Art at the
Crossroads'' is a wacky exercise in historical simulation, the
excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so
many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you
consider eBay a place. But the show no doubt will be as popular in
New York as it was in London. There is no underestimating the

   LANGUAGE-IMMERSION (Undated) _ Five years ago, at a stationery
store on the Left Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished
in my pants pocket for some francs and walked toward the counter, a
smile of fear frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out
this sentence to the old woman at the counter: ``Je voudrais
acheter le magasin, s'il vous plait.'' The common word for magazine
is magazine (mah-gah-ZEEN), not magasin (mah-gah-ZAA). I had asked
to buy the shop. And so it went. For 10 days in Paris I was a
helpless prisoner of my past: four years of undistinguished high
school French and one semester at college. I could make my way
through a French newspaper, but conversation was out of the
question. Until now. No longer the 98-pound-weakling of
bilingualism, I have persuaded myself that it is possible to
function confidently, perhaps even thrive, in another culture. I am
a graduate of language immersion. By Charles Strum.

<P>
   Like other forms of the disease, skin cancer is caused by the
abnormal growth of cells. Of the three forms of skin cancer _ basal
cell cancer, squamous cell cancer and melanoma _ melanoma, the
least common but most deadly, is also the form of cancer most
likely to spread to other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 9,200 people are expected to die of skin cancer
this year _ 7,300 from melanoma alone, according to statistics
compiled by the Center for Dermatology Care in Thousand Oaks.
Others will be killed by the spread of the cancer to vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of a melanoma victim is 45. Americans have a one
in 80 chance of developing the disease. People with fair skin and
light eyes are at greatest risk for melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is treatable if caught early. The American Academy
of Dermatology and the American Cancer Society advise people to
look for unusual moles or skin lesions. Follow the ABCD rule:
</P>
<P>
   Asymmetry: Where one half of the pigmented lesion does not match
the other half.
</P>
<P>
   Border: The edges of a lesion are ragged, notched or blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Color: The color is not uniform over the legion, containing
different shades of tan, brown, black, sometimes with patches of
red, white or blue.
</P>
<P>
   Diameter: Any lesion that is wider than 1/4 of an inch, about
the size of a pencil eraser.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a growth with any of these traits, see a doctor.

CUDDLY DISNEY CREATURES ARE EXTINCT IN SCARY, THRILLING
`DINOSAUR'

   In the field of animation at least, Disney is one brand name
that still stands for something. As hard as DreamWorks, Warners,
Fox and the rest of the Hollywood competition scramble, they just
can't seem to match it for innovation, imagination and quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it took Jeffrey Katzenberg and his DreamWorks to
come up with its thoroughly mediocre ``Road to El Dorado,'' for
instance, the Mouse House released two blockbuster animated hits _
``Tarzan'' and ``Toy Story 2'' _ and this weekend has a third
likely candidate for the honor in ``Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest computer-generated effort is something of a
departure, too. It's not a musical, and the cuddly aspects of its
characters have been tuned way down. Though it nods at the
conventions of the animated feature, it's also much more realistic
than usual for the genre, sometimes unsettlingly so.
</P>
<P>
   The title character is an iguanodon named Aladar who hatches
from an egg that somehow got kicked around the primeval landscape
in the opening sequence, and landed in a colony of warm-blooded
lemurs. Naturally, the lemurs raise the cute baby dinosaur as one
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   At the point where it looks like we're in for a cross between
``Barney'' and ``Tarzan,'' the film switches gears with a gigantic
meteor shower that devastates the planet, and sends the surviving
dinosaurs on a quest to reach their Eden-like ``nesting grounds''
to save their species.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there are landslides, stampedes, a drought, a
dinosaur romance, and plenty of battles as the herd is constantly
pursued by a pair of giant-jawed, all-teeth carnisaurs and a pack
of velociraptors _ those lightning-fast and vicious critters we got
to know and fear in ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the weakest part of the film is its ``human'' element:
the '90s jargon (``We're outta here''), the ``character'' voices
(provided by Della Reese, Alfre Woodard and Joan Plowright, among
others), and the de rigueur subplot in which Aladar challenges his
aging dinosaur leader to become head of the herd.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers have little or no interest in this aspect of the
movie, and have thrown in the cliches because they are expected.
Too bad they didn't skip the gags and one-liners, along with the
songs, and go the distance in making this an authentic dinosaur
world.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, ``Dinosaur'' is still one heck of an action adventure.
From its knockout opening sequence _ a pterodactyl flight through a
Cretaceous world filled with thousands of milling dinosaurs _ the
film is totally alive. And the computer technology is moving so
fast now that the effects seem even more eerily lifelike here than
in November's ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' is also a surprisingly scary movie _ even for
adults _ and quite violent for a Disney cartoon. It's rated a
benign PG, but very young children may be horrified by its vision
of a brutal, eat-or-be-eaten world. On the other hand, boys between
the ages of 8 and 13 should enjoy it so much they'll think they've
died and gone to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Dinosaur. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton. Screenplay
by John Harrison, Robert Nelson Jacobs and Walon Green. Voices:
D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, Della
Reese. Disney. 82 minutes. Rated PG for reptilian violence.

`O'NEILL': THE MORNING BEFORE THE LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 &HT;    Joseph J. Ellis is Ford Foundation Professor of American History
at Mount Holyoke College and author of ``American Sphinx: The
Character of Thomas Jefferson.'' 
 By JOSEPH J. ELLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1962, only nine years after Eugene O'Neill died, Arthur and
Barbara Gelb published a major study of his life and work. Crammed
with interviews with O'Neill's ex-wives, boyhood friends and
theatrical colleagues, driven by the conviction that O'Neill's
posthumously published masterpiece, ``A Long Day's Journey Into
Night,'' was the theatrical equivalent of ``Moby-Dick,'' the Gelbs'
biography helped to establish O'Neill's reputation as the great
brooding genius of American dramatic history. Like O'Neill's life,
their book was a sprawling work of passion, with the rough edges
still showing and its own nervous energy throbbing slightly out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly 40 years later, the Gelbs have made the highly
unusual decision to rewrite their biography of O'Neill from
beginning to end. Although the old book is still in print, the
Gelbs wanted to include material from the O'Neill papers at Yale
University that had not been available earlier, along with fresh
interviews with previously unknown or uncooperative sources and,
most interestingly, their own more mature perspective on the
tangled dynamics of O'Neill's family life, which had served as the
interpretive centerpiece of their early book.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference between the old book and the new, apart
from the addition of anecdotes and an updated bibliography, is a
somewhat more charitable attitude toward O'Neill's parents and a
slightly harsher judgment of his multiple excesses as an alcoholic,
adulterer, derelict and self-destructive American Prometheus. There
is also a difference in scale. ``O'Neill: Life With Monte Cristo''
is merely the first in a projected three-volume work. It ends in
1918, with O'Neill as a 29-year-old aspiring playwright, poised to
ascend into the American pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   The major rationale for such expansive treatment of O'Neill's
formative years is that for O'Neill they truly were formative. W.B.
Yeats once observed that every aspiring artist must choose between
``perfection of life, or of the work.'' O'Neill not only made an
emphatic choice of work over life, but also seemed determined to
make his personal life into a series of painful imperfections that
then became the creative material for his most enduring work. He
did away with happy endings in the American theater by studiously
avoiding them as a character in his own one-man play. He learned,
the hard way, that life was never too good to be true, always too
true to be good.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was literally born on Broadway, at a theatrical hotel in
1888. His father, James O'Neill, was a prominent actor who
squandered his talent by playing more than 5,000 performances in
the lead role of the melodramatic moneymaker ``The Count of Monte
Cristo.'' The subtitle of this book refers to O'Neill's extended
dependence on his father and on the money he earned in a play that
symbolized the sentimental values O'Neill learned to loathe.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Ellen Quinlan O'Neill, became addicted to morphine
while recovering from Eugene's birth and thereafter assumed the
character of a matronly victim of life, formidable in her
helplessness. His older brother, called Jamie, was an alcoholic and
womanizer whose major fraternal contribution was to introduce his
brother to the saloons and whorehouses of New York. If ``A Long
Day's Journey Into Night'' is about the most famous dysfunctional
family in American dramatic history, O'Neill's inspiration began at
home.
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of modern biography, especially when the subject is
a major literary figure, is driven by the urge to undermine the
writer's artistic achievement by exposing the previously unknown
details of his or her private life. Or as John Updike recently put
it, literary biographies seem designed ``to reduce celebrities to a
set of antics and ailments to which we can feel superior.''
O'Neill's early life would seem to provide a veritable arsenal of
ammunition for this emerging genre, which we might call ``homicidal
biography.'' Consider the following.
</P>
<P>
   A solitary and sickly child, O'Neill early on adopted the
posture of the self-absorbed rebel without a cause. He flunked out
of Princeton after one year, abandoned his pregnant wife, wandered
to Honduras and Argentina in search of gold and prostitutes, then
found a sliver of serenity as a seaman on cargo ships sailing out
of New York. (He often remarked that he wished he had been born a
sea gull.) He cultivated his alcoholism and his alienated posture
in the saloons of Battery Park, then hit bottom in 1912 when he
attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief fling as a journalist in New London, Conn., and a
briefer fling as a student of playwriting at Harvard, he took up
residence in a Greenwich Village bar called the Hell Hole, a place
where bohemian convictions mixed easily with booze. Befriended by
the radical journalist John Reed, he proceeded to begin a torrid
affair with Louise Bryant, Reed's lover. All during this time he
was wholly dependent on the philanthropy of his father, who was
toiling away in ``Monte Cristo,'' and whom, he apprised everyone,
he thoroughly despised.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Arthur Gelb _ he is a former theater critic who went
on to become managing editor of The New York Times _ are less
interested in these disreputable episodes as evidence of O'Neill's
deeply flawed character than as raw material from which he created
his own tragic vision. After all, they seem to say, O'Neill never
tried to conceal his private sins, personal obsessions or domestic
catastrophes. He put them on the stage for all the world to see.
They believe that art trumps and ultimately redeems life,
especially when the artist is a genius capable of producing ``Long
Day's Journey,'' ``Ah, Wilderness'' and ``Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' all of which transformed the neurotic history of the
O'Neill family into masterpieces of the American theater.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``The Iceman Cometh'' transforms the self-destructive
habits of O'Neill's drunken cronies in the bars of Battery Park
into a poignant dramatization of the human blend of perversity and
nobility. O'Neill's demons may have got the better of him in his
life, but he triumphed over them in his art.
</P>
<P>
   For better and for worse _ and I think mostly for better _
``O'Neill: Life With Monte Cristo'' retains the characteristic
features of its predecessor. It is mercifully unburdened by
literary theory. It is lumpy and aside-ish, perfectly content to go
off on tangents describing the Irish-American affinity for alcohol
or the pretensions of New London society. It swings too literally
between the narration of O'Neill's life and the scenes he
reconstructed in his plays, as if O'Neill had orchestrated the
Oedipal conflicts with his parents to enrich his depiction of the
Tyrone family in ``Long Day's Journey.'' (On second thought, maybe
he did.)
</P>
<P>
   Though it lacks an overarching argument about O'Neill's
psychological insights, apart from the fact that they derived from
his own experience of tragedy, it is brimming with energy and
dedicated to the idea that O'Neill, more than any other playwright
in American history, deserves our abiding attention. You put this
book down and nod in agreement.

`LUMINOUS MOTION': TROUBLED MOM AND SON, SADLY ADRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait till yesterday's here,'' goes the Tom Waits
song that accompanies the end credits for ``Luminous Motion,'' and
Bette Gordon's funny, unnerving new film casts a similar spell of
low-key dislocation. It begins with the voice of 10-year-old
Phillip (Eric Lloyd) reflecting on his earlier life as though it
were the distant past. ``Childhood feels like a ghost town,'' he
muses. ``It's hard to distinguish what's real from what's something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an accurate premonition of the dreamy odyssey that
follows, but it may seem a bit much coming from the mouth of a
late-20th-century American boy, even one as precocious and
introspective as Phillip. There is a quality of earnest, overripe
literariness to the script _ adapted by Robert Roth and Scott
Bradfield from a novel by Bradfield _ that, at least early on,
holds the audience at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like a quality of landscape,'' Philip says, musing on
the nomadic life he leads with his mother (Deborah Kara Unger), and
while Lloyd reads the words with the right tone of wistful rue,
it's not clear that he knows what they mean. Is that any way to
talk about your mother?
</P>
<P>
   But the voice-over _ a technique, once taboo among serious
filmmakers, that has lately become all but ubiquitous _ is a crutch
the movie quickly, and wisely, puts aside. We get a better sense of
Philip's melancholy inwardness, his blithe innocence and his
inscrutability from studying Lloyd's chubby, expectant face. And
the relationship between mother and son is too charged and too
subtle to be conveyed on screen in mere prose. The story _ nuanced,
shocking and slippery _ requires more than a literal-minded
transcription of the novel, and Gordon performs the alchemical feat
of turning it into visual poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luminous Motion'' tells Philip's story and his mother's
simultaneously, and its emotional pivot is their mutual pain at the
discovery that the two stories are not the same. For Philip, their
life on the road, drifting between motels and diners in a red
Impala cluttered with old science textbooks and glass figurines, is
a state of perfect symbiosis. He is blind to his mother's
desperate, reckless sadness as she ricochets through a series of
one-night stands, petty thefts and bottles of cheap liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Unger, who played the chief Canadian do-gooder in ``The
Hurricane,'' holds ``Luminous Motion'' together even as her
character's life falls apart. The film's coherence, and its
emotional power, depend on her ability to play in effect two roles
at once. She has to show us both what Philip sees and what he
refuses to acknowledge: the tender, funny resourceful mother, and
the damaged, lonely woman casting about for stability. Unger
accomplishes this with amazing understatement, and without a trace
of pity or sentimentality. Her voice is gravelly and slow, and her
face seems always on the verge of melting into sleep. Toward the
end of the movie, she's barely awake, and her languorous exhaustion
takes on a tragic dimension.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is revealed obliquely, through Philip's playful,
quicksilver temperament. Like his mother, though, the boy is not
quite what he seems. He appears to suffer from auditory and visual
hallucinations, receiving first telephone calls and then surprise
visits from his vanished father (Jamey Sheridan). When Philip and
his mother briefly settle down with a kindly carpenter named Pedro
(Terry Kinney), the apparitional father, like the ghost in Hamlet,
instructs his son to kill the usurper. But then once the real Dad
has returned, Pedro's shade appears to goad Philip toward murderous
Oedipal vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   At least, I think that's what happens. With cunning agility,
``Luminous Motion'' tiptoes along the narrow boundary between
fantasy and reality. We're never sure whether what we see is taking
place in the physical world or in Philip's mind. And while the film
respects both his emotions and his perceptions, it also leaves open
the possibility that he is suffering from a serious mental illness.
Is this surrealism or schizophrenia? Either way, the film sustains
a delicate counterpoint between childlike wonder and deep,
inconsolable melancholy. It's a bit like ``The Sixth Sense,'' but
without the melodramatic comfort of the supernatural. Its horror,
like its humor, comes from close to home, from the primal bond
between mother and son.

`THE WELL': BLAIR WITCH-TYPE DREAD INFUSES AN OUTBACK PUZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first half of ``The Well,'' the Australian director Samantha
Lang's beautifully creepy debut feature, is an efficient study in
the contrasting temperaments of two lonely women. Hester (Pamela
Rabe), who lives with her father on a desolate sheep station, is
the repressed one. We know this because of her long skirts and
buttoned-up blouses, her orthopedic shoes and her flat, colorless
hair, which she wears either severely plaited or gathered into a
bun like the one Anthony Perkins sported in ``Psycho.'' Her taste
in music runs to German lieder sung at dirge pace to the
accompaniment of an out-of-tune upright piano.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine (Miranda Otto), her wayward young housekeeper, is the
free spirit and resident life force. She loves loud rock music and
likes to dance around in knee-high boots and short gauzy skirts.
Her flaming red hair is the only splash of color on the dour,
Victorian psychic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   But Hester loves Katherine. Or at least she buys her expensive
gifts, excuses her from chores and learns, in her company, how to
laugh. Bred in flinty pioneer thrift, Hester begins to spend money
as if it were going out of style. She buys a brand-new silver
Toyota pickup and, once her father dies, sells her childhood home
and everything in it. Hester's disapproving financial adviser (Paul
Chubb) suspects that Katherine has bewitched her, but the unlikely
pair, along with two cookie tins full of cash, settle into a cozy
cottage and begin fantasizing about a trip to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you begin to chafe at the obviousness of this setup, or
to settle in for another hour of glum psychological atmospherics,
Katherine runs over something _ which turns out to be someone _ on
a deserted dirt road, and ``The Well,'' with a neck-snapping jolt,
turns into the scariest exercise in cinematic sleight of hand since
``The Blair Witch Project.'' Soon there is a body to be disposed
of, and the deep, dry well in front of the cottage offers itself as
a practical solution and as a metaphor for the murky terror that is
about to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine begins to insist that the man in the well is alive and
that he has fallen in love with her. Surely she's come unhinged. Or
maybe Hester, who either believes Katherine or doesn't, has gone
over the edge. Or maybe you're the crazy one. Strange things begin
to happen, unless nothing is happening at all. The story, adapted
by Laura Jones from a novel by Elizabeth Jolley, is like a chain of
slipknots, drawing ever tighter until one by one they disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Lang brings this puzzle to the screen with mathematical
discipline and painterly emotion. She charges the smallest
interactions with unbearable tension and knows how to induce panic
by suggesting rather than showing. Like Peter Weir in ``Picnic at
Hanging Rock,'' she turns the empty, windy outback into an actively
sinister presence.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling into ``The Well'' you feel you've awakened into
someone else's nightmare, and you emerge from it clammy with a
dread you don't quite understand. See it with someone you trust. Or
better, see it alone, since afterward you won't be able to trust
anything, least of all your own perceptions.

ORIGINALITY LEFT BEHIND IN `ROAD TRIP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The poster for ``Road Trip'' features a collection of pretty,
young, undressed kids strategically concealed behind an unfurled
road map and a spaced-out (and thankfully fully dressed) Tom Green.
Smells like ``American Pie'' on wheels to me, only this time the
motivation isn't the pursuit of sex. It's the pursuit of a sex
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Nice guy Josh (the blandly good-looking Breckin Meyer from
``Go'') is an Ithaca University undergrad struggling to keep a long
distance romance alive with his high school sweetheart in Austin,
Texas. ``It isn't cheating if you're in different area codes,''
counsels his best friend E.L. (Seann William Scott, ``American
Pie''), a self-proclaimed expert on the unwritten rules of
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   So when Josh succumbs to the advances of pretty young co-ed Beth
(Amy Smart, ``Outside Providence''), he's satisfied that he hasn't
transgressed too badly.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some situations the rules don't cover, such as
videotaping the event and accidentally sending it to your steady.
(``That's not fair,'' whines Green. ``She gets to see the tape and
we don't.'') Thus the road trip, and all kooky characters, wild
adventures and petty larceny that entails.
</P>
<P>
   Is it funny? In one scene, a vindictive waiter drops French
toast down his underwear (front and back!) before serving it up to
a hapless traveler, who gobbles it down with gusto. It's your call.
</P>
<P>
   Deadpan comic Tom Green is on hand as the zoned-out narrator and
stay-at-home buddy, who likely won the role because he'll do
anything for a well-earned gross-out laugh, including drop a live
rodent into his mouth. Cute and charismatic Smart shows pluck and
panache in a thankless role as the ``other'' woman.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a familiar journey and director/co-writer Todd
Phillips (whose previous encounter with higher education is the
documentary ``Frat House'') sidesteps every opportunity to inject a
little edge or originality into it. There's some touch-and-go race
humor that barely squeaks under the radar of offensiveness, gags
about fat girls and horny old men and kinky sexual thrills, and a
few blatantly gratuitous nude scenes, but no surprises in the
inevitable coming of age rituals and inevitable happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' is sure to elicit giggles and hoots from crowds of
teenagers with its succession of gross-out gags and sexual humor,
but this is one teenage tour that never gets up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Road Trip. Directed by Todd Phillips. Screenplay by Phillips and
Scot Armstrong. Cast: Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy
Smart, Fred Ward, Tom Green. DreamWorks. 97 minutes. Rated R for
nudity, sexual situations, drug use and gross-out humor.

 &HT;    'N SYNC: The boys are back
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the time finally come to take 'N Sync seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone outside the quintet's target audience of preteen
girls and you'll probably get a decisive no. After all, these guys
are just clones of the Backstreet Boys, who themselves follow in
the R&AMP;B-flavored tradition of New Kids on the Block. If you've
heard one boy band, you've heard them all.
</P>
<P>
   Except that this boy band, which performs two sold-out concerts
at the National Car Rental Center in the days ahead, has managed to
break all the sales records for its latest release, No Strings
Attached.
</P>
<P>
   Since it hit stores in March, the album has held on to the No. 1
spot for seven weeks. (Don't be surprised if Britney Spears'
sophomore effort, Oops ... I Did It Again, finally knocks it off.)
In the first seven days, it sold more than 2.4 million copies,
marking the strongest week of sales by any artist throughout
history _ and more than doubling the total of the previous
record-holder (the Backstreet Boys, who else?). By the time the
Recording Industry Association of America _ the group that awards
those gold- and platinum-selling designations _ got around to
tallying the figures, the total had jumped to 7 million, a record
for a first audit.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, these guys, who got their start in the teen-pop
factory of Orlando _ they had the same manager as the Backstreet
Boys _ can't be that good. Or can they?
</P>
<P>
   The members of the group _ Lance Bass, 22; Joshua ``JC'' Chasez,
23; Joey Fatone, 23; Chris Kirkpatrick, 28; and Justin ``Curly''
Timberlake, 19 _ insist they're the real deal. But even they admit
the numbers caught them off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to sell something, but not to that
(extent). We're very, very excited and thankful,'' says Fatone,
speaking during a telephone news conference last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bass, who heads his own production company, thinks the record
sales were due to tireless promotion (''We did, like, 50 million
television appearances'') and the fact the album was delayed for a
long time. The group's self-titled debut dates back to 1998. ``The
fans were just so hungry for something out there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   _ More of the same
</P>
<P>
   No Strings Attached will offer few surprises to those familiar
with the boy-band formula. It's an album that mixes light-funk
grooves and broken-heart sentiments in a radio-friendly package.
Indeed, you can't tune to a Top 40 station without hearing the
first single, Bye Bye Bye, practically every 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the tunes are so wholesome. Take the case of
Digital Get Down, a song that seemingly explores the cybersex
phenomenon. In this age of online child predators, it's generated
some controversy. Did the band worry about the message?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really. That song was meant to be fun,'' Bass responds,
noting that it was written with a video concept about ``having a
party on the Internet.'' He insists the fans get the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Artistic growth
</P>
<P>
   As for the artistry behind the album, the group feels that,
regardless of its critics, it's moved well past the bubble-gum
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People now are starting to see that we enjoy the music,'' says
Fatone. ``It's not like we're just throwing something together to
sell the album. It's something we put our blood, sweat and tears
into.''
</P>
<P>
   And while boy bands have been the rage for the last few years,
resulting in some amusing parodies on television, 'N Sync's members
say the phenomenon must be placed in context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone's taking the whole thing a little wrong,''
says Bass. ``As much as there are teen bands, there's the same
amount of rock bands, R&AMP;B groups, solo acts. ... I think a lot of
older people in the music industry are a little jealous that it's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   The band also points to the fact that it wasn't
``pre-assembled'' in the same way as other boy groups. ``We didn't
go through a boot camp or audition,'' says Bass. Indeed, 'N Sync
started out as an extension of Chasez and Timberlake's work
together on the Mickey Mouse Club (they were on the TV show the
same time as Britney Spears). The two tried to make it in
Nashville; when that failed, they returned to Orlando, hooked up
with the three other members _ Bass was the last to join _ and
began exploring some tight harmonic arrangements. By 1997, they had
a record contract _ and after exploding in Europe, they found a
place on the American pop charts, buoyed by a Disney Channel
special.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the band is starting to write its own material _ Chasez
contributed four songs to the new album _ which it offers as
further proof of its evolution. ``We're heavily involved in
everything,'' says Fatone, noting the band even helped design the
set for the No Strings Attached tour and oversaw production of the
T-shirts. ``You want something that's quality. You don't want to
give back to our fans a piece of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the concert itself? Given that the band was on
the road just last year _ it played MARS Music Amphitheatre _ it
wanted to take it to the next level. ``It's twice as big,'' says
Bass of the stage. Every song gets its own set of special effects.
Look for pyrotechnics aplenty, but Bass won't reveal any other
details, except to say ``we're going to get very close to everybody
in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Given how large that audience has become, it should make for
quite a party.

 &HT;    Amazing animation saves so-so `Dinosaur'
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disney Pictures is crowing with justifiable pride over the
hyper-realistic digital images of prehistoric creatures in its
computer-animated summer feature, Dinosaur. But have you noticed
that no one is bragging about the intricacies of the movie's
screenplay?
</P>
<P>
   The film reportedly cost close to $200 million, when the price
of Disney's new digital studio is included in the total. Wasn't
there any money left over for writers with a few new ideas?
</P>
<P>
   Picture The Land Before Time crossed with Tarzan. An abandoned
iguanodon egg hatches, and the orphan reptile Aladar is raised by a
family of nurturing lemurs as one of its own. (Memo to science
teachers: Yes, Disney folks concede they are taking factual
liberties in suggesting that lemurs were around when dinosaurs
roamed the Earth. But these fuzzy monkeys are darned adorable, so
get over it.)
</P>
<P>
   After an earth-scorching meteor shower, the kind that might have
led to the extinction of these giant Barneys, the dinosaurs migrate
in search of their traditional nesting grounds. They trek through
desert that once was fertile land, almost dying of thirst. Of
course, it wouldn't be an animated feature if they did not make it
to the lush valley, but not before we learn a few lessons about not
being bossy, about sticking with the group and about lending a
helping foot to those who are old and slow.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a movie that would be better with the sound
turned down, this is it. Still, the visuals are awesome, so sit
back, scan the screen and enjoy. The detail work on the creatures _
both the scales on the dinosaurs and the hairs on the lemurs that
come along for the trek _ is beyond impressive, particularly as
they move and the textures are heightened with the play of light
and shadow. The reptiles look a little too rubbery, but otherwise
you will swear they are real.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the look so striking is the blend of photo-realistic
backgrounds, often digitally enhanced, then combined with the
computer-animated figures in the foreground. Typical of the
powerful cumulative effect is an early majestic shot where a
birdlike oviraptor, clutching the iguanodon egg that will become
our main character, soars over jagged cliffs to, alas, the sounds
of James Newton Howard's heavy-handed music track.
</P>
<P>
   True, these opening scenes are disconcertingly reminiscent of
Moses' harrowing voyage down the Nile in Prince of Egypt, if you
substitute a runaway egg for the baby in the bulrushes. Still, it
is the most involving, lyrical sequence in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the dinosaurs and the lemurs break the mood by
speaking. In English. The movie never quite recovers from this
strategic mistake. In the 60 years since the original Fantasia, the
techniques for depicting animated dinosaurs have made quantum
leaps, but are talking Carnotaurs and Styrachosaurs really
cinematic progress?
</P>
<P>
   With a tab of $200 million, Dinosaur presumably must appeal to
as wide an audience as possible, and that becomes its undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The vivid, violent battles between dinosaurs seem geared to
action-loving teens but are probably too intense for toddlers. At
the same time, the cute, cuddly interplay between the lemurs may
delight tots but will likely make the eyeballs of their older
siblings roll to the backs of their heads. And adults looking for
an interesting story are completely out of luck.

NEW POSTMODERN VERSION OF `HAMLET' ISN'T FOR PURISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In Michael Almereyda's contemporary version of William
Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,'' the melancholy Dane is no longer a Dane
but a New Yorker _ an aspiring filmmaker and the son of the slain
president of Denmark Corp. Hamlet spends a lot of time in the back
of limousines, the ``To be or not to be'' soliloquy plays out in
the action-movie aisles of an empty Blockbuster Video, and firearms
make their way into the climactic swordfight.
</P>
<P>
   And although this all takes place in the year 2000, everyone
speaks in Elizabethan dialogue and iambic pentameter.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it ain't for purists, and Almereyda isn't
apologizing for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare kinda jumped his grave a long time ago,'' the
laconic, 40ish director said during a Dallas stop. ``He can take
anything you throw at him. I think he won't be spinning in his
grave. He's beyond it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda should know. While researching his version of the
Bard's tragedy, he watched more than 20 film versions of
``Hamlet.'' They included a videotaped Ingmar Bergman stage version
starring ``Fargo's'' Peter Stormare, and a Christopher Plummer
version starring a young Michael Caine as Hamlet's friend, Horatio.
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda's own version _ which clocks in at under two hours,
relatively brief for this play _ stars Ethan Hawke in the title
role, as a confused and depressed young man obsessed with avenging
the murder of his father (playwright Sam Shepard plays the father's
ghost, who vanishes into a Pepsi machine). Hamlet knows that his
uncle, Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan), murdered his father, then
married Hamlet's mother (Diane Venora) and took over _ in this case
_ the family business. Hamlet spends most of the movie trying to
prove it and bring Claudius down, with disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke brought some affectations to the role _ namely, a wool cap
and tinted, black-rimmed glasses _ making it look like he's
wandering through an early '90s music video instead of a
Shakespeare classic. This, Almereyda admited, isn't entirely
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kind of contemporary Hamlet figure that made it personally
urgent for Ethan was Kurt Cobain,'' the director said, referring to
the Nirvana lead singer who killed himself in 1994. ``You think of
all the contemporary figures who have had promising lives cut
short, by suicide or some kind of violent death, and rock 'n' roll
people figure high on the list as Hamlet-like figures who had a lot
of promise and glamour but have a self-destructive streak, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the play know it's littered with corpses,
and that vindictiveness grows as the deaths mount. Yet Almereyda
said that Hawke also brought an unusual perspective to the
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He insisted on the idea that the violence in the play should
be regarded (as unintentional) _ that Hamlet's failure to kill his
uncle isn't proof of weak character,'' Almereyda said. ``It's just
the opposite. (He knows it's) bad to kill people. There's nothing
in Shakespeare's work that suggests he thought murder was a good
idea. The way you wrestle with this issue is showing it as a
compulsion, as a command from your father, from your father's
ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing such familiar actors as Hawke, Murray and MacLachlan
speak Shakespeare's words in a 21st-century setting can be jarring,
as if the movie were dubbed into a foreign language. But Almereyda
said that feeling is inescapable for today's audiences, and would
affect any presentation of the Bard's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (the language) has a kind of natural flow once you get
into it,'' he said. ``There's a kind of threshold where you have to
be patient and allow yourself to get used to it. But I find that
(problem) in almost any production of Shakespeare, whether it's
modern dress or not. The language is different; it's elevated and
ornate, and it's not what you hear walking down the street. But the
thoughts can be expressed in a more natural way than it's often
done. I didn't really want actors to be sputtering and declaiming.
I wanted it to feel more internal and intimate. And I got that, for
the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews haven't always agreed. Some praise the movie's
``postmodern'' twist, while others lambaste the film as pretentious
revisionism. Almereyda said he's been more fortunate with early
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had luck in that the film has so far appealed to people
who don't know the play, and also (to) people from Shakespeare
societies,'' he said. ``I decided to be brave and show it to (two
groups of Shakespeare scholars), and they couldn't have been more
enthusiastic about it. I was kind of taken aback. Because they
recognized that it might be severely cut, but the heart of it draws
together a kind of an essence. It's really meant to be an attempted
``Hamlet,'' a collage of ``Hamlet'' and a way of talking about
``Hamlet'' in contemporary terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the arty talk, though, Almereyda does want to make
sure that moviegoers' rears stay in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to scare anyone out of the theater,'' he said.
``I hope the movie's accessible.''

<P>
   All you Britney Spears fans, stop right here.
</P>
<P>
   You're not going to like this review. You're going to hate this
review. You're going to call me and tell me that I'm an old coot
and I just don't understand that she's, like, the greatest thing
ever _ or at least since ``Total Request Live'' or whatever _ and
how lame I am and how cool her clothes are and ...
</P>
<P>
   Just stop. For both of us. Go play this CD again _ I know you
already have it. Trust me. It's better for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of you, let me say that if it does nothing else,
``Oops! ... I Did It Again'' lives up to its title. From the
opening title track _ which is ``... Baby One More Time'' with
different lyrics _ to the end, ``Oops!'' is a Xerox copy of her
first CD, which has sold more than 7 million copies and made the
photogenic Louisiana teen the queen among the ever-growing roster
of cute-little-girl pop singers. The vanilla hip-hop beats, the big
choruses (during which Spears' vocals often conveniently disappear
into those of her background singers), the wide-eyed romance of the
lyrics _ it's all firmly in place and packaged with, again, photos
of cute lil' Britney with her usual tight clothes and
toothpaste-commercial smile.
</P>
<P>
   And as usual, Britney is busy with the boys. If she's not
telling a former beau that she's, she's so getting over him on
``Stronger,'' she's telling another that he should quit being
jealous on ``What U See (Is What U Get),'' and telling a third that
he needs to step up and declare his crush on ``Don't Let Me Be the
Last to Know.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hormone-charged teen angst at its most blandly
predictable. Coupled with Spears' featureless, thin voice,
``Oops!'' was bound to be just a rehash of the first CD.
</P>
<P>
   But two factors make it, if anything, worse than that: One is
``Lucky,'' in which a teen starlet by the same name garners all
sorts of fame but is still, gosh darn it, sad. This would seem to
be Spears' big ``Please don't think my life is perfect'' moment,
but you know, given that hers basically is, at least for a
teen-ager, I really can't work up any sympathy. Maybe when she buys
me a $1 million mansion in England to go with hers, I'll be able to
feel her pain.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a cover of ``Satisfaction,'' for which Spears, her
producers and her record company should issue an immediate apology.
</P>
<P>
   Look, it's real simple: Britney Spears came along at the right
time, with the right marketing campaign, the right body and the
right smile. She jumped on the gravy train _ one that, given her
weedy voice, she won't be able to parlay into more interesting
music. This is bloodless pop-by-committee _ but, just like acne and
New Kids on the Block, it won't last forever.
</P>
<P>
   I promise.

<P>
   Paul Simon once sang, ``These are the days of miracle and
wonder,'' and though in the auto industry it is engineering rather
than miracle that gives us our wonder, there is still room for
wonderment to emerge on its own in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   And in that vein, I wonder:
</P>
<P>
   --Why Saab, as it produces such fine cars and continues to give
them grace and horsepower, has yet to come out with an
all-wheel-drive vehicle. Volvo's gone there. Audi's gone there.
Porsche has harnessed its 911 Turbo with AWD. Everybody seems to be
going there, and as manufacturers manage to squeeze ever more
horsepower from high-revving, smaller engines, front-wheel-drive
cars, Saab's selling point in days gone by, can't handle the power
without torque steer. AWD is the way to go and Saab ought to be
going there with select models.
</P>
<P>
   --Why it works with consumers when manufacturers attach designer
or outdoor outfitter names to special models. We had the Eddie
Bauer Ford Explorer. Chevrolet's new Avalanche pickup truck/SUV has
a North Face model. And Subaru has just unveiled an L.L. Bean
Outback _ big jump from hunting boots to cars but they've done it.
If Volkswagen manages to produce a new version of the Microbus _ as
it is attempting to do _ can a Peter Max model be far behind? And
will some school bus manufacturer give us the Ken Kesey edition?
</P>
<P>
   --How Pat and Mary Brooks, both in their mid-50s, are doing as
they attempt to drive a 1949 Buick Super ``Woody'' Wagon ``Around
the World in 80 Days.'' The Iowa couple are in a fleet of 40
vintage vehicles that left London earler this week in what is being
called the first motor rally to circumnavigate the globe. They're
all due back in London on July 18. Where do you find Buick parts in
Rangoon?
</P>
<P>
   --Why everybody _ save Jaguar, thank the Lord _ seems to have an
SUV, or several SUVs, in the works. Even Porsche, apparently afraid
consumers will add a competitor's SUV to their garage as a second
car instead of a second Porsche, will build an SUV. I just don't
see it.
</P>
<P>
   --How car companies come up with the names of the colors in
which they'll bathe their cars. Volkswagen brings that to mind this
week with two new colors for the New Beetle: Vapor and Reflex.
Vapor is a variation of blue, and I guess I can see that. But
Reflex is a tint of yellow. VW is calling the new colors so cutting
edge that you will be able to order Beetles in these colors only
over the Internet. Vapor. Reflex. How long before we get an SUV
coated in Imposing, or an overpowered sports car called Skittish? I
saw a diaper-yellow Toyota MR2 Spyder recently that I'd definitely
call Recoil.
</P>
<P>
   --How many of the popular Chrysler PT Cruisers survive intact
and how many get the aftermarket treatment. Already, an aftermarket
outfit called Performance West has come out with a ``PT Bruizer''
that adds racing seats, mesh grille, and a supercharger attached to
the original engine that boosts it from 150 to 210 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   --If Ford will ever get its act together on the Mustang Cobra,
ballyhooed and long awaited, but plagued by engine problems. Word
is, it will manage to produce around 300 SVT Cobra Rs _ billed as a
$55,000 match for the Porsche Boxster S and the ultimate Pony Car.
Not everyone is going to want to spend $55,000 on a Mustang, so
let's hope Ford gets its act together on the lesser model of the
Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   --And not to pick on Saab, but I still wonder why it never
produced the 900 Turbo 16 EV-1, which back in the mid-80s looked
like a cross between a Sonnett and a Datsun Z. It was a 2+2 with
nearly 170 horsepower _ and with added horsepower and AWD, would
look good even today as sports coupes abound.

CHRYSLER'S PT CRUISER LOOKS LIKE A HOT ROD, BUT ISN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   It was a startled bellow that emanated from deep in the
recycling shed at my local landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, will ya look at that!'' cried Alice, major domo of
all we recycle or discard in my little town.
</P>
<P>
   I have driven Jaguars and Porsches and Mercedes Benzes to the
landfill, cars that approached six figures in cost. Alice never
looked up. That was until I rolled in with the Chrysler PT Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Alice was not alone in her attraction to the hot little car
because there is no defined demographic slice drawn to the Cruiser.
It draws admirers the way a magnet draws iron filings, pulls them
across generations, from spirited automotive enthusiasts and those
who rarely glance at cars except as things of utility.
</P>
<P>
   It's a retro rig, reminiscent of the 1930s and '40s _ ``An Al
Capone car,'' Alice called it, though I look at it and see 1930s
Chrysler Airflow: upright windshield, high roof, high doors,
bulging fenders. The PT Cruiser _ minivan, truck, car depending on
your own point of view _ is a rounded departure from a trend,
breaking away from the boxy minivans that have become so uncool the
way the Airflow streamed away from the rectangular cars that were
so prevalent before its appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If the New Beetle was, well, the new Beetle, then the PT Cruiser
is the new minivan.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a minivan feel when you sit inside. High seats (and a
remarkable driver's seat that goes straight up and down for better
view), a nose that slopes away so you feel you are looking down at
the road, and a cavernous feel inside a cabin that is as
utilitarian as you will find. Chrysler claims it has 26
configurations and I couldn't find them all, but know this: The
rear seats split 65/35; you can fold them down; you can take them
out; the rear window ledge drops when the seats are folded down to
form a flat cargo area; the front passenger seat folds down and you
can carry 8-foot two-by-fours, a ladder, or skis in the space.
</P>
<P>
   It's got storage bins where most cars don't even have places.
Pockets and nets and sliding drawers throughout. It's almost as if,
inside, you are sitting in an appliance rather than an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   All this, while maintaining a retro feel with oval inserts in
the dash that match the exterior color, a tall, white-knobbed stick
shift in the standard, black-on-white gauges, and sturdy pillars
rising to a high ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Most switches are at center dash, even the switches for the
front windows (odd, I thought). Switches for the rear windows are
on the back of the center console (odder, I thought, and
inconvenient for the driver who has to reach back for them).
</P>
<P>
   There is ample leg- and headroom and the rear seat is a
veritable couch. The front buckets could use a bit more length
under the thigh, but they were firm and well sculpted and held well
on the sides in corners. Not, of course, that you'll be rolling
your PT Cruiser at high speeds on twisting roads. It's not made for
that. It's a cruiser with a small ``c'' in the performance sense.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a 2.4-liter, DOHC, four-cylinder engine that used about
21 miles per gallon in 10 days of testing. It's no rocket off the
line, and though it looks like a hot rod, it's not. What it is is a
front-wheel-drive transporter that felt remarkably like Volkwagen's
New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   As tall as it sits, it cornered quite well, with limited sense
of body roll. Fully loaded (two adults, three children), its engine
was not challenged on steep hills and it held its own in speedy
commuter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumbles that Chrysler will be offering a turbocharged
version of the Cruiser and that added touch could make this a
superb little car. As it is, I can just picture the aftermarket
aficionados lined up to take a crack at the fine base Chrysler has
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension in the PT Cruiser is independent up front with
struts, coil springs, and antiroll bar. The rear (avoiding struts
that would intrude on interior cargo space) has a rigid axle with
trailing arms, antiroll bar, and coil springs.
</P>
<P>
   At a base price of somewhere under $16,000, it is a fine
purchase, though I'd certainly fork out the extra dough for ABS and
traction control. There is also word that some dealers (will they
never learn?) are gouging on the price despite warnings from
headquarters that they shouldn't be. If you run into gouging, let
me know.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler plans to sell 150,000 PT Cruisers in the first model
year, and should have no problem doing so. Before the first one
ever hit a showroom they had nearly 400,000 inquiries from
prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   What Chrysler is selling here is not a feat of engineering. It's
Neon-based but better than the Neon, though certainly not as hot a
car as it looks. Its performance is just OK, and I cannot imagine
it with the automatic transmission. The long-throw, five-speed
standard is just the tranny for this rig and I suspect an automatic
would plod when coupled with this engine and the ton-and-a-half the
Cruiser weighs.
</P>
<P>
   No, what is being offered is an image, a feel, a sense of the
past with a great whiff of today's technology and dependability
tossed in.
</P>
<P>
   It may look hot, but this is about coolly cruising the open
road, windows down, radio blasting, a highway happening that
crosses generations. It is about rolling into a burger joint on a
hot summer evening, sticking a surfboard over folded-down seats and
heading for the beach, or cruising dark stretches of road until you
find that all-night diner.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a rig that can haul all you need for your college
dorm room, transporting kids and groceries in a
soccer-field-to-supermarket shuttle on a Saturday morning, about
nostalgia that won't break down.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? Go ask Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --The yoke-like door handles, front and rear, that you can grab
with a whole hand. No looking for just the right cranny in which to
slip two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --Nice armrest folds down for the driver. Why no armrest for the
front-seat passenger?

`SMALL TIME CROOKS': MONEY, CLASS AND KULTCHAH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Artistic ingenuousness is something that's difficult, if not
impossible to fake. That's one reason why Woody Allen's silly new
comedy, ``Small Time Crooks,'' is such a pleasantly surprising
little treat. In this sweet, funny wisp of a movie, Allen shucks
off his fabled angst and returns in spirit to those wide-eyed days
of yesteryear, before Chekhov, Kafka and Ingmar Bergman invaded his
creative imagination. As willfully goofy and freshly scrubbed as
Allen's 1969 directorial debut, ``Take the Money and Run,'' it
suggests that once a naif always a naif, that at the core of
Allen's sensibility persists an inviolable strain of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of this flighty caper comedy that begins as a spoof of
``Big Deal on Madonna Street,'' then morphs into something
resembling a child's-eye ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' often feels
as though it were being plucked out of thin air while the movie was
being shot. Put a bunch of children in an attic with a trunk full
of costumes and have them improvise a play and what they come up
with might well have the same short-term memory as ``Small Time
Crooks,'' in which some seemingly major characters all but
disappear once the movie shifts gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' suggests that despite the excoriating
bitterness of such '90s films as ``Husbands and Wives,''
``Deconstructing Harry'' and ``Celebrity,'' Allen is in many ways
still a wistful, wisecracking boy from Coney Island laughing at the
fancily dressed grown-ups and their pretensions as he munches
cotton candy, his nose pressed to the glass separating him from the
Manhattan dream world. Look, Ma! What are those weird little things
on the dining room table? They're finger bowls, dear.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's set in modern New York, the mood of ``Crooks''
feels like every movie decade (but especially the 1930s) compacted
into an eternal comic present. Like his ``Manhattan Murder
Mystery,'' the new film owes as much to 1930s screwball tradition
as it does to the present. Not the least of its accomplishments is
its portrayal of a bunch of colossally stupid people with trashy
tastes as adorable bumblers who emerge as much more human than the
rich and snooty sharks with whom they amusingly rub elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of objects of ridicule, the movie treats its ``little
people'' as true-blue common folk whose vulgar tastes reflect a
groundedness and even decency, notwithstanding their lust for
larceny. For a self-conscious intellectual like Allen to
convincingly express such generosity toward the unlettered is
disarming. When one character confuses Henry James with Harry
James, instead of sneering with the snob whose highbrow
name-dropping sails over his companion's head, we sympathize with
her humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   What sets the story whirring is a preposterous scheme for a bank
heist proposed by Ray Winkler ( Allen), a meek, addle-brained
ex-convict whose socially ambitious wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman),
a former New Jersey stripper, harbors dreams of becoming a
Manhattan hostess of wealth and culture. Ray's solution to their
dire financial plight is to rent a vacant store next to a bank and
set up a phony storefront business while he and his accomplices _
Denny (Michael Rapaport), Tommy (Tony Darrow) and Benny (John
Lovitz) _ attempt to tunnel from the basement into the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the movie's funniest moments observe the incompetence of
these inept fools who drill into a wall only to rupture a water
main. Meanwhile, upstairs, the cookie shop that Frenchy has opened
unexpectedly takes off and quickly makes the Winklers wealthy
beyond their wildest dreams. At this point, the movie abruptly
drops its caper plot to concentrate on the Winklers' embattled
ascent up the social ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In this middle chapter of a three-part story, Frenchy, who
speaks in the same nasal cadences as Ullman's television character
Fern Rosenthal, more or less takes over the movie. Pursuing her
quest for higher things, this good-hearted, credulous arriviste
places her dreams in the lap of David (Hugh Grant), a charming,
unscrupulous art dealer whom she employs as her Park Avenue
Pygmalion.
</P>
<P>
   Ray soon decides he wants none of this high culture business.
He'd much rather stay at home in their tchotchke-stuffed apartment
(hideous souvenir dolls line the bookcases and table surface and
the living room is adorned with a huge gold harp), drink beer and
play poker. As David pitches snooty high-cultural woo to Frenchy,
Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of
charm and nasty calculation.
</P>
<P>
   The story takes another U-turn, and suddenly Ray and Frenchy
collaborate on another robbery scheme. This time it's the theft of
a priceless necklace from Chi Chi Potter (Elaine Stritch), a
wealthy art patron. This final turn of the story is the most
problematic part of the movie, because it relies more on
sitcom-ready plot twists than social satire for its humor. Allen
often seems careless in the way he ends his comedies. And even for
a movie as scatterbrained as this one, the outcome of ``Small Time
Crooks'' feels rushed and pat.
</P>
<P>
   The fleeting delights have to do with its tone, its light and
lovely throwaway humor, and its deftly easygoing performances. In
softening his standard schlemiel to make Ray more of a stumblebum
than a whiner, Allen has come up with yet a new, likable variation
on a familiar character. Ullman's Frenchy is such a twinkling,
upbeat vulgarian that you wish her discontinued HBO series,
``Tracey Takes On ... ,'' would be revived immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is nearly stolen by Elaine May, as Frenchy's dimwitted
cousin May, who goes to work at the cookie shop and unwittingly
spills the beans about the heist every time she opens her mouth.
May is the kind of stubbornly eager dullard who sends guests
running at a swank Manhattan party by enthusiastically burbling out
the day's weather to anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   How light is ``Small Time Crooks''? So light it makes Allen's
last film, ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' seem almost Dostoyevskian by
comparison. But it is also funny enough to leave you smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Small Time Crooks'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested). It includes some mild off-color humor.

`ROAD TRIP': RESTAURANT PROTOCOL AND OTHER HELPFUL TIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' has a serious lesson to impart. Never, ever send a
plate of French toast back to a restaurant kitchen because it
happens to be sprinkled with powdered sugar. If that plate should
be returned denuded of the dreaded topping by a waiter who seems a
tad too obsequious when he plops it down in front of you, it's
probably because he knows where that French toast has just been,
and you don't. And trust me, you don't want to. If you have any
notions of eating what is smilingly put before you, think again, no
matter how appetizing it may appear.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be notorious French toast sequence in ``Road Trip,''
this season's probable hit in the post-teen-age gross-out genre
revived two years ago by ``There's Something About Mary,'' is one
of more than half a dozen such sequences that should keep young
audiences chortling, snorting and snickering over the next several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Road Trip'' doesn't feature stars of the magnitude of
Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon, it may not make as much
money as its prototype. But it reveals its director Todd Phillips
and his screenwriting partner Scot Armstrong as clever mad
scientists of dumb cinematic raunch. They know exactly how far to
push the envelope without earning their film an NC-17 rating. Both
seem to possess a demonic understanding of how buried in the
deepest recesses of the primmest sensibility lurks a pimply,
potty-mouthed adolescent yanking down his pants and screaming for
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Vying with French toast for No. 1 on the list of the movie's
farcically raunchy bits is a scene set in a sperm bank in which an
alarmingly aggressive nurse helps an unsuspecting young man
discover the erogenous potential of his nether parts. Then there's
a corpulent woman's seduction of a chicken-chested male virgin so
skinny he makes Don Knotts look like a Charles Atlas graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Like the drugged-dog jokes and the hair gel sequence in ``Mary''
and the pie and beer scenes in last year's ``American Pie,'' ``Road
Trip's'' carefully planted comic shocks are this movie's primary
raison d'etre. Yet even in these tactics there can be discerned the
glimmerings of an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Beth (Amy Smart), the flaxen-haired college girl
who is the movie's closest thing to a heroine, is sexually forward
in a way that only designated ``sluts'' are allowed to be in
Hollywood movies. Far from being punished for her lustful ways in
``Road Trip,'' she is ultimately rewarded with something like true
love. Chalk one up for girl power.
</P>
<P>
   The sperm bank scene, for all its outrageous exaggeration,
insinuates a more polymorphous perverse view of male sexuality than
Hollywood movies almost ever allow. And as comical as it appears
with its clashing body types, the (interracial) sex scene has an
underlying sweetness. His sexual initiation transforms the movie's
97-pound weakling into a psychic he-man who musters the courage to
stand up to his bullying dad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``Road Trip'' follows the desperate cross-country dash
of Josh (Breckin Meyer), a student at Ithaca College, and three
fellow students to Texas to intercept a pornographic home video
that was accidentally mailed to Josh's longtime sweetheart at the
University of Austin. In that video, Josh, who has pledged his
fidelity to his 1,800-mile-distant girlfriend, is shown being
seduced by Beth, with whom he won a date at an auction.
</P>
<P>
   To make the trip, the boys strong-arm Kyle (DJ Qualls), a
quivering little milquetoast whom they normally wouldn't give the
time of day, into lending them his father's car with the implicit
promise that he is now one of them. It almost goes without saying
that the precious vehicle is doomed. But the manner of its
destruction, following a spectacular flying leap across the gap in
a rickety wooden bridge, is as funny an auto demolition as any
movie has given us in some time.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``There's Something About Mary,'' ``Road Trip'' has the
loose shambling structure of a rock 'n' roll shaggy dog story and
no pretenses to realism. Where ``Mary'' had a strolling troubadour
nudging the story along, ``Road Trip'' is narrated by Barry (the
MTV comedy star Tom Green), the travelers' geeky friend, who
remains in Ithaca so he can have the opportunity to feed white mice
to his roommate's insatiable pet python. When the snake loses its
appetite, Barry, crazed with visions of animal carnage, momentarily
(and hilariously) confuses himself with the reptile.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Road Trip'' is a hit, it is likely to inspire the usual
puritanical hand-wringing about the foul state of movies and
Hollywood's going to hell in a handbasket. But if you think back a
few years, this movie is a lot funnier (and, dare I say, smarter)
than the last cycle of gross-out movies initiated by ``Porky's.''
As we all know, bad taste is timeless. And sometimes it can be so
funny that you can't help laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Road Trip'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, nudity, strong
language and many pungently off-color jokes.

`DINOSAUR': JURASSIC LARK: REX OF THE CARTOON JUNGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reputedly the most expensive animated feature film ever made,
``Dinosaur'' may also boast the longest, most crowded end credits
in the history of cinema. After the winsome reptilians and their
primate pals, paleontologically doubtful but ever so cute, have
wandered off into the Cretaceous sunset, the screen fills with
rapidly scrolling double columns of names, identifying the few
hundred people who labored to bring those extinct, eternally
fascinating beasts back to life.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly endless list of software designers, code writers
and technicians seems more like a matter for the Justice
Department's antitrust division than a roster of movie-making
talent, but this vast committee, superintended by the directors
Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton, has used a lot of new-fangled
technology to work some gratifyingly old-fashioned magic.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that ``Dinosaur'' was filmed in a dozen
real-world locations, including Hawaii, Venezuela, Australia and
the Los Angeles County Arboretum, you may expect a disclaimer
vowing that no actual dinosaurs were harmed during production.
Marianne Moore once likened poems to ``imaginary gardens with real
toads in them.'' Walt Disney Pictures has spared no expense to find
real gardens and populate them with meticulously imagined,
computer-generated reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   From an initial close-up of ridged, rippling hide _ evocative of
a breathing, flexing piece of exquisitely textured high-end luggage
_ ``Dinosaur'' begins, in time- and market-tested Disney fashion,
with a breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that
the rest of the movie never quite lives up to. Those scores of
animators and technical advisers have conjured a teeming pre-human
world, and the first minutes of the film present it in swooping,
eye-filling panorama.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is as luxuriant and intoxicating as a theme park
ride; more remarkably, it feels like a real movie, as if the
flights of giant birds, the stampede of herds and the ruminant
movements of leaf-eaters were all being captured by a camera,
rather than generated inside a computer.
</P>
<P>
   This long ersatz tracking shot follows the progress, airborne
and underwater, of a purloined Iguanadon egg, which at last alights
in a quiet island treetop populated by a clan of friendly lemurs.
At this point, the movie itself touches down in familiar territory
and pursues a narrative cobbled (by half a dozen credited writers
and story-hatchers) from previous Disney films. The egg hatches
into an orphan named Aladar, whose fate is the subject of a debate
between mommy and daddy lemurs almost identical to the argument
between Tarzan's adoptive gorilla parents. Maternalism prevails,
the stern paternal heart is melted, and soon Aladar is a frisky
adolescent capering with his young lemur friends and emoting in the
dulcet tones of D.B. Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   The young dinosaur's identity crisis is pre-empted by a giant
asteroid, which unleashes a barrage of lethal, spectacular effects,
including mushroom cloud, shock wave and firestorm. Don't worry:
This is a Disney film, and mass extinction would be far too
downbeat, but the lemur's leafy paradise is destroyed, along with a
great many lemurs. (Their deaths are carefully implied, rather than
shown, to minimize upset among the youngest viewers.) Aladar
manages to save his family, which includes the requisite gruff
patriarch (Ossie Davis), the wise, nurturing mother (Alfre Woodard)
and the wise-cracking juvenile sidekick (Max Casella, who can't
hope to match Rosie O'Donnell's rambunctious gorilla or Samuel E.
Wright's singing lobster in previous Disney family outings). They
soon stumble upon a herd of dinosaurs making their way to the
promised land _ that is, the nesting grounds _ where all the
diverse, noncarnivorous species will be joined in the circle of
life.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm ahead of the story. Along the way, the trekkers must
contend with predatory carnotaurs (only pedantic 6-year-olds will
object if you insist on calling them T. rexes) and the consequences
of ecological catastrophe as they cross a desert littered with
bleached skeletons and picked-over carcasses. Aladar befriends a
pair of kind, slow, elderly female dinosaurs: Eema, a folksy
Styrachosaur (Della Reese), and Baylene, a sweet, enormous
Brachiosaur (Joan Plowright). He develops a crush on a spirited
female Iguanadon named Neera (Julianna Margulies) and falls afoul
of her brother, Kron ( Wright in a growly turn) and his enforcer,
Bruton (Peter Siragusa).
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Kron and Aladar comes down to a disagreement
about survival tactics. Kron, a hard-core Darwinian realist,
insists that only the strong deserve to survive, and that weaklings
and slowpokes like Baylene and Eema should be sacrificed to the
greater good. Aladar, perhaps because he was raised by primates,
embraces more advanced theories of altruism and evolved
cooperation. The dispute is settled in a no-holds-barred saurian
alpha male smack-down, the outcome of which is hardly in doubt. In
a Disney movie, after all, good always triumphs over evil _ or, in
the moral idiom of the target audience, the nice ones beat the mean
ones.
</P>
<P>
   And the mean ones are pretty convincingly mean. Although nobody
knows what dinosaurs sounded like _ there is a rough consensus
among paleontologists that they didn't sound like D.B. Sweeney or
Margulies _ the soundtrack is full of plausibly reptilian (or
proto-avian, since it's now thought that they evolved into birds)
roars, bellows and coos. The reason to see this movie is not to
listen to the dinosaurs but to watch them move, to marvel at their
graceful necks and clumsy limbs and notice how convincingly they
emerge into sunlight or get wet.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the art evolves so rapidly that Aladar may soon
look as cheesy as Godzilla to the children already clamoring for
toys made in his likeness. Adults who grew up on traditional
animation may notice the seams between the computer-generated
figures and their real backgrounds and wish that the figures
themselves had more warmth and substance. But I'm loath to
contradict the opinion of the preschool cinephile and dinosaur
enthusiast in whose company I saw the movie. ``What did you think
of it?'' I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary and cool and nice,'' he replied.

   What more could you want?

&HT;     BUSH'S OLD SOFT-SHOE ROUTINE PUTS GORE ON THE DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 21)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nimble-footed dexterity of Gene Kelly
singing and dancing amid a torrent of raindrops, George W. Bush
taps his way with confidence from one ideological camp to another.
In doing that, he often dismays his friends and disarms his foes.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he overwhelmed his opponents in South Carolina's
Republican primary because pillars of the religious right believed
he stood as one with them and Pat Robertson in their opposition to
abortion in any form or for any reason. At the same time,
unreconstructed Southerners reveled in Bush's contention that
flying the Confederate flag, a last sad symbol of slavery, over the
state capital is nobody's business but theirs.
</P>
<P>
   When his visit to Bob Jones University ignited a bonfire of
controversy, Bush quickly claimed he was sorry he had not spoken
out against the school's religious and racial bigotry. He also
wrote to New York's influential Cardinal John O'Connor to deny that
he had any prejudice against Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then donned the raiment of Republican moderate and won
enough delegate votes to clinch the party's presidential
nomination. Next, he soft-shoed his way with some success into
vineyards that once were considered the Democrats' sacred domain.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he has seemed to transform Al Gore, the candidate
of the party that traditionally prides itself on its record of
social and economic reform, into a stodgy stand-patter.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Gore is cast in the old Republican role of
defender of the status quo. When Bush unveils an initiative _ as he
has done with taxes, education and Social Security _ Gore
undertakes the thankless task of saying no. He may be right, but he
sounds negative.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has latched onto proposals that Republicans have been
advancing for some time: school vouchers, the investment of Social
Security funds in the stock market and a massive tax cut similar to
President Ronald Reagan's 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Bush has announced that he will make trigger
safety locks for handguns available across Texas and, if elected
president, throughout the nation. His initiative is a shrewd one
that may please some advocates of gun control, while not
displeasing the nay-sayers of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Gore appears to be defending the current,
oft-criticized public school system while Bush claims his plan
would give parents a greater choice in the education of their
children through taxpayer-supported vouchers that would permit them
to attend private schools, including parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore argues that it is unconstitutional and wrong to use public
funds to enroll children in religious schools and that the better
course is to hire more and better teachers and improve public
school facilities. But his words do not appear to win voter
approval in the way that Bush's do.
</P>
<P>
   Yet under Bush's plan a lot of children could be disappointed.
They would discover that the facilities of private schools,
parochial or otherwise, are often limited and that most youngsters
will have to remain where they are while tax money provides the way
to possibly better schools for some of their friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Social Security, Bush advocates that younger
contributors to the 65-year old system be permitted to invest in
personal retirement accounts whose income would be derived from the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   That might be all right for individuals who understand the
erratic ways of the market and the fact that they can lose as well
as gain by investing part of their retirement income themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Would the federal government be willing to step in and reimburse
them for their losses? Or would they find themselves in their
sixties, seventies and eighties trying to live off far less income
than they had anticipated?
</P>
<P>
   Social Security was created by Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Congress in 1935, at the depth of the Great Depression when few
private businesses provided pensions for their employees. It has
been one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of programs created
by the federal government to help people.
</P>
<P>
   Where seniors once found themselves homeless and money-less,
they now can depend at least on the stipend from Social Security.
Millions of Americans have almost nothing besides Social Security
and Medicare to sustain them in their sunset years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Americans like to gamble and take chances that
could lead to financial betterment, which is why they flock to
racetracks and buy lottery tickets. Many already are in the stock
market and doing quite well. But the market is not always going to
be as buoyant is it has been in recent years. The national economy
is certain to decline to some degree in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Before we leap we should look very carefully at where we're
going. Meanwhile, it might do Al Gore good to don some dancing
slippers and tap his way through the remainder of the campaign,
unveiling popular initiatives as he bounces along.
</P>
<P>
   Time is on his side. Election Day is more than five months away.

   Conan Doyle, on Holmes
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really terribly important after the war when all the
young men needed contacting,'' Sir Arthur Conan Doyle says rather
breezily on camera during a 10-minute address he delivers on a DVD
recently released by Focusfilm, a distributor in Ossining, N.Y. It
was 1926, and by his remarks and manner the writer clearly wants to
be done with his celebrated creation, the detective Sherlock
Holmes, and move on to matters that he considers more serious:
psychic experiences and communication with the beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The young men he refers to were killed during World War I.
Holmes, he seems to imply, would be better off laid to rest himself
if only the public would permit it. One gets the impression that
Conan Doyle agreed to speak about his detective only if he could
then devote most of his talk to spiritual matters. People are
convinced Holmes is alive, he says incredulously. Women propose to
him. As if to calm alarmists, he adds that of course he will go on
writing about Holmes and his ``rather stupid friend Watson.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same disc, part of a set of four, is ``Terror by Night,''
a Holmes adventure filmed by Universal during the '40s with Basil
Rathbone as the detective and Nigel Bruce as Watson. At 54 minutes,
it is the shortest of a dozen of Rathbone's Holmes films and takes
place entirely on a train as the detective reveals everything about
the theft of the fabled Star of Rhodesia diamond, including the
fact that it really wasn't stolen at all but remained in Holmes'
pocket throughout the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The detective brings off other nice surprises in three other
cases on the discs: ``Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon''
(1942), ``The Woman in Green'' (1945) and ``Dressed to Kill''
(1946), which was Rathbone's last Holmes film. By then he had
played the role more than 200 times, not only on screen but on the
radio in ``The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.'' In those days,
stars walked over to the sound stage after they were finished on
the set. Nearly four hours of these broadcasts are on each disc,
with dozens of cases involving the likes of the unfortunate
tobacconist, demon barber, headless monk and guileless gypsy.
</P>
<P>
   Though aloof and inscrutable, Rathbone's Holmes is warmer and
less severe than Jermey Brett's in the BBC television series.
Gentle fun is made of Watson, a bumbler with old-school chums
called Stinky and the Major. Women are ravishing and dangerous in
the way they often were in '40s films, especially Patricia Morrison
in ``Dressed to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rathbone naturally took to disguises, which are as plentiful as
trunks and caskets with false bottoms. In ``The Woman in Green,''
Professor Moriarty, Holmes' arch-enemy, reappears, played by Henry
Daniell, whom Rathbone called the most effective of the Moriartys.
</P>
<P>
   The movies come from the National Film Museum, a large archive
in Bangor, Me., that provides old film to producers and
distributors. As with many DVD's, the picture quality is only as
good as the original materials. ``They'd gone the gamut into
television release and other things,'' said Al Taylor, the
company's president. ``There were only old library prints so we had
to do a lot.'' It was enough.
</P>

   NEW RELEASES

   Sleepy Hollow

   Heads roll and roll in Tim Burton's exuberantly dark and
expressionistic reworking of the Washington Irving story. Sent up
the Hudson River to investigate some killings, the squeamish
detective Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp, left, with Christina Ricci)
encounters a horseman from hell (Christopher Walken), headless
himself, hacking a seemingly random swath through the
conspiratorial citizenry of Sleepy Hollow. Burton renders the
Irving story unrecognizable, but an ornate fantasy should make its
own rules, and, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``
`Sleepy Hollow' does that with macabre gusto.''

   The World Is Not Enough

   From a traditional swift opening, Michael Apted's film lifts the
James Bond franchise onto a somewhat more mature plane. As Elektra,
Sophie Marceau gets slinky costumes and skiing and boudoir
sequences befitting an ally of the terrorist Renard (Robert
Carlyle). Conversely, Denise Richards seems barely out of high
school as a scientist whose expertise with plutonium is counted
upon to deliver the world from Renard. The elevation is provided by
007 himself. In his third Bond film, Pierce Brosnan ``bears
noticeably more resemblance to a real human being'' (Maslin).

   Like ``Tumbleweeds,'' Wayne Wang's film follows a mother and
daughter on a cross-country escape. ``You're gonna die one day too,
Mom, just like the rest of us,'' the 14-year-old Ann (Natalie
Portman) says sarcastically to her mother, Adele (Susan Sarandon),
before the two leave Bay City, Wis. ``But not in this town,'' Adele
replies. For no good reason Adele has gotten it into her head that
life holds more promise in Beverly Hills, Calif. Being the more
mature of the two, Ann tries to be a teen-ager while acting as
anchor for a childish parent. As for Wang, he ``once again works
splendidly with actresses, and boy, does he have a lot to work with
this time'' (Maslin).

On her trail, a British intelligence agent and surveillance expert
called the Eye (Ewan McGregor) always stays in the same hotel as
she does, pressing his ear to the bathroom tile to hear her
splashing around in the tub beyond the wall. The Eye also has
visions of the young daughter he hasn't seen in years, which leaves
him consumed with guilt, or so we are left to believe in Stephan
Elliott's ``impenetrable mess of a movie'' (Stephen Holden).

   THE SOURCE. Chuck Workman's stirring kaleidoscopic documentary
with dramatized readings reveals much about the Beat writers Jack
Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs. (Even viewers who
know a lot about Kerouac may be surprised by his later talk-show
appearances.) Johnny Depp intones Kerouac, Dennis Hopper echoes
Burroughs and John Turturro puts fierce emotion into Ginsberg's
``Howl.'' Those interviewed include Ginsberg, Kerouac, Neal Cassady
and Norman Mailer, and music is provided by Philip Glass, Bob
Dylan, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and many others. ``However
well known the assorted Beat legends have become,'' Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, ``there is a cumulative power to
seeing so many of them evoked so colorfully in a single film.''

 &HT;    There's no place like Oz
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ali Sharp does not know who the short man in the
white get-up is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see me in `The Terror of Tiny Town'? '' he asks. ``I
had seven parts in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he continues, his eyes growing wider with excitement as
the 12-year-old girl's grow wider with confusion. ``I played the
foreman of the ranch, the stagecoach driver, a member of the
sheriff's posse, a bad guy the sheriff's posse was chasing, a
double for two men when they mounted and dismounted horses, and I
was also singing in a bar scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee,'' says Ali, still clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Swensen hugs her and goes on to meet the next person in
line at the Northcross Mall promotional event for ``The Wizard on
Ice.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ali is a bit confused, maybe it's because the producers of
this retelling of ``The Wizard of Oz'' didn't hire Swensen on the
basis of his star turns in ``The Terror of Tiny Town.'' They hired
the Pflugerville resident because 62 years ago he received the
greatest honor a midget actor knows: He was cast as a Munchkin.
</P>
<P>
   When someone tells Ali that meeting Swensen is huge _ he is one
of only 11 surviving cast members, all Munchkins _ she returns.
This time, Swensen demonstrates the ``German goose step march''
that he and the other Munchkin soldiers did right before Dorothy
followed The Yellow Brick Road.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Ali is amused. ``Wow, I'm not going to wash my hands
now,'' she says. ``No, I'm not going to take a bath. He hugged
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Swensen, all 4 feet 6 3/4 inches of him, has made another person
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Austin, Clarence ``Shorty'' Swensen has never bragged
about his celluloid immortality. He never mentioned it to
co-workers during his 28 years as an electronic technician at the
University of Texas. Just once, when his three children were in
grade school, did he speak to a class about it.
</P>
<P>
   A minor role by all accounts, it has nonetheless made him a star
to the Oz world. There is one, you know. Oz, which this year is
celebrating its centennial as a fictional realm, is a hot
commodity. Oz memorabilia sells at inflated prices on eBay. The
International Wizard of Oz Club boasts 2,500 members and its own
Web site (www.ozclub.org). And America's three Oz festivals attract
hundreds of thousands of fans every year.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight years ago, when he started making public appearances,
did Swensen begin to embrace their attention. Why? ``It has enabled
me to see everything that is great and beautiful,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   LETTER OUT OF NOWHERE
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, the 19-year-old Shorty _ the nickname he got at Allan
Junior High _ was invited to join Stanley R. Graham's All Midget
Circus at the Texas Centennial Fair in Dallas. John and Winifred
Clifton of Austin, billed as the only midget couple in the world
with a midget child (Myrna, age 10), knew Swensen and put in a good
word. John Clifton, one of the original Buster Browns who traveled
the country making appearances for the shoe company, had a lot of
clout in the midget community.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen had little talent, so he sold tickets. He didn't see the
work as demeaning, like carnival freaks put on exhibit. Midgets,
many of them uneducated, had a hard time finding other work.
</P>
<P>
   The All Midget Circus folded a year later, when a string of
rainy days kept people away in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen returned to Austin to try to finish high school. But his
academic career was interrupted by ``the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a round-trip train ticket in it,'' he says, still
surprised. All the midgets connected with the circus got the same
letters.
</P>
<P>
   He was instructed to travel to Los Angeles to ``be in a movie.''
It turned out to be ``The Terror of Tiny Town,'' an all-midget
Western now regarded as one of the worst films ever made.
</P>
<P>
   His second film was one of the best. MGM tried to find 300
midgets to dance and sing and protect Dorothy from the Wicked Witch
of the West, but could only locate 125. Children were used to fill
out the crowd shots.
</P>
<P>
   He earned $50 a week, $700 total. Toto, Dorothy's dog, had a
better agent; he got $125. ``I looked at it as just a job,'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   If you look closely, you can spot Swensen in the Munchkin Land
scene when Dorothy gets in the carriage to head to Emerald City.
``We're marching behind the carriage, right to left on the screen.
I'm the first soldier on the fourth row, camera side,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He got to talk to Judy Garland twice, and she was ``nice. She
invited some of us to walk through her dressing room. We got a kick
out of that.'' He treasures an autographed picture Garland gave him
_ his only memento of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming, he got his third movie part, in ``Tarzan
Finds A Son,'' starring Johnny Weissmuller. This paycheck was even
bigger: $800. He played a chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   After the limelight, Swensen returned to Austin to again pursue
a high school diploma. He was working for the National Youth
Administration when World War II broke out. He landed a job as a
radio technician at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. One
weekend in 1941, the 24-year-old returned home one Saturday and
took in a movie at the Paramount. He was heading to the bus stop,
when he ran into his old colleagues the Cliftons and their daughter
Myrna, now 16.
</P>
<P>
   He talked to the Cliftons but couldn't keep his eyes off the
beautiful girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home every weekend after that,'' says Myrna. They got
married in 1945 and had three daughters _ two are midgets _ who
have given them five grandchildren (none midgets).
</P>
<P>
   Swensen joined UT and remained there until 1973, when he moved
to a state job delivering in-house mail. He retired in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   All those years, and hardly a mention of his role in one of the
most celebrated films of all time. In fact, he can't remember when
he first saw the movie. It was several years after it was released.
``To me, it was just a movie. I had a small part and that was it. I
watched it and I thought it was a nice movie,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At school, his kids never bragged about their dad's obscure
fame. Maybe a neighbor knew, but that was it.
</P>
<P>
   TIME AGAIN IN OZ Until 1989, when he was invited to attend the
movie's 50th anniversary in Liberal, Kansas. This was his first
contact with any of Munchkins since the making of the film. After
that, he was invited to the annual Oz celebrations in Chesterton,
Ind., and Chittenango, N.Y., the birthplace of Frank Baum, who
wrote the original ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go because of the kids that we meet. They bring a tear to my
eye and I begin to live it all again. And the adults who yell, `Oh!
There's a Munchkin! A real live Munchkin!' They get more excited
than the children,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When Steven Cox, author of ``The Munchkins Remember'' and ``The
Munchkins of Oz,'' met Swensen in 1988 to interview him for the
first book, he was ``hesitant and suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't understand why anyone would be interested in a job
he had 50 years ago that lasted a few weeks. It's overwhelmed him.
He's surprised that people have become fans. None of the Munchkins
had any idea what the fascination was from the rest of the country
and the world,'' says Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen now understands all the fuss. He and Myrna receive
all-expense paid trips to the three Oz festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat us grand,'' says Swensen. ``It's probably the best
thing in the world that's happened to me, getting to meet the other
Munchkins at the festivals. `Munchkin' is a family name to us, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   At the festivals, he sells autographed pictures of himself in
Munchkin soldier costume for $10. Cox says he's seen the pictures
sell for $50 on eBay. Myrna, who has been making beaded Christmas
ornaments for many years, started making Oz ornaments 10 years ago
and selling them at the festivals. The set of eight _ Dorothy,
Toto, Scarecrow, Tinman, Cowardly Lion, Glinda the good witch, the
Wicked Witch of the West and a Munchkin soldier _ sells for $44.
They go quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had offers to sell them on the Internet, but I can't even
keep up with the orders now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   People have offered to sell them in collector shops and even
mass produce them, but she's turned them down. ``Then they're not
made by a wife of a Munchkin,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen hopes to keep this up a long time. He's 82 but looks
much younger.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many more people he can make happy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because of the wonderful things he does.

 &HT;    `Small Time' is a good time
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Remember the space alien in Woody Allen's
``Stardust Memories'' who advised him to make funnier movies?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the prolific director-screenwriter either just got the
message or momentarily ran dry of personal crises to base his
latest movie on.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, ``Small Time Crooks'' is a refreshingly
angst-free, lightweight entertainment, an unalloyed comedy that
will bring to mind his 1969 filmmaking debut, ``Take the Money and
Run.''
</P>
<P>
   For Allen is back as a schlemiel of a bank-robber wannabe, lowly
ex-con-turned-dishwasher Ray Winkler, who yearns to tunnel into a
New York bank, steal a couple of million bucks and flee to a new
life in Miami. But first he has to talk his manicurist wife,
Frenchy (a frumpy, shrewish Tracy Ullman), into giving him their
life savings for heist supplies. And get her to pose as a cookie
baker in a shop near the bank, while he and a band of truly stupid
accomplices drill loudly in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Italian caper picture ``Big Deal on Madonna Street''
that may have been Allen's inspiration, the crooks are completely
inept and soon caught. The first 20 minutes of ``Small Time
Crooks'' is all obvious humor, saved only by the performances.
Notably, there is Elaine May as Frenchy's dense cousin May, who
knows nothing about the bank job yet still gives them away.
Fortunately, Allen soon gets bored with this plot and shifts away
from it to focus on the consequences of Frenchy's extraordinary
success with her cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, she is franchising her recipes, rolling in dough and
indulging her excessive taste in clothes and furnishings. Steve
Kroft of ``60 Minutes'' even does a cream-puff feature on her
eccentric Sunset Farms corporation. Frenchy can buy anything but
what she really wants _ respect. She is courted by the board
members of opera societies and museums, who gleefully take her
money and laugh behind her back.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchy itches to become cultured, while Ray is content to watch
television at home in his underwear, so they drift apart.
Eventually, Frenchy encounters far bigger time crooks than Ray
could ever dream of becoming. A solicitous Hugh Grant educates her
in life's finer things in order to tap into her wealth, while her
accountant is simply an embezzler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' is funny, not profound. Settle happily for
some amusing broad comedy and the message that money isn't
everything, so we should appreciate what we have.
</P>
<P>
   Appreciate Ullman, who blooms as she goes corporate, wearing
wacky Suzanne McCabe gowns with eccentric flair. The character is
too cartoonish to take very seriously, yet as she gets duped by
Grant, Ullman makes us care about her. Appreciate May, who has been
away from performing too long. Her ditsy, socially inept role is a
stock character, not far from the one May wrote for herself in ``A
New Leaf `` almost 30 years ago. But she gives each line a
delicious spin that continues to earn laughs, even when you can see
the joke coming from far off.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to Kenneth Branagh and Sean Penn, who have starred in
recent Allen features, but no one can deliver his dialogue quite
like he can. As Ray, he adds a blue-collar touch that feels a bit
forced, but Allen's comic timing is otherwise pitch-perfect, and he
plays off Ullman so well.
</P>
<P>
   His movies probably never will have wide appeal, but this one
should prove more popular than most of his releases of the past
decade. Allen used to make films influenced by the dour Ingmar
Bergman. As the banter between Ray and Frenchy suggests, as well as
the final line of the movie, ``Small Time Crooks'' is his homage to
``The Honeymooners.''

rainy days kept people away in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen returned to Austin to try to finish high school. But his
academic career was interrupted by ``the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a round-trip train ticket in it,'' he says, still
surprised. All the midgets connected with the circus got the same
letters.
</P>
<P>
   He was instructed to travel to Los Angeles to ``be in a movie.''
It turned out to be ``The Terror of Tiny Town,'' an all-midget
Western now regarded as one of the worst films ever made.
</P>
<P>
   His second film was one of the best. MGM tried to find 300
midgets to dance and sing and protect Dorothy from the Wicked Witch
of the West, but could only locate 125. Children were used to fill
out the crowd shots.
</P>
<P>
   He earned $50 a week, $700 total. Toto, Dorothy's dog, had a
better agent; he got $125. ``I looked at it as just a job,'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   If you look closely, you can spot Swensen in the Munchkin Land
scene when Dorothy gets in the carriage to head to Emerald City.
``We're marching behind the carriage, right to left on the screen.
I'm the first soldier on the fourth row, camera side,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He got to talk to Judy Garland twice, and she was ``nice. She
invited some of us to walk through her dressing room. We got a kick
out of that.'' He treasures an autographed picture Garland gave him
_ his only memento of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming, he got his third movie part, in ``Tarzan
Finds A Son,'' starring Johnny Weissmuller. This paycheck was even
bigger: $800. He played a chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO AUSTIN
</P>
<P>
   After the limelight, Swensen returned to Austin to again pursue
a high school diploma. He was working for the National Youth
Administration when World War II broke out. He landed a job as a
radio technician at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. One
weekend in 1941, the 24-year-old returned home one Saturday and
took in a movie at the Paramount. He was heading to the bus stop,
when he ran into his old colleagues the Cliftons and their daughter
Myrna, now 16.
</P>
<P>
   He talked to the Cliftons but couldn't keep his eyes off the
beautiful girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home every weekend after that,'' says Myrna. They got
married in 1945 and had three daughters _ two are midgets _ who
have given them five grandchildren (none midgets).
</P>
<P>
   Swensen joined UT and remained there until 1973, when he moved
to a state job delivering in-house mail. He retired in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   All those years, and hardly a mention of his role in one of the
most celebrated films of all time. In fact, he can't remember when
he first saw the movie. It was several years after it was released.
``To me, it was just a movie. I had a small part and that was it. I
watched it and I thought it was a nice movie,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At school, his kids never bragged about their dad's obscure
fame. Maybe a neighbor knew, but that was it.
</P>
<P>
   TIME AGAIN IN OZ Until 1989, when he was invited to attend the
movie's 50th anniversary in Liberal, Kansas. This was his first
contact with any of Munchkins since the making of the film. After
that, he was invited to the annual Oz celebrations in Chesterton,
Ind., and Chittenango, N.Y., the birthplace of Frank Baum, who
wrote the original ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go because of the kids that we meet. They bring a tear to my
eye and I begin to live it all again. And the adults who yell, `Oh!
There's a Munchkin! A real live Munchkin!' They get more excited
than the children,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When Steven Cox, author of ``The Munchkins Remember'' and ``The
Munchkins of Oz,'' met Swensen in 1988 to interview him for the
first book, he was ``hesitant and suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't understand why anyone would be interested in a job
he had 50 years ago that lasted a few weeks. It's overwhelmed him.
He's surprised that people have become fans. None of the Munchkins
had any idea what the fascination was from the rest of the country
and the world,'' says Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen now understands all the fuss. He and Myrna receive
all-expense paid trips to the three Oz festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat us grand,'' says Swensen. ``It's probably the best
thing in the world that's happened to me, getting to meet the other
Munchkins at the festivals. `Munchkin' is a family name to us, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   At the festivals, he sells autographed pictures of himself in
Munchkin soldier costume for $10. Cox says he's seen the pictures
sell for $50 on eBay. Myrna, who has been making beaded Christmas
ornaments for many years, started making Oz ornaments 10 years ago
and selling them at the festivals. The set of eight _ Dorothy,
Toto, Scarecrow, Tinman, Cowardly Lion, Glinda the good witch, the
Wicked Witch of the West and a Munchkin soldier _ sells for $44.
They go quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had offers to sell them on the Internet, but I can't even
keep up with the orders now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   People have offered to sell them in collector shops and even
mass produce them, but she's turned them down. ``Then they're not
made by a wife of a Munchkin,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen hopes to keep this up a long time. He's 82 but looks
much younger.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many more people he can make happy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because of the wonderful things he does.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The vision that changes lives in Laramie, Wyo., on an
October morning in 1998 is anything but celestial.
</P>
<P>
   The first person to experience it, a young man on a bicycle,
finds it impossible to believe that what he is looking at is human,
initially thinking he has come upon a Halloween effigy, a
grotesquely rigged-up scarecrow.
</P>
<P>
   The second to arrive, a sheriff's deputy, cannot make out the
face on the still-breathing body: Only two tracks of skin are
revealed through the crusted blood. They must have been formed, she
speculates with an anguished wonder, by the paths of tears.
</P>
<P>
   Thus is a 21-year-old man named Matthew Shepard described in the
extraordinary final moments of the first act of ``The Laramie
Project,'' the enormously good-willed, very earnest and often
deeply moving work of theatrical journalism that opened Thursday
night at the Union Square Theater.
</P>
<P>
   These two accounts, taken from transcripts of interviews with
citizens of Laramie by the members of the Tectonic Theater Project,
are delivered in counterpoint with a third, that of an emergency
room doctor who says his mind at first refused to grasp the idea
that what was done to Shepard was wrought by the hands of other
men. The note again resonates, a knell that trembles with troubling
persistence: What has happened is beyond humanity, at least as any
of these three figures has known it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Laramie Project,'' which has been overseen by the director
and writer Moises Kaufman, the inspired talent behind ``Gross
Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' is virtuously
determined to reclaim that missing human factor, to find the light
in an event of harrowing darkness. Shepard, as much of the world
now knows, was an openly gay university student who was beaten,
tied to a fence on the outskirts of town and left to die by two men
roughly his age. In death, he has become a poster boy for the
casualties of anti-gay violence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``The Laramie Project'' _ which has largely been
shaped from interviews conducted during six visits to Laramie by
Kaufman and his ensemble of actors and writers following the crime
_ the images of the bloodied Shepard, beaten beyond recognition,
keep echoing. They become the touchstone by which everything else
is measured, an unconditional physical reality that cannot be
ignored but can, the play suggests, be transcended.
</P>
<P>
   Reams have already been written on the murder of Matthew Shepard
and on the trials of his killers, Russell Henderson and Aaron
McKinney. Those three men remain mostly abstractions here. Whereas
``Gross Indecency,'' the Tectonic group's best-known earlier
project, was built around the vivid onstage presence of Wilde, the
central players in the tragedy of ``Laramie'' are essentially
presented as what they have come to stand for.
</P>
<P>
   What Kaufman and his team are after is less a portrait of any
person than one of the ethos of a place. In the deliberate, simple
formality of its staging, in which eight radiantly clean-scrubbed
performers embody 60 different people against Robert Brill's
bare-bones set, ``Laramie'' often brings to mind ``Our Town,'' the
beloved Thornton Wilder study of life, love and death in parochial
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Laramie is indeed presented as a latter-day
Grovers Corners, a cozy place where everyone appears to know
everyone else's business and actually finds comfort in this. But if
``The Laramie Project'' nods conspicuously to Wilder, this play is
``Our Town'' with a question mark, as in ``Could this be our
town?'' There are repeated variations by the citizens of Laramie on
the statement ``It can't happen here,'' followed immediately by
``And yet it has.''
</P>
<P>
   A young ``Muslim feminist'' student who grew up in Laramie
describes this dizzying contrast of idealized perception and
deflating reality as something like the confusions induced by the
mazes in an Escher print. The observation and the observer are
unusually exotic for this play.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The production's characters, winnowed down from roughly 200
people interviewed, generally fit a more familiar mold of the
small-town American Westerner: friendly, plain-spoken, guarded and
understandably suspicious of the troupe from New York that has
arrived to probe, a self-consciousness that has been incorporated
into ``The Laramie Project.''
</P>
<P>
   They needn't have worried. Even the evening's less sympathetic
characters, including the Kansas preacher who showed up at
Shepard's funeral as an anti-gay protester, are served up with
respectful caution. Most of the others are wrapped in a warm cloak
of affection.
</P>
<P>
   The production's translation of transcribed interviews and
documents may directly recall the methods of the performance artist
Anna Deavere Smith, especially in her study of racial conflict in
Brooklyn, ``Fires in the Mirror.'' But ``Laramie'' _ which gives
credit to a team of a dozen writers and dramaturgs led by Kaufman
and Leigh Fondakowski _ feels less clinical than Smith's works in
presenting its subjects, and the lack of distance is not always an
asset.
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic priest who arranged the first of the
candlelight vigils held for Shepard more than once speaks of the
importance of a ``correct'' representation of Laramie. That
injunction has been thoroughly honored. Though the cast is more
than capable in its creation of an affecting emotional climate,
only a few of its members have anything like Smith's ear for
revelatory speech patterns and are able to summon portraits that
feel correspondingly authentic.
</P>
<P>
   There is an overriding sense that the characters _ who range
from ranchers to university professors, from a lesbian waitress to
a Baptist minister _ are cut from the same cloth of perplexed
decency, embellished with the occasional signpost of an
eccentricity, like the woman who remembers when her Laramie home
was isolated enough for her to do her housework in ``my
altogethers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few recurring figures who acquire the specificity of
fingerprints: One thinks especially of the bicyclist who found
Shepard, embodied with eloquent inarticulateness by Kelli Simpkins,
and the deputy sheriff, vibrantly played by Mercedes Herrero, who
is exposed to HIV while assisting the wounded Shepard. By and
large, however, these people are defined principally by their
responses to an unspeakable event. You aren't allowed to know them,
as you are, say, the characters in ``Boys Don't Cry,'' a movie that
covers similar material.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while running two and a half hours with two intermissions,
``The Laramie Project'' sustains its emotional hold. As Kaufman
demonstrated with ``Gross Indecency,'' he has a remarkable gift for
giving a compelling theatrical flow to journalistic and historical
material. And here he again finds the implicit music in repeated
phrases and themes.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, those echoes conjure the feelings of
horrified astonishment that certain acts of brutality can still
elicit. Actually, the evening itself has the feeling of those
candlelight vigils. There is that same sense of a stately
procession through which swims a stirring medley of emotions:
anger, sorrow, bewilderment and, most poignantly, a defiant glimmer
of hope.

GREAT ARCHITECTURE AND CULTURAL SCENE: WAXAHACHIE'S PLEASURES ARE
BOUNTIFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAXAHACHIE, Texas _ For 10 or 15 minutes, I have been happily
admiring the orderly displays at the Ellis County Museum _ a
beautiful collection of silk and ivory fans from France and Japan,
antique china pitchers from England, Victorian dresses,
100-year-old quilts. But when two young backpackers wander into the
museum, which also serves as a visitors' center for this small
Ellis County city, I can't help but eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
   They're looking for a nearby campground and, I presume, the
location of Scarborough Faire, the Renaissance festival that's been
held in the spring hereabouts for 20 years. But a museum volunteer
also takes time to tell them a little story about the majestic
courthouse in the square, half-obscured by scaffolding and security
fencing.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them the basics, that it's more than 100 years old and
undergoing a renovation. Then she adds that if they look carefully,
they should still be able to see the fantastic and grotesque
carvings decorating the sandstone and granite structure. Maybe it
isn't true, she allows, but local legend has it that the stone
carver who created these angry and evil creatures did so after
being spurned by a local woman, Mabel Frame _ and that the one
beautiful face was there only because the carver completed it
before she rejected him.
</P>
<P>
   The kids leave, charmed; later, sure enough, I see them standing
in front of the courthouse, peering and pointing. Waxahachie had
won a couple more fans.
</P>
<P>
   Day-trippers might come here first for Scarborough Faire or to
eat lunch and shop for antiques on the appealing square. But what
hooks them is the history. In addition to the 1894-built
courthouse, Waxahachie is home to more than 150 original Victorian
gingerbread houses, scattered throughout town like so many gorgeous
surprises, earning it the nickname ``Gingerbread City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a child, I didn't realize what a jewel we had
here,'' says Hilda Chapman, a Waxahachie native who owns the
Gingerbread Antique Mall in a renovated building where her father
once had a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost some wonderful old things, but we don't want to
lose any more. We have a very active historical society, and we've
been able to keep the ambience of the old town.''
</P>
<P>
   The homes, for the most part, date from around the turn of the
century, when Waxahachie, settled on the banks of Waxahachie Creek
in 1851, began to prosper from the cattle and cotton industries.
Though several have been turned into bed-and-breakfast inns, most
are still private homes; a few are open for perusing every June
during the Gingerbread Trail tour of homes. (This year's tour is
the weekend of June 3-4.)
</P>
<P>
   However, there's plenty to enjoy from outside. Take one or both
of the amazingly detailed, easy-to-follow driving tours prepared by
Historic Waxahachie Inc., and you'll see many of the town's
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Like the aforementioned courthouse, one of the most beautiful in
the state. Currently closed for renovation, it's interesting for
its architecture alone _ the castlelike reddish stone structure,
embellished with turrets, towers and intricate stone carvings, cost
$175,000 when it was built.
</P>
<P>
   And the Chautauqua Auditorium, an octagonal amphitheater that
serves as a rare physical reminder of a nationwide literary and
scientific society popular from about 1900 to 1930. This
wood-shuttered building, one of only three remaining in the United
States, was once one of many across the nation that hosted summer
meetings that were one part entertainment, one part education.
Religious leaders, authors, musicians, actors and singers took the
stage here, drawing thousands; Waxahachie's auditorium, on the edge
of Getzendaner Park, was restored in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a string of lovely homes, some mansions, some
rather modest, in styles ranging from Queen Anne to prairie to
neoclassical revival. Drive slowly and stop to admire the details:
a frieze on a porch, a delicate wrought-iron fence, a set of fluted
Ionic columns, a formal garden in full bloom. It's no wonder that a
number of Hollywood movies have been filmed using Waxahachie homes
and businesses, including ``Tender Mercies,'' ``Places in the
Heart,'' ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde,'' ``Square Dance'' and ``The Trip to
Bountiful.'' (The Waxahachie Chamber of Commerce publishes a
brochure that tells which buildings were used for which films.)
</P>
<P>
   And downtown, where you begin and end these driving tours, is
one of the best revival stories _ the Rogers Hotel, set to reopen
this summer after a massive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in 1912, the hotel had a grand roof garden and
such modern amenities as hot and cold water in the private baths,
telephones, electric lights, and a dumbwaiter. But like many
small-town hotels, it fell on hard times; by the 1950s, at least
one guest recalled being met in his room by a bevy of bats. The
hotel closed in the '60s, and though there were sporadic attempts
at revival, perhaps as an apartment building or seniors housing,
most citizens had pretty much given it up for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dallas investor Anthony Cimino, looking for property in
town to renovate, happened across the building. He wasn't really
looking to build a hotel, but that seemed the natural use for it;
the downstairs lobby had earlier been renovated into a casual
upscale restaurant, now known as the Crazy Horse Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, we just got excited about it in our family and
just kind of plowed ahead,'' Cimino says. ``We're just trying to
preserve as much of the original character as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Cimino hopes the hotel will begin accepting guests this summer
in 27 oversized, totally renovated rooms. The hotel had been empty
so long that virtually none of the remaining furniture or bathroom
fixtures was usable, says project director Herb Dowlearn. However,
they've saved numerous antique doorknobs, etched glass transoms,
etched iron radiators and heavy wooden doors and are trying to
incorporate them into the design. New furniture has been purchased
that matches the period, such as sleigh beds and marble-topped
dressers, Cimino says.
</P>
<P>
   Cimino was probably attracted to the property at least partly by
the factor that has attracted other new businesses in the past few
years _ the square's growing reputation as a unique place to while
away the afternoon, eating at one of the half-dozen interesting
little independent restaurants or browsing through a growing
selection of antiques shops and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Julie Webb, whose Webb Gallery for self-taught and
folk artists is worth a drive to town all by itself, have been
there since the beginning of the renaissance. Their brightly
painted storefront, in a renovated old paint store just off the
square, is a light, airy space filled with hulking metal
sculptures, colorful primitive paintings, and such engaging
oddities as an intricate motorized carnival, built primarily from
toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Webbs might not have expected much local support when they
moved from Dallas to the town in 1987, but then they've seen a lot
of change since then. And they like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board, things have gotten more culturally varied,
and we like the whole atmosphere, with the coffee shops and the
restaurants open downtown and people starting to move into the
lofts of some of the older buildings,'' Bruce Webb says. ``It's
definitely beginning to develop its own sense of community.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the kind of thing that brings daytrippers back, again
and again.

&HT;     STUDY SHOWS CHILDREN RESPOND BETTER TO RITALIN ALTERNATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CINDY TUMIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A study directed by a physician at the University
of Texas Health Science Center has concluded that a drug called
Adderall might be a better choice for some hyperactive children
than the more widely prescribed Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children in the study took only a single dose of
Adderall daily, and researchers said its overall performance was
better than methylphenidate, the generic version of Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Pliszka, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at
the University of Texas Health Science Center, was the lead
investigator in the study published this month in the Journal of
the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Funding
for the research came from Shire Richwood Inc., a subsidiary of
Adderall manufacturer Shire Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million children in the United States have
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is marked by
symptoms that include inattention, distractibility and
hyperactivity. Stimulant-based medication long has been the primary
treatment for the disorder, and methylphenidate has accounted for
80 percent of the prescriptions written during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Adderall, a mixture of two types of amphetamines, initially was
developed as a weight loss drug in the 1960s and later fell out of
use. The manufacturer revived it several years ago after tests
showed it was effective in treating ADHD. It has been used largely
for children who don't respond to methylphenidate.
</P>
<P>
   Pliszka's study is part of an effort by doctors to compare the
two drugs in controlled tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that we can use Adderall first,'' Pliszka said.
``Physicians and families should feel very comfortable about using
it. That's the main finding of this study.''
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 58 children who got Adderall, methylphenidate
or a placebo _ a harmless, unmedicated preparation _ for three
weeks. During that time, the children were evaluated periodically
by teachers and parents, using a scale that assessed whether their
behavior and attention problems were improving.
</P>
<P>
   Pliszka said the research showed both medications were superior
to the placebo and that Adderall performed better than
methylphenidate. Seventy percent of the children on Adderall also
were able to get by on one dose a day, eliminating the need for
midday medication, Pliszka said.
</P>
<P>
   That finding could be an important point for Shire, because new
drugs are entering the marketplace that are designed for once-a-day
dosing. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson &AMP; Johnson is seeking federal
approval for its new drug, Concerta, which will offer single-dose
convenience. The company expects to begin marketing the drug later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ritalin is manufactured by CIBA-Geigy Corp.

GREAT ARCHITECTURE AND CULTURAL SCENE: WAXAHACHIE'S PLEASURES ARE
BOUNTIFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAXAHACHIE, Texas _ For 10 or 15 minutes, I have been happily
admiring the orderly displays at the Ellis County Museum _ a
beautiful collection of silk and ivory fans from France and Japan,
antique china pitchers from England, Victorian dresses,
100-year-old quilts. But when two young backpackers wander into the
museum, which also serves as a visitors' center for this small
Ellis County city, I can't help but eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
   They're looking for a nearby campground and, I presume, the
location of Scarborough Faire, the Renaissance festival that's been
held in the spring hereabouts for 20 years. But a museum volunteer
also takes time to tell them a little story about the majestic
courthouse in the square, half-obscured by scaffolding and security
fencing.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them the basics, that it's more than 100 years old and
undergoing a renovation. Then she adds that if they look carefully,
they should still be able to see the fantastic and grotesque
carvings decorating the sandstone and granite structure. Maybe it
isn't true, she allows, but local legend has it that the stone
carver who created these angry and evil creatures did so after
being spurned by a local woman, Mabel Frame _ and that the one
beautiful face was there only because the carver completed it
before she rejected him.
</P>
<P>
   The kids leave, charmed; later, sure enough, I see them standing
in front of the courthouse, peering and pointing. Waxahachie had
won a couple more fans.
</P>
<P>
   Day-trippers might come here first for Scarborough Faire or to
eat lunch and shop for antiques on the appealing square. But what
hooks them is the history. In addition to the 1894-built
courthouse, Waxahachie is home to more than 150 original Victorian
gingerbread houses, scattered throughout town like so many gorgeous
surprises, earning it the nickname ``Gingerbread City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a child, I didn't realize what a jewel we had
here,'' says Hilda Chapman, a Waxahachie native who owns the
Gingerbread Antique Mall in a renovated building where her father
once had a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost some wonderful old things, but we don't want to
lose any more. We have a very active historical society, and we've
been able to keep the ambience of the old town.''
</P>
<P>
   The homes, for the most part, date from around the turn of the
century, when Waxahachie, settled on the banks of Waxahachie Creek
in 1851, began to prosper from the cattle and cotton industries.
Though several have been turned into bed-and-breakfast inns, most
are still private homes; a few are open for perusing every June
during the Gingerbread Trail tour of homes. (This year's tour is
the weekend of June 3-4.)
</P>
<P>
   However, there's plenty to enjoy from outside. Take one or both
of the amazingly detailed, easy-to-follow driving tours prepared by
Historic Waxahachie Inc., and you'll see many of the town's
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Like the aforementioned courthouse, one of the most beautiful in
the state. Currently closed for renovation, it's interesting for
its architecture alone _ the castlelike reddish stone structure,
embellished with turrets, towers and intricate stone carvings, cost
$175,000 when it was built.
</P>
<P>
   And the Chautauqua Auditorium, an octagonal amphitheater that
serves as a rare physical reminder of a nationwide literary and
scientific society popular from about 1900 to 1930. This
wood-shuttered building, one of only three remaining in the United
States, was once one of many across the nation that hosted summer
meetings that were one part entertainment, one part education.
Religious leaders, authors, musicians, actors and singers took the
stage here, drawing thousands; Waxahachie's auditorium, on the edge
of Getzendaner Park, was restored in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a string of lovely homes, some mansions, some
rather modest, in styles ranging from Queen Anne to prairie to
neoclassical revival. Drive slowly and stop to admire the details:
a frieze on a porch, a delicate wrought-iron fence, a set of fluted
Ionic columns, a formal garden in full bloom. It's no wonder that a
number of Hollywood movies have been filmed using Waxahachie homes
and businesses, including ``Tender Mercies,'' ``Places in the
Heart,'' ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde,'' ``Square Dance'' and ``The Trip to
Bountiful.'' (The Waxahachie Chamber of Commerce publishes a
brochure that tells which buildings were used for which films.)
</P>
<P>
   And downtown, where you begin and end these driving tours, is
one of the best revival stories _ the Rogers Hotel, set to reopen
this summer after a massive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in 1912, the hotel had a grand roof garden and
such modern amenities as hot and cold water in the private baths,
telephones, electric lights, and a dumbwaiter. But like many
small-town hotels, it fell on hard times; by the 1950s, at least
one guest recalled being met in his room by a bevy of bats. The
hotel closed in the '60s, and though there were sporadic attempts
at revival, perhaps as an apartment building or seniors housing,
most citizens had pretty much given it up for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dallas investor Anthony Cimino, looking for property in
town to renovate, happened across the building. He wasn't really
looking to build a hotel, but that seemed the natural use for it;
the downstairs lobby had earlier been renovated into a casual
upscale restaurant, now known as the Crazy Horse Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, we just got excited about it in our family and
just kind of plowed ahead,'' Cimino says. ``We're just trying to
preserve as much of the original character as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Cimino hopes the hotel will begin accepting guests this summer
in 27 oversized, totally renovated rooms. The hotel had been empty
so long that virtually none of the remaining furniture or bathroom
fixtures was usable, says project director Herb Dowlearn. However,
they've saved numerous antique doorknobs, etched glass transoms,
etched iron radiators and heavy wooden doors and are trying to
incorporate them into the design. New furniture has been purchased
that matches the period, such as sleigh beds and marble-topped
dressers, Cimino says.
</P>
<P>
   Cimino was probably attracted to the property at least partly by
the factor that has attracted other new businesses in the past few
years _ the square's growing reputation as a unique place to while
away the afternoon, eating at one of the half-dozen interesting
little independent restaurants or browsing through a growing
selection of antiques shops and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Julie Webb, whose Webb Gallery for self-taught and
folk artists is worth a drive to town all by itself, have been
there since the beginning of the renaissance. Their brightly
painted storefront, in a renovated old paint store just off the
square, is a light, airy space filled with hulking metal
sculptures, colorful primitive paintings, and such engaging
oddities as an intricate motorized carnival, built primarily from
toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Webbs might not have expected much local support when they
moved from Dallas to the town in 1987, but then they've seen a lot
of change since then. And they like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board, things have gotten more culturally varied,
and we like the whole atmosphere, with the coffee shops and the
restaurants open downtown and people starting to move into the
lofts of some of the older buildings,'' Bruce Webb says. ``It's
definitely beginning to develop its own sense of community.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the kind of thing that brings daytrippers back, again
and again.

   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ In a victory for the Clinton
administration, the Senate on Thursday narrowly killed a measure to
set a deadline for withdrawing American ground troops from Kosovo,
a proposal that also had drawn fire from Gov. George W. Bush. By a
53-47 vote, senators stripped a provision from a military
construction spending bill that would have cut off funds for the
5,600 U.S. forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, forcing their orderly
withdrawal unless Congress authorized the mission's extension. By
Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BUSH (Austin, Texas) _ With his remarks in recent days on
China trade and Senate efforts to set a time limit on the Kosovo
deployment, Gov. George W. Bush has shown himself to be squarely in
a Republican tradition of internationalism and of favoring
presidential supremacy in the making of foreign policy. In short,
he has looked very much like his father. By Alison Mitchell.

South Carolina General Assembly voted Thursday to remove the flag
from the Capitol dome and their chambers. At noon on July 1, South
Carolina will become the last state to remove the old symbol of
secession from its seat of government. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   LOS-ALAMOS-FIRE (Dateline TK) _ In a scathing report, the
Interior Department said the fire that destroyed more than 200
homes in Los Alamos was caused by numerous failures by Park Service
officials who started a fire to destroy underbrush. The officials
failed to properly plan for the fire, check weather and ground
conditions or coordinate and communicate with each other, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in releasing the report Thursday. By

<P>
   NH-DEATH-PENALTY (Concord, N.H.) _ With a vote by the New
Hampshire Senate on Thursday, the state Legislature approved a bill
to repeal the death penalty, something no other state has done
since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the reinstatement of capital
punishment 23 years ago. But the 14-10 vote was two votes short of
the margin needed to override the veto that Gov. Jeanne Shaheen has
promised. (Summary from wires) By John Kifner.

   KIMES-TRIAL (New York) _ Sante and Kenneth Kimes, an accused
mother-and-son team of con artists, were found guilty Thursday of
murdering a wealthy Manhattan widow as part of an elaborate scheme
to seize control her $8 million townhouse. Relying entirely on
circumstantial evidence, prosecutors convinced the jurors that the
Kimeses killed Irene Silverman, 82, in April 1998 and disposed of
her body. Mrs. Silverman's body has never been found, and defense

   SCI-STRESS-WOMEN (Undated) _ For more than a half century,
scientific gospel has held that animals, including humans, respond
to stress by preparing to do battle or to flee, a physiological
syndrome commonly known as ``fight or flight.'' But in a newly
published report, a group of researchers asserts that females often
show a very different reaction to stress, one that revolves around
nurturing and seeking the support of others rather than aggression
or escape. This ``tend and befriend'' response, seen both in humans
and in animal species, may be based in hormonal differences between
the sexes, the researchers argue. And in a long ago world, it may
have conferred an evolutionary advantage, allowing females to
reduce the risk to their offspring and to themselves posed by
predators, natural disasters and other Pleistocene-era threats. By

(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sun., May 21.) 
Our rating: 1 star 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, CBS gave us the life of ``Jesus''; this week, they
offer another story of someone best-known for cushy family
connections: ``The Linda McCartney Story.'' This may very well be
the most staggeringly unnecessary biopic in the history of the
genre. Let's face it: Paul has likely not been itching for a movie
about his late spouse, and Linda herself would no doubt be aghast
at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only the most pathetically obsessed Beatles fan who
might be interested in this _ the sort who would buy Linda's
posthumously released CD, for example _ and that demographic
wouldn't even earn a decent rating for the Oxygen Channel.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of urgency to tell this story is apparent in every
tedious frame of the movie. For starters, the actors scarcely
resemble the icons they're playing. Elizabeth Mitchell plays Linda
_ who refers to herself early on as ``a divorced working mother,''
conveniently neglecting to mention, ``and heiress to the
Eastman-Kodak fortune,'' so we'll be more on her side. She's
certainly got the, um, blond hair part down pat.
</P>
<P>
   When Linda's in the middle of a photo shoot with a haggard bunch
of fellows allegedly portraying the Rolling Stones, I could only
hazard a guess that it was supposed to be Mick Jagger hitting on
her because that would've been most glamorous. (For a professional
photographer, Linda seems to fall unprofessionally into bed with
her subjects fairly easily: In addition to McCartney, the film
tallies up Jagger and Jim Morrison _ or at least some facsimile in
that they share the same number of arms and legs _ among her
conquests.) A woman referred to as ``Chrissie Hynde'' shows up only
for purposes of cheap name-dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Paul McCartney (who, as played by Gary Bakewell, has
never seemed so, um, puffy) comes upon the picture, they fall in
love and live happily ever after. Well, almost: Their big trials
come when a music critic insults Linda's backing caterwauling at a
Wings concert, when Paul frets over non-existent financial woes and
when he's busted for pot possession in Japan. Hardly the sort of
problems with which we average viewers are likely to empathize.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Linda develops the cancer that took her life in
1998. Pointlessly, the film veers back and forth in time from the
Beatle days to her battle with the disease, which kills what little
momentum the story may have and doesn't really meaningfully develop
drama in her struggle to survive.
</P>
<P>
   For all we know, Linda McCartney was a kind and loving person
who just happened to be born into wealth and married even better.
But that doesn't automatically mean that such a life inspires any
compelling drama. If nothing else, ``The Linda McCartney Story''
tenders a chilling warning for all celebrities: No matter how
insignificant a level of fame you may achieve, there's going to be
a cynical filmmaker out there who'll make a crummy biopic of your
life when you die. Obscurity never seemed so good.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The museum that had the audacity to take the measure
of the whole universe with its new planetarium has now turned its
attention to another daunting subject: the remote and forbidding
Gobi Desert of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   In a new exhibition, which opens Friday and will run through
Oct. 29, the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan has
recreated some of the stark grandeur of the Gobi in a diorama that
includes life-size models of dinosaurs and tiny mammals living
there 80 million years ago. There is the sound of the Gobi, too.
The whistling of stiff winds sweeping over the scene is so real
that you can almost feel the sting of sand in your face.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery beyond is filled with fossil remains that in recent
years have opened scientists' eyes to new interpretations of the
lives of these fascinating bygone creatures. Some are the most
complete dinosaur fossils ever discovered, and all illustrate newly
gained insights into the growth, behavior and variation of
dinosaurs. The fossils show some of the most revealing examples yet
of preying dinosaurs, nesting dinosaurs and their hatchlings,
flightless birds and other evidence of an evolutionary link between
dinosaurs and modern birds.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Fighting Dinosaurs: New Discoveries From
Mongolia,'' has one of the most evocative fossil finds in the
world, one never before seen in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Digging in the Gobi in 1971, a Mongolian-Polish expedition
uncovered the skeletons of two dinosaurs, a Protoceratops and a
Velociraptor, that appeared to have died locked in combat. The
Velociraptor, a carnivorous predator, had embedded its sharp foot
claw into the neck of its prey, the plant-eating Protoceratops. The
predator's left hand gripped the prey's head. In defense, the
Protoceratops had just bitten the predator's right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of five or six of the most famous specimens in
dinosaur paleontology,'' said Dr. Mark A. Norell, curator of the
exhibition and an authority on dinosaurs. ``It's like a snapshot of
an event that happened 80 million years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as scientists can tell, neither animal won that battle;
nature did. Recent geological studies suggest that an avalanche of
sand released by a brief but heavy rainfall buried the foes alive.
Such a phenomenon of collapsing sand dunes may also help explain
the presence of so many well-preserved fossils throughout the Gobi.
</P>
<P>
   As arresting as the fighting dinosaurs may be, why would the
American Museum mount another dinosaur exhibition now? Its recently
renovated fourth floor houses one of the world's finest displays of
fossils from the entire age of dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot's happened in the last seven to 10 years,'' Norell
explained. ``This has been one of the most active decades in
dinosaur studies. Our expeditions to the Gobi and work by others
have produced many new species and new interpretations. Our picture
of dinosaurs is much different now.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, supported by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest
Endowment Fund, is one of the main attractions in the Festival of
Mongolia, a program of Mongolian music, dance, film and sports
being held in the city over the next few months. A related
exhibition, ``Mongolia Observed: Photographs Present and Past,''
has already opened at the museum and will continue through Sept. 4.
Most of the pictures are by Dr. Robert McCracken Peck, a naturalist
and photographer, and depict contemporary Mongolian life.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolia occupies a special place in the museum's history.
Expeditions led by Roy Chapman Andrews in the 1920s put the Gobi on
the world map of paleontology. During the Cold War, Russian and
Polish scientists continued fossil hunting there. Finally, after
Mongolia's break with the Soviet bloc, paleontologists from the
American Museum joined with the Mongolian Academy of Sciences to
conduct annual Gobi expeditions, beginning in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the fossils in the new exhibition were collected by
these recent exploring parties and are being displayed for the
first time. A few specimens are so new they have yet to be given
formal scientific names.
</P>
<P>
   No place in the Gobi has yielded a greater abundance of fossils
from the late period of dinosaurs, between 120 million and 65
million years ago, than a region known as Ukhaa Tolgod. Discovered
in 1993, the site has been the focus of fossil hunting ever since.
</P>
<P>
   When visitors step into the exhibition hall, the first thing
they see is the diorama of the Ukhaa Tolgod badlands. Several of
the dinosaur models in the scene may come as a surprise. Their
bodies are covered in feathers, reflecting newly gained knowledge
that some smaller dinosaurs were probably feathered animals.
</P>
<P>
   Next the exhibition shows off fossils from the Andrews
expedition and compares these findings with more recent research.
Here are the striking skeletons of two dinosaurs, as yet unnamed
relatives of Oviraptors, that were found side by side in 1995. They
also appear to have been buried alive under a collapsing sand dune,
where their remains were safe from scavengers and undisturbed while
they slowly turned to stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really remarkable in their completeness,'' Norell
said. ``And look at their birdlike features _ the wishbone here,
the breast bone, the three toes just like birds.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a nine-minute pause to see a film of Gobi explorations,
visitors move to the fighting-dinosaurs display. One close look at
the interlocked skeletons and the imagination calls the struggle to
life. A three-minute computer animation, projected on a large
screen and accompanied by sound, recreates the scene based on
current theories of dinosaur anatomy, behavior and locomotion.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the exhibition includes several examples of
dinosaur nests filled with fossilized eggs and in some cases with
the delicate skeletons of hatchlings and juveniles. They are
arranged to illustrate the stages of dinosaur development and their
likely behavior as parents.
</P>
<P>
   Other displays are also designed to deliver messages: how
scientists examine fossils and determine new species, how they
uncover evidence of dinosaur-bird kinship, how small but diverse
mammals played a role in the ancient Gobi environment and were thus
ready to inherit the earth after the dinosaur extinction.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, Norell said, ``We have relied on real
specimens _ actual fossils just as they emerged from the ground, so
the public gets to see the sort of evidence that we paleontologists
base our conclusions on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last sections visitors see a replica of a dig site where
they can get the feel of fossil hunting. Here they can call up
computer depictions of the stages of discovery and laboratory
analysis of fossils. At other computer stations, one can visit
dinosaur Web sites for perhaps more than you would ever want to
know about these creatures. These sites include
www.discovery.com/guides/dinos/dinos.htmlwww.ucmp.berkeley.edu and
www.tyrrellmuseum.com
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, take time to press your fingers on one of the
``touchable specimens.'' Nothing could feel more stony and
lifeless. Yet it is out of such material, dead and buried for
millions of years, that scientists have been able, in effect, to
visualize life on earth as it was long before human beings took the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   And there is so much more where these fossils came from.
Paleontologists from the museum, led by Norell and Dr. Michael J.
Novacek, will return to the Gobi in July, seeking new insights into
past life and more fossils for future exhibition.

   TULIA, Texas _ Four of Mattie White's six children are in jail.
</P>
<P>
   So are her brother, her niece and her son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   All but one were arrested on the same day in the same small town
for the same offense: selling cocaine. Just after dawn on July 23,
law officers went to the homes of White's relatives and dozens of
other Tulia residents, flashed arrest warrants and took them away,
many still in their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tore me apart,'' said White, a 47-year-old prison guard who
now cares for her daughter's two young children. ``I just don't
understand it. This has affected my life 120 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a pulled thread that unravels a garment, Swisher County's
biggest-ever drug bust is destroying the fabric of the small black
community in the Panhandle, White and others say.
</P>
<P>
   Others blame the damage on the prevalence of crack cocaine,
which they say justifies the operation and the large number of
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 357 blacks who reside in Tulia, 32, or one of every 11,
was arrested as a result of an 18-month undercover investigation.
Of the 45 people indicted, 43 were arrested and two remain at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 11 non-blacks who were arrested had close family or
social ties to the black community, residents said. The suspects
ranged in age from 16 to 60. Most had prior criminal convictions,
many of which were not drug-related, on charges ranging from
Driving While Intoxicated to Endangerment of a Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population is small, and there was a large number of
blacks arrested,'' said Iris Lawrence, a board member of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in
Amarillo, 48 miles to the north. ``The question is: Were they the
only people in Swisher County dealing drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence added that the civil rights organization is monitoring
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover officer's strategy was to mingle with the
community and purchase drugs, said Lt. Mike Amos, head of the
Amarillo-based Panhandle Regional Narcotics Task Force, a
state-funded agency that sends narcotics agents to 26 counties. It
just so happened, Amos said, that the agent was befriended almost
immediately by a black man who was trusted within the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took him around and introduced him to all of his friends
dealing dope,'' Amos said. ``It worked out that most of the people
the gentleman knew were black. That is all there is to it. Our main
purpose is to get into the community and purchase narcotics. ... we
told him to buy from ... whoever was selling the dope.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweep _ conducted by five state, county and local law
enforcement agencies, including the Tulia Police Department _
resulted in an overflow of prisoners at the jail that had already
been filled to capacity. Some prisoners had to be transferred to
jails in neighboring counties. Boarding the suspects, then trying
them, has seriously strained the county's financial resources,
leading to a 5.8 percent tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Still, local officials consider the drug bust an unmitigated
success. They dismiss assertions that race played a role and say
the heavy jail terms _ one Anglo man was sentenced to 434 years _
were justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good, wholesome community, and I think a large part
of the long sentences is that we have conscientious people sitting
on the jury,'' District Attorney Terry McEachern said. ``I have had
nine juries, and nine juries have hit them hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public pays me to prosecute criminals, and it doesn't make
any difference to me if they are black, white, Asian, pink, purple
or green,'' McEachern said. ``Everyone has their reasons, but I
don't care about their reasons. If they commit a crime, they have
to be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Tulia find it a stretch to believe there were so many
drug dealers operating in a less-than-affluent farming town of
5,220, just about one square mile in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are drugs here in Tulia, but there are not 40 black drug
dealers in Tulia,'' said Gary Gardner, a white farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Shearer, professor of criminal justice at Sam Houston
State University in Huntsville, said Tulia's drug activity isn't
that unusual for a rural Texas community these days. A mobile
society, accessible borders with other states and Mexico, and its
remoteness make Tulia ideal for drug-dealing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are isolated, they think no one is paying
attention to them,'' Shearer said of dealers. Ironically, the
presence of a state prison in Tulia might also draw trafficking to
the area because of high demand for smuggled drugs by inmates, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of fast-food restaurants and strip shopping centers, the
seat of Swisher County revolves around the town square and Friday
night football. Tulia is nearly 48 percent white, more than 44
percent Hispanic and nearly 7 percent black. Cowboy boots and
overalls are always in vogue, and $2.50 buys a cheeseburger and
fries at the Tulia Pharmacy across from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The town, which lies between Lubbock and Amarillo, has seen its
share of economic hard times.
</P>
<P>
   The per capita income is $11,000 _ $8,700 below the state
average _ according to Claritas, an independent marketing data
company in Arlington, Va. Many residents make their living farming
corn, wheat or cotton or raising cattle. Even the sheriff and
district attorney moonlight as farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of opportunities for young people here,''
said County Judge Harold Keeter, who also serves as the county's
financial officer. ``If they stay, there just isn't a lot for them.
They become disillusioned and depressed and get into other things
to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent Mike Vinyard said students disclosed in a
1994 survey that a large percentage were using illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For years, local officials had clamored for ways to combat the
problem. Undercover operations were launched and random, mandatory
drug testing for students in extracurricular activities was
implemented in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a year after the testing began, 10 of 385 tests
administered came back positive. The following year, 14 of 954 were
positive. So far this year, six of 808 tests have come back
positive, mainly for cocaine and marijuana, Vinyard said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's bust was prompted by numerous complaints from
residents, Sheriff Larry Stewartsaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a lot of stuff was going on,'' Stewart said. ``You get
a lot of phone calls saying, `Did you know about so and so.' I knew
we had a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff, with approval from county commissioners, contacted
the narcotics task force.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Coleman, 41, a former Cochran County deputy sheriff, was
recruited as an undercover investigator and sent to Tulia. A lanky,
long-haired Anglo, Coleman took a job sorting livestock at the
local cattle auction and quickly made contacts in the town's small
black community.
</P>
<P>
   A major break was striking up a friendship with Eliga Kelly, a
trusted, hard-drinking African-American in his 60s, who is known
around town as ``Man Kelly,'' the sheriff said. The pair were seen
cruising around town in Coleman's pickup, and Kelly introduced him
to his social circle.
</P>
<P>
   Then, law enforcement officials said, Kelly helped Coleman score
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who was publicly identified when he later testified as
a named witness at all of the subsequent trials, spent more than a
year accumulating evidence. He bought more than $20,000 worth of
cocaine, methamphetamines and marijuana, mostly in small amounts of
less than three grams, said Lt. Mike Amos, head of the regional
drug task force.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, after reviewing the evidence obtained by Coleman, a
grand jury handed up 132 indictments for drug-related offenses.
Three days later, officers fanned out across Swisher County with
arrest warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 detained that day quickly pushed an already full jail far
past its 26-prisoner capacity. With prisoners sleeping on the
floor, authorities shipped some off to jails in neighboring
counties. Some of those arrested were already in jail on different
charges. Others were picked up in following weeks in Midland,
Oklahoma and on the Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Swisher County officials knew that waging a war on drugs in
Tulia would cost them. No one expected the bill to run so high.
</P>
<P>
   So far, housing and prosecuting inmates has cost Swisher County
$120,000, and is expected to reach $230,000 this year; the county's
annual budget is $3.2 million, Keeter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had an undercover agent in town, but as far as
scope, we had no idea it would turn into something this large,''
the county judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The normally sleepy courthouse, which used to handle two or
three trials a year, has been busy with an average of three a month
since the bust.
</P>
<P>
   To date, each of the 37 suspects prosecuted has been convicted.
Twenty-eight accepted plea bargains; the remainder pleaded either
not guilty or no contest in jury trials, McEachern said. Six are
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some had prior drug convictions, he said, and the local juries
are sending a statement with the heavy jail sentences they are
handing down.
</P>
<P>
   The stiffest so far _ 434 years _ was given to William Cash
Love,, an Anglo man who has a child with Mattie White's daughter,
Kizzie White.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who was on probation for other drug-related offenses, was
charged with eight counts of selling drugs, including two counts of
selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school, a first-degree felony,
the district attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Moore, 57, described by residents as the center of the black
community in Tulia, was sentenced to 90 years for selling cocaine
to Coleman. Moore had two prior convictions for felony drug
dealing, McEachern said.
</P>
<P>
   The lightest sentence went to Ramona Strickland, 25, a black
woman who received a $2,000 fine for delivery of cocaine. Eliga
Kelly, Coleman's first contact in the black community, was given 10
years' probation and a $1,000 fine in a plea bargain, McEachern
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the agreement for Kelly was that he testified against
other defendants, and he has testified in two trials,'' the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The sting and the sentences have stirred strong emotions, both
pro and con.
</P>
<P>
   Residents like Doyle Hutson, an Anglo who manages a motel,
applaud the effort and say they are willing to shoulder the expense
if it means keeping drugs off the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost is just something we have to bear,'' Hutson said.
``You can't have these guys around doing what they want to do _
especially drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, particularly in the black community, are outraged.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests have broken families. Grandparents have taken over
parenting duties from adult children now behind bars, and their
neighborhood has lost much of its life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to see them all running around together, and now it
is real quiet because all of the kids are in jail,'' said Ida
Smith, one of a group of women who gathered at her modest red-brick
home and reflected on how ``It'' _ the bust _ changed the
community. Her daughter, Yolanda Smith, was sentenced to six years
after accepting a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra Vancleave, an Anglo woman who dates Mattie White's son
Kareem, nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the people we hung out with are locked up, every last
one of them,'' she said. ``They don't care nothing about you if
you're black or if you run around with blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the relatives contend that the sentences aren't
warranted and have intimidated other suspects into accepting plea
bargains for crimes they didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they gave Moore 90 _ and Cash 400 _ years, they all
wanted to plea,'' Mattie White said. ``They see what the other ones
are getting and they don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney dismisses such contentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered them pleas, and I wasn't unreasonable,'' McEachern
said. When ``they didn't take them, the jury made a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the truth lies, residents say the impact on families
cannot be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing you can do,'' said White, who is currently
seeking a second job so she can support her two small
grandchildren. Her daughter, Kizzie White, received 25-year
sentence for selling cocaine and her son, Donald White, received a
12-year-sentence. Another son, Kareem White, is in jail awaiting
trial. A fourth son is serving a prison sentence for rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I cried a whole week when they gave my daughter
time,'' White said. ``I'm struggling now to take care of her kids.
But these are my children and these are their children. I have to
do what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said he sympathizes with the families whose
relatives are in jail, but said it was worth it and that he would
do it all again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in jail has mothers, fathers, kids and family,''
Stewart said. ``These are just folks, they are not my enemies, but
they have done something to violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What choice do I have. To ignore it?''
</P>

(Editors: the 3rd take is a 425-word guide to schools in the New
York metropolitan area.) By CHARLES STRUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five years ago, at a stationery store on the Left
Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished in my pants pocket
for some francs and walked toward the counter, a smile of fear
frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out this sentence
to the old woman at the counter:
</P>
<P>
   ``Je voudrais acheter le magasin, s'il vous plait.''
</P>
<P>
   The common word for magazine is magazine (mah-gah-ZEEN), not
magasin (mah-gah-ZAA). I had asked to buy the shop.
</P>
<P>
   So it went. For 10 days in Paris I was a helpless prisoner of my
past: four years of undistinguished high school French and one
semester at college. I could make my way through a French
newspaper, but conversation was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. No longer the 98-pound-weakling of bilingualism, I
have persuaded myself that it is possible to function confidently,
perhaps even thrive, in another culture. I am a graduate of
language immersion.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I have no immediate plans to do much more than order en
francais at a midtown restaurant. But others are looking forward to
a fresh round of business travel, or a summer visit to France or
Italy or Japan, and yearn to be more self-sufficient, even fluent.
For them, language courses like the one in which I enrolled,
offered by the Language Immersion Institute, function as an
introduction, a brush-up or a steppingstone to broader learning. A
friendly caution, however: in the elementary levels, a weekend in
another language can saute your brain, leaving you momentarily mute
and at least a half-sentence behind the person you're straining to
understand. At times it's like trying to do long division in your
head.
</P>
<P>
   My only previous encounter with immersion was a week at a tennis
camp in Massachusetts years ago. Possessed of an average hacker's
game at the time, I left the campus paralyzed by instruction. So
focused had I become on where to step, how to swing and what my
next shot should be that I couldn't hit the ball at all. Eventually
the reflexes returned, including some bad habits. But it was
demoralizing. Not so with French.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 hours of weekend conversation, the equivalent of one-third
of a semester, my classmates and I were continually coaxed to
struggle aloud. Mercifully, this was not like high school, where
teen-agers wince from embarrassment. I felt no trace of the angst
of my sophomore year, when my teacher _ a humorless woman who
looked like Howdy Doody with a gray wig and spoke French with an
Indiana twang _ aimed her intolerance up and down the rows like a
machine gunner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we were tutored by Denise Springer, a native speaker
from the northeast seaside town of Berck-Plage in Flanders. A
master teacher who retired in December as a language professor at
the State University of New York at New Paltz, she happily
transformed our gaucheries into new lines of instruction. We were
applauded because we tried. It was OK to be ignorant. It was
acceptable to be clumsy. We probably set a record for the number of
sentences fractured per quarter-hour, but our persistence was
always rewarded, with more instruction and more encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a form of benign brainwashing,'' said Dr. Henry Urbanski,
the director of the institute, which he founded on campus in 1981.
The immersion technique isn't new, of course. In the 1960s, the
Peace Corps placed its volunteers in similar programs. Among its
most successful practitioners is the Defense Language Institute in
Monterey, Calif., which trains the military.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanski, a walking advertisement for immersion, was born in
Poland and speaks seven languages: English, French, German,
Italian, Russian, Hebrew and Polish. He learned some of them, he
says, by living in the country where the language is spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a believer in learning the language when you have an
urgency to use it, when you need to, when you're totally immersed
in it,'' he said. But the program he established initially served
another purpose as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was chairman of the foreign language department at New Paltz
in the late '70s, which coincided with the time that language
requirements at colleges were being abolished,'' he said. ``We were
experiencing a drop in students and a consequent drop in faculty
members. I felt that we had some talented language teachers, and
they had no students to teach. That's when I decided there's people
out in the world who are no longer in school who need language
instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is immersion?
</P>
<P>
   ``You exclude English for 15 hours in one weekend, and after a
while students develop more confidence,'' he said. ``They are not
afraid to speak and make mistakes and to try to communicate in the
language.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the key: making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans,'' he said, ``hate to make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. So on a recent Friday evening, my classmates and I
left our pride at the door of the Dumont Plaza Hotel on East 34th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   We students, about 70 of us, and 10 or 12 instructors _ a fairly
typical gathering for Manhattan _ arrived at a hotel conference
room at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As individual classes go _ they range from 6 to 15 students _
mine was on the cozy side and fairly typical in its goals. Of the
six of us, four wanted to learn more French for touring the
country, one needed French for a doctoral program, and I was
curious to see whether I was facile enough to move beyond
irrelevant textbook phrases about le cahier, le stylo and mon
oncle.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, classes are held at the Dumont Plaza. The
institute also conducts weekend instruction at the State University
campus at New Paltz, at the nearby Mohonk Lake Mountain House and
at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry. Instruction begins with Elementary
I and Elementary II (my level) and two intermediate levels. There
are also advanced immersion courses of two weeks and four weeks, at
New Paltz. Most students in the Manhattan program are commuters,
but some stay overnight at their own expense. Tuition was $295 for
the weekend, which included a welcome break for bagels and coffee
on Sunday morning. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   We began drifting into our meeting room in twos and threes,
randomly filling seats and waiting to meet our teachers before
following them to one-bedroom suites that would serve as
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Urbanski's welcome was low-key. He urged us to shed our
inhibitions and expectations, recalling Heywood Hale Broun's
observation of his own language studies. Broun felt he had been a
good student, Urbanski said, but complained that ``when he got to
Paris he found that no one spoke intermediate French.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the instructors came forward to call the roll for
their classes. They rattled off greetings and room numbers and a
few phrases to lubricate us for what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Mild panic swept the room, and someone who was dead serious
yelled out, ``I think I'd better switch to Level I.''
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30 we were in our ``classrooms.'' My group was interrupted
several times in the first hour by late arrivals, until finally 10
of us crowded into the suite's sitting room. We received paperback
texts, introduced ourselves and talked in French about our jobs,
worked on vocabulary and conversation, and adjourned at 10 p.m.
With the exception of a few necessary instructions for the next
day, Mme. Springer spoke only in French.
</P>
<P>
   When we reconvened at 9 a.m. on Saturday, there were just the
six of us, the others having bailed out. (Most Friday night
dropouts tend to sign up for lower-level instruction either the
same weekend or at a future date, Urbanski said.) Our group was
set: Vicky Jeffers, a psychologist from Morristown, N.J.; her
friend Ann Elkas, a registered nurse from Chatham, N.J.; Mitzi
Pratt, a bookbinder from Martha's Vineyard, Mass.; Debra Schmidt
Bach, from Brooklyn, a curator at the South Street Seaport Museum;
and Cellen (pronounced SELL-in) Wolk, a landscape gardener from
Rockland County. They all knew I would be writing about our
experience.
</P>
<P>
   We were pretty well matched, but the consensus was that Mitzi
was the class genius. Her accent and pronunciation were quite good,
and her command of sentence structure was superior to ours. She had
spent some months working with a set of language tapes, and it had
paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't been to Europe for a while,'' she said, ``and then I
went to France last fall for the grape harvest, the vendange. It
was a great trip, and it inspired me to improve on the French that
I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Her childhood French instruction, she said, had begun in a
private, co-ed elementary school on the North Shore of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Of her weekend at the Dumont Plaza, Mitzi said later: ``I was
very nervous beforehand, but I had underestimated my ability. I had
this vision of us sitting in this room being forced to speak French
to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That did happen. But most of the time we interacted with
Springer, or created conversations at her direction.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, we paired off and interviewed our partners
in French. Then we reported to the group. I learned that Ann was a
nurse who also volunteered at a domestic-abuse phone line. She has
three grown children, one of whom is married. She drives a Lexus
and lives in a two-story house with four bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now try saying that in French. In full sentences.
</P>
<P>
   More grist for Mme. Springer, who stood by a large easel and
jotted down new words or phrases or verb forms with a marking pen.
Nothing escaped her interest.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she gestured to an oversize handbag on the floor
near Vicky's chair. She referred to it as le sac, but then went on
to explain that its size qualified it for what Parisians call by a
slyly suggestive name that will not be repeated here. It is a
prostitute's bag, big enough for a change of clothes, makeup, etc.
Suddenly we were immersed not only in language but also in culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ann and Vicky were both relative newcomers to French. In school,
Ann had studied Latin and taken a year of Spanish. Vicky said she
had been a pretty fair student of German. ``I could think in
German,'' she said. ``I could read poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Both had been to France recently and wanted to become more
comfortable with the language. So they enrolled together in a
weekly hourlong course in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting enough conversation,'' Ann said. ``I'm great
at visual learning, but my conversation is terrible. Just don't ask
me to go, impromptu, into a big conversation with you.''
</P>
<P>
   We all survived the day. But when we left the hotel at 6 p.m. on
Saturday, some of us displayed the telltale squint of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drove home, my husband said I sat there like a lump, I
was so tired.'' Ann said. ``I said, `We're going out to eat, aren't
we?'''
</P>
<P>
   Food had been our salvation on Saturday afternoon, too. .
Springer, it seems, relishes lunchtime on an immersion weekend, and
her favorite restaurant is a Theater District fixture, Pierre au
Tunnel, on West 47th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Pujol opened the restaurant, on 48th Street, about 50
years ago, and it has remained in the family. Pujol's son-in-law,
Jean-Claude Lincy, greeted us, and a member of the staff cheerfully
put up with our attempts to order a tartine of this or a plat of
that. We kept up some snappy table patter about de Gaulle, French
socialism and Madame's wartime experiences in occupied France. But
mercifully the food arrived, and it struck us all that it was the
first time in hours that we had opened our mouths without having to
think. (We split the bill, in English.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest event of the weekend, though, was the dreaded oral
report on Sunday. Mme. Springer had directed each of us to prepare
a five-minute presentation. We were permitted to write it out the
night before, but not to read from it in class.
</P>
<P>
   Vicky went first. Her report was on an American doughboy in
Paris in 1918 and the penniless French countess he married. They
eventually became her in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed that I could make the presentation and elaborate
spontaneously,'' she said later. ``I felt comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann talked about her work as a volunteer with the domestic-abuse
line. Cellen, the jardiniere, spoke lovingly about landscaping. It
turned out that Cellen had been a competent Spanish speaker after
having lived in Mexico years ago. But she had all but given up on
French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had four years of first-year French in high school,'' she
said, adding that her mother, a French teacher, seemed to think her
daughter had no aptitude for language. After doing poorly in her
first French class, she repeated French I the next year. Then she
moved to a new school, and another French I class, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of a trip to Europe this summer, she chose to
try immersion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began dreaming in French,'' she said, after a day of class.
</P>
<P>
   Mitzi told us about a trip to ancient ruins in Peru. I tried to
describe a French cartoon character a friend had introduced me to.
Named Becassine, she is a chauvinistic Bretonne in regional apron
and cap whose exploits, chronicled in two dozen books, became
popular between the world wars. (I had hoped for extra credit.)
</P>
<P>
   Debra is working toward her doctorate at Columbia University in
the history of decorative arts, for which she must pass a French
comprehension exam in the fall. She described a visit to Paris
about 13 years ago, when she was in her 20s. ``On my way home one
night,'' she said, ``I gave my address to a taxi driver, but
apparently I didn't pronounce it properly. When I showed the
correct address, he started yelling at me.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, she said, she dreamed that people were shouting at
her in French. She awoke to find that they were: her hotel was next
to a noisy restaurant kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Which provoked a stern caution from Madame and may explain at
long last why the French become frustrated with Americans. It's not
because we take pratfalls in pursuit of fluency; it's because we
make the sounds wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' she said, ``if you don't pronounce it correctly,
the French simply won't understand you.'' It must have been
important: she said this in English!
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 on Sunday, exhausted but triumphant and with just 30
minutes remaining, we realized that making mistakes had not been so
bad after all. We had stuttered and stumbled and persevered. Our
teacher was still smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Our valedictory was brief but pleasant. We read poems and sang
songs in unison and recited tongue twisters: ``Comment sont ces six
saucissons-ci? Ces six saucissons-ci sont six sous.''
</P>
<P>
   There were hugs for the teacher, promises to enroll with her
again and invitations to visit her in the Hudson Valley. A
valedictory of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am moved by the fact that people come and spend a weekend,
people who have other interesting things to do,'' Mme. Springer
would tell me later. ``If you are intelligent, you are
self-criticizing, and it can work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never know exactly the level of the people when they
enroll. Some people think they are better than they are. But most
people are better than they think they are.''

SECURITY COUNCIL PUTS ARMS EMBARGO ON ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council has imposed an arms
embargo on Ethiopia and Eritrea in the hope that it will spur the
two sides toward a resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous vote near midnight on Wednesday, the council
barred all sales and deliveries of arms and other military
equipment to the two countries for 12 months _ or until
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is able to report that they have
reached ``a peaceful, definitive settlement of the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for Russian and French support, the United States,
which sponsored the resolution, had to drop additional sanctions
against Ethiopia, which began this phase of a three-year-old war by
attacking Eritrea, a former Ethiopian province, on Friday. The U.S.
delegation wanted to bar international travel by Ethiopian
officials, but other council members said this could hamper peace
talks, which have been taking place in Algiers. Algeria is the
current chairman of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   It took three days of hard negotiations for the council to reach
an agreement on how to deal with the war in the Horn of Africa,
which most members agree is pointlessly destructive. Eritrea and
Ethiopia were very close to agreement only a few weeks ago, but a
Security Council delegation that visited the area last week was
unable to dissuade the Ethiopians from reopening the war.
</P>
<P>
   A time limit on sanctions was demanded by Russia, France and
other council members, who say they have seen too many open-ended
embargoes imposed _ often at the behest of the United States _ with
no policy on what to do about the sanctions when they seem no
longer to be effective. The council is studying how to improve the
use of sanctions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, hailed the vote to put a
time limit on sanctions as a historical first for the council. The
Russians have been most critical of the embargo on Iraq, now in its
10th year, without an end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, who handled the Ethiopian-Eritrean
sanctions debate for the United States, said after the vote that
the resolution was intended to bolster the Organization of African
Unity as it tries to restart peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sends an unequivocal and strong message to the
parties to bring an end to this conflict,'' she said.

ETHIOPIAN FORCES CAPTURE KEY TOWN IN ERITREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ETHIOPIA-ERITREA-U.N.) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SHELALO, Eritrea _ The geographically strategic town of Barentu
in western Eritrea has fallen into Ethiopian hands after heavy
fighting involving dozens of tanks and thousands of troops,
officials on both sides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian capture of Barentu, achieved overnight in a battle
fought across hilly, difficult terrain, sent hundreds of thousands
of Eritrean refugees streaming eastward Thursday in the general
direction of the capital, Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian soldiers continued to chase retreating Eritrean troops
toward the larger town of Keren, northeast of Barentu.
</P>
<P>
   Each side claims to have inflicted more than 25,000 casualties
on the other since last Friday, when Ethiopia launched its current
offensive. There was no way to confirm either claim.
</P>
<P>
   For two years of the war, the fighting had been confined largely
to a sophisticated network of trenches along the nations' border.
But six days after Ethiopia mounted an offensive, the border
trenches were left empty as the war shifted firmly into Eritrean
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Barentu, which is about 45 miles from the Ethiopian border, lies
on a major supply route to the westernmost front of the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon Ethiopian jets streaked toward Barentu,
and smoke rose from the area. as the Ethiopian army advancing in
heavy fighting. Eritrean officials said Wednesday that their
soldiers had repulsed several assaults on Barentu but have since
said that the army had made a ``strategic withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yemane Gebremeskel, an Eritrean presidential adviser, said
Thursday, according to Reuters, that Barentu had been evacuated
before the army withdrew. According to Eritrean relief agencies, he
said, ``over 200,000 people from the Barentu area are heading
east.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Eritreans, the Ethiopian gains, which have emptied
several Eritrean towns in the path of advancing troops, confirmed
their worst fears. Eritrea, which until 1993 was the northernmost
province of Ethiopia, has always maintained that Ethiopia had its
eye on permanently taking back territory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an effort to stop the fighting, the U.N. Security Council
late Wednesday night imposed an arms embargo on Ethiopia and
Eritrea to try to get them to resume peace talks. The council voted
to bar all arms and military equipment sales or deliveries to the
two countries for the next 12 months, or until Secretary-General
Kofi Annan can report ``a peaceful, definitive settlement of the
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The war started in May 1998 as a dispute over contested spots
along the two nations' 620-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethiopia says it wants to regain contested territory, but then
why do they keep trying to gain territory beyond the contested
territory according to the colonial maps?'' Yemane Gebremeskel, an
aide to Eritrea's president, said to the French news agency
Wednesday in the capital, Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   But Haile Kiros, an Ethiopian government spokesman, said the
nation's interest was purely in retaking land that it said Eritrea
invaded in 1998. ``Our intention is only to regain our territory,''
he said. ``The invading forces have to be pushed out.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of calm along the border, Ethiopia started
an offensive on Friday, saying it wanted a quick end to a war that
has drained its economy and complicated a food shortage that has
affected millions of people. While Eritrea has condemned Ethiopia
for reigniting the fighting and for reluctance in signing a peace
accord, Ethiopia has said Eritrea was the original aggressor and
needed to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, government officials said
its soldiers had shot down an Eritrean MiG fighter jet after it had
bombed recaptured territory on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Ethiopian troops poured Tuesday through Tokombia, a market
town on the way north to Bar entu, dozens of other Ethiopian troops
looted the town, whose residents fled during the fighting on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian soldiers picked through the mud-and-thatch houses and
emptied shops in the main square. One soldier carried an umbrella
and a soccer ball; another carried two new axes and a bottle of
vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
   Abdu Seid, a 22-year-old company commander, said that despite
appearances, no one was really looting. The soldiers were dirty
after all the fighting, he said, and looking for things they could
bathe with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to wash ourselves,'' he said. ``People have taken only
what they need,'' he said.

&HT;     U.S.-MEXICO CUSTODY CASE ENDS HAPPILY, BUT OTHERS LINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY MARTIN and SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tearful reunion this week between Laura Garcia,
8, and her Texas mother has sparked hopes by the State Department
and child advocates for the return of 105 other American children
believed abducted and living in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is getting bigger and bigger, and we are not
getting the kids back,'' said Guillermo Galarza with the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization
in Alexandria, Va., that works with the State Department and once
used milk cartons to publicize missing children.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department reported in November that Mexico is the top
destination for parents who abduct their children to escape custody
disputes in the United States. Since 1991, at least 750 children
have been taken there.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children, Mexico honors 3 percent of U.S. requests to return
abducted children. By contrast, the United States honors about 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries are signatories to the 1980 Hague Convention,
which established procedures for resolving international child
custody issues.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was abducted by her father in 1997 and taken to Rio
Bravo, Mexico, where she lived for three years like a fugitive. She
attended school sporadically and longed for her mother in Buda,
Texas, some 30 miles northeast of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Following publication of a newspaper account of the case, the
father, Joel Garcia, agreed to return the little girl to his former
girlfriend. The Laura rejoined her mother on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Galarza said the voluntary return of Laura Garcia to her mother,
Norma Lua, is a great relief to the parents, family, social
workers and government officials involved. Joel Garcia also is the
father of Luna's 5-year-old son, who remained in the custody of his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cases take up to five years,'' Galarza said. ``This was a
case that was handled by the State Department. It would have taken
awhile for the courts to take the case in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department often is forced to pressure the Mexican
government for help, officials and child advocates say. ``We will
continue to raise this issue with them, that we want more
returns,'' a State Department spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 100 missing-child cases in which U.S. parents are
seeking help and have filed a complaint under the Hague Convention.
The State Department is investigating five other complaints where
children are being held in Mexico, for a total of 105 open cases.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican parents, meanwhile, are seeking help under the treaty to
have 131 children returned from abductors believed to be living in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Having different sets of laws in the two nations heightens the
problem with cross-border, parental child abductions, said
Guillermo Gutierrez, president of the National Foundation of Stolen
and Disappeared Children in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a federal crime in the United States, the kidnapping
of a child in Mexico by a parent usually is considered a family
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that the laws don't coincide. In the United
States, abducting a child is a serious crime with serious
penalties, but in Mexico it's not,'' said Gutierrez, whose
nonprofit organization works with the Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, in Mexico City, said a universal law respecting
children's rights and helping to streamline the process is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who was caught in
a dispute between his Cuban father and relatives in Florida,
heightened awareness about cross-border custody cases.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Days'' PG-13 (profanity, substance
</P>
<P>
   abuse and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM)1 hour,
43 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino)51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth'' PG-13 (intense sci-fi action)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Teens likely will be unable to stay awake, let alone make any
sense out of ``Battlefield Earth,'' a flat-footed sci-fi epic.
Boring, murky and full of unintentionally funny lines, this pet
project of star John Travolta is based on the 1982 novel by L. Ron
Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology, to which Travolta
belongs. (Jane Horwitz, Washington Post)1 hour, 57 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Bob Facinelli.
</P>
<P>
   This three-hander is well worth your time for the terrific
acting. Three salesmen _ a corrosive cynic, (Kevin Spacey), a
resigned old-timer (Danny DeVito) and an eager-beaver newcomer (Bob
Facinelli) _ wait in their version of hell, i.e., a hospitality
suite in Wichita, for the chance to land that one all-important
client. Spacey and DeVito's performances are bracing and brainy.
(ERG) 1 hour, 31 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage'' PG-13 (sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Stiefel,
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull and Zoe Saldana.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned show biz fantasy for teenagers with leotards
and plies, ``Center Stage'' is a kind of movie that gets retooled
every 10 years or so. Its antecedents include ``Fame,'' ``Dirty
Dancing,'' ``The Turning Point'' and even ``Flashdance.'' It's the
female version of a sports movie: Sweat and inspiration lead to
love and brief heartache, but ultimately growth, self-worth and
even stardom result. (SM)1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Sweeney, Della Reese
</P>
<P>
   and Julianna Margulies.

   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an Iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: while most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. B

   ``East Is East'' R (profanity
</P>
<P>
   and domestic violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri
</P>
<P>
   and Linda Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   Set in working-class Britain in 1971, this uneven but energetic
film focuses on a boisterous Anglo-Pakistani family. The father is
a tyrannical type, while the mother is a grounded fish-and-chips
Englishwoman. And the kids are totally caught up in the exploding
England Swings pop-culture surrounding them. The very good cast,
headed by Om Puri and Linda Bassett, is a huge asset. (ERG)1 hour,
36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``East-West'' R (violence, brief sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   In French and Russian with subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandrine Bonnaire
</P>
<P>
   and Oleg Menchikov.
</P>
<P>
   An uneven Iron Curtain epic, it's French director Regis
Wargnier's film about Russian emigees returning to their former
motherland after World War II, invited warmly by Stalin himself,
only to be met by guns and deceit. Wargnier builds an oppressively
claustrophobic atmosphere, and constructs several suspenseful
sequences. But like his Oscar-winning ``Indochine,'' the movie
feels overblown and undernourished. (SM)2 hours, 1 minute. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files: The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers) 1
hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones
</P>
<P>
   in Viva Rock Vegas'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark Addy
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yabba-dabba-don't. A new, needless, live-action ``Flintstones,''
with Mark Addy as Fred, Stephen Baldwin as Barney, and the
courtship of Wilma and Betty as the plot. Inoffensive and mildly
amusing in spots, but hardly worth a trip to the theater. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service)1 hour, 29 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG)2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle and Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record-store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable because
he's listening to these songs? ``High Fidelity'' is as smart as it
is enjoyable. It's a great date movie about dating. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``I Dreamed of Africa'' PG-13 (nudity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger
</P>
<P>
   and Vincent Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Cardboard figures have adventures in Africa. Oscar winner Kim
Basinger stars as real-life woman Kuki Gallmann, who up and moves
her family from Italy to the Dark Continent because, as she tells
her son, ``I've stopped growing.'' Directed by one-hit wonder Hugh
Hudson (``Chariots of Fire''), the movie never slows down long
enough to get inside the heads of its characters. (SM) 1 hour, 54
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the Faith'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller,
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, it's a sweet-natured hymn to love and longtime
friendship. Edward Norton (as a priest) and Ben Stiller (as a
rabbi) are pals whose childhood friend (Jenna Elfman) returns to
catch both their eyes in more than a friendly way. The first 90
minutes have charm, a sophisticated sexiness and some nice, offbeat
bits. Then things start to crash. (SM) 2 hours, 9 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball'' PG-13 (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and Sanaa Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   All's not fair in love or basketball is one of several themes in
this flawed but appealing romance. Q (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) meet as kids and rival basketball players. They realize
throughout the film that they love each other as much as the game.
Director Gina Price-Bythewood (her producer is Spike Lee) may not
have scored a slam dunk, but she comes close thanks to her engaging
stars. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   max documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino)45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a remembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B+

   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on Ernest Hemingway's novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Me'' PG (mild violence and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny
</P>
<P>
   and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be Hollywood's first organ-transplant romance,
bereaved widower David Duchovny falls for shy heart-transplant
recipient Minnie Driver, unaware that his beloved first wife's
ticker is beating inside her chest. Duchovny is actually rather
wonderful here, with a sweet pensive romanticism. But Driver
herself just doesn't seem worthy of Duchovny. (ERG) 1 hour, 56
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' PG (mild thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Not cute enough for kids, not clever enough for adults,
DreamWorks' latest animated feature is gorgeous but curiously dull.
Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are the voices of a couple of
16th-century scam artists looking for the Lost City of Gold in the
New World. The movie fuses visual splendor with unsteady
storytelling and tone. The waterfalls are beautiful, but the movie
is a washout. (SM)1 hour, 23 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' R (sexuality, crude humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Green.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Ivan Reitman (``Animal House,'' ``Ghostbusters''),
``Road Trip'' is about a quartet of guys who try to retrieve a
missent sex video. The trip has its share of gross-outs _ from
making fun of large women to doing something completely disgusting
with French toast. It's a witless, dumb and dumber version of
``Animal House,'' and its saving grace, MTV genius Tom Green, isn't
in it enough. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 31 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo Must Die'' R (violence, some profanity
</P>
<P>
   and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jet Li and Aaliyah.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the martial arts genre, the violence is strong. This
is Jet Li's first English-language film and it has a great look and
an edgy feel, along with some broad swaths of humor. (Kevin Thomas,
Los Angeles Times)1 hour, 55 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tommy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   and Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' is another military flick that climaxes
in a courtroom, where soldiers shout out conflicting reports of
what really happened in the heat of battle. ``Rules'' is laughable,
but it's watchable thanks to the leads. Tommy Lee Jones is the
flick's anchor. And Samuel L. Jackson delivers an on-the-stand
blow-up like Jack Nicholson's ``You-can't-handle-the-truth''
bluster from ``A Few Good Men.'' (SM) 2 hours, 7 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' PG-13 (violence and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joshua Jackson
</P>
<P>
   and Paul Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In this conspiracy thriller for the Clearasil set, the WB's
Joshua Jackson plays an average Joe sucked into an elite, monied
club. It comes with a price, though. Like he can't ever get out.
(SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tracey Ullman,
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen, Elaine May
</P>
<P>
   and Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen remembers how to make us laugh in this comedy about
lightweight crooks who bumble into lots of cash. As Allen's
big-haired blond wife, Frenchy, Tracey Ullman is a pitch-perfect
character who can ground even her silliest role in genuine feeling.
Elaine May, who steals every scene she's in, plays Frenchy's cousin
May, easily the dimmest creature in a movie loaded with low-watt
bulbs. (SM)1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Code'' R (drug use, sexuality, language and some
violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stellan Skarsgard,
</P>
<P>
   Salma Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   The medium is the message in Mike Figgis' sometimes terrific,
sometimes tedious experiment in digital filmmaking. Here's the
gimmick: the screen is divided into four parts showing simultaneous
action in real time involving a large cast of characters. The
film's technique and technology are fresh. The story isn't. The
plot devices are moldy: A jealous lover. An estranged wife. A lying
sexpot. A loaded gun. (SM)1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey leads a reconnaissance mission to take over
a damaged German sub and capture the secret Nazi coding device
that's confounding U.S. efforts to win the war. Despite a
predictable script, blatant cliches and a penchant for
chest-beating fanfare music, ``U-571'' has plenty of furious
action, occasional suspense and lots of super-loud booms. It's no
``Das Boot,'' but it can suck you in. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 56
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin Suicides'' R (strong thematic
</P>
<P>
   elements involving teenagers)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst
</P>
<P>
   and Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   This shimmery, darkly comic adaptation of Jeffrey Eumenides
novel about five teen girls and the boys who obsess over them marks
the assured, often inspired feature debut from writer-director
Sofia Coppola. (Yes, that Sofia, who was unwisely cast by dad
Francis in his ``Godfather III.'') She takes a dreamy,
cinematically difficult book and creates a visually hypnotic movie.
(SM)1 hour, 36 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Heart Is'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natalie Portman
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   A cornpone comedy-drama about a single mom, made with enough
polish to be a guilty pleasure. Natalie Portman plays the pregnant
teen who heads for California and winds up becoming the Wal-Mart
Mom in Oklahoma. She gets good support from Stockard Channing,
Ashley Judd and Sally Field. (SM)2 hours. C+

 &HT;    `Small Time Crooks' hands over big-time laughs
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' is a small-change Woody Allen film. It's
also the writer-director's funniest in years, free of the sour
self-absorption of his late-1990s movies (especially ``Celebrity''
and ``Deconstructing Harry'').
</P>
<P>
   Allen plays ex-convict Ray Winkler, who's tired of his
dishwashing job and hits on a new plan to strike it rich: With
money saved by his manicurist wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), he
wants to rent an empty restaurant and use it as a front while he
and criminal cronies tunnel from its basement to the bank located a
few doors down.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchy, a big-haired blonde erupting out of lime-green stretch
pants, initially ridicules Ray's plan. She reminds him of his
previous ``two-year mandatory vacation'' behind bars and henpecks
him in front of his motley crew (including Jon Lovitz and a
cheerfully dumb Michael Rapaport). But it's Frenchy herself who
turns out to be the indispensable member of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   When she and Ray strike it rich, and not in the way you expect,
``Crooks'' switches from a character study of incompetence to a
culture-clash comedy. Production designer Santo Loquasto and
costume designer Suzanne McCabe cram the screen with hilarious
examples of pricey tackiness as Ray and Frenchy surround themselves
with brass objets d'art, garish jewels and an exasperated chef
(former designer Isaac Mizrahi, in a cameo) who concocts haute
cuisine _ to Ray's disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't get a cheeseburger, what's it all mean?'' he
grumbles, preferring to watch TV and drink a beer rather than mess
with finger bowls and four different forks. But for Frenchy, wealth
is a chance to narrow the gap between her downtown roots and her
uptown windfall. ``I want to be the real thing,'' she explains.
Which leads her into the orbit of a dapper art dealer (Hugh Grant
at his foppish best), who agrees to teach her about the finer
things in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' is ultimately as lightweight as one of the
stories Allen occasionally publishes in The New Yorker. But its
giddy offhandedness is part of its immense charm. It helps that
Allen, who's never really plausible as any sort of crook, recedes
into the background as the movie goes on. He makes room for Ullman,
who's a pitch-perfect character chameleon who can ground even her
silliest role in genuine feeling.
</P>
<P>
   As good as she is, though, the movie belongs to Elaine May
whenever she's on-screen. A writer-director herself (``A New
Leaf''), she plays Frenchy's cousin May, easily the dimmest
creature in a movie loaded with low-watt bulbs. With a slight lisp
and deadpan earnestness, May steals all her scenes while somehow
managing to make the character as sweet as she is stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The last third of ``Crooks'' sags a little, with a protracted
party sequence that's not as funny or suspenseful as it needs to
be. But you'll feel like cutting Allen some slack, just for wanting
to make us laugh again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tracey Ullman, Woody Allen, Elaine May and Hugh Grant.
Written and directed by Allen. Rated PG for profanity.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Allen remembers how to make us laugh in this sweet
culture-clash comedy.

 &HT;    Looks good, less filling
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leapin' Lizards! ``Dinosaur,'' Disney's years-in-the-making,
$200 million-plus computer-animated feature, is finally upon us.
And these lizards do more than leap. They fight, play, run, cuddle
and swim. They talk. They even dispense lessons in social skills
(work together) and Darwinian theory (survival of the fittest isn't
the ultimate good; look after old-lady dinosaurs because they might
be more useful than you think).
</P>
<P>
   Our hero is Aladar _ not the celebrated 1970s racehorse Alydar,
but an Iguanodon raised by a clan of lemurs after being separated
as an egg from his birth mother. As in last summer's ``Tarzan,''
the marsupial patriarch (voiced by Ossie Davis) is less than
thrilled by his mate's (Alfre Woodard) maternal instincts: ``Things
like that eat things like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. Aladar ( D.B. Sweeney) grows up into a nice
3-ton plant-eater who loves his adopted family. But then a meteor
shower _ a truly stupendous sequence _ destroys their island. So
Aladar and the few survivors set out to find food, water and maybe,
if they're lucky, other living things.
</P>
<P>
   They stumble onto a herd of dinosaurs (mixed species) whose
habitat was also destroyed by the meteors. Led by the dictatorial
Kron (Samuel E. Wright), they're headed for the fabled nesting
grounds, where they hope they'll be safe. Working against them:
thirst, hunger, flesh-eating Carnotaurs, scavenging Velociraptors,
and Kron's move-it, move-it, move-it tendency to leave the weak
behind as Raptor fodder. The kindhearted Aladar soon bonds with an
elderly Styrachosaur (Della Reese) and a towering Brachiosaur (Joan
Plowright), who's the last of her species. His protectiveness
catches the eye of Kron's sister (Julianna Margulies), much to
Kron's displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the plot is eerily close to Don Bluth's 1988 traditional
animated feature ``The Land Before Time,'' in which four baby
dinosaurs sought the Great Valley to be safe. Movie buffs may note
traces of ``Red River'' in the rivalry between Kron and Aladar. And
anyone who saw ``The Prince of Egypt'' will recognize egg-Aladar's
wild ride to his new home as the movie begins.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, unlike the marvelous ``Toy Story'' movies, which
delighted the mind and eye, ``Dinosaur'' offers $200 million in
special effects and a script worth about 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that won't bother the picture's target audience _ namely,
little ones whose favorite giant reptile is a purple non-people
eater named Barney. They'll get a kick out of the comic interaction
between Aladar and his adopted family (a balletic vine swing is
sensational). They'll be enthralled by the jaw-dropping credibiity
of this lost world and its myriad inhabitants. And the simple story
will hold their attention.
</P>
<P>
   But two warnings. First, while most of the movie is Barney-tame,
the scary parts are quite scary _ the aforementioned meteor shower
and several Carnotaur attacks. Second, any dinosaur-lovers whose
idea of dinsoaurs isn't baby-blue eyes and anthropomorphic
tendencies had best look elsewhere. Say, at your local video store
for ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>

<P>

   With the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Della Reese

 &HT;    `East-West' a conflicted Russian epic
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not the welcome home they expect. When Russian emigres
return to Russia after World War II, invited warmly by Josef Stalin
himself, they're met in their former motherland by soldiers with
guns. Some of them are shot on sight. Some are sent to labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Alexei (Oleg Menchikov) and his French wife,
Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire), look lucky. At the start of
``East-West,'' they're spared Stalin's wrath, primarily because
Alexei is a doctor. He's young and useful. So, with their young
son, they're sent to Kiev, where they're assigned a single-room
apartment in an overcrowded boardinghouse. It's a nest of paranoia
where tenants are ready to denounce each other to the police as a
show of their patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Finding herself trapped in an open-eyed nightmare, Marie
desperately tries to find ways to regain her liberty and return to
France. Every move she makes is monitored and reflects badly on
Alexei, who, to her growing horror, seems to be trying to be a
model citizen and move upward in the Soviet hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Their marriage becomes what appears to be an act of mutual
betrayal, as each tries to survive Stalin's brutal regime in ways
that undermine their trust in each other. The breach between them
widens when two very different people enter Marie's life.
</P>
<P>
   The first is Gabrielle (Catherine Deneuve), the grand French
actress whose theater company tours through Kiev, and whom Marie
sees as a possible liaison between herself and the French
government. The second is Sacha (Serguei Bodrov Jr.), a 17-year-old
swimmer who, like Marie, would like to escape Russia. She becomes
his unofficial coach, training him to swim hard, with the hopes of
winning a slot at the European championships in Vienna, where he
could seek political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Director Regis Wargnier builds an oppressively claustrophobic
atmosphere and constructs several suspenseful sequences. But, like
his Oscar-winning ``Indochine,'' this movie feels both overblown
and undernourished. It takes a fascinating bit of history, then
plies it with melodrama, and the movie seems conflicted between
epic storytelling and intimate drama. After a compelling first
half, ``East-West'' begins to feel dramatically haphazard; it jumps
forward in time, and its tightly coiled energy starts to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   It's mainly held together by Bonnaire, whose face is something
of a cinematic wonder _ at one moment lush and glamorous, the next
hard and haggard. She gets strong help from Menchikov as a man more
complicated than she thinks, and, of course, Deneuve is divine
sweeping in as a grande dame. The only disappointment in the cast
is Bodrov, with his blank, slightly dumb face. For the record, his
father, Serguei Bodrov Sr. (``Prisoner of the Mountains''), was one
of the screenwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``East-West''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandrine Bonnaire,
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Menchikov and Catherine Deneuve. Rated PG-13 for
</P>
<P>
   violence and brief sensuality. In French and Russian with
subtitles. 2 hours,
</P>
<P>
   1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An uneven Iron Curtain epic.

 &HT;    Spacey and company do a stellar sales job
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Jean-Paul Sartre, hell was other people. For the trio of
salesmen who are the focus of ``The Big Kahuna,'' hell is being on
the road in a hospitality suite in Wichita, Kan., stuck with a
plate of limp hors d'oeuvres and an important client to snag (i.e.,
the big kahuna.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on Roger Rueff's 1992 play ``Hospitality Suite'' and
directed by John Swanbeck, the film could be subtitled ``The
Near-Death Experiences of a Salesman.'' Larry (Kevin Spacey), Phil
(Danny DeVito) and Bob (Peter Facinelli) are in the industrial
lubricant business. Phil, at 52, is resigned and deflated, a man on
automatic. Twentysomething Bob is new and nervous, but grounded by
a deep religious faith that keeps him from being a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   Larry is, well, Kevin Spacey with all burners on and a lot of
very sharp dialogue. A dyspeptic, less dimensional cousin to
Spacey's Oscar-winning suburbanite in ``American Beauty,'' Larry is
all snide attitude and wired verborrhea. He and Phil bicker like an
old married couple. Phil knows Larry is going to mouth off about
everything from the cramped, sterile quarters to the cruddy
crudites they're going to serve in their washout of a hotel
hospitality suite. But Larry shakes up Bob in a nanosecond with his
withering abuse. His excuse? ``The carrot sticks went to my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' _ the play's name is so much better _
immediately conjures up comparisons to David Mamet. Sort of Mamet
Lite. Plus, its stage origins glow like Tony Curtis' teeth in a
1950s swashbuckler. But what pleasure there is in the acting. Not
so much newcomer Facinelli; he's out of his league, as 90 percent
of today's actors would be, and his role is the most facile of the
three. It's as if the playwright wanted to envision a character
with deep religious convictions but couldn't quite commit to it in
an intriguing way.
</P>
<P>
   But Spacey and DeVito are at the top of their game. OK, Spacey's
done this bit before. But he does it so darn well. Just listening
to his bile is a guilty pleasure. Further, look closer, as
``American Beauty'' suggests, and you discover that underneath the
showy cynic is a total company man who cares more about doing a
good job than anyone else in the room.
</P>
<P>
   As for DeVito, ever since the little-seen ``Living Out Loud,''
he's been taking unexpected risks, digging deeper into character
roles. His Phil is a marvel of emotional burnout, a walking midlife
crisis staring at a dead-end career and a failed marriage. Yet,
somehow, he keeps on going. He's Willy Loman, with a sigh and a
shoeshine. And in his sly, quiet way, he almost steals the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and Bob Facinelli. Directed
by John Swanbeck. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: See it for the acting.

 &HT;    A sophomoric journey to a real gross-out
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   College comes in many forms. The smart minds in ``Good Will
Hunting.'' The sliced-up bodies in ``Scream 2.'' And university
life's lowest common denominator, ``Road Trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it was filmed in metro Atlanta and at the University of
Georgia (the school stands in for both quasi-fictional University
of Ithaca and Austin's University of Texas), there's much that
local movie fans may want to see. Such as the UGA campus and the
seemingly hundreds of local extras strolling Athens and dancing at
locally filmed house parties.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a lot you may not want to see. ``Road Trip,''
produced by Ivan Reitman (``Animal House,'' ``Ghostbusters''), is
about a quartet of guys who head out to try and retrieve a sex
video sent astray. It has its share of gross-outs, from making fun
of large women to doing something completely disgusting with French
toast. And you thought ``American Pie'' might have gone too far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' is a dumb and dumber version of ``Animal House,''
which had gross-outs in its day but also wittily spoofed
fraternities, college parties, college government, the U.S.
government, ROTC, sex, drinking, drugs, dating and, of course, road
trips. ``Road Trip'' is nothing more than a series of sight gags
and put-downs. It's often funny, but it never has anything smart to
say. The trailer that's been playing everywhere reveals all the
major laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's saving grace is MTV genius Tom Green. He's the guy
on the tube who'll do anything _ paint polka dots on his parents'
house while they're away, or escort an ark of petting-zoo animals
into it. And he's funny. He does good bits in ``Road Trip'' but
isn't in it enough (he would sign on for only a 15-day stint, so
his character is mostly at the beginning and end).
</P>
<P>
   That leaves us with four less skilled actors performing most of
the film's antics. And, while some moviegoers obviously relish this
kind of shtick, these guys mostly just crash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Green. Rated R for strong sexual content, crude
humor, profanity and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Was college really like this? Well, sometimes.

 &HT;    Director Allen keeps low-tech profile when it comes to tools of
filmmaking
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen is asking for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you'll excuse me,'' he says. He has food in his mouth
and is making smacking noises as he chews on a thin slice of
toasted rye bread. It's all the midday meal he's going to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lunch was wheeled in on a cart,'' says Allen, 64, who's
ensconced in a Regency Hotel room in New York, promoting his latest
movie, ``Small Time Crooks,'' by phone. ``It was inedible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crooks,'' opening today in metro Atlanta, is a light,
sometimes slapstick comedy, written and directed by Allen, about a
penny-ante ex-convict (Allen), his manicurist wife (Tracey Ullman)
and how a bungled bank robbery somehow leads them to millions of
dollars when her fresh cookies become as popular in New York as
anything ``Seinfeld's'' Soup Nazi ever ladled up. The movie's
co-stars include Michael Rapaport, Hugh Grant, Jon Lovitz and
Elaine May as May, the dingiest of dingbats.
</P>
<P>
   Allen recently _ and politely _ responded to a variety of
questions about his new movie, his co-stars and even, ahem, Mia
Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many people are already comparing ``Small Time Crooks'' to
``Take the Money and Run.'' You see it that way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I can see why one might think that, because the lead
character in both is a bank robber. But this is a comedy just for
laughs. ``Take the Money'' was a pseudobiography. This is a much
different personal story. And what happens to the character is very
different. This is a much more plot-driven character story. While
``Take the Money'' was a bunch of crazy jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Elaine May's character is classic Elaine May. Did you write
the part for her?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a crazy thing to do. It's hard to get Elaine. I've known
her for years, slightly. And it was presumptuous of me to think
that I could get her. I was very lucky. She could just as easily
have said no with one of her many excuses. When I made ``Take the
Money,'' I offered her a part. She called back and said, ``You
won't want me for this part because I'm wearing a neck brace.''
With ``Crooks,'' she said send over the thing and then said sure.
And I was lucky with Tracey (Ullman) as well. I didn't write it
with anyone in mind. When we thought of her, we got so excited
because we knew she'd be so funny. And then to cap the whole thing
off, there's Hugh Grant. When I thought of Hugh Grant I thought,
`Perfect: He'd be great to play the heavy and he's got a great
sense of humor.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: Early on there's this great scene with you and Tracey Ullman
on the roof with this bright sunset. Was that something you
planned, or did it just happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: We did plan the rooftop scene. But we originally wanted
Tracey's cookie shop to be called Rainbow Cookies. We felt that it
was too expensive to get a rainbow and put it on special effects,
and we knew we could get a sunset on the roof. There were a lot of
problems, though. Problems of lighting it. The sun falls fast. We
had to do the scene very quickly. In the end, we would have been
better buying the rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You never really use much in the way of effects. Aren't you
part of the digital age?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not a technological person. I don't have a computer. No
word processor. I type on a portable typewriter. And some of that
stuff is expensive. For me, the technological devices are only good
as tools for telling the story. And what's happened in many films
is that directors use these effects and they are so dazzling and
wonderful and in the end they do the films to show the technical
effect. It becomes the means to the movie. . . . To parade it, I
don't care about that. I'm not interested in it. I think the movie
should be about people and situations. So I use the technology when
I have to, but it's rare when I have to. . . . In ``Celebrity'' I
needed to do a skywriting sequence, and I certainly could not have
gotten it done in the sky. We'd still be shooting today.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about digital filmmaking and digital projection and all
that technology that's supposed to change filmmaking?
</P>
<P>
   A: I saw one example of (digital projection) that didn't look
great to me. When it comes out and if it's genuinely something that
you want to do, then great. But what I've seen of it (right now) is
no big deal. . . . I do think the technology will improve and do
away with projecting film. . . . And the digital colors will be
rich and beautiful. And you won't have to go through all the
indignities of seeing your movie being projected (incorrectly).
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, in a way, you're embracing the new technology now?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. What I'll do is continue to film conventionally. And (as
the technology improves), if I feel there is a use for it, I will
use it. Right now, a digital camera would have been no help to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You used to not do many interviews. Now you're talking to the
press, doing a voice-over for ``Just Shoot Me,'' going to colleges
to promote ``Crooks.'' Why the change?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have to do a certain amount of promotion or I seem like a
louse. Especially when people come in and do work for me for
(practically) no money. I can't just not do anything. . . . I don't
relish these things. But I don't want to be a terrible person to
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read where Mia Farrow said she's wanting to mend fences
with Soon-Yi Previn.
</P>
<P>
   A: All fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about your competition at the movies this summer? You
thinking about seeing ``Mission: Impossible 2,'' ``Dinosaur'' or
``The Perfect Storm''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. I've never heard of any of those titles. I would never
have the slightest interest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what recent films did interest you?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the last six months, I enjoyed ``Magnolia.'' I enjoyed
``The Wonder Boys.'' I enjoyed ``East-West.'' Those were films I
like. Most of the other films I have no interest in at all. Those
films are for kids. It's the stuff I would have loved when I was 12
years old.

`JOURNEY OF MAN': THE ASCENT OF MANKIND _ AN ALLEGORY IN 38
MINUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The French-Canadian troupe Cirque du Soleil is
renowned for conjuring visual magic that fuses dance and the circus
arts in scenarios that often carry a mythical and spiritual charge.
And in the tableaus they have created for the new Imax-3D film
``Journey of Man'' they have compiled an all-engulfing sensuous
wonder book of aesthetic adventures with a light moral gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Cirque du Soleil's acrobats leap, twirl and dive in
spectacular natural settings, you often have the sensation of
forsaking the everyday world and plunging into a strange,
paradisaical and slightly scary dimension of pure myth, with a
Gallic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious dual allegory, the movie, which opens Friday at the
Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, roughly parallels the ascent of
humankind from caves into a civilized stateliness with symbolic
portrayals of the human life cycle from early childhood to old age.
As beautiful as the movie is, its brief 38-minute length prevents
it from having much impact as a sweeping allegory. Almost before
the movie begins, it seems to be over.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the film, directed by Keith Melton, written by Steve
Roberts and Peter Wagg, and narrated by Ian McKellen with a
high-toned hauteur, works as a series of enthralling tableaus that
seem almost to burst out of one another like visionary flashes from
an unusually vivid dream.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with an illustration of the Big Bang theory of
creation, as an explosion of light and a pounded bass drum
introduce Cirque du Soleil percussionists painted and costumed as
Japanese taiko drummers performing in a court style that dates back
to the eighth century. As they play, an embryonic ``universal
child'' appears who at the end of the sequence is plunged into the
ocean to be ``born'' in an interpretive dance performed underwater
by a group synchronized swimmers with amazing breath control.
</P>
<P>
   Rocketing out of the water, the child lands in an enchanted
redwood forest (the movie's most magical sequence) where he meets
his ``instinctual guides,'' the Flounes, a pair of clownish
parental shamans who watch over him like silent guardian angels.
The tableau is dominated by yellow bird-like bungee jumpers who
leap from the trees like human yo-yo's. At first they seem scary.
But once the child has mustered his courage, they whisk him off
into a different world.
</P>
<P>
   Finding himself in a craggy arid canyon that suggests a
spectacular limbo (the sequence was filled in Valley of Fire State
Park in the Nevada desert), the child, now adolescent, looks up to
observes a muscular daredevil, poised on a pinnacle, deftly
manipulating a gleaming metallic cube. Inspired by his courage, the
boy eventually makes his way to the top of the canyon as the cube
bursts into flame and his elusive idol sails away into the
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is an idyllic 17th-century garden in whose
reflecting pool two statues, floating on a giant lily pad come to
life, perform a precarious, slow-motion balancing act that
demonstrates an idealized yin-yang harmony (devoid of overt
eroticism) between man and woman.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes a quasi-biblical turn with the arrival of the
evil Stiltman, a mildly satanic figure who tempts the young man
with a gold bowler hat symbolizing wealth and power.
</P>
<P>
   In the next scene, the man, surrounded by elegant luxury, is
entertained by the Banquine, a group of vagabond tumblers who try
to revive the spirit of his lost childhood. In the final chapter,
the now mature man, his youthful joie de vivre restored, reunites
with the Flounes and finds himself at the Brandenberg Gate in
Berlin surrounded by children whom he leads toward knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journey of Man'' may not impart much genuine wisdom. But it
conveys plenty of wonder while mostly avoiding any saccharine
preachiness. At its most evocative, you really do feel you've
stumbled into an enchanted realm. &QL;

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS _ TAKE 1
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's been a lot in the media about Sen. John McCain
finally endorsing Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president, but I
don't recall seeing anything about Bill Bradley doing so for Vice
President Al Gore. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: When Bradley quit the Democratic presidential race in early
March, he said he would ``support'' Gore and would campaign for
him. However, the former New Jersey senator pointedly did not use
the word ``endorse.'' Asked why, he told reporters: ``It's your
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also didn't release his delegates to Gore. Bradley had
412 delegates, compared to Gore's 1,424. ``They've been loyal
supporters and deserve to have their voices heard (at the
Democratic National Convention),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today, meanwhile, reports that a joint appearance between
Gore and Bradley may be in the works. Although Bradley hasn't
spoken to Gore since March 9 and the two sides have had a
``non-relationship,'' according to Bradley's staff, a Gore
spokesman said the campaigns are in ``close contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand there's a government Web site with safety tips
for foreign travel. Where can I can find it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department posts information online at
http://travel.state.gov/travelwarnings.html; or you can call
202-647-5225.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been interested in the Lewis &AMP; Clark Expedition for
several years, and have visited many sites along the trail. Where
are their original diaries stored?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are kept in temperature- and humidity-controlled
conditions at the American Philosophical Society Museum in
Philadelphia, according to a spokeswoman for the Lewis &AMP; Clark
Center in St. Charles, Mo. They aren't available for public
viewing. Scholarly researchers may be able to see them, but only
under strict conditions.
</P>
<P>
   She added that a traveling Lewis &AMP; Clark exhibition is planned
``in a couple of years.'' It will have many artifacts, but details
aren't yet available. She didn't know its schedule, itinerary, or
even what it might contain. If you haven't seen anything about it
by the end of 2001, call the Lewis &AMP; Clark Center for information:
636-947-3199.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the name of the water that comes as a gel and can be
used in gardening? Where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be thinking of Soil Moist, although it isn't exactly
what you're describing. It sounds like it would serve the purpose,
however. It's a granular product that can be added to pots. When
you water the pots, the granules form a clear gel that gradually
releases water into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   It's available in two sizes at gardening centers: 3 ounces for
$3.97 and one pound for $18.97. In summer, most container gardens
require daily watering, so the gels are ideal for when people are
away from home on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about tickets to the NCAA men's
basketball Final Four tournament in 2002?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ticket application information for the 2002 Final Four, March
30 and April 1 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, won't be available
until March 2001. NCAA spokeswoman Megan Wallace advises checking
online at www.ncaachampionships.com in late March 2001for further
information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the U.S. Mint issued any state commemorative quarters so
far in 2000? It seems like I have seen two new ones.
</P>
<P>
   A: Right you are. The first issue of the Mint's 50 state
quarters program this year is for Massachusetts. It features a
design of the minuteman, the famous statue at The Minuteman
National Historical Park in Concord. The year's second quarter, for
Maryland, highlights the dome of the Maryland Statehouse. Next is
South Carolina, to be followed by New Hampshire and Virginia. The
Mint is issuing five new quarters a year over a 10-year period.
This is the second year of the program.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, you can keep up with all the state quarters as
they're issued at www.usmint.gov/50states/.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who or what is Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico
named for? It hasn't been mentioned in all the reporting about the
disastrous fire around Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   A: The name comes from Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier
(1840-1914), a Swiss-American explorer, anthropologist and
archaeologist whose main interest was the Indians of the American
Southwest. He was an early advocate of ``participant observation,''
learning about the Indians not only by living with them and
studying their culture, but also by studying their artifacts and
the ruins on their land.
</P>
<P>
   One of his primary goals was to dispel white Americans' myths
about the Indians. The best way to do that, he concluded, was by
living with the Indians and then writing about them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his research was published as ``Final Report of
Investigations Among the Indians of the Southwestern Portion of the
United States'' (1890 and 1892). In 1903, he joined the staff of
the American Museum of Natural History and later he lectured on
Spanish-American literature at Columbia University. In 1911 he went
to Spain, where he worked until his death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson officially designated the area
encompassing Frijoles Canyon as Bandelier National Monument. Many
archaeological sites, such as Shohakka Pueblo, Tsankawi and San
Miguel, are within its 50 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any multi-state lotteries other than Big Game and
Powerball?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, one other: the Tri-State Lottery (Maine, New Hampshire
and Vermont).
</P>
<P>
   Q: President and Mrs. Clinton and Vice President and Mrs. Gore
all attended the funeral in New York for Cardinal John O'Connor.
When both the president and vice president leave Washington for an
occasion such as this, do they travel together on the same
aircraft? Or, for security reasons, do they travel separately?
</P>
<P>
   A: The White House declined to answer specifically whether they
would or would not have been aboard the same aircraft, or what the
policy might be. A spokesman who said he was speaking on
background, and not for attribution, said only that the two had
traveled together on some past campaign trips, but because each now
has a busy schedule, they travel separately more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are any free or inexpensive special events planned in
connection with the baseball All-Star Game, similar to the NFL
Experience during the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The ``blockbuster'' event for the public, as promoters
call it, is the John Hancock All-Star FanFest, scheduled July 7-11
at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta. It will include
interactive games, Major League clinics and seminars, autograph
sessions with players, displays of memorabilia, and other
baseball-related activities.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th annual FanFest, leading up to the 71st All-Star Game
July 11 at Turner Field, is described as ``the biggest single
baseball event in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any details about a class-action suit against
Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses?
</P>
<P>
   A: A federal judge in New York has granted class-action status
to about 60 lawsuits that charge the two auction houses with
colluding to fix prices.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by The Wall Street Journal, it's a blow to Sotheby's
and Christie's because the ruling, issued late last month by U.S.
District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, allows plaintiffs seeking
millions of dollars in damages to avoid the expense and trouble of
separate trials.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan defined the class broadly as anyone who bought or sold
articles through the defendant auction houses from Jan. 1, 1993,
through Feb. 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Both auction houses are under investigation by the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division. At issue is whether the two
concerns colluded when, within weeks of each other, they changed
fees charged to buyers and sellers at auction. Together, the two
houses control about 95 percent of a $4 billion worldwide auction
market.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan has set a tentative trial date of February 2001 in the
event no settlement is reached earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We will be visiting D.C. in June and wonder about the status
of the restoration project at the Washington Monument. Will the
monument be reopened by then?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, no. Initially it was scheduled to reopen by July 4,
but that won't happen, according to Donna Desormeaux of the
Washington, DC Convention and Visitors Association. The restoration
and refurbishment project is nearly complete, but the best estimate
for reopening is ``sometime later this summer.'' Until then, the
National Park Service recommends that visitors check out the
interpretive center on the monument's grounds.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS _ TAKE 2
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ... or online at www.washington.org/.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the scoring system in baseball? What numbers
correspond to which positions?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the numbers assigned to each defensive player's
position: 1, pitcher; 2, catcher; 3, first baseman; 4, second
baseman; 5, third baseman; 6, shortstop; 7, left fielder; 8, center
fielder; 9, right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   An out is noted by listing the numbers of the players who touch
the ball. For example, a ground ball that is hit to the shortstop
who throws it to first base for an out is noted as 6-3. A
short-to-second-to-first double play: 6-4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of other symbols are used in recording the events of a
game, and people may have their own variations. A strikeout is a K,
but if it's on a called strike, the K is reversed. Base hits are 1B
(single), 2B (double), 3B (triple) and HR (home run).
</P>
<P>
   Other common abbreviations include BB (base on balls), E
(error), FC (fielder's choice, meaning a fielder catches a ground
ball and tries to get a runner out instead of the batter; or the
batter does reach first base safely, but isn't given credit for a
base hit); HBP (hit by pitch); PB (passed ball); WP (wild pitch); S
(sacrifice bunt); SF (sacrifice fly); L (lined out); F (flied out);
and CS (caught stealing).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever happened to actor Paul Reubens, who played the
character Pee-wee Herman? He had some personal problems a few years
ago, but I haven't seen anything about him since. Is he still in
show business?
</P>
<P>
   A: He appears to be finished with the ``sabbatical,'' as he
termed it, that followed in the wake of his 1991 arrest and
conviction for indecent exposure in a Florida adult theater.
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction, CBS pulled his ``Pee-wee's Playhouse''
series off the air, and stores yanked Pee-wee toys off the shelves.
He was the punchline in countless jokes, and even he made a joke
about himself on an MTV video music awards program a few weeks
after his arrest. He stepped out of the public eye, building up his
``ET'' memorabilia collection, gardening, and spending time with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Now he appears to be moving to regain his ruined career,
although taking it slowly. In 1995, he appeared in a recurring role
as a TV executive on ``Murphy Brown.'' He also had parts in the
films ``Dunston Checks In,'' ``Matilda'' and ``Mystery Men,'' and
finished a Dwight Yoakam-directed Western, ``South of Heaven, West
of Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   As he told an interviewer last year, he also plans to resurrect
Pee-wee in what he termed ``a semi-autobiographical movie . . .
about fame in our times. Pee-wee becomes famous and turns into a
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the five most-populated countries in the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: In terms of population, the world's largest country is China,
with an estimated 1.25 billion inhabitants in mid-1999 (one-fifth
of the world's total population). India, which recently topped 1
billion, ranks No. 2. The next three, as listed in World Almanac
and Book of Facts 2000: United States, with about 273 million
people in 1999; Indonesia, 216 million; and Brazil, 172 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Reports about the funeral for Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York stated that there are eight remaining U.S. cardinals. Who are
they? Also, can you explain the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic
Church?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually there are seven active cardinals in the United
States, not eight, said David Early of the U.S. Catholic Conference
in Washington. They are Cardinals Anthony Bevilacqua, Archdiocese
of Philadelphia; Francis George, Chicago; James Hickey, Washington,
D.C.; William Keeler, Baltimore; Bernard Law, Boston; Roger Mahony,
Los Angeles; and Adam Maida, Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   There are three other American cardinals, but they are working
in the Vatican, Early added.
</P>
<P>
   The hierarchy (organization of the clergy by rank) starts with
the pope, or Holy Father, who is head of the Roman Catholic Church
and the highest member of its clergy. Below the pope, in decreasing
order, are cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, and deacons.
The pope and bishops are responsible for the pastoral governance of
the Church.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, between the two sacramental orders of bishop and
priest, you sometimes find monsignor, a purely honorary title
granted to certain priests in recognition of exceptional service to
the Church.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused about the Catholic practice for cardinals, such
as the late John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, to have the first
name before the title. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's simply Catholic tradition, explained Bill Ryan of the
U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington, but it isn't universally
followed. ``Sometimes it's Cardinal followed by the first and last
names,'' Ryan added. General newspaper style, however, is to put
the title before the name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported on the title of cardinal in the Roman Catholic
Church, which sometimes appears before a first name, and sometimes
between the first and last names. Can you explain the origin of its
use in the latter way?
</P>
<P>
   A: It derives from an 18th century English custom, said Bill
Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington. Various nobles
_ such as Alfred Lord Tennyson _ rearranged their names and titles
for their own purposes. The practice was imitated by many courts in
Europe at the time, Ryan added, and survives to the present day,
although it's not common. As he explained earlier, it's not always
followed by the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In baseball, what exactly is a balk?
</P>
<P>
   A: The purpose of the balk rule _ which was adopted in 1899 _ is
to limit what the pitcher is allowed to do in an attempt to pick
off a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it's pretty simple: When the pitcher is on the mound
and his foot is in contact with the rubber, he cannot fake one
thing and then do another. He cannot fake a pitch and then throw to
a base, or fake a throw to a base and then pitch. If he starts
either action, he must finish that action without hesitation or
alteration.
</P>
<P>
   The rule specifies many specific actions, but it is a judgment
of the umpire as to whether or not one action was started (and not
completed).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently printed a poem that starts off ``Monday's child
is fair of face,'' and so on through the days of the week. This has
started a controversy in my family, because we can't find out what
day of the week we all were born on. Is there any such thing as a
perpetual calendar? Calendar companies used to distribute them free
years ago, but I can't find any now, and I've been told that
they're no longer available.
</P>
<P>
   A: Check the World Book Encyclopedia, Volume C, and under
Calendar you'll find three tables showing the day of the week for
any year desired, 1753 to 2030. The letters in the Table of Years
refer to the first column of the Table of Months. The figures in
the Table of Months refer to one of seven columns in the Table of
Days.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, to find what day of the week Christmas fell on in
1900, you'd look for 1900 in the Table of Years. It's followed by
the letter a. Look for a in the Table of Months, and under
December, you'll find the number 6. In the Table of Days, column 6
tells you that the 25th day, Christmas, fell on a Tuesday in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat easier if you're online. Go to
http://dmarie.com/asp/history.asp?action &QC; process. Enter the date
you're interested in, press Go, and information pops up showing
which day of the week it was, the top news stories of the day, most
popular songs of the times, average house and car prices, and more.
Another good eternal calendar site is www.aia-and.com/eternal.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Coca-Cola's million-dollar prize offer at Turner Field
in Atlanta be in effect during this summer's All-Star Game Home Run
Derby? What about during the All-Star Game itself?
</P>
<P>
   A: Atlanta Braves spokesman Glen Serra says Coke ended its $1
million reward in April for hitters who reached the Sky Field, in
the third deck in left field. No one ever did it, although on April
20 Andres Galarraga hit a towering shot that struck one foot from
the top of the foul pole, threatening to reach the ``unreachable''
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter soon will achieve the Gold Award from the Girl
Scouts. It's the highest honor Scouts can get. Who are some of
better-known recipients of this award? I'm having trouble locating
a listing of previous notable recipients.
</P>
<P>
   A: The reason you're having trouble is because there is no such
list. While many former Girl Scouts have gone on to become famous
in later life, records have not been kept showing which ones
received Gold Awards, said Ellen Christie-Ach of the organization's
New York office. It would be safe to conclude, however, that at
least some famous former Scouts achieved the Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you print the words to the Molson beer commercial, ``I
am Canadian Joe''?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the transcript of the commercial, ``Joe's Rant,'' as
performed by actor Jeff Douglas:
</P>
<P>
   I am not a lumberjack, or a fur trader.
</P>
<P>
   I don't live in an igloo,
</P>
<P>
   or eat blubber, or own a dogsled,
</P>
<P>
   and I don't know Jimmy, Suzie, or Sally from Canada,
</P>
<P>
   although I am certain they are really, really nice.
</P>
<P>
   I have a prime minister, not a president
</P>
<P>
   I speak English and French, not American
</P>
<P>
   I pronounce it ``about,'' not ``a boot''
</P>
<P>
   I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack
</P>
<P>
   I believe in peacekeeping, not policing
</P>
<P>
   Diversity, not assimilation
</P>
<P>
   and that the beaver is a proud and noble animal.
</P>
<P>
   The tuque is a hat,
</P>
<P>
   A chesterfield is a couch,
</P>
<P>
   And ``Z'' is pronounced zed, not zee, ZED
</P>
<P>
   Canada is the second-largest land mass,
</P>
<P>
   The first nation of hockey, and
</P>
<P>
   the best part of North America!
</P>
<P>
   My name is Joe, and
</P>
<P>
   I am Canadian!

   TULIA, Texas _ Like a pulled thread that unravels a garment,
Swisher County's biggest-ever drug bust is destroying the fabric of
the small black community in the Panhandle, say people affected by
it. Others blame the damage on the prevalence of crack cocaine,
which they say justifies the operation and the large number of
arrests. Of the 357 blacks who reside in Tulia, 32, or one of every
11, was arrested as a result of an 18-month undercover
investigation. Of the 45 people indicted, 43 were arrested and two

   HAMLET-DIRECTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In Michael Almereyda's contemporary version of William
Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,'' the melancholy Dane is no longer a Dane
but a New Yorker _ an aspiring filmmaker and the son of the slain
president of Denmark Corp. Hamlet spends a lot of time in the back
of limousines, the ``To be or not to be'' soliloquy plays out in
the action-movie aisles of an empty Blockbuster Video, and firearms
make their way into the climactic swordfight. And although this all
takes place in the year 2000, everyone speaks in Elizabethan
dialogue and iambic pentameter. In other words, it ain't for
purists, and Almereyda isn't apologizing for that. By ROBERT

   UNDATED _ The first time we get a good look at Ethan Hawke in
Michael Almereyda's bizarre, contemporary version of ``Hamlet,''
he's wearing the tinted, black-rimmed glasses of an ``artiste.''
The first person who came to my mind wasn't a melancholy Dane but a
pompous Irishman _ with the specs on, Hawke bears a faint
resemblance to Bono, the self-important lead singer of U2. This may
be a highly personal reaction, but it's appropriate because, like
Bono, this ``Hamlet'' is often pretentious, but likable in spite of
itself. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment

wrapping their products in bunting by knowingly perpetuating the
Second Amendment fraud and thereby persuading gun enthusiasts that
they are upholding some grand constitutional principle by opposing
gun control legislation. It is well, then, that the Million Mom
March has not ended with the events of last weekend. A Million Mom
March Foundation is to be formed to keep up the pressure for more
gun control legislation and the enforcement of that already on the
books. At the same time, the foundation will provide the public
with information on how its representatives in Congress stand on
gun issues and the extent of their support from the gun lobby. By

   NEW YORK _ The Guggenheim's ``1900: Art at the Crossroads'' is a
wacky exercise in historical simulation, the excuse being a new
century. It is hard to remember the last time so many bad pictures
were in one place at one time, unless you consider eBay a place.
But the show no doubt will be as popular in New York as it was in
London. There is no underestimating the public's taste for kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good deal of excellent art mixed in among the dogs,
and sometimes what is best is not what you would expect, which is
partly the show's point. It tries to conjure up the situation in
art at the turn of the last century, when Picasso was a
little-known young Spaniard, and a French painter named Paul Chabas
won the gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle for a
vaporous confection of soft-core bathing beauties called ``Joyous
Frolics.'' We see Mondrian cheek by jowl with Albijn Van den
Abeele, Renoir with Anders Zorn, Kandinsky with Pal Szinyei Merse.
If you think you know who comes out on top in each case, you are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We're meant to look anew at a moment 100 years ago, when it was
not yet clear who would be the pioneers in the 20th century and who
would be forgotten. Thus recapturing innocence, we can make
connections between conservatives and avant-gardists, Americans and
Finns, one generation and another, which for the sake of
simplification or because of ignorance art historians have glossed
over or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea, anyway. The lesson is simply that ``history is
messy,'' Simon Schama's phrase, which the catalog approvingly
quotes, although it might be more precise to say that the present
is messy while history, after historians have finished with it, is
always too tidy.
</P>
<P>
   It is useful to be reminded of this. But we ought to be careful
about taking ``1900'' too much at face value. This being a global
age, imagine an exhibition of current art that mixed selections
from the Venice Biennale with art made by members of the National
Academy of Design; work by star graduates from art schools in
Beijing, Los Angeles and Cairo; and examples by the leading
Argentine and Portuguese portrait painters, whoever they are. An
interesting cross section maybe, but would it fairly represent
where we are now in art, or would it be a hodgepodge of the sort
one could fabricate for any year during the last century or two?
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, we find the young Picasso, Mondrian, Kupka
and Kandinsky, who, had they stopped painting in 1900, we can
presume would be ignored today. Kupka, soon to invent pure
abstraction, was painting frothy lunching parties for the 1900
Paris fair, retrograde art for the marketplace by someone with more
talent and imagination than what we see suggests (demonstrating
that one should be careful before writing off a young artist).
</P>
<P>
   It is vaguely interesting to be reminded of how Kupka, Picasso
and the others conformed to convention at the turn of the century.
But hindsight is why they are here, and it's of limited historical
value to note that at that instant they were outshone by more
successful artists whom they would soon eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   The show, with 250 paintings and sculptures filling the whole
museum, was organized by Robert Rosenblum, the art historian, now a
Guggenheim curator, who has written widely about old and new art.
His unconventional textbook on the 19th century puts many
once-famous, now-forgotten figures into the story line. The
exhibition extends this principle. Rosenblum assumes scholastic
neutrality about whether, say, Carl Wilhelmson is as good a painter
as Cezanne. They worked at the same time; they're both in the show.
We decide.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is laughably easy, but detractors will call this an
abdication of curatorial responsibility. You can bet that
traditionalist critics are charging up their computers to fight the
latest Armageddon of artistic standards at the Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. The show provides compensatory rewards for its
schlock quotient and whatever might be unclear about its
inclusionary standards.
</P>
<P>
   There are discoveries, for example, and this is a reason to see
any show. Eugene Jansson was painting luminous scenes in an
Impressionist mode when Monet was painting London and the Seine,
and Jansson holds his own in a single picture of Stockholm Bay.
Ignacio Zuloaga, the flashy Spanish society portraitist, stands out
for a bizarre homage to Velazquez in the form of a portrait of a
dwarf, and he comes across as more daring than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand Hodler, the important Swiss painter, can't be called a
discovery, but he emerges as an even more refined, luminous
innovator in this context. Likewise, Eugene Carriere, the Symbolist
who painted misty spiritualistic monochromes with the quality of
nighttime snapshots, proves to be a true original.
</P>
<P>
   Carriere, Zuloaga and others exemplify a widespread mood of
paranoia, pessimism and general fin-de-siecle angst, cutting across
nationalities, generations and styles. It isn't quite true that not
a single picture in this exhibition depicts the sun shining through
clear skies, but almost. These are literally dark works. Poverty,
religious fear, loneliness, sexual anxiety including homosexual
guilt, distrust of industrialization: They're the symptoms of a
psychic havoc wrought by Freud, late Victorianism, urban sprawl,
the reshuffling of social classes and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Who can deny that these artists had a reason to be glum?
</P>
<P>
   Two world wars later, after the bloodiest century in history, we
should regard them as visionaries. Even the glassy world of the
supremely retrograde academic William-Adolphe Bouguereau suggests a
desperation to escape from reality. One of the show's surprises is
simply reminding us that Bouguereau was still around when someone
like Maurice de Vlaminck was painting ``The Bar,'' a brash and
grotesque paean to modern night life, primed for hard times.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first exhibition to present a cross section of a
year from a century ago. The Orsay Museum in Paris did something
similar in 1993 about painting across Europe in 1893, a smaller
show, less flashy. That was an underappreciated experiment because
the time perhaps wasn't right. Exhibitions of old art, whatever
they're about, are successful only if they speak to the present,
and the value of ``1900,'' its drawbacks aside, is ultimately to
hold up a mirror to now.
</P>
<P>
   The situation for art in 2000 seems as hard to parse as it
clearly was 100 years ago. And 1900 was also an in-between moment,
a creative no man's land, despite everything that was going on.
Cezanne, Degas, Renoir and Monet were around, but they were no
longer new. That goes double for Bouguereau. Cubism was still a few
years off. Art has these difficult-to-define episodes, then moves
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   The show also proves that bad art can sometimes get a second
look, profitably. Because painting today encompasses camp without
guilt, it wouldn't be surprising if Leon Frederic's triptych ``The
Stream,'' with its Rubensian babies cascading through Alpine mist,
caught some contemporary artists' attention, if only for its sheer
hypnotic awfulness. I could imagine that John Currin, for example,
a fashionable painter now, might be intrigued by Frederic or by
Antonio Teixeira Carneiro, the Portuguese Symbolist, or even by
Bouguereau.
</P>
<P>
   It takes fresh eyes to see art turned on its head. Jean-Leon
Gerome, Bourguereau's conservative colleague, inspired Dali with
his ``Optician,'' a trompe l'oeil curio painted for a 1902 Paris
exhibition of advertising signs: a dog with a monocle is sandwiched
between a pince-nez with disembodied eyes and the fractured word
``O PTI CIEN.'' It is a pun on ``Au petit chien,'' meaning ``oh,
little dog'' or ``at the sign of the little dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Wordplay. Surrealism. No wonder Dali loved it. Rosenblum calls
the work an instance of unwitting prophesy: ``Who would have
expected the stuffy Jean-Leon Gerome, who railed against the
Impressionists at the 1900 fair, to produce a strange painting that
offered a preview of Dada and Surrealism?''
</P>
<P>
   One might put it this way: that artists, who are trained to
think unconventionally, often do not feel as constrained as the
rest of us by the verdicts of art historians, so they may sometimes
help us see what we dismiss too easily or refuse to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Patience is required. This show strains it. The weak-hearted and
modern-day culture Pharisees may never get past the shock of
confronting so much of the art that the abstractionists were
rebelling against in a great museum created as a shrine to
20th-century abstraction. Heathens have taken over the temple
again. Could there by any further blasphemy?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes. The traveling Norman Rockwell exhibition arrives
at the Guggenheim soon.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A weakening upper-level low, which spawned a swarm of tornadoes
in the Plains on Wednesday and more twisters across the Middle West
on Thursday, will move east from the Ohio Valley toward the Middle
Atlantic states on Friday. The depleted state of the upper-level
low will limit severe weather. Nonetheless, isolated damaging winds
can still occur east of the central Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   A low-pressure system over southern Ohio will ripple east along
a cold front, drawing moist air south of the front over a wedge of
cool air north of the front. As a result, cool rain will spread
slowly east over the central Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Widely separated thunderstorms, some with hail and damaging
winds, will erupt from northeast Texas to the Tennessee and lower
Ohio Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WET WYOMING
</P>
<P>
   At Casper, Wyo., nearly 70 percent of the 12 inches of average
annual precipitation occurs from late spring to summer. Most of
this growing-season precipitation falls from thunderstorms. On
Wednesday, 2.22 inches of rain deluged Casper as a potent
disturbance churned across the Rockies. Wednesday's rainfall
amounted to more than Casper's entire May average of two inches.
Like Casper, many towns that lie in the lee of the Rockies receive
a mere modicum of rain, on average, frequently rendered dry by the
lofty Rockies, which act like a shield against Pacific moisture. &QL;

 &HT;    EASTWOOD SAYS LAWYERS EXPLOITING LAW FOR A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS
 &HT;    360&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a noisy audience in wheelchairs on one side of
the issue and Clint Eastwood on the other, a congressional
subcommittee considered Thursday whether businesses should be
warned before being sued for violating the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The current law ``is just not fair,'' Eastwood told a House
Judiciary panel.
</P>
<P>
   The actor and former mayor of Carmel, Calif., said he supports
the goals of the ADA, a decade-old statute requiring public
accommodations to be accessible to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said unscrupulous lawyers are ``perverting the law''
by filing scores of lawsuits against small businesses and
collecting legal fees even if the problem is corrected as soon as
the owner learns of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawyers cloak themselves under the guise they're doing a
favor for the disabled, when really they're doing a disservice,''
said Eastwood. The actor said he was hit with such a lawsuit and a
demand for $500,000 in legal fees concerning an alleged ADA
violation at his Mission Ranch Hotel and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing of the Constitution subcommittee, Eastwood
testified in support of an amendment authored by Reps. Mark Foley
and E. Clay Shaw, both Florida Republicans. The legislation would
require that businesses be notified of an ADA violation and given
time to fix it before being sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply says that, before filing a lawsuit against a
business for ADA access violations, let the business know it's out
of compliance and give them 90 days to clean up their act,'' said
Foley. ``If they don't, then by all means, sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the vocal observers in wheelchairs who crowded the hearing
room and hallway outside, though, sentiment was decidedly against
the change.
</P>
<P>
   With the amendment, business owners could just await a violation
notice _ that might not ever come _ before making their
establishments accessible to the handicapped, opponents told the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary economic incentive driving voluntary compliance is
avoidance of litigation and the prospect of paying attorneys' fees
if the complaining party prevails,'' said Christine Griffin,
executive director of the Disability Law Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow.)
</P>
<P>
   However, Foley said the amendment is needed because lawyers are
exploiting the law set up to protect the civil rights of disabled
people. While the statute prevents disabled plaintiffs for
receiving damage awards, it allows fees for attorneys who file
lawsuits claiming violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ADA is being used by some attorneys to shake down
thousands of businesses from Florida to California,'' Foley told
the subcommittee. ``And they're doing it at the expense of people
with disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Donna and David Batelaan, a disabled couple who own and
operate a mobility equipment business in Lake Worth, Fla., said
they were sued _ without notice _ for having an improperly painted
handicapped parking spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost us less than $100 to correct the infraction and $2,000
for attorney's fees,'' said Donna Batelaan.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Fields Jr., a West Palm Beach, Fla., attorney, said he
fought for the rights of the disabled for years and ``never thought
that I would be on the other side'' defending businesses. But he
told of defending the owner of a baseball card shop who had
promptly corrected his ADA deficiencies but was then hit with a
bill for $4,500 in attorney's fees and costs.
</P>
<P>
   He said 1,000 such suits have been filed in South Florida, and
predicted a national ``explosion of ADA litigation'' unless the law
is changed.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy K. Fields, the assistant Palm Beach County attorney, said
that the county commission had adopted a resolution urging Congress
to pass the ADA amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission acted after one law firm filed 38 lawsuits in two
weeks against ``longtime established mom and pop businesses'' who
were unaware of modifications they needed to make to comply with
the ADA. The suits were filed on behalf of a disabled Broward
County child and included cases against a liquor store and a pawn
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Once informed of their violations, most of the businesses
quickly tried to fix the problems, Fields said. ``They then
received demand letters from the plaintiffs attorney for $5,000 in
fees.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses warned that the law should not be weakened
because of actions of a few greedy attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law has been on the books for a decade, pointed out
Frederick Shoz, owner of an ADA consulting company in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., so businesses have had plenty of time to come
into compliance. He said it is unfair to ask disabled people to
wait another 90 days when they encounter an illegal obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee members said the issue presents a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it does seem unfair to file a lawsuit without warning
and charge legal fees to an unknowing small business owner who acts
quickly to comply with the law to provide proper access to the
disabled. However, without the threat of a lawsuit, there is no
incentive to provide the legal accessibility until receiving the
90-day notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very difficult issue to deal with,'' said Rep. Mel
Watt, D-N.C.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BATTLEFIELD EARTH,' starring John Travolta and Barry Pepper.
Directed by Roger Christian (PG-13, 117 minutes). In the year 3000,
beings from the planet Psychlo conquer Earth in only nine minutes
and reduce all humans to grunting illiterates. The chief nasty,
Terl (Travolta), devises a scheme to put the man-animals to work in
the gold mines for him. He sees potential in one cave dweller
(Pepper) and straps him to a machine that beams the wisdom of the
ages into his head. Little does Terl realize that by educating a
human, he is sowing the seeds of his own destruction. Sitting
through this film with its stock villains is like watching the most
expensively mounted high school play of all time. It may be a bit
early to make such judgments, but ``Battlefield Earth'' may well
turn out to be the worst movie of this century (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTER STAGE,' starring Ethan Stiefel, Sascha Radetsky, Amanda
Schull, Peter Gallagher and Donna Murphy. Directed by Nicholas
Hytner (PG-13, 113 minutes). Hytner's film tracks the professional
and romantic travails of a group of young dancers at the fictitious
American Ballet Academy in New York. The script is a patchwork of
showbiz movie and romantic comedy cliches, and the acting rarely
rises above daytime soap-opera obviousness, but who ever went to a
dance movie to see good writing or realistic acting? The movie is
loaded with lively dance sequences, and Hytner films them
beautifully, especially the show-stopping finale, choreographed by
Susan Stroman and spiritedly danced by Stiefel, Radetsky and the
lovely Schull, who carries the movie with her energy and grace
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `COMING SOON,' starring Bonnie Root, Gaby Hoffmann and Mia
Farrow. Directed by Colette Burson (R, 91 minutes). Burson's
teen-age comedy was twice threatened with an NC-17 rating by the
MPAA, but this tale of a somewhat directionless high school
senior's quest for her first orgasm (and, incidentally, a spot at
an Ivy League college) is much less offensive than a lot of smirky,
cynical PG-13 fare. It is unusual to see the sexuality of young
women treated with such candor, and Burson's satirical view of
Stream, her heroine (Root), is leavened with respect. The movie
often loses focus, and the comic pace often flags. The real fun
lies not in following Stream's episodic travails but in watching
Hoffmann as her spoiled best friend and Farrow as her holy hippie
terror of a mother compete to see who can steal the most scenes
from the wan, earnest Root (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `EAST-WEST,' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and
Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115 minutes).
After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda
campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return home.
Alexei Golovine (Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie (Bonnaire),
the couple at the heart of Wargnier's sumptuous, moving historical
melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow returnees, who are
killed or imprisoned on arrival. ``East-West'' chronicles Alexei's
ambivalence about their new life in a drab, depressing communal
apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to escape it. The film may
be faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in Hollywood-style
catharsis, but it also uses the resources of old-fashioned
emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed light on forgotten history.
``East-West'' is a grand costume pageant, full of grandeur and
period detail, but it is also the portrait of a marriage under
extreme external and internal pressure, and a showcase for two
great film actresses: Bonnaire and Deneuve, playing an actress who
becomes aware of Marie's plight during a tour of the Soviet Union
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `FREQUENCY,' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by
Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the Future'' meets
``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ``The
Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental
supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is a morose
young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter,
on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that
cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two
collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a
serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea
Stadium (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GLADIATOR,' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: What would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. Crowe is the noble Roman general who ends
up fighting for his life. Crowe gives a performance with
ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He
holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `HAMLET,' starring Ethan Hawke, Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles,
Bill Murray, Diane Venora and Sam Shepard. Directed by Michael
Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Almereyda has rooted his voluptuous and
rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's play in today's
Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and squalor give the
movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a complex character in
this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often shaded in lush,
soothing hues of blue, ``Hamlet'' exudes an intoxicating masochism
in which half the cast is battling despondency and the other half
has the glint of imminent insanity. Here, the melancholy of Hamlet
(Hawke) over the death of his father is almost a state of grace: it
gives him a sense of purpose that the other characters lack. The
director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity that makes
this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's language and
intent intact (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `I DREAMED OF AFRICA,' starring Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez.
Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 120 minutes). This screen
adaptation of Kuki Gallmann's memoir about her life in Kenya with
an adventurer husband and two children is little more than a
picturesque travelogue. Although the story is loaded with tragedy,
a stiff, expository screenplay and mostly weak performances keep it
from resonating. Basinger's spaced-out baby-doll Kuki and Perez's
petulant husband render this conservation-minded couple remote and
vaguely unsympathetic. That couldn't have been the movie's
intention (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LOVE AND BASKETBALL,' starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps.
Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (PG-13, 118 minutes). The
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature-film debut, about
the romantic and competitive bond between the basketball players
Monica (Lathan) and Quincy (Epps), has an enchanting, lived-in
homeyness. Prince-Bythewood does a wonderful job of creating an
atmosphere for her characters _ particularly for the superb Lathan
_ but the movie fails to fashion a consistent narrative. It doesn't
seem to be about anything. But it is a promising first movie from a
filmmaker with a lot to offer. Who knew anyone could get a drama
out of Title IX, the federal law ensuring that girls get a chance
to compete in school sports? (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `TIME CODE,' starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Saffron Burrows, Holly
Hunter and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 93
minutes). Figgis' astonishing new film, shot in a single day with
hand-held digital video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously,
in real time. ``Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the
hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest
declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its
technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear
and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting
from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Tripplehorn and
Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of
pathos. Whether ``Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold
prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky
curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it is hard
to think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible
possibilities of film (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `28 DAYS,' starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Steve
Buscemi and Dominic West. Directed by Betty Thomas (PG-13, 110
minutes). Bullock gives a creditable performance as Gwen Cummings,
a fun-loving New York writer ordered to visit a drug and alcohol
rehabilitation clinic after a drunken car accident. Veering
unsteadily between comedy and suds, the movie portrays Gwen's
fellow residents at Serenity Glen as a bunch of goofy caricatures
and confuses things further with its dime-store psychologizing. It
ultimately reduces the rehab experience to a zany (but mostly
unfunny) summer-camp farce (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `U-571,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon
Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow, whose previous film, ``Breakdown,''
was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open
spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie.
McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he
is cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a
Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and
his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow
does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a
minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever
seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and
Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes).
Coppola's directorial debut, adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides' 1993
novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970s
Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and
emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual
black humor. The movie's best moments have an inspired feeling of
playfulness and freedom matched by Dunst's smart, beguiling
performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening propels her and
her sisters to their doom. But despite Coppola's keen instincts,
and the beautifully understated acting of Woods and Turner as the
Lisbon parents, ``The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by the
self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its source
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `WHERE THE HEART IS,' starring Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd.
Directed by Matt Williams (PG-13, 115 minutes). Young Novalee
Nation (Portman) is terribly phobic about the number five, and
about five minutes into this astonishingly shameless melodrama with
its lower-class sweetheart heroine, you will start to feel exactly
the same way. The movie seems to be stuck with its own five
fixation, too, because a new character or situation is introduced
every five minutes, or so it feels, to keep things lively.
Abandoned by her boyfriend, Novalee gives birth in a Wal-Mart. She
later befriends a nurse ( Judd), a single mom with a passel of
children, and takes up photography. The audience doesn't get credit
for being able to track a character through life without the film's
being stuffed with enough nutty incidents _ a kidnapping,
catastrophic storms _ for an entire season of television
(Mitchell).

GERMANY'S DRESDNER BANK TO LAY OFF 10 PERCENT OF WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Dresdner Bank AG, which abandoned merger
talks last month with Germany's largest bank, Deutsche, is expected
to announce plans on Friday to reduce its work force by 5,000
people _ about 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as Dresdner, Germany's third largest bank, is
struggling to regain its balance after the collapse of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner, like most of Germany's other big banks, is under
tremendous pressure to reduce costs in its retail banking business.
Before calling off their planned merger, Dresdner and Deutsche had
planned to eliminate a combined total of 16,000 jobs and about
5,900 in the retail banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner executives knew they would have to consolidate
operations regardless of whether they merged with another bank. But
the severity of the anticipated job cuts, first reported Thursday
by Dow Jones Newswires, is far more than banking industry analysts
had foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts also would be the first concrete move by Dresdner's new
chairman, Bernd Fahrholz, who took over on May 1 after Bernard
Walter resigned from the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrholz, who will preside over Dresdner's annual shareholder
meeting on Friday, will also be making his first extended
appearance in public and providing his first clues to his strategy
for putting the failed merger behind.
</P>
<P>
   Walter, who had negotiated the proposed merger with Deutsche
Bank, announced plans to quit the day after he called off the
merger talks in early April. Deutsche, which would have clearly
dominated the new institution, had insisted on gutting most of
Dresdner's investment banking subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Since the merger collapsed, Dresdner's stock has declined about
7 percent and closed Thursday at 45.31 euros, down two-tenths of a
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner has been fighting to halt a defection of investment
bankers who had been rattled by the near-shutdown of their
business.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say it must also reduce costs and find a way out of
its problems in retail banking. The problem is that unilaterally
shutting bank branches almost certainly means losing customers to
rivals with branches across the street.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the only institution under pressure. Deutsche Bank has
come in for scathing criticism for mishandling the negotiations and
for the way its top executives fought each other.
</P>
<P>
   And Commerzbank, Germany's fourth largest bank, has become a
target of almost daily takeover speculation. In the last month, a
Dutch investment group called Rebon NV has acquired a 17 percent
stake in Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind Rebon's investment is a former executive of
Dresdner Bank, Hans Georg Hoffmann, who has indicated that he wants
to facilitate some kind of merger between Commerzbank and another
institution.

   Visits with foreign leaders and discussion of foreign policy are
on the agendas for both presidential candidates next week. Al Gore
is to meet Monday with South African President Thabo Mbeki, who
will be on his first state visit to the United States. George W.
Bush also is expected in Washington on Monday for a speech to the
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee. He also plans to meet
Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said spokesman
Scott McClellan. Gore addresses the same organization on Tuesday.
Bush also is expected to meet with Mbeki later in the week, either
in Austin or Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE JUST THE THOUGHT OF HILLARY WILL KEEP HIM GOING
</P>
<P>
   As Rudy Giuliani edges toward fateful decisions on prostate
cancer treatment and his Senate candidacy, some of his key aides
and allies are predicting he'll stay in the race. The NYC mayor is
scheduled to appear on an hourlong MSNBC town hall tonight, and
Republican officials say it's unlikely he'd do so if he doesn't
plan to stay in the race against Hillary Clinton. Giuliani has
spent a lot of time closeted with senior advisers, including
campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum, deputy mayor Joseph Lhota and
chief of staff Anthony Carbonetti. ``My guess is he is going to
run,'' the New York Daily News quoted one member of the mayor's
inner circle as saying. ``I can't see Hillary Clinton winning this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   HMMM, NOW ABOUT THAT MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in the balance of Rudy Giuliani's decision on whether
to stay in the Senate race are the millions of dollars he has
raised. Nearly half of the $19 million has been donated by
out-of-state voters, many of whom answered solicitations because
they dislike his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Yet under federal law,
Giuliani may squirrel away every cent of the more than $9 million
he hasn't spent _ even if he drops out. That prospect irritates St.
Louis banker Michael Ross, for one. Ross contributed as much as
federal law permits to Giuliani's Senate race. Sure, he admires
Giuliani and wishes him well. But the $2,000 in checks he wrote to
the Friends of Giuliani account were for one purpose, he said:
keeping Clinton out of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   TOGETHER AT BIRTH, SEPARATED AT COLLEGE
</P>
<P>
   One of George W. Bush's twin daughters plans to continue the
family tradition by attending Yale University in New Haven, Conn.,
while the other will stay home to study at the University of Texas
at Austin. The fraternal twins, 18, graduate next week from Stephen
F. Austin High, a public school. Barbara Pierce Bush, named for her
paternal grandmother, is going to Ivy League Yale. Her father
received an undergraduate degree from Yale in 1968. His father and
grandfather also were Yalies. Bush's other daughter, Jenna Welch
Bush, named for her maternal grandmother, will attend UT, the
state's largest university with more than 49,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   UN-CONVENTIONAL NETWORK WISDOM
</P>
<P>
   This may be the year conventions virtually disappear from prime
time for the big networks. During primary season this year, the
broadcast networks essentially ceded extended political coverage to
CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC. Expect more of the same for the
conventions. While ABC, CBS and NBC haven't nailed down their plans
yet, the bad memories of 1996's disastrous ratings and scripted,
sanitized conventions are still fresh. Conventions ``are no longer
news events,'' said broadcast consultant Andrew Tyndall. ``They're
propaganda events.'' The biggest media story four years ago was Ted
Koppel and his ABC ``Nightline'' crew abandoning the Republican
event, saying nothing newsworthy was happening.
</P>
<P>
   VOTERS PERCEIVE LESSER INFLUENCE
</P>
<P>
   Americans have little sense of power over the presidential
nominating process, with only one-fifth of them saying that voters
in the primaries chose George W. Bush or Al Gore as the nominees,
the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows. Seventy-five percent
favored a single national primary to the present system, where they
feel early states have too much influence. Respondents agreed that
voters had less influence over either party's choice than did
financial contributors and party leaders. For Bush, 21 percent
credited the voters, 26 percent said party leaders and 44 percent
said financial donors. For Gore, 20 percent credited voters, 48
percent said party leaders and 24 percent said financial
contributors. The poll's margin of error was 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY AIDES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's presidential campaign, getting ready for the
general election battle, has been expanding its senior staff _
including the hiring of a new deputy to chief strategist Karl Rove.
Chris Hennick, most recently a lobbyist with former GOP chairman
Haley Barbour's firm and who has been a political operative for
both the Republican National Committee and the Republican Governors
Association, joined the campaign this week.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AND MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush met Microsoft founder Bill Gates several weeks
ago in Washington state, and when asked about the Justice
Department's antitrust action against the computer software giant,
signaled a sympathetic attitude. The candidate stated a preference
for ``innovation over litigation.'' Bush apparently also owns
significant share of Microsoft. The Times of London reported that
Bush's latest financial disclosure statement shows shares valued at
more than $100,000. Because the holding was purchased for a blind
trust, the Bush campaign said the Texas governor had been unaware
of the holding until he signed the disclosure forms a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ZONE OF PRIVACY ON ANNIVERSARY
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Al and Tipper Gore celebrate 30 years of a marriage
that has included the joys and strains of raising four children and
the emotional highs and lows of high-stakes political life. The
Gores will celebrate their anniversary at home in Washington,
according to aides. The couple had considered a getaway to Florida,
but that was scuttled after the vice president _ apparently without
consulting his wife _ agreed to allow a small pool of reporters to
accompany him on vacations.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT MAKES KEYES KEEP RUNNING?
</P>
<P>
   Since his surprisingly strong showing in the Iowa caucuses,
where he gained 14 percent of the vote, Alan Keyes has fallen off
the political radar screen and will not be elected president. So
why is he still running for president? His own campaign asked _ and
answered _ that question in a recent mailing to North Carolina
voters: There is a battle for the soul of the Republican Party, the
battle lines are forming, and those on the right side should cast
their votes for the conservative, anti-abortion rights activist.
But Michigan State University political science prof David Rohde
thinks Keyes runs simply because he wants to: ``He is in the public
eye more than he would be if he withdrew. He is getting his issues
in the public eye more. And, as long as he keeps on as an active
candidate, the media has some incentive, and some feel an
obligation, to cover him.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TAMING OF THE SHREWD
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party leaders in Colorado and Georgia have called on Pat
Buchanan, the leading contender for the Reform presidential
nomination, to resign from the party on the ground that he has been
spreading hate and intolerance and ignoring the party procedures.
Jim Mangia, secretary of the national Reform Party, predicted that
more states would move against Buchanan. Bay Buchanan, Buchanan's
sister and chief strategist, called the Colorado and Georgia moves
``much ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO PLUG A BIG LOOPHOLE
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators led by Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.)
and John McCain (R-Ariz.) introduced legislation to close a
loophole in federal tax and election law that allows nonprofit
groups to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on political
campaigns with virtually no disclosure. Under Section 527 of the
Internal Revenue Code, groups like the Sierra Club and Republicans
for Clean Air can to raise and spend millions of dollars on behalf
of candidates, run TV ads and conduct telephone campaigns so long
as they don't explicitly advocate the election or defeat of a
specific candidate. The bill would require that such groups
register with the Federal Election Commission, disclose their
existence to the Internal Revenue Service, and reveal large
contributors and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY'S GHOST HANGING AROUND
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic discontent continues to register in uncontested
primaries,'' the Wall Street Journal notes. Al Gore is winning
easily, but Bill Bradley won 27 percent of the vote in Nebraska, 19
percent in North Carolina and 18 percent in West Virginia. In
contrast, John McCain's percentages in those Republican primaries
were significantly lower. That ambivalence also is being seen in
the polls. The latest Los Angeles Times poll found Gore taking 79
percent of Democrats, while George W. Bush nails down 91 percent of
Republicans. The difference may largely explain why Bush has led in
all but a few of this year's polls.
</P>
<P>
   PUTTING HOLES IN SCHWEITZER CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   With an uphill battle against Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.),
Democrat Brian Schweitzer, has found another obstacle to overcome.
Schweitzer said that Voter Consumer Research, the same phone bank
company in Houston that made negative calls against John McCain in
South Carolina was making calls to Montana on behalf of Burns.
Schweitzer said Montana voters were asked if they were aware that
Schweitzer once worked in Libya, ``a known terrorist state.'' Yes,
he did once work in Libya, Schweitzer said, in 1980, as an importer
of U.S.-made farm equipment for farms being worked by Americans.
And if there was something wrong with that, he went on, ``whoever
is paying for this dirty trick push poll needs a civics lesson.''
The Burns campaign denied any knowledge or involvement.
</P>
<P>
   UNUSUAL COMBO OF OLD CHINA HANDS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush sought to reassure union workers that normalizing
trade relations with China will expand jobs and prosperity at home
and help spread freedom abroad. ``The stakes are high,'' Bush said.
``It will mean much lower trade barriers and enormous opportunities
for U.S. exports and more work and jobs for United States
workers.'' The issue puts Bush on the same side as the Clinton-Gore
administration in pressing for normalization of trade relations
with China, the world's most populous nation and a potential major
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   PARTIES DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING
</P>
<P>
   Candidates let their political parties do much of the dirty work
in TV advertising, according to a new study that documents the
pervasive use of unregulated and increasingly popular ``issue
ads.'' Just 20 percent of the ads paid for by congressional
candidates in 1998 attacked their opponents, compared with 60
percent of those by political parties, according to the study,
released today. And two-thirds of issue ads were paid for by
political parties, with interest groups airing the rest. The study
was conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York
University School of Law, an organization that advocates campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   COMING SOON: `THE AL GORE STORY'
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee is preparing to launch a
multimillion-dollar ad campaign designed to bolster Al Gore's
presidential campaign by introducing his biography to Americans.
The ad blitz, engineered by Gore's political team, could begin as
early as this month and end at the presidential convention this
summer, costing upwards of $10 million, according to Democratic
officials. The Associated Press said the ads were described by
several party officials as a discussion of Democratic issues that
give way to biographical material about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SECURITY APOCALYPSE?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore told 10,000 senior citizens at an AARP convention in
Orlando, Fla., that ``we could see the end of Social Security as we
know it'' under George W. Bush's plan to allow private investment
of government retirement funds. Bush, campaigning a continent away
in Washington state, accused Gore of being ``mired in the past''
while he, Bush, leads by proposing changes to ensure Social
Security's future.
</P>
<P>
   A BUSY GUY _ HE'S NOT RETIRED
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush declined invitations to appear at the AARP
convention in Orlando either in person or on video. And AARP head
Horace Deets noted that Bush was the only presidential candidate of
either party to fail to appear at AARP-sponsored candidate forums
in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan. ``I can't say
they are snubbing us. ... They just haven't accepted a number of
invitations, and it's kind of hard to understand why,'' Deets said.
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said scheduling problems prevented the
his boss from attending. Bush was campaigning in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SECURITY IS SOCIAL SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Claims by George W. Bush that 1.3 million federal workers have
an advantage in retirement income over private-sector workers is at
odds with what federal workers do _ and do not _ get when they
retire. Bush points to the federal retirement plan when he argues
that the Social Security program should include individual
investment accounts so that workers could invest in the stock
market and earn a higher rate of return. In fact, Hearst Newspapers
points out, most of the 2.4 million federal civilian workers pay
Social Security payroll taxes just like everyone else. They do,
however, also have a thrift savings plan _ similar to a 401(k)
retirement investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   SWIM THE DEEPEST RIVER, CLIMB _
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton broke two engagements to be by his wife's side
when she officially became the state Democratic Party's nominee for
Senate the other night. Clinton said that before they knew when
wife Hillary would speak, he had already committed to attending a
dinner for the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund and a campaign
event for the Senate Democratic Committee. He said he finally
canceled the MALDF event, telling the organization: ``I've been
with you folks a long time, and if you'll let me go hear my wife
give a speech, I'll do any event you want in America, anytime,
wherever in the future. And I told the Senate Democratic Campaign
Committee that the Senate campaign I was most interested in was
otherwise occupied tonight and I was going there.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE COMES OUT ON WOMEN'S ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   A week after feminist activists privately scolded Al Gore for
not getting his message out on domestic violence, Gore pressed
Congress to break a yearlong stalemate and reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act, which provides funds to shelters for battered
women. ``This is the time to intensify our efforts with the goal of
eliminating violence in the home in any form,'' Gore said in a
statement e-mailed without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   THE POSTMAN NEVER VOTES TWICE
</P>
<P>
   Oregon officials declared the nation's first test of an
all-mail-voting primary election an unqualified success, boosting
voter turnout to 50 percent, the state's highest level in a dozen
years despite a lackluster ballot. ``I think vote-by-mail is here
to stay,'' said Secretary of State Bill Bradbury. The turnout was
the highest for an Oregon primary election since 1988, when 55.1
percent of voters cast ballots. In the last primary election, two
years ago, 34.9 of registered voters participated. Vote by mail was
mainly responsible for the increase, said Bradbury.

A 250-MILE YARD SALE COMES TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Tenn., Ky.)   By DARRELL NORMAN   
 The Gadsden (Ala.) Times   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PAYNE, Ala. _ The second 250-mile yard sale along the U.S.
11 Antique Alley does not start until Friday, but Peggy and Terry
Bohannon have been at it all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been putting out some things every day, so we'll be
ready,'' Peggy Bohannon said. Already the Bohannons and a few
friends had the parking lot in front of their store pretty well
covered with stuff. Four or five more friends were expected to set
up before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry has had a lot of people calling, wanting to set up here,
but we decided to have just the ones we had last year,'' Peggy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale route covers U.S. 11 from Birmingham, Ala., to
Knoxville, Tenn. It was organized by tourism officials wanting to
duplicate the success of the 450-mile yard sale that extends from
Gadsden to northern Kentucky and draws tens of thousands to Lookout
Mountain Parkway every August. The first U.S. 11 sale last spring
drew a heavy turnout and more of the same is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   The sale runs Friday through Sunday, but as they do for the
August sale, both vendors and shoppers got an early start.
</P>
<P>
   The Bohannons do not have far to cart their wares for the sale.
They run an antiques store in a red log cabin, separated by just a
parking lot from U.S. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The store is open infrequently, but this weekend the store and
every foot of space will be filled and ready for business. The
store is now packed with furniture, carpenter's tools, car tags,
moonshine jugs, a large parlor stove and hundreds of other things.
</P>
<P>
   A mile or two south of the Log Cabin, the grass had been freshly
mowed in a pasture on the east side of U.S. 11, and signs
advertised spaces for rent for the yard sale. Similar scenes can be
seen up and down U.S. 11 as vendors prepare for the weekend.

pig for a government experiment involving invisibility.
 &HT;    But then all hell breaks loose. The experiment goes kablooey,
and said two-bit thief goes both invisible and nuts.
 &HT;    Welcome to ``The Invisible Man,'' the Sci-Fi Channel's latest
original series, a newfangled take on the classic H.G. Wells saga.
And meet Vincent Ventresca, who stars as the title character,
Darien Fawkes.
 &HT;    ``You don't really get the world of `The Invisible Man' until
the last five minutes of the pilot,'' Ventresca says, looking ahead
to the show's two-hour kickoff on June 9. ``What you've got is a
guy with a gland in his brain that makes him invisible, and now
what's he going to do with that power? Will he do good? Will he do
evil?
 &HT;    ``Then he's got the complexity that, if he stays invisible for
too long or if he doesn't get a shot, he'll go mad and release all
of his darkest inhibitions, thus releasing a psychopath into
society.
 &HT;    ``He then also has to deal with The Agency, this secret
government agency that's run under the auspices of the Department
of Fish and Game,'' Ventresca adds. ``They're going to give me the
counteragent as long as I do what they want me to do on a weekly
basis.''
 &HT;    What the agency wants Fawkes to do week in and week out, of
course, is to disappear for a while, infiltrate some cadre of
baddies and eliminate great threats against our great nation. By
his side _ and occasionally in his way _ stands Hobbes, Fawkes'
boss/partner, played by Paul Ben-Victor from ``The X-Files''
episode ``Tooms.''
 &HT;    ``The core of the show, I think, is the `48 Hours' relationship
between Fawkes and Hobbes,'' Ventresca says by telephone from his
Los Angeles home. ``And by `48 Hours,' I mean the movie with Eddie
Murphy and Nick Nolte.
 &HT;    ``Separately, we're pretty good at what we do,'' he says, ``but
together we make a really, really super team. I like that Hobbes is
unimpressed with my invisibility. He's more motivated on a fiscal
level, and hopefully we'll find out why he's hooked up with this
agency.''
 &HT;    The Indianapolis-born Ventresca, whose credits include the 1997
film ``Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,'' a recurring role
as ``Fun Bobby'' on ``Friends,'' a spot as a regular on the
short-lived sci-fi series ``Prey'' and a turn opposite ``Phantom
Menace'' star Jake Lloyd and ``Frequency's'' Jim Caviezel in the
upcoming independent feature ``Madison,'' hopes that ``The
Invisible Man'' is ... subversive.
 &HT;    ```Subversive' is one of those words you sort of know what it
means, but it's not until you stop and look it up that you really
know,'' the actor says. ```Subversive,' in the dictionary I read,
means to literally turn upside down.
 &HT;    ``Our pilot surprised me a couple of times,'' he says. ``You
think it's going to be this, and then something turns upside down.
It's not what you thought it would be.
 &HT;    ``That was my reaction, and I'm curious to see if other people
have that reaction.''
 &HT;    The Sci-Fi Channel has committed to the pilot and 12 subsequent
episodes, meaning that Ventresca will be disappearing for the
foreseeable future. And that's fine by him, even if he's admittedly
not the biggest genre fan on the planet.
 &HT;    ``It's not that much of a stretch,'' he says. ``Scientists
really are trying to create an invisible suit. That's a great thing
about the show _ the invisibility aspect is spelled out just enough
that, if you want to go on the ride, you can. And it doesn't insult
the audience.
 &HT;    ``You have to take some leaps, but even non-sci-fi shows ask you
to take some leaps.''

&HT;     `LION' OF GOLF SET THE STAGE FOR TODAY'S TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Pa.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAUL DOMINGUEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Decades before a Tiger ruled the PGA Tour, a lion
named Arnold was the king of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the possibilities if Arnold Palmer were in his prime
now.
</P>
<P>
   What could a man with Palmer's All-American looks, charisma and
professionalism earn in today's market where athletes pitch
everything from mutual funds to Micatin?
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have won enough to buy the PGA Tour just on his
attitude alone,'' said Buddy Cook, Southwestern Bell Dominion
tournament director. ``He and Tiger Woods are similar in their
drive to excel. That's what makes them both successful.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods is any indication, Palmer could earn twice as much as
he does now as golf's elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Woods earned $47 million last year while winning eight events
and pitching products such as Nike and American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, 70, has not won a tournament since 1988 but he still
earned $19 million last year mainly through his golf-related
businesses and from pitching products such as Cooper Tire and
Pennzoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnie, if he was in his prime (today), would probably be one
of the highest-paid (athletes),'' said Jim Reese, a sports
administration and facilities management assistant professor at
Ohio University. ``He is definitely going after a different target
market, but he is still very marketable.''
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements are just a portion of the money Palmer could have
earned.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has accumulated $13.9 million while winning 18 events
since joining the PGA Tour in July 1996. In comparison, Palmer won
60 titles and yet his total earnings on the PGA Tour amount to $1.8
million for a career that spans more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just under $2 million? Woods surpassed that in his first five
PGA Tour events this year.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about the possibilities, Palmer offered a warm,
friendly smile that has become as familiar as his unfinished swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say I wouldn't think about that,'' Palmer said.
``It's hard to think about what might have been. If I had to do it
all over again, I would accept it if it turned out the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   While the thought of playing in his prime against today's top
golfers intrigues the competitive spirit in Palmer, he realizes he
would miss out on so much more.
</P>
<P>
   No, the PGA Tour is fine without him and his life is too
fulfilled to ever daydream about what could be.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he would miss out on all the great memories he has
accumulated over the years. He would miss out on all the great
experiences he enjoyed while competing in 724 PGA Tour events,
including his many battles with Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he enjoyed a wonderful life with his wife, Winnie,
who died Nov. 20, 1999, after a lengthy battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour would not be what it is today without Palmer laying
the foundation in the '50s, '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The legend from Latrobe, Pa., is a key reason today's players
can earn millions annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the epitome of what golf is like,'' Cook said. ``He, and
Byron Nelson is the other person that quickly comes to mind. They
sure made it easier for the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer put golf in the national consciousness. He came along at
a time when television coverage of golf was still in its infancy,
and he became the game's first superstar.
</P>
<P>
   He did so with stirring victories and an ability to make his
fans feel like they were a part of each victory or loss. ``Arnie's
Army,'' as his fans were dubbed, were thousands strong, and yet
Palmer seemed to know each individual when he smiled or looked at
someone directly in the eye from inside the gallery ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just makes you feel that you're the one that's important,''
Cook said. ``I don't know how he does it, but he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got that charisma. He's like a magnet. His smile is so
genuine. He can look over at the ropes and smile like he's known
you for years, like you're his new best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was also one of the first athletes to build a successful
career as a product pitchman. He began pitching Pennzoil in 1985
and helped make the product a household name, which led other
companies to recruit athletes in hopes of similar success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people that are the most successful in
endorsements as a pitchman or pitchwoman are the ones that avoid
controversy, and Arnie has been able to do that most of his
career,'' Reese said. ``He's been able to maintain a high level of
integrity in his life. There has never been an Arnie Palmer
incident. He has never pulled a Bobby Knight.''

GIVE THEM A PLACE TO DREAM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids' bedrooms are for sleeping, playing, reading, dressing,
dancing, hiding and dreaming _ both the nighttime kind and the
wide-awake kind.
</P>
<P>
   So why do so many parents do little more than set up a
metal-frame bed, toss on some boring sheets, add a hand-me-down
dresser and a mismatched desk and cover up the wall dings with
tacky posters? And then they always close the door when company
comes over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen how my kids treat their rooms?'' they would
probably say. ``They can't handle nice furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Geoffrey Halpern, owner of Ethan Allen Valley Manor in
Northridge, says most kids actually rise to the occasion and start
taking better care of their rooms when they have appealing
furniture. ``Children take pride in their things, especially 8-, 9-
and 10-year-olds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Allen is one of several furniture and home decor companies
that have launched kid-specific lines in the last year or so.
Others include Pottery Barn, Lexington Home Brands and The Company
Store. They didn't need the 2000 Census to recognize the population
boom in little kids, pre-teens (ages 8-12) and teen-agers
coinciding nicely with a very robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Furniture, which launched its Young America line last
month at the International Home Furnishings Market, says the youth
furniture business has grown 10 to 20 percent a year over the last
five years to reach $2.7 billion in annual retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a good chunk of that is nursery stuff. For newborns,
moms and dads yield to their oooh-isn't-that-cute mushy sides and
spend liberally for the coordinated furniture, wallpapers, window
treatments and bedding that will be used only two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it make more sense to invest in furnishings that will
last children longer?
</P>
<P>
   If kid-inflicted damage is a concern, Halpern steers his
customers away from the high-polished Chippendale and Queen Anne
reproductions into the Cottage and Country French lines, which can
be ordered with Tuff-A-Nuff laminate top surfaces that resist
rings, crayons and scratches left by toy cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could go for the weathered finishes on the handmade
furniture available from Joseph Wahl Arts in Woodland Hills, which
can look even better after it has been used.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wahl and Halpern agree it is wise to ask kids' opinions
about furniture and other decor elements, and to think beyond the
immediate future. When Wahl is helping a customer choose a
hand-painted motif, for example, he advises against cowboys and
Indians, which a boy will outgrow, and encourages his customers to
think sports or transportation instead.
</P>
<P>
   Wahl, who relies mainly on word of mouth and counts Kim
Basinger, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Emilio Estevez among his clients,
mines the nostalgia vein in his furniture, paint finishes and
antique accessories. Pokemon posters and Barbie dollhouses would
look out of place in Wahl's rooms, but his customers find it
irresistible. ``I'm not for everybody, but people who get it, buy
it,'' he said. ``I think kids respond to it, too, more than we give
them credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   In getting his shoppers to look ahead to the day they pack a son
or daughter off to college, Halpern shows off E.A. Kids' Organizer
_ desk, dresser, cabinet and bookshelf components that can be mixed
and matched in varying configurations according to need and floor
space. The desks include computer spaces and keyboard trays with
plenty of work surface for hand-written assignments, yet without
the cold office furniture look.
</P>
<P>
   E.A. Kids also offers entertainment centers in smaller cabinet
work than the family-room models.
</P>
<P>
   In newer homes, children's rooms have shrunk as master suites
and sitting areas have expanded. So making furniture fit might be
more difficult than making it affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery Barn designers found the secret to creating more floor
space is giving kids ways to get their junk off the floor. They've
made canvas storage pockets on a space-dividing screen as well as
bedside and footboard arrangements. The Pottery Barn Kids line,
currently available only through catalog and online shopping, also
offers square storage baskets and some nice interlocking wooden
cubes for a do-it-yourself shelf system.
</P>
<P>
   For older kids _ those who no longer tumble out of bed _ IKEA
suggests going up. Way up. Its Stora full-size platform bed in
lacquered knotty pine hovers about 5 1/2 feet above the floor to
allow a teen or young adult easy access to a very functional desk
and bookshelf space beneath. The trade-off, of course, is less
headroom in bed. Although there isn't a matching dresser, IKEA's
Bialitt unfinished pine dressers (add the lacquer yourself) go well
with it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want your children to read more, try giving them a cozy
place to do it. Whether it's E.A. Kids' Thinking Chair or Pottery
Barn's Basic Chair Junior, the trend is toward comfortable
upholstered seating on a smaller scale. These are not
toddler-sized, outgrown by age 6. Most are broad enough to fit
narrow adult hips, yet low enough to the floor to welcome small
ones. And when they show wear and tear, they can be re-covered for
another child.
</P>
<P>
   If the budget simply won't allow for a total redo, adding
accessories can make a difference. Joseph Wahl Arts usually stocks
4- to 5-foot U-Control model planes from the '50s for $150-$400.
Pottery Barn Kids and The Company Store both have great bedding
aimed at pre-teens and teens, and IKEA has a huge selection of
affordable lamps and lighting fixtures, storage systems and rugs.
</P>
<P>
   When it's all done, kids probably will enjoy spending more time
in their rooms and might even clean them up without being asked.
And moms just might leave those doors open. &QL;

STARS! CLIFFHANGERS! FINALES! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A schedule of season finales appears at end of story. Time
and channel are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(Editors: Nichelle in 3rd graf is cq.) By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month Al Gore sat on a couch in the study of the vice
president's official residence and said with great urgency: ``Get
in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe
is destroyed.'' He had already made his position on the destruction
of the universe clear: ``As an environmentalist, I'm against
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore gives a droll reading while playing himself on the animated
comedy ``Futurama,'' set in the year 3000. In Sunday's
time-traveling season finale, the hero, a pizza delivery guy named
Fry, has stumbled back to his original home in 1999, distorting
history, creating a rip in the space-time continuum and making a
final big bang imminent. Gore is trying to get Fry to re-enter the
cryogenic tube that took him to the future and so save the world
(not a bad thing to have on your resume if you want to be
president).
</P>
<P>
   Matt Groening, the creator of ``Futurama'' and the mastermind
behind ``The Simpsons,'' recalled how the guest shot came about. He
had read that Gore was a fan of both shows and called the vice
president's staff to ask if he would be willing to play a nerd. In
Sunday's episode, Gore arrives with a band he calls his Vice
Presidential Action Rangers (also doing there own guest voices),
including Uhura from ``Star Trek'' (Nichelle Nichols) and Stephen
Hawking. ``Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?'' Fry
asks. ``Sure, why not,'' says Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows whether Gore's guest shot will endear him to voters
besotted with pop culture but his presence has inspired one of the
wittiest episodes that this uneven year-old series has done. The
Gore portion of the episode hints that a more topical spin and
sharper, irreverent writing ( Hawking uses his wheelchair as a
lethal weapon) could make this series as funny as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' joins a flood of season finales this weekend, with
subjects ranging from a day at the beach to sexual slavery.
Together, they reveal a great deal about the possibilities and
limitations of network television. By the time this largely
lackluster season ends on Wednesday, we'll have seen shows that
define the border of network daring (``Sopranos'' envy only goes so
far), as well as finales that hint at the struggles of aging dramas
and the potential of still growing comedies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night's finale of ``Law and Order: Special Victims
Unit,'' the main plot involves a wealthy businessman (Andrew
McCarthy), who keeps his wife and their young housekeeper in mental
and physical slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The more gripping subplot is smartly self-referential: The
detectives in the show's sex-crimes unit undergo psychological
testing to see how they are enduring relentless encounters with
rapists and pornographers. Eliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) is a
family man; his partner, Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), is a
result of her mother's rape. The psychologist wonders if they or
their colleagues are ready to snap (the answer creates a
cliffhanger).
</P>
<P>
   This series raises a similar issue with viewers: How dark can a
weekly series be?
</P>
<P>
   Though it has been a ratings success since moving to Friday, the
show's premise might be called ``another week, another pedophile.''
When the series is good it is extraordinary. On last week's episode
(more compelling than Friday night's), a television newswoman
reported that she was the recent victim of an unknown rapist; at
the end, she was killed by a bomb placed in a box of flowers at her
door. As taut and gripping as that episode was, the bleakness built
into the series makes it hard to think about tuning in every week.
</P>
<P>
   VILLAINS AND VICTIMS
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference between the darkness of ``Special Victims
Unit'' (a conventional show about unmistakable heros and villains)
and the riskiness of the season's two new standouts, ``The West
Wing'' and ``Judging Amy,'' terrific shows that have consistently
become better. Their daring comes from the complex humanity of the
characters and the ambiguity attached to the thorny political and
social issues they face.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whether that complexity comes from the White House staff or
the family court rulings of Judge Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman), both
series tie things up with fluffy resolutions. President Barlett
(Martin Sheen) on ``The West Wing'' marches in with his rousing ``
Smith Goes to Washington'' ending; and though the heroine on
``Judging Amy'' faces thorny decisions, her mother, Maxine (Tyne
Daly), always knows best.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that while these tacked-on endings are jarring,
they may also be the sops that make the shows palatable to the
broadest possible audience. In the compromised landscape of network
television, conventional cliffhangers and feel-good endings may buy
``Amy'' and ``West Wing'' the freedom to be tough-minded the rest
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final minutes of each episode, these two shows are
fiercely intelligent. ``The West Wing'' (which ended its season on
Wednesday) has even created drama out of the hour-by-hour details
of poll results. It is especially good at the small touches that
define fraught working relationships. When C.J. (Allison Janey),
the press secretary, complained to Leo (John Spencer), the chief of
staff, that he had not let the president know about her
contribution to a discussion, he says, ``Don't do this, C.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's delivery subtly captures not only the condescension
and sexism behind the remark, but also the extent to which those
attitudes are unconscious, knee-jerk reactions in this boys' club.
Though President Barlett remains a know-it-all, the character has
cultivated a dry wit. The finale, in which an assassination attempt
left viewers wondering who, if anyone, had been harmed, was the
kind of explosive action the series rarely indulges in. Yet it
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Next Tuesday's finale of ``Judging Amy'' explodes atypically
too, with the threat of violent action. But the episode also plays
to the series' great, week-after-week strengths. An innocent,
overheard conversation between Amy and Bruce, her court services
officer, leads to charges of improper behavior against them. ``A
white female judge and a black male CSO,'' Bruce says. ``I'm
surprised we lasted this long.''
</P>
<P>
   What could have been lurid soap opera is handled with savvy
realism here. The final episode leaves more than their professional
fate hanging: Maxine has been having a romance with a wealthy
businessman, whose son crudely interferes, and one of Amy's rulings
may have deadly repercussions.

&HT;     TRAINER UNFAZED BY POST POSITION FOR PREAKNESS FAVORITE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Count trainer Neil Drysdale among those who will
tell you that post positions mean nothing in an eight-horse field
at the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale was smooth and calm Wednesday afternoon as he used the
sixth selection to pick post 7 for Fusaichi Pegasus, the
overwhelming favorite, in the draw for the 125th running of the
Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it means much, maybe nothing at all,'' Drysdale
said from the ESPN Sports Zone, where the field was drawn for
Saturday's race. ``You've got a quarter of a mile to the first
turn, so what difference does it make where you start?''
</P>
<P>
   Seven 3-year-olds will challenge Fusaichi Pegasus, the Kentucky
Derby champion who was made the 3-5 morning-line favorite for the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the field may be more significant than the choice of
post positions. The field is the smallest for the Preakness since
Hansel beat seven others in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the seven challengers for the Preakness, contested
at 1 3/16 miles, raced against Fusaichi Pegasus in the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Joe Orseno's Red Bullet, one of the newcomers, will
start from post 4. Red Bullet, owned by Frank Stronach, was made
the second betting choice at 9-2 by longtime oddsmaker Clem Florio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing really well here, and the extra time off after the
Wood has done him a world of good,'' said Orseno, who is starting
his first Preakness horse. ``We have to take a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet has won three of his four career starts, the only
loss by 4 1/4 lengths to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial. The
son of Unbridled, runner-up in the 1990 Preakness, defeated Derby
place finisher Aptitude in the Gotham.
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In, the Rebel Stakes winner and Arkansas Derby runner-up,
also makes his Triple Crown debut in the Preakness. He is trained
by Steve Asmussen and will be ridden by Cash Asmussen, the first

   ``He's set up to fire his best shot,'' said John Cilia,
representing the owners, Ackerley Brothers. ``We just don't know if
his best shot is good enough.''

   Snuck In was shipped to Churchill Downs for the Derby, but Steve
Asmussen said he wasn't pleased with his final work and kept the
son of Montbrook out of the Run for the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In was 4-for-7 as a 2-year-old and in the money in every
start. He still has never been off the board in nine career starts,
five of them victories.
</P>
<P>
   The other Preakness newcomer is Hugh Hefner, a lightly raced son
of Bertrando who has run against California-breds in four of his
six career starts. His best finish in open company was a fourth
behind Dixie Union, Exchange Rate and Captain Steve in the Grade
III Best Pal as a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Owner-breeder-trainer Edward Nahem, a friend of the colt's
namesake, selected the rail post with the fourth selection in the
draw, which was televised nationally by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be on the lead,'' said Nahem, who is making his
first start in this race. ``I think we got to the bottom of him in
the Snow Chief (a second-place finish to Grey Memo), and that set
him up for the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert, who won the first two legs of the Triple
Crown in 1997 and 1998 with Silver Charm and Real Quiet, is trying
to salvage a leg of this one after being shut out in last year's
classics for the first time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take one more shot at it,'' Baffert said of
Captain Steve. ``We're here because our horse came back great from
the Derby. He ran so well for us. He just got run into a ditch by
Wheelaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve actually was in the lead in the stretch before
Wheelaway and jockey Rich Migliore came over and rammed them during
the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who has won this race five times, said
he expects High Yield to run much better than his 15th-place finish
in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus will try to become the first Preakness favorite
to win this leg since Timber Country in 1995.

NEW YORK: deadly repercussions.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAYING SO LONG
</P>
<P>
   Other daring series were simply in the wrong place this season.
The medical drama ``Wonderland'' was canceled by ABC after two
episodes, leaving a hard core of followers wondering where it went.
The ratings were atrocious for a network show, but some viewers
loved it. (Every television reporter, editor and critic has heard
from friends and viewers who were passionate about ``Wonderland,''
which rarely happens when a show is pulled.) ``Wonderland'' might
have done fine on cable, where a smaller, devoted audience is
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the canceled cop series ``The Beat'' might have done
better on a real network rather than on UPN, the wrestling netlet.
The show wasn't breaking ground (and as it went along relied less
on its gimmick of switching back and forth between film and video).
Yet it worked as a lively version of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Other new shows turned out to be less daring than they promised.
``Once and Again,'' though renewed for next season, has already
petered out dramatically. Lily and Rick, (Sela Ward and Billy
Campbell), the divorced parents who find each other, have become
tiresome and annoying.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary characters are much more absorbing and the show
picks up conspicuously when they become the focus: the children are
believably difficult and confused; so are Lily's sister, who fell
for a married man, and Rick's ex-wife, who fell for a younger man.
(Maybe Rick and Lily should just run off-screen together, leaving
the show in better shape.)
</P>
<P>
   It took ``Once and Again'' just a few months to age badly.
Better series take years before those signs show, and ``The
Practice'' is approaching that point. The season's best episodes
came in a recent story line in which Ellenor (Camryn Manheim) tried
to save a man from death row. The least compelling elements
involved the wedding of Bobby and Lindsay (Dylan McDermott and
Kelli Williams). Sunday's exceptional finale displays the series'
continued power, in an emotionally strong story about a woman
(Marlee Matlin) on trial for shooting the man who raped and killed
her 7-year-old daughter. Its weariness is apparent in the wedding
plot, which is wrapped up with a surprise that seems forced.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for shows like ``The Practice'' become evident in a
recent episode in which Eugene (Steve Harris) wonders yet again why
he defends guilty lowlifes. How many times can the lawyers on ``The
Practice'' ask that question? How many trials can the doctors on
``ER'' (which ended its season Friday night) endure? Do we believe
that John Carter (Noah Wyle) became a drug addict because he was
stabbed by a patient? Or is he just another victim of the writers'
desperation?
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' finale on Sunday (not available for preview)
will not mark the end of the series or of David Duchovny's
appearances, though both were possibilities. Duchovny will return
for half of next season. In a turn both brilliant and obvious,
aliens will abduct his character on Sunday's finale and he will be
lost in space at the beginning of next season.
</P>
<P>
   But like ``E.R.'' and ``The Practice,'' ``The X-Files'' has
outlived its best days; now if these shows become a subject of
conversation, it's only for viewers to say they have gone downhill.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG-TERM POSSIBILITIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While many dramas have aged badly, a block of finales on Sunday
display the rich long-term possibilities of well-written,
irreverent comedies. ``The Simpsons'' may be a decade old, but it
is still consistently among the best-written shows on television,
its wit apparent in such tiny details as the phrases Bart writes as
punishment on the blackboard in each week's opening credits. ``I
will not make art out of dung,'' he wrote one week.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's finale is a parody of VH-1's ``Behind the Music,''
which takes a backstage view of the Simpsons' dysfunctional route
to sitcom stardom in ``Behind the Laughter.'' In this version of
history, presented with the cliched, overwrought narration of the
VH-1 series, when ``The Simpsons'' series faltered, ``Fox put the
show on hiatus and replaced it with hidden-camera footage from the
dressing room at Ann Taylor in a reality special called `Keepin' It
Real.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill'' has improved its sly, tongue-in-cheek humor
about a propane salesman in Texas and his family, making the Hill
family laughable without being unlikable. Friday night's finale
takes them to a country music festival loaded with guest voices,
including Randy Travis'. But last week's episode was funnier, with
Sydney Pollack as a podiatrist who puts Peggy Hill's size 16 feet
on an Internet site for foot fetishists.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEN CAME MAUDE
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to be irreverent with cartoons than live actors, but
the season's best new comedy, ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' has
flourished by creating a perfect balance of realism and comic
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The series quickly moved beyond the idea that Malcolm, the
middle child (played with endearing mischievousness by Frankie
Muniz), is a genius. The appeal of the show is that this family is
typical in its shouting, squabbling and mean tricks. It even gets
away with a mother (Jane Kaczmarek) who dishes out lovingly vicious
punishments. On Sunday's episode, while the rest of the family goes
to the beach, the youngest child, Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), is
left behind with the baby sitter (Beatrice Arthur) who ends up
doing a stellar flamenco with him.
</P>
<P>
   Not every finale says something about the broad television
landscape, of course. The hourlong season finale of ``Spin City''
on Wednesday, finds a deft way to write the indispensable Michael
J. Fox out of the series. The episode could have been mawkish,
because Fox chose to leave after announcing that he has Parkinson's
disease. But the series has always been written with a touch of
sophistication that raised it above most sitcoms. Though the final
episode has moments of undeniable emotion, it relies on hard-nosed
political reality to send Fox's character, the deputy mayor, out of
his job and out of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Though Charlie Sheen will join the cast next year, playing a new
character, Fox's departure is sure to transform ``Spin City'' into
something different. He managed to blend an upscale aura and
laserlike comic timing with a down-to-earth appeal; mixing the
exceptional and the ordinary, risk with insurance, is apparently
what it takes to make a network success.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the schedule for the season finales mentioned in the
critic's notebook article:  &QL;

<P>
   FRIDAY NIGHT: ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,'' at 10 ET
on NBC.

ANDREW HILL: ``DUSK'' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pianist Andrew Hill has long been embraced by the jazz
underground, whose language of appreciation too often rests on
notions of musicians' being underserved, underrated or not having
the appropriate context for their genius to shine. ``Dusk,'' Hill's
first album in 10 years, should end his marginal status: It
connects him with some of the better young jazz musicians working
today and takes the full measure of Hill as a composer better than
one would have thought possible. It makes him important again.
</P>
<P>
   What's nice about his current rehabilitation, which was helped
by players like the trumpeter Ron Horton and saxophonist Marty
Ehrlich, is that it wasn't brought about from the outside, by a
record company. Hill is imposing enough to attract disciples all by
himself, and that's what has happened in the last few years. (He
has been especially embraced by members of the Jazz Composers
Collective.) His pieces tend to strike the ear as discontinuous but
generally gain cohesion on further listening. His favorite pace,
playing all alone or in front of a steady rhythm section, is
wobbly; his legato sounds hesitant; his harmonies are influenced by
Thelonious Monk's tone-clashes; he likes to write in odd meters;
and his keyboard touch is self-consciously raw and unpolished.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes him unusual, but ``Dusk'' is better than just
unusual. Part of it has to do with the exactness of the horn
arrangements: The music is full of long, contrapuntal harmonized
lines that move around from major to minor, keeping the mood in
flux, and for the most part solos are used only as short segues to
the next chunk of writing. And part of it, of course, has to do
with a good rhythm section.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has recorded his share of opaque, incomprehensible music,
but ``Dusk,'' on the Palmetto label, brings him back into a clarity
that's near the territory of his greatest album, ``Point of
Departure'' in 1964.

 &HT;    SENATORS LAUNCH 'E-GOVERNMENT' PROJECT
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senators launched a bipartisan effort Thursday
to give citizens more access to the federal government through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas the lawmakers said they would consider include naming a
government-wide ``information czar'' and expanding online ``G-Bay''
auctions to dispose of surplus federal property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we are faced with is not whether an electronic
society is emerging, and not whether e-government will become a
reality, but rather how it will occur and what form it will take,''
said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the ranking minority member on
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was joined by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the panel's
chairman, in urging people to make use of a new Web site to help
legislators better cope with the digital future.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the broad long-term goal was ``to allow everybody
to become openly and interactively involved in the process of
writing legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both senators made it clear that neither had specifically
endorsed any of the 40 ``new ideas'' posted for discussion on their
new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But in answering a reporter's question, Lieberman said the
creation of a federal CIO, or chief information officer, who could
offer the kind of centralized leadership over online issues widely
adopted by many large corporations, was ``worthy of
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, on the other hand, voiced skepticism on the need for a
federal CIO. And a spokesman for the White House Office of
Management and Budget said that the agency's deputy director for
management ``already effectively serves as the federal CIO.''
</P>
<P>
   Both senators voiced enthusiasm over the prospect of adopting
more of the online lessons learned by the private sector to
strengthen federal services, cut operating costs, broaden citizen
involvement and, as their blurb on the Web site puts it, ``re-think
government processes.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also raised the prospect of ``one-stop shopping''
through the Internet for those seeking multiple government permits.
They also cited the need to enhance online distribution of surplus
goods through online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the General Services Administration's Federal Supply
Service, which makes purchases for most federal agencies, signed a
partnership with American Management Systems Inc. to form an online
auction site for surplus items. The cyberspace facility would
broaden the public auctions the GSA already holds, which raised
more than $260 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   At its new online site _ to be based on an Internet auction
system developed created by Ariba _ the GSA expects to auction off
up to $ 10 billion in government surplus items. It expects the site
to be up and running within six months.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new idea,'' as envisioned by the senators, would build on
this program to facilitate the distribution, free of charge, of
federal surplus goods to state agencies state, local governments
and qualified non-profit groups. Under the plan being reviewed at
their Web site, they could all ``be allowed to access the Internet
site themselves, to review what property is available.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With glowing reviews and some help from a Hollywood
legend, the Encores! concert series' production of ``Wonderful
Town,'' which had a brief run at City Center two weeks ago, may be
headed for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were under way this week between City Center officials and
several groups of producers, including Anita Waxman, Elizabeth P.
Williams and Fran and Barry Weissler, to move the musical to a
Broadway house in late fall. Rehearsals would probably begin soon
after the production's director, Kathleen Marshall, completes her
work as choreographer on ``Seussical,'' a new musical due in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great for us and great for the company,''
said Judith Daykin, the president of City Center. ``But it's very
early in the talking stages.''
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that ``Wonderful Town'' would be a joint effort
of City Center and outside producers. Several people privy to
negotiations said that one of the quiet instigators and financial
backers of a Broadway run was Paul Newman, whose wife, Joanne
Woodward, is on the City Center and Encores! boards. Calls to
Newman's agent, Sam Cohn, were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful Town,'' with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics
by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, follows two sisters from Ohio
loose in the big city. The show, with Rosalind Russell as the
wisecracking Ruth and Edie Adams as her younger, dreamier sister,
Eileen, opened at the Winter Garden in February 1953 and ran for
559 performances.
</P>
<P>
   In the Encores! incarnation Donna Murphy played Ruth and Laura
Benanti played Eileen. Reviewing the show in The New York Times,
Ben Brantley called the production a ``goose-bump-making
revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Daykin said the Broadway version would ideally be staged in the
same stripped-down concert style as the City Center production,
with minimal sets, lighting and costumes. One area of concern for a
commercial run, however, is the size of the production's cast (32
actors) and its orchestra (30 musicians). Both those figures would
mean a large weekly overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a move to Broadway has a precedent in ``Chicago,'' the
hit revival that began as an Encores! concert in 1996. That show,
produced on Broadway by the Weisslers, turned into a giant
international hit, grossing more than $100 million in New York
alone and spawning nine other companies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   An Orphan No More
</P>
<P>
   Another musical long anticipated in New York has finally found a
home. On Nov. 7 ``Jane Eyre,'' John Caird's adaptation of the epic
Charlotte Bronte novel of a governess and heartache, is to begin
previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. An opening is planned for
Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The well-traveled musical, with a score by Paul Gordon, was
conceived in the early 1990s. It had a 1994 workshop at the
Manhattan Theater Club and a production in Wichita, Kan., a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996 it opened in Toronto in what was billed as a
pre-Broadway tryout. But a combination of mixed reviews and lack of
available theater delayed the move south.
</P>
<P>
   Then last summer the show re-emerged, selling out a two-month
run at the La Jolla Playhouse near San Diego, breaking box-office
records and receiving its best reviews to date. Still, no theater
was available.
</P>
<P>
   Now the show finally is expected to arrive, with Marla Schaffel
playing Jane and Mary Stout the comic Fairfax, as they have since
its early days. James Barbour is Rochester, Jane's love interest.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Niemtzow, who leads a four-member producing team, said
the long wait had been worthwhile. ``Given the situation where
everybody is so hungry for theaters,'' she said, ``we're just
thrilled to be getting our chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clipping `Wings'
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting in the Wings,'' Noel Coward's 1960 play, is giving up
the ghost. The production, which its producers say recouped its
investment, will close on May 28.
</P>
<P>
   The closing comes as a small surprise because one of its stars,
Lauren Bacall, had recently announced a contract extension, while
its other star, Rosemary Harris, has just been nominated for a Tony
Award.
</P>
<P>
   But Leonard Soloway, a producer of the play, said that sales for
June ``looked disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking Charge
</P>
<P>
   Considering that ``Lydie Breeze,'' at New York Theater Workshop,
is about a group of friends involved in the establishment of a
utopian community, it seems fitting that the production itself
resulted from a ``let's put on a show'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   The main cheerleader for the production was Elizabeth Marvel,
who plays the title character, the conflicted idealist at the
two-part cycle's heart. In January she arranged a casual reading of
the John Guare script by calling a group of friends. ``I said,
`We're not going to rehearse it, just read,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That reading was so successful that when another spring
production at the workshop was delayed, Marvel and her actors
jumped in. She invited Adam Guettel, a friend, to compose some
songs and asked her boyfriend, Bill Camp, to play a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   The production has received favorable reviews since opening on
Monday, the same day Marvel won an Obie Award for her work in ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' an earlier production at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear about the disempowered actor, their fate in
other people's hands,'' Marvel said. ``It's just really wonderful
to experience it the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Return Engagement
</P>
<P>
   Blythe Danner will celebrate her 20th year acting at the
Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts this summer,
appearing opposite Stephen Collins in ``Tonight at 8:30,'' a
collection of six one-acts by Noel Coward. Danner and Collins are
to perform in three of the plays, while Charlotte D'Ambroise and
Bill Irwin will appear in the other trio.
</P>
<P>
   Other casting for the summer season includes Sara Gilbert (late
of the television show ``Roseanne'') in ``Hot L Baltimore,'' Marian
Seldes in ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' and Eric Stoltz in ``Light Up
the Sky.''

`WHEN THEY SPEAK OF RITA': AN INSULAR FAMILY CONFRONTS AN INCIPIENT
REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Potter family of Tremont, N.H., is awfully behind
the times. Asa, the father, is the county road agent, vigilant in
his neighborly functions of snow removal and the occasional
emergency rescue but inept as a politician and unable to use a
computer. His 19-year-old son, Warren, is a crack mechanic but he
cannot face the fact that his girlfriend, Jeannie, a promising
student, is going off to college in the fall. Rita, mother and
wife, is the kind of homemaker who keeps the coffee pot on and
instinctively salves every setback with fresh-baked cookies.
</P>
<P>
   In Daisy Foote's flawed but affecting new play, ``When They
Speak of Rita,'' which opened Wednesday night at Primary Stages,
trouble, of course, is a-brewing along with the coffee. The outside
world, a place where other people have money and travel and do
things without the circumscription that holds the Potters in place,
is both threatening and alluring, and the main conflict for all the
characters here is the devil you know versus the devil you don't.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an old story for most people but the Potters have
managed not to confront it until now, and their individual
resolutions of how to proceed as Tremont is yanked along at the
tail end of progress make effective kitchen drama. Rita (the
playwright's older sister, Hallie), who earns money cleaning houses
for newly arrived, wealthy city folks, dreams of being a caterer _
or anything but what she is. Reading in the newspaper about
accomplished Frisbee players, she marvels sadly, ``There are so
many things in this world that a person can be good at.'' Isolated
in their small town, and sealed off from one another in their
Yankee stoicism, the Potters are unprepared for Rita's desperately
impetuous revolt.
</P>
<P>
   In nine scenes stretching over 10 eventful months, Warren (Jamie
Bennett) starts his own garage and impregnates and marries Jeannie
(Margot White), who gives up college; Asa (Ken Marks) loses his job
in an election to an interloping newcomer and, not incidentally,
Rita runs off with her son's best friend, a sweet-tempered boy
named Jimmy (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) whose own parents are violently
unhappy and who has long sought solace in Rita's kitchen, a
modestly homey place (a perfect-pitch design by Jeff Cowie) where,
he tells her, she is ``a bright, shining star.''
</P>
<P>
   This central event is obviously crucial to the advancement of
the narrative but it is also the play's chief problem, at least as
Foote has written it here. All the characters are skillfully drawn
as long as they are expressing themselves obliquely and mundanely.
Asa, who is devastated when his wife leaves, cannot muster any
greater expression of affection when she returns than to say, ``I
missed your cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the heartbreaking norm, and the play is persuasive in
evoking an environment where such emotional strictures are
inviolable. But when Foote has them speak their hearts, as in a
scene in which Jimmy pours out his love for Rita and she responds,
the writing seems clumsily estranged from the rest of the script,
and the actors cannot help but be similarly so from their
characters. Their coming together is abrupt _ an explosion of
feeling that has been contortedly restrained _ but Foote has not
solved, in language, the credibility problem. You don't believe
Jimmy or Rita is capable of such things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is much here that makes suspending disbelief
worthwhile, and much of that has to do with this being a family
play in more ways than one. Daisy Foote is the younger daughter of
Horton Foote, a proven master, as a playwright and screenwriter, of
small-town family implosions, and he has directed this play with
the quiet confidence of someone who recognizes a story that can
tell itself. Foote has said in interviews that the play is derived
from an interval decades ago when her father, who grew up in rural
Texas, the setting for many of his own works, moved the family to
New Hampshire, and his sense of the internal pressure building
inside a home translates northward seamlessly. The directorial
touches _ a door's timely slamming to punctuate the end of a
conversation, a motor running in the garage _ are infrequent and
beautifully orchestrated, giving the silence that surrounds the
dialogue in the Potter kitchen a powerful and subtle resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Foote has cast the play with care and skill, beginning with
Hallie Foote, his daughter and a frequent leading lady in his own
plays. As Rita, she is the image of rectitude fighting off
tremulousness. In the end, appalled by her own rashness and her
yearning still inarticulable, she is defined not by her
circumstances but by the fullness of her depressed character. Her
apology to Asa _ ``I'm sorry about everything, about everything
that's happened, about everything that I've done; I'm very, very
sorry'' _ is a brutal acknowledgment of defeat. Rita's nadir is the
high point of a skilled performance.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensemble around her, everyone is convincing, from Marks,
who allows Asa's undemonstrative presumption to unravel subtly into
helplessness, to White, who turns a teen-age girl into an earnestly
self-assured mediator, the family's best hope for emotional
guidance. Bennett, as Warren, the most competent and closed-minded
Potter, and Moss-Bachrach, a lanky young actor with a spectacularly
unruly haircut, who gives Jimmy the sincere and gentle charm of a
foolishly misguided boy growing up too fast, make their torn-apart
friendship a genuine loss. You end up caring about these people _
and the playwright _ even when they lapse. &QL;

&HT;     CLINTON HAS THE MOST STABLE CABINET IN 20TH CENTURY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 21)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton's hard-charging, scandal scarred
presidency has undergone endless staff turnover at the White House
but the two-term chief executive enjoys the most stable Cabinet of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Four Cabinet officers are on their way to serving the full eight
years of his presidency _ a record in presidential history.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton turns over the presidency to his successor
at inauguration ceremonies in January, the 27 men and women who
have led the 14 Cabinet departments at various times during his
presidency will have put in an average of 48 months on the job _
assuming no further Cabinet changes.
</P>
<P>
   Their job longevity far exceeds the record of recent
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   _ George Bush's Cabinet members averaged 31 months over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Reagan's Cabinet members averaged 38 months over eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy Carter's Cabinet members averaged 28 months over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Richard Nixon-Gerald Ford Cabinet averaged 27 months over
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   _ The John F. Kennedy-Lyndon B. Johnson Cabinet averaged 37
months over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have to go back to the presidency of Woodrow Wilson
during the eight years straddling World War I to find a Cabinet
that comes close to the longevity of the Clinton team. The average
length of service of Wilson's Cabinet matches the 48 months
achieved by the Clinton Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton edges out Wilson in two other categories: the number of
Cabinet officers who served the full eight years and the median
length of service of Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a built-in advantage over Wilson in the number of
eight-year Cabinet officers because Clinton has 14 Cabinet posts
while Wilson only had nine.
</P>
<P>
   The length of service is in addition to the hallmark of
Clinton's Cabinet _ its diversity. Clinton has appointed more
women, blacks and Hispanics to his Cabinet than any president in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 men and women who have held Cabinet posts, 14 have
been white men, five have been black men, three have been white
women, two have been black women and three have been Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Jones, a retired political scientist at the
University of Wisconsin and a former president of the American
Political Science Association, says the stability of Clinton's
Cabinet stands in sharp contrast to staff turnover at the White
House where there have been six White House counsels, four chiefs
of staff and four press secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be surprising but Clinton's Cabinet has the greatest
longevity of any president in the last century,'' says Jones, who
compiled the comparative study. ``Clinton has achieved this
milestone despite impeachment and despite the scandals that have
afflicted his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Education
Secretary Richard Riley will have served eight years in their
posts, a record for any eight-year administration in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Only three Cabinet officers served for eight years under Wilson,
Franklin D. Roosevelt and the combined eight-year term of John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Dwight D. Eisenhower had two Cabinet
officers serve for eight years; Ronald Reagan had one _ Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Cabinet's longevity came despite the onslaught of
investigations by court-appointed special prosecutors who looked
into the activities of five Cabinet officers over the last eight
years. The inquiries cleared three and indicted two _ yielding a
guilty plea by former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry
Cisneros and an acquittal for former Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says that Clinton achieved such unprecedented stability by
selecting executives who wanted the assignments to achieve specific
goals rather than as stepping-stones to higher posts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's keen interest in policy also boosted job satisfaction
for many Cabinet officers, encouraging them to stay on rather than
returning to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the fun of doing these jobs is seeing something happen
in your area of expertise,'' said Jones. ``It's satisfying for
these people to take proposals to the president and have him say,
`Yeah, I like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reno sounded rhapsodic on May 13 when she described her job
satisfaction during her commencement address at Duke University
School of Law. Her 37-year career as a lawyer, she said, was capped
by her service as attorney general, a stint that ``has brought joy
and challenge and fascination to my life in dimensions and
intensity that I never dreamed was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Rockman, a political scientist at the University of
Pittsburgh, said job satisfaction in the Clinton Cabinet was
probably heightened by the very scandals that engulfed the White
House. Those recurring problems distracted nettlesome White House
staffers, thus enabling Cabinet officers to operate independently
to develop and implement administration initiatives without White
House interference, Rockman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone back to the pre-Nixon era when Cabinet officers
were free to be the major formulators of policy in their areas of
responsibility,'' he said. ``The crises for this administration
have centered on the president, the vice president and the White
House, leaving Cabinet officers free to carry out their
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides to several of veteran Cabinet officers agreed that
the White House staff's constant damage-control operations freed
the hands of Cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Shalala said the health and human services
secretary has exercised wide leeway in her dealings with the White
House in the aftermath of the impeachment crisis because ``the
White House needed her in a way that they wouldn't have needed
her'' before the impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and political appointees at the Cabinet departments
agree that Cabinet officers often become more effective the longer
they serve in their posts. Cabinet officers gradually expand their
impact beyond testifying on Capitol Hill and dealing with interest
groups affected by their department's policies to build personal
relationships with congressional leaders, seize control of the
career civil service and establish personal ties with key state
officials.

TAIWAN'S VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS WILLING TO SPEAK HER MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Annette Lu says Taiwan is an ``independent
sovereign state.'' She thinks President Clinton ought to invite the
leaders of Taiwan and China to hash out their differences at the
White House. And when asked whether there are two Chinas _ a
proposition that outrages Beijing and sends most officials here
into semantic contortions _ she does not miss a beat: ``I would say
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that the new government of the president-elect,
Chen Shui-bian, seems eager to silence its outspoken vice
president-elect?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here on Monday, Lu, 56, offered opinions on
everything from relations between Taiwan and China to relations
between men and women. She was unrepentant about having described
the two countries in a previous interview as ``distant relatives
and close neighbors.'' That phrase drew a toxic reaction from
Beijing, which denounced Lu as a ``scum,'' bent on promoting
Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not do anything wrong, I did not say anything wrong,''
said Lu in a gentle voice by turns somber and playful. ``For China,
being such a big nation, to choose a woman to be the target. All of
a sudden, I became famous. I don't deserve that much.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Lu will be sworn in as Taiwan's first female vice
president. She is half of the team that swept the Nationalist Party
from power after more than a half century of rule. And by her own
reckoning, she is the first woman to be elected to a leadership
position in 5,000 years of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
   With so much history hanging over her, Lu's description of her
career has all the elements of an epic narrative. A native
Taiwanese and feminist leader, she was once thrown in jail for 5
1/2 years by the Nationalist government, after being charged with
advocating Taiwan's independence. Now, on the eve of her
inauguration, she is being tarred by the Chinese leaders on the
very same issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've accused me of what the KMT accused me of 20 years
ago,'' said Lu, using the initials for the Nationalist Party's
Chinese name, Kuomintang. ``Twenty years later, the same party who
suppressed me is ready to have its regime transferred to me on
behalf of the freedom fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the new administration are quick to note that
power is being transferred to President-elect Chen, a careful
politician who has labored since the election in March to soothe
China's leaders on the question of Taiwan's independence. Although
Chen's party, the Democratic Progressive Party, formally calls for
independence, he says it is an unnecessary step.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election, Chen has proposed to lift limits on
Taiwanese investment in China and to discuss direct trade links
with the mainland. He has also steered clear of pronouncements on
the role of the United States in the standoff between the
countries. Lu's oft-repeated suggestion that Washington act as a
mediator has rankled senior officials in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forthcoming vice president spoke her mind again on this
issue,'' said the foreign minister-designate, Tien Hung-mao, in an
interview. ``The fact of the matter is, this is not official
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people are harsher. ``She's a loose cannon,'' said Andrew
Yang, head of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a
research institute. ``She doesn't share the same political beliefs
as Chen Shui-bian. She sees herself as the guardian of the
Taiwanese independence movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for officials like Tien is that Lu regards foreign
affairs as her area of expertise. A lawyer with degrees from the
University of Illinois and Harvard, Lu has led Taiwan's
unsuccessful battle to be readmitted to the United Nations. Her
resume lists visits over the years to South Africa, Nicaragua,
Ireland and the Netherlands as prominently as her five election
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the campaign, people expected me to be
active in foreign affairs and mainland affairs,'' she said. ``It
all depends on where President Chen would like me to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiow-Jen Chang, a woman in Parliament who knows Lu, remembers
the energy and imagination that she brought to Taiwan's quixotic
effort to re-enter the United Nations. In 1997, Lu arranged for a
blimp with a flashing sign to fly over the U.N. building, while a
boat carrying another sign floated past on the East River and a
pro-Taiwanese crowd paraded on the street outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year she proposed a different way to enter the U.N.,''
Chang said. ``She doesn't care how people will react. She says and
does exactly what she believes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Lu has been the county magistrate of Taoyuan, an
industrialized area south of Taipei. Although she twice won the job
handily , Lu was unable to deliver Taoyuan for Chen. Political
analysts said Lu also did not help win women's votes for Chen. Her
only value, they said, was to shore up the pro-independence faction
of the Democratic Progressive Party, which views Chen with
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Chen's senior advisers are moving to marginalize Lu
even before she is sworn in. During Lu's interview on Monday, no
aides were present _ an odd practice for the future No. 2 official
of a country. And she said she would not be involved in the
drafting of Chen's inauguration speech because it will be subjected
to such intense scrutiny in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the PRC authorities to understand that it is useless to
target me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rumors that she was being frozen out, Lu said they
were planted by people, here and in mainland China, who want to
drive a wedge between her and Chen. The rise of an outspoken woman,
she said, was bound to ruffle feathers on both sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the internal circle of power, they are not ready yet,''
Lu said with smile of someone who has been there before. ``But they
are getting ready.''

DISCREET CHARM OF BUNUEL; BUILDING AN INCUBATOR; IN KEATON'S
FOOTSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore.)  By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Serge Silberman celebrated his 83rd birthday on May 1
by flying from his home in Paris to New York, where the next day he
attended a screening of ``The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,''
the Oscar-winning 1972 film he produced for his friend and longtime
associate Luis Bunuel.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, May 1 was also the date in 1945 when U.S. troops
liberated the Nazi camp at Ludwigslust, Germany, where Silberman
had been transferred after surviving Birkenau (where his parents
died) and Auschwitz. ``I have had a horrible life and a wonderful
life,'' he said in his suite at the Carlyle, speaking in an English
colored by a complex assortment of European accents. ``It was like
being born again on my birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in France after the war, he abandoned his training as a
mining engineer and entered the movie business. By 1953 he had
become a producer; his subsequent credits include Jean-Pierre
Melville's ``Bob le Flambeur'' (1955), Jean-Jacques Beineix's
``Diva'' (1981) and Akira Kurosawa's ``Ran'' (1985).
</P>
<P>
   But it is Bunuel, the Spanish-born surrealist who died in 1983,
who remains the closest of his associates. ``He was older than I
was, but he was like a son to me,'' Silberman said, describing the
protective relationship that allowed Bunuel to realize five of his
best films: ``Diary of a Chambermaid'' (1964), ``The Milky Way''
(1969), ``The Phantom of Liberty'' (1974) and ``That Obscure Object
of Desire'' (1977), which will all be rereleased in coming months,
and ``Discreet Charm,'' which is playing at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so generous, so nice, a truly beautiful human being,''
said Silberman of the man whose most famous image, from the 1929
``Andalusian Dog,'' graphically depicts a straight razor slicing an
eyeball. ``He was one way in life and another way up here,''
Silberman added, tapping his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the anarchic energy of his films, Bunuel led an
orderly life and made his movies the same way. ``He gave me the
scripts like a child turning in his homework, as if he were afraid
of what I was going to say,'' Silberman said. ``He would only shoot
exactly what was in the script. He was absolutely prepared. With me
he made everything in about 48 days. It took him one week to edit.
And when the first cut was done, the picture was finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Building an Incubator
</P>
<P>
   Another approach to producing is being developed at Madstone
Films on lower Fifth Avenue. The company's founders _ Tom
Gruenberg, a 25-year veteran of the film industry, and Chip Seelig,
a partner in Goldman Sachs _ say they hope to reinvent the entire
process. ``The idea we came up with,'' Seelig said, ``was to take
first-time directors, most likely young, and try to put them in a
very supportive, nurturing environment and see what comes out of
that process.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result 15 novice filmmakers will be put under two-year
contracts with annual salaries of $50,000, a benefits package and a
retirement plan. The resident filmmakers are expected to act as
creative catalysts for one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back to the halcyon days of the '70s, with Spielberg
and Lucas and Coppola and Scorsese,'' Gruenberg said. ``They would
sit and talk about film for 10 or 12 hours a day. We felt that if
we could harness creative filmmakers and put them into an
environment where they could work and talk, and take away the
financial problems, we could raise the bar creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage group consultation, Madstone is offering a
financial incentive. ``In the two years you are working at
Madstone, you have a percentage of every film that we make,'' said
Seelig, so that at the end of the process the filmmakers will all
be sharing in one another's success.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new offices, at 85 Fifth Avenue, are being
designed to foster cooperation. ``We're trying to set
architecturally a very collaborative environment,'' said Eva
Kolodner, an independent producer (``Boys Don't Cry'') who has been
brought aboard as head of feature development and production. ``The
idea is that I can go write my script by myself, but at the end of
the afternoon I can sit down and sigh: `I'm having trouble with
this dialogue. Does anybody have any thoughts?'''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the concept is the relatively inexpensive digital
video equipment that has recently been developed. ``It's a digital
operation from start to finish,'' Gruenberg emphasized. ``We're
going to shoot digitally, and retrofit 50 theaters across the
country, and fill those theaters with digital content that we make
or acquire.''
</P>
<P>
   Madstone's business plan calls for films budgeted at $500,000 to
$1.5 million, a typical range for independent features.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask us, `Why digital?''' Kolodner said. ``You could
make a 35-millimeter feature for that budget. But it's a new art
form.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``People have a kind of flexibility in digital
that doesn't exist anymore in 35-millimeter, where you are
constrained by your budget. With digital you can shoot more, you
can take more chances, you can push the boundaries a little bit
more.''
</P>
<P>
   And where are these bright young talents to be found? ``Our
first kind of outreach is to film schools and film festivals,''
Kolodner said. ``But if people want to come to us, the real place
to go is our Web site, www.madstonefilms.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not a dot-com,'' Seelig said, with the emphasis of a
newly wary Wall Streeter. ``We just happen to have an Internet
address.''
</P>
<P>
   In Keaton's Footsteps
</P>
<P>
   An original piece of film scholarship has just been published by
The Santa Monica Press. In ``Silent Echoes: Discovering Early
Hollywood Through the Films of Buster Keaton,'' the author, John
Bergstrom, has gone over the major Keaton shorts and features with
a magnifying glass, identifying the original locations through the
tiniest of clues and presenting side-by-side-by-side comparisons of
how the various buildings, intersections, alleyways and landscapes
appear on film, in period photographs and today.
</P>
<P>
   The results are a sort of Proustian collage of time and memory,
biography and history, urban growth and artistic expression.
Bergstrom has traced almost every step of the celebrated chase in
``Cops'' (1922) through downtown Los Angeles. And he identifies the
locations Keaton used during the Manhattan production of ``The
Cameraman'' (1928). He also gives precise directions to the site in
Culp Creek Canyon in Oregon, where in 1927 Keaton staged the train
wreck in ``The General,'' though Bergstrom warns, ``The brambles
are sharp, the rocks are slippery, and the hike requires passing
along private property.''

   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ In a victory for the Clinton
administration, the Senate on Thursday narrowly killed a measure to
set a deadline for withdrawing American ground troops from Kosovo,
a proposal that also had drawn fire from Gov. George W. Bush. By a
53-47 vote, senators stripped a provision from a military
construction spending bill that would have cut off funds for the

   KIMES-TRIAL (New York) _ Sante and Kenneth Kimes, an accused
mother-and-son team of con artists, were found guilty Thursday of
murdering a wealthy Manhattan widow as part of an elaborate scheme
to seize control her $8 million townhouse. Relying entirely on
circumstantial evidence, prosecutors convinced the jurors that the
Kimeses killed Irene Silverman, 82, in April 1998 and disposed of
her body. Silverman's body has never been found, and defense
lawyers for the Kimeses insisted that their clients were scapegoats
in a vast conspiracy. By David Rohde.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1962, only nine years after Eugene O'Neill died, Arthur and
Barbara Gelb published a major study of his life and work. Crammed
with interviews with O'Neill's ex-wives, boyhood friends and
theatrical colleagues, driven by the conviction that O'Neill's
posthumously published masterpiece, ``A Long Day's Journey Into
Night,'' was the theatrical equivalent of ``Moby-Dick,'' the Gelbs'
biography helped to establish O'Neill's reputation as the great
brooding genius of American dramatic history. Like O'Neill's life,
their book was a sprawling work of passion, with the rough edges
still showing and its own nervous energy throbbing slightly out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly 40 years later, the Gelbs have made the highly
unusual decision to rewrite their biography of O'Neill from
beginning to end. Although the old book is still in print, the
Gelbs wanted to include material from the O'Neill papers at Yale
University that had not been available earlier, along with fresh
interviews with previously unknown or uncooperative sources and,
most interestingly, their own more mature perspective on the
tangled dynamics of O'Neill's family life, which had served as the
interpretive centerpiece of their early book.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference between the old book and the new, apart
from the addition of anecdotes and an updated bibliography, is a
somewhat more charitable attitude toward O'Neill's parents and a
slightly harsher judgment of his multiple excesses as an alcoholic,
adulterer, derelict and self-destructive American Prometheus. There
is also a difference in scale. ``O'Neill: Life With Monte Cristo''
is merely the first in a projected three-volume work. It ends in
1918, with O'Neill as a 29-year-old aspiring playwright, poised to
ascend into the American pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   The major rationale for such expansive treatment of O'Neill's
formative years is that for O'Neill they truly were formative. W.B.
Yeats once observed that every aspiring artist must choose between
``perfection of life, or of the work.'' O'Neill not only made an
emphatic choice of work over life, but also seemed determined to
make his personal life into a series of painful imperfections that
then became the creative material for his most enduring work. He
did away with happy endings in the American theater by studiously
avoiding them as a character in his own one-man play. He learned,
the hard way, that life was never too good to be true, always too
true to be good.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was literally born on Broadway, at a theatrical hotel in
1888. His father, James O'Neill, was a prominent actor who
squandered his talent by playing more than 5,000 performances in
the lead role of the melodramatic moneymaker ``The Count of Monte
Cristo.'' The subtitle of this book refers to O'Neill's extended
dependence on his father and on the money he earned in a play that
symbolized the sentimental values O'Neill learned to loathe.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Ellen Quinlan O'Neill, became addicted to morphine
while recovering from Eugene's birth and thereafter assumed the
character of a matronly victim of life, formidable in her
helplessness. His older brother, called Jamie, was an alcoholic and
womanizer whose major fraternal contribution was to introduce his
brother to the saloons and whorehouses of New York. If ``A Long
Day's Journey Into Night'' is about the most famous dysfunctional
family in American dramatic history, O'Neill's inspiration began at
home.
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of modern biography, especially when the subject is
a major literary figure, is driven by the urge to undermine the
writer's artistic achievement by exposing the previously unknown
details of his or her private life. Or as John Updike recently put
it, literary biographies seem designed ``to reduce celebrities to a
set of antics and ailments to which we can feel superior.''
O'Neill's early life would seem to provide a veritable arsenal of
ammunition for this emerging genre, which we might call ``homicidal
biography.'' Consider the following.
</P>
<P>
   A solitary and sickly child, O'Neill early on adopted the
posture of the self-absorbed rebel without a cause. He flunked out
of Princeton after one year, abandoned his pregnant wife, wandered
to Honduras and Argentina in search of gold and prostitutes, then
found a sliver of serenity as a seaman on cargo ships sailing out
of New York. (He often remarked that he wished he had been born a
sea gull.) He cultivated his alcoholism and his alienated posture
in the saloons of Battery Park, then hit bottom in 1912 when he
attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief fling as a journalist in New London, Conn., and a
briefer fling as a student of playwriting at Harvard, he took up
residence in a Greenwich Village bar called the Hell Hole, a place
where bohemian convictions mixed easily with booze. Befriended by
the radical journalist John Reed, he proceeded to begin a torrid
affair with Louise Bryant, Reed's lover. All during this time he
was wholly dependent on the philanthropy of his father, who was
toiling away in ``Monte Cristo,'' and whom, he apprised everyone,
he thoroughly despised.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Arthur Gelb _ he is a former theater critic who went
on to become managing editor of The New York Times _ are less
interested in these disreputable episodes as evidence of O'Neill's
deeply flawed character than as raw material from which he created
his own tragic vision. After all, they seem to say, O'Neill never
tried to conceal his private sins, personal obsessions or domestic
catastrophes. He put them on the stage for all the world to see.
They believe that art trumps and ultimately redeems life,
especially when the artist is a genius capable of producing ``Long
Day's Journey,'' ``Ah, Wilderness'' and ``Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' all of which transformed the neurotic history of the
O'Neill family into masterpieces of the American theater.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``The Iceman Cometh'' transforms the self-destructive
habits of O'Neill's drunken cronies in the bars of Battery Park
into a poignant dramatization of the human blend of perversity and
nobility. O'Neill's demons may have got the better of him in his
life, but he triumphed over them in his art.
</P>
<P>
   For better and for worse _ and I think mostly for better _
``O'Neill: Life With Monte Cristo'' retains the characteristic
features of its predecessor. It is mercifully unburdened by
literary theory. It is lumpy and aside-ish, perfectly content to go
off on tangents describing the Irish-American affinity for alcohol
or the pretensions of New London society. It swings too literally
between the narration of O'Neill's life and the scenes he
reconstructed in his plays, as if O'Neill had orchestrated the
Oedipal conflicts with his parents to enrich his depiction of the
Tyrone family in ``Long Day's Journey.'' (On second thought, maybe
he did.)
</P>
<P>
   Though it lacks an overarching argument about O'Neill's
psychological insights, apart from the fact that they derived from
his own experience of tragedy, it is brimming with energy and
dedicated to the idea that O'Neill, more than any other playwright
in American history, deserves our abiding attention. You put this
book down and nod in agreement.

&HT;     PELOSI FACES LOSS OF ANNUAL PLATFORM ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 21)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the House approves permanent normal trading
status for China next week as expected, Rep. Nancy Pelosi will lose
her annual platform for highlighting Beijing's human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   For each of the last 10 years, Pelosi has led the charge in
Congress to pressure China to improve its human rights policies in
exchange for favorable U.S. trading privileges.
</P>
<P>
   She lost every one of those battles because Congress always
voted to renew China's U.S. trading status for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she says, her efforts were not in vain because ``we
succeeded every year in putting the issue on the front burner.''
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes this week to grant Beijing permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR), it would put an end to the annual debate
over U.S.-China trade _ and it would blunt Pelosi's annual campaign
to focus attention on China's poor record on human rights,
environmental standards and trade accords. The Senate is expected
to quickly follow the House's expected approval.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, D-Calif., opposes permanency on the basis that it would
abolish any leverage that Congress has to pressure the Chinese
during the annual debate over 12-month renewals.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says permanent trading benefits for
China would benefit American businesses. Republican voter counters
in the House say they have 150 GOP votes and pro-PNTR Democrats say
they are nearing 70 votes, putting the total close to the 218
needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think neither side has the votes yet,'' Pelosi said last
week in an interview in her office. ``It will be a fight to the
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   She says some 30 House Democrats who voted in the past to renew
China's favorable trading status now oppose granting the permanent
normal trade relations (PNTR) to China.
</P>
<P>
   But she notes wryly that she is accustomed to being on the
losing side of the China human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost every year, so it wouldn't be a shock'' to lose the
big vote for permanent normal trade relations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, a human rights advocate with Human Rights
Watch, a nonprofit New York-based group, said Pelosi has earned ``a
great deal of respect for her commitment'' to human rights in
China. ``She has been one of the most outspoken and energetic
advocates.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1994, Pelosi fought unsuccessfully to attach human
rights conditions to the annual renewal of China's trade benefits,
although she supported renewing the country's favorable trade
status.
</P>
<P>
   She broke with the administration in 1994 when President Clinton
decided to stop considering human rights issues as a condition for
renewing favorable trade relations with China. Since then she has
urged the total revocation of China's trade benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Pelosi has also sharply attacked China for
violating other trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strictly on the basis of trade, this is a bad deal,'' Pelosi
says, adding that China has often violated its trade pacts.
``There's no reason to think that China will comply now.''
</P>
<P>
   She says China has failed to keep promises to open its markets,
stop the piracy of intellectual property and end the export of
goods produced by prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   She also slams China for violating signed agreements on
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi says she has lost the China human rights battle for the
past decade because ``we're up against some mighty forces.''
</P>
<P>
   She says China trade always wins over human rights issues on the
House floor because pro-China businesses and lobby groups hire
former Cabinet members to make the case to Congress. They ``weigh
in heavily on these issues when they speak. The public doesn't know
they are speaking as a hired hand of someone wanting to go into
business with the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi says it's tough for her to win a lobbying battle against
the White House because the administration can win votes with
favors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is doling out favors for votes,'' she says.
``The slogan of the day is `What do you want?'''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi admits her China human rights stance has forced her to go
against the wishes of many of her supporters in Silicon Valley. The
high-tech region near her San Francisco district is a fertile
source of campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said to them, it's hard for me to understand how any
industry that takes pride in the new, new thing, is resorting to
the old, old way of kowtowing to the Chinese regime.''
</P>
<P>
   She says her constituents in the Chinese-American community in
San Francisco have mixed opinions over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Pelosi says she feels strongly about human rights and won't
back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I was young, I thought the best job in the world
would be to be the assistant secretary for human rights'' in the
State Department. She said she envisions that job would enable her
to ``be part of a policy that respects the dignity and worth of
every person.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, 60, said she first became concerned with human rights as
a teenager when she read the ``Diary of Anne Frank,'' a book about
a young girl who perished along with her family in the holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I first thought, how dare anyone do that to
anybody else? That was a jarring experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another catalyst for her was the 1989 massacre of Chinese
students at Tiananmen Square, which she is reminded of daily by a
poster above her desk in her Capitol Hill office that is signed by
dozens of Chinese dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever won, it would have been wonderful,'' Pelosi says.
``But people always tell me `Money always wins, it's just a
question of how long you can keep the issue alive.'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a measure of First Lady Hillary Clinton's
growing confidence as a candidate that she was willing to share the
stage with her husband as she became the official Democratic
nominee for U.S. Senate from New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her advisers had wanted him to stay away, fearing that
he would overshadow her. But those days are over, for good or ill.
</P>
<P>
   She is a star now in her own right with her own campaign, her
own public policies and her own identity. She even has her own
enemies, separate from his.
</P>
<P>
   Her ideological views closely track his, but they are not
identical. And as the campaign progresses, she will have to take
positions that resonate with New Yorkers rather than fit the
policies of a national administration.
</P>
<P>
   She has been properly mum during rival Republican New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's health and marital troubles. For once, a huge
political controversy has nothing to do with her or the rogue to
whom she is married. It's impossible for even the nutty paranoid
right to find some sort of Clinton conspiracy behind Giuliani's
problems. They are all his.
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence that the novelty of a candidate who
doubles as first lady is beginning to pale as she is increasingly
being viewed simply as an ambitious female politician who wants to
be a U.S. senator. A recent New York poll shows that 37 percent of
voters surveyed have a favorable view of her, 35 percent dislike
her, 22 percent have mixed opinions and 6 percent haven't heard
enough to hold a view.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true, as conservatives have been claiming, that
everyone knows so much about her most voters have already made up
their minds to hate her. The campaign battle will be for the hearts
and minds of that conflicted and undecided middle.
</P>
<P>
   Poll analysts say the carpetbagger issue has shorter legs now
than it did originally. She recently completed a tour of every one
of the state's 62 counties and is demonstrating a good grasp of
local issues. It always seemed an exaggerated, transitory problem
anyway. Sophisticated New Yorkers readily embrace celebrities, no
matter their origin. And there's a gigantic precedent. Voters were
happy to overlook the fact that Democrat Robert Kennedy was a son
of Massachusetts and give him a U.S. Senate seat in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's campaign got off to a rocky start with minor
boo-boos that raised questions about her inexperience. She has been
doing much better lately although she concedes that she has learned
the hard way that it was easier to be a candidate's spouse than it
is to be the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady told a congressional wives' luncheon here Tuesday
a few hours before she accepted the Democratic nomination in New
York that she now has a ``different perspective'' on the demands of
political life. She said she recalls with dismay all the times she
asked her husband, ``Why did you wear that?'' or told him, ``If
only you had said this or done that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could take it all back,'' she sighed with an impish
grin. Nobody asked her if now Bill Clinton generously returns the
favor by critiquing her performance on the stump as well as all
those snappy pantsuits she favors.
</P>
<P>
   The basic lesson, she said, is that the only way to cope is to
``be yourself'' although she added to laughter that being herself
means she is now ``a lot blonder than when I arrived in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid sounding Pollyannaish about a political spouse's
comparatively relaxed life _ we know that hers at least has not
been easy at all _ Hillary Clinton described her initiation on the
evening of her husband's 1992 election into the intense glare
focused on a president's mate.
</P>
<P>
   It was cold outside in Little Rock, she recalled, So she put on
thick black stockings with her outfit to keep warm while she
listened to his victory speech.
</P>
<P>
   She was shocked the next day to discover the stockings had
become a big issue. She found extensive journalistic commentary,
ranging from accusations of bad taste to what she described wryly
as ``a sinister view of what it all meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to the congressional wives: ``Develop a thick skin''
and don't take criticism too personally.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton doesn't have a good record of following her own
advice, being known for her relatively translucent sheathing. But
for the time being at least she is being disciplined in pursuit of
a goal she obviously wants very much.
</P>
<P>
   It is not she but Giuliani who has temper tantrums and
irresponsible outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens now in the Senate race, the outcome is likely
to be close. That's okay. No candidate should expect to have the
job handed over on a platter, whether the purpose is to prove a
first lady is qualified to run for elective office or the purpose
is to prevent her from extending the Clinton name in active public
life.

<P>
   BIZ-KODAK (Undated) _ It may be the quintessential
company-in-transition. Over the last several years, Eastman Kodak
has jettisoned the legacies of failed diversification efforts, cut
$1.2 billion in overhead and embarked on a series of digital
photography initiatives intended to catapult the company into the
New Economy. But given the lackluster results shareholders have
endured, many wonder if Kodak really is on the verge of such a

</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-STRATEGIES (Las Vegas) _ The kernel of truth embedded in
contrarian analysis is that the market rarely follows forecasts
that are very widely held. Bull markets typically end once everyone
becomes convinced that the market has nowhere to go but up. That is
the origin of the old saw about bull markets liking to climb a wall
of worry, and it explains why having a bootblack tell you about the
latest stock tips is considered the quintessential sign of a top.

   ABOUT-CARS-LOWRIDERS (Tampa) _ Lowriding emerged in the '50s in
the barrios of California, as Chicano youths _ in what may have
been a reaction to the hot-rod culture dominated by whites _
transformed their cars into shiny, fantastical, ground-hugging
showboats. ``Go low and go slow'' were the watchwords. From the
beginning, lowriding was as much about ethnic identity as about
machinery. In the 1980s, lowriding began to break out of its
traditionally Latino stronghold. By Dan Neil.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tony Limon is home, for now safe in the only
shelter the 18-year-old has known, quoting Scripture and petting
his puppy Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the Lord to send me home,'' Limon said, his voice
cracking a bit. ``And I'm home.''
</P>
<P>
   Limon's hand, now gently scratching behind the ears of a
grateful Great Dane, doesn't seem to belong on the same thin arm as
the one that brutally bashed an opponent's face during a high
school basketball game in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Now out of prison, Limon is under house arrest while appealing
his five-year sentence for attacking Brent Holmes during a South
San-East Central game a year ago January.
</P>
<P>
   Limon, a Hispanic, will no longer discuss the racial jabs
reportedly traded between the teams before his assault on Holmes,
who is black, only saying they're now against everything he
believes.
</P>
<P>
   Limon dropped Holmes with a sucker punch so vicious that he
twisted and crashed face-down near the free throw line as blood
oozed on the court and his body squirmed in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility, and I have sinned against God,'' Limon
said of the attack. ``Because I had no right to hit anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Mark Luitjen sentenced Limon to five years in
prison in February.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one had ever served jail time for an assault that
took place during a game, national attention came to focus on San
Antonio, South San High School and its players and coach.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months into his sentence, Limon says a fellow inmate
at the Garza West Unit in Beeville approached him and demanded he
help beat up a black man.
</P>
<P>
   ``In prison, you have to make a stand, and prison is the most
racist place I've been,'' Limon said. ``You either sat at a black
table, a white table or a Hispanic table when you ate. I had to
make a stand to almost everybody there, because I saw a black
person as my brother _ as a creation of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Limon split three months between the Bexar County Jail in San
Antonio and the Beeville prison unit, and the experience behind
bars seems to have changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   He now wields Scripture like he once wielded a chopping elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jail was a theme park compared to prison,'' Limon said.
``Prison was hell, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't relax in prison, because you're never safe. You have
guys in there who are never going to see freedom again, and they
wouldn't waste two thoughts of killing someone over a bag of
chips.''
</P>
<P>
   Limon, clutching a tattered Bible brand new only three months
ago, believes the ordeal _ from the impulsive assault to his
imprisonment _ is all part of God's plan for his redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I figured, man, cut me some slack,'' Limon said of
Luitjen's surprisingly stiff sentence. ``Who gets five years for
elbowing a guy in a basketball game? Who else has ever gotten that?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I figure I've been chosen, because this has never
happened. The Lord said, `Tony, here's the Bible. Learn.'''
</P>
<P>
   The judge weighed Limon's prior arrest for a burglary a couple
of months before the assault _ for which he received probation _ at
the sentencing, dispelling the idea that only the assault on Holmes
landed him in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks ago, Luitjen agreed to let Limon post bond
while his appeal is pending. But the judge imposed limits on the
release.
</P>
<P>
   The house arrest restricts Limon to staying between the
thresholds of his family's small three-bedroom home on San
Antonio's South Side, and an electronic monitoring device around
the ankle keeps track of his every movement.
</P>
<P>
   While Limon's mother, Olivia Ramey, draws comfort from her son's
new inclination for nonstop proselytizing, Limon also knows some
old friends may duck at his first hint of Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been a leader all of my life, and in the past I've
led my friends to nightclubs and high school parties and things
like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm going to lead them to God.''
</P>
<P>
   South San basketball coach Gary Durbon, named in a lawsuit by
the Holmes family who contend that Durbon taught violent strategy
to his players, is skeptical of Limon's and his mother's sudden
embrace of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has, fantastic, because he needs it bad and she needs it
bad,'' Durbon said. ``But if they're just claiming this to get the
public's sympathy, then shame on 'em for blasphemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Limon said Durbon should study his Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blasphemy is saying God is not real,'' Limon said. ``Blasphemy
is cursing God. I say I believe in God. Is that cursing God?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to understand what we're saying before we say
it. As for Coach Durbon, I pray for him every night.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Limon knew little of the Bible before his sentencing. Now its
edges are frayed and pages are loose. ``I don't go anywhere without
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's no problem under the conditions of his house arrest, and
his confinement to home after three months of imprisonment is
heaven on Earth for Limon.
</P>
<P>
   Limon said his new faith protected him in prison. On the fourth
night in the county jail in February, Limon said he dropped to his
knees and quietly uttered this plea: ``Lord, I've sinned against
you and I'm sorry. I don't even know how to pray to you, and I
don't even know what I'm saying. I just know that I need help, and
I know that I've done wrong in my life. But I'm asking you to come
into my life. I open my heart to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Limon said the prayer changed him forever, and it armed him
spiritually for his transfer to the Beeville prison in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other prisoners thought my faith was fake at first,''
Limon said. ``They wanted me to fight, but I said I'm not going to
fight against a guy just because he's black. He's a creation of
God. I told them you do what you have to do, but my Lord says he
will contend with those who contend with me. And Isaiah 54:17 says
no weapon raised against you shall prosper.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Limon has big bills to pay, starting with several thousand
dollars in medical expenses he owes Holmes and thousands more in
attorney fees. The appeals process that could take up to a year
could lead to a resumption of the sentence, a trial by jury or
probation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Limon wanders the hallways of his home, reading and
preaching the Bible to friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope at some point the judge will allow Tony to go out and
get a job, and maybe enroll in some college courses,'' his lawyer,
Carlos Uresti, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More importantly, I know Tony wants to go to church. I think
the judge wants to make sure everything gets settled and Tony gets
all his affairs in order, and then at some point he'll allow him to
go to church and school and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Limon was released last week after his attorneys filed the
appeal and the motion for the $30,000 bond, which allows Limon to
remain free while his appeal is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Limon said his plans, no matter how the appeal turns out, will
center on ``serving the word of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Lord wants me to dig ditches, I'm going to dig ditches
in the name of the Lord. If he wants me to go to college, I'm going
to come home and do my homework in the name of the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``God was calling me for a long time, and I ignored him. I'd
been going against the will of God all of my life. I pursued
worldly stuff and material things, but now I have my Bible in hand
and I think, man, I'm blessed.''

TIME WARNER, DISNEY REACH TENTATIVE RESOLUTION OF CABLE DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have reached an
agreement in principle that will end their rancorous dispute over
the cable carriage of television networks owned by Disney, Time
Warner chairman Gerald Levin told shareholders at the company's
annual meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Time Warner nor Disney executives would discuss the
specific details of the agreement Thursday, saying that it needs to
be committed first to contractual language. But one executive with
knowledge of the agreement said that it was ``completely an
economic deal,'' meaning that it would not specifically address
Disney's demands for assurances about the pending merger between
America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had raised concerns that the new company would deny
access on the Internet or cable television to competitive providers
of entertainment and information.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the shareholders, Levin said that the deal was
a result of direct negotiations between Robert Iger, the president
of Disney, and Richard Parsons, the president of Time Warner, and
that they had reached what he called a handshake agreement. A Time
Warner spokesman, Edward Adler, later labeled it as a ``telephonic
handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both companies said senior executives' refusal to
discuss the details was a result of the previous bitterness that
has surrounded the negotiations. The bitterness led to Time
Warner's decision to take Disney's ABC stations off its cable
systems on May 1. Time Warner had declined a Disney offer of a
one-month extension in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The move proved calamitous for Time Warner. The company was
criticized by consumers, editorial pages and politicians in New
York and Washington. Time Warner restored the service one day
later, agreeing to an extension until July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the effects of that fallout, Levin said in his
remarks at the annual meeting that Time Warner had apologized to
consumers and regulators for terminating access to ABC stations.
Then he added that the companies had reached an agreement in
principle to resolve what he called their commercial dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The executive with knowledge of the deal said that Levin's
careful language was an indication that the resolution will deal
solely with the financial details of Time Warner's agreement to
continue carrying the ABC stations, and will not specifically
address Disney's concerns about the merger with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this agreement is an enormously positive step,'' the
executive said. ``Whether it's the last step or not, time will
tell.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Disney executives challenged some aspects of the merger in
meetings with both congressmen and representatives of the Federal
Communications Commission last week. Though Disney did not ask the
FCC to block the merger itself, Disney did request that it issue
certain directives that would insure that competitors receive the
same full access to consumers that any AOL or Time Warner company
receives after the two companies merge.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's worries about whether a combined AOL and Time Warner
would wield too much control over access to both the Internet and
cable distribution became a factor in what had been long-standing
negotiations over how Disney would be compensated for the
transmission on Time Warner cable systems of the ABC stations that
Disney owns.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had backed off a deal that was near completion when the
AOL merger was announced. Time Warner charged that, after the
merger announcement, Disney greatly increased its financial
demands, to a point where it would have cost Time Warner another
$300 million over 10 years. Disney disputed that figure.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to come to Disney in fees for carrying cable
channels that Disney owns, including the Disney Channel, the Soap
Channel and Toon Disney.
</P>
<P>
   The rancor escalated into the showdown at the beginning of the
month, when Time Warner pulled ABC off the air in such cities as
New York, Los Angeles, and Houston. ABC reacted by placing
advertisements in many papers for consumers to purchase satellite
dishes to circumvent Time Warner's cable service. ABC agreed to pay
the cost of the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   That move greatly angered Time Warner officials, who said Disney
was directly threatening their business.
</P>
<P>
   But there were indications early this week that the two sides
were getting closer because the ads for ABC's satellite deal were
pulled from newspapers starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this week, Time Warner reached agreement with NBC
for transmission of that network's stations. ``That move sort of
isolated ABC,'' said a Time Warner executive. ``It helped move
things along.''

MOTHER-IN-LAW OF ALL VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: Repeating to insert clarifying references to Mrs. K-Doe
in grafs 14, 15, 18, 19, 20) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ This is a city where anything can happen: a jazz
parade might suddenly strike up a march in a quiet residential
neighborhood at 1 a.m., or in the middle of the afternoon a tourist
restaurant could be invaded by masked gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   For six years Ernie K-Doe's Mother-in-Law Lounge, a corner bar
opened by this '60s rhythm-and-blues singer, has been a perfect
embodiment of New Orleans unpredictability: every visit to K-Doe's
shrine to himself is an adventure. But nothing in my experience
interviewing musicians or spending time at the Mother-in-Law Lounge
could have prepared me for what happened there this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the history books the 64-year-old K-Doe, whose original name
was Ernest Kador Jr., is known for recording the No. 1 hit
``Mother-in-Law'' followed by several regional successes. But to
the denizens of New Orleans today he is a bona fide character,
brimming with unpredictable energy and an unharnessed ego that has
led him to nickname himself the Emperor of the Universe. He is a
golden oldie who has lifted himself off the skids with the support
of a new wife, the opening of an off-the-beaten-track bar and
tireless dedication to the musical temple that is himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't but two of us left,'' he said one night behind the bar
at the Mother-in-Law Lounge. ``James Brown and K-Doe.''
</P>
<P>
   In his performance at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
Festival, which ran from April 28 to May 7, K-Doe strung his old
hits together in a set that ran 20 minutes shorter than the time
allotted to it. Wearing a canary yellow suit with rhinestones and
stitched music notes, a feathered yellow crown and a flowing yellow
cape with the words ``Emperor Ernie K-Doe'' emblazoned on the back,
he announced songs with lines like, ``Here's another million-seller
by Ernie K-Doe: I never miss.'' His voice was rough, ragged and
tended to flatten out, but he nonetheless put on a blaring, madcap
R-and-B performance that held the audience gleefully rapt.
</P>
<P>
   And the performance didn't stop at Jazz Fest. He and his wife,
Antoinette (who is also his seamstress, backup singer and manager),
made sure that the music continued each night at the Mother-in-Law
Lounge. On a typical night there K-Doe stays behind the bar. In the
front of the room there is a jukebox filled with Ernie K-Doe
recordings from the '50s on. When a patron plays one of K-Doe's
songs, the legend himself will usually pick an old brown taxicab
microphone off the back counter and sing along.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will he karaoke, but he will also talk to his own voice
on the CD, making comments like, ``Tell 'em, K-Doe,'' or ``I'm
cocky, but I'm good.'' Occasionally, in a small room in the back,
K-Doe's flesh-and-blood mother-in-law can be seen watching
television, oblivious to the havoc in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   For the nights of Jazz Fest, K-Doe brought in a dapper-looking
lounge performer named Rico Watts, who plays at the bar on Sundays,
to accompany him on synthesizer and drum machine. It was on one of
those nights that a photographer and I visited to prepare this
column about K-Doe, who sat at the bar running his long, ladylike
fingernails through his suspiciously elaborate long black hair. We
requested permission for an interview and photographs, and he and
his wife were only too glad to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   While on break between sets, we walked out to K-Doe's touring
van, with his name emblazoned on the side surrounded by stars, and
talked. He spoke of wanting to let the record labels know that he
was actually free and looking for a deal, and then proceeded to
recite several of his favorite immodesties, including his assertion
that ``there are only three songs that will last until the end of
the earth.'' Those songs are: ``Amazing Grace,'' ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' and ``Mother-in-Law.'' Because, he observed,
``there will always be mothers-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we headed back into the bar to take photographs and
watch him perform his second set. During his last number, the
racial unity song ``Black Boy, White Boy,'' he stopped singing and
looked directly at me. ``I was good to you, wasn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure were, K-Doe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why are you trying to record my show?''
</P>
<P>
   I looked down at my lap: the recorder I had used to tape our
conversation was sitting there, though, of course, it hadn't been
turned on since the interview. Suddenly, the music stopped and Mrs.
K-Doe came roaring from behind the bar, demanding that the tape be
handed over. ``We aren't playing any more music until you give us
the tape,'' she shouted.
</P>
<P>
   I offered to let them hear the tape to prove that there was
nothing but interview on it. But Mrs. K-Doe wouldn't hear any of
it. And I wasn't going to relinquish the tape especially since it
included other interviews I had conducted in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock the door!'' she barked at a man who was either a
heavy-set regular or a security guard. ``Nobody's getting out of
here until he hands over the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff took an unexpected turn when Mrs. K-Doe called the
police. She screamed that they would force me to hand over the tape
as well as the film, because she had decided that she wanted the
film as well. As an R-and-B singer coming up in the '50s and '60s,
K-Doe was no doubt cheated out of his fair share from his music,
which may help explain why they thought I was trying to make a
bootleg of the show to sell for personal profit at some sort of
K-Doe black market swap meet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the K-Does had been extremely exhausted and busy the
weeks of Jazz Fest, with Mrs. K-Doe staying up all night to make
costumes and cook for her husband's concerts, parties and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of surreal negotiations outside the club with two
police officers (which included a search of the photographer's bag
for more K-Doe bootleg tapes), Mrs. K-Doe calmed down, and no
arrests were made. ``I'm sorry this misunderstanding happened,'' I
told her and pointed out to her that the article I intended to
write would let more people know about K-Doe and their bar.
</P>
<P>
   She barked back: ``This man is a legend. He doesn't need any
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's going to get it anyway, and don't let this tale
discourage you from dropping in. Take it from someone who will
probably never be allowed to enter the Mother-In-Law Lounge again,
my visits to New Orleans won't be the same without it.

SCI-FI DRAMAS AND LAUGHS FOR FOX'S NEW SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Making the most sweeping changes of any broadcast
network, Fox announced a new prime-time lineup for the next
television season Thursday that introduces seven dramas and two
comedies.
</P>
<P>
   The roster is heavy with new science fiction entries, one of
which Fox hopes will emerge as the replacement for ``The X-Files,''
which is now scheduled for what is presumably its last year after
its settlement this week with its creator, Chris Carter, and its
star, David Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny, whose Mulder character will be abducted by aliens in
Sunday's season finale, agreed after long negotiations to return
for half of the episodes next season. As part of the deal, Fox
settled Duchovny's lawsuit against the company. He had charged that
he was deprived of potential profits on the sales of the show's
repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny's partner, played by Gillian Anderson, will spend the
first part of next season hunting for Mulder, and then in the last
11 episodes they will be reunited, after which they will wind down
to a finale for the characters _ if not the series _ next May.
</P>
<P>
   Fox hopes that by then one of its new dramas will be ready to
fill the 9 p.m. Sunday spot. Carter has one entry in the
sweepstakes, ``The Lone Gunmen,'' a spinoff of ``The X-Files''
featuring a strange threesome of computer hackers: Langley, Byers
and Frohike. That series is one of two that Fox is announcing as
part of its fall schedule, even though they won't begin until
January.
</P>
<P>
   The other is simply being called ``The Michael Crichton
Project,'' and the writer of ``Jurassic Park'' is still working on
the script, with no details available yet.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Crichton and Carter, Fox has lined up other well-known
producers for its new shows, including David E. Kelley, James
Cameron, Gregg Hale (the creator of the ``Blair Witch Project''),
Darren Star and Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's show ``Boston Public'' is about the faculty at a public
high school in suburban Boston, the area where both of his other
shows, ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' are set. Kelley is so
highly regarded that he secured the spot on Monday leading into
``Ally McBeal,'' even though he has not shot a pilot for the new
show, which is not even cast yet.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, in his first effort since the phenomenally successful
``Titanic,'' has created a series called ``Dark Angel,'' a
futuristic thriller about a genetically enhanced teen-ager trying
to escape her military handlers in the Pacific Northwest in the
early 21st century. It stars Jessica Alba.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's ``Fearsum'' will be an overt attempt to scare the wits
out of viewers the way ``Blair Witch'' did. In this one, the
operator of an underground Web site discovers e-mail from his dead
brother and seeks to track him.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the sci-fi contenders has only a tangential
connection to a great producer. ``Night Visions'' clearly owes a
lot to the late Rod Serling in its effort to create a horror
anthology that recalls ``The Twilight Zone.'' The show promises
scary tales with bizarre twists.
</P>
<P>
   Star will not be competing with the terror entries, but his new
series, ``The Street,'' is intended to bring to mind his other hit,
HBO's ``Sex and the City.'' This is the male version, with a batch
of young turks from Wall Street on the prowl for money and women.
</P>
<P>
   The Carsey-Werner production company is behind Fox's
highest-profile new comedy, ``Don't Ask,'' in which John Goodman
returns to weekly television as Rex, a single father with
teen-agers who takes in the family of his irresponsible friend
David. What David doesn't know is that Rex is gay.
</P>
<P>
   The other new comedy is ``Schimmel,'' a vehicle for the stand-up
comedian David Schimmel, who plays a family man who cannot help
being startlingly abrasive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Fox schedule:
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: ``Boston Public,'' ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: ``That '70s Show,'' ``Titus,'' ``Dark Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: ``Don't Ask,'' ``Schimmel,'' ``The Street.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: Movies (until January), ``The Lone Gunmen''; The
Michael Crichton Project.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: ``Fearsum,'' ``Night Visions.''
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: ``Cops,'' ``Cops'' (repeats), ``America's Most
Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: ``Futurama,'' ``King of the Hill,'' ``The Simpsons,''
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' ``The X-Files.''

KNICKS-HEAT RIVALRY OUT FROM BEHIND RILEY SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Riley is finally saying it out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough's enough,'' he sighs. ``Twenty-two times. I'm tired of
looking at them. I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night will make 23. In each of the last four years,
Riley's Miami Heat have faced Jeff Van Gundy's New York Knicks in
the Eastern Conference playoffs. They went seven (the maximum) in
1997. They went five (the maximum) in 1998. They went five (the
maximum) in 1999. They have now gone five in 2000, and if history
holds up its end of the bargain, the Knicks will win in Madison
Square Garden and we will all jet back to Miami for another
winner-take-all affair in the American Airlines Arena Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After 22 games, the tally is 11-11. What more do you need to
know? Only this: in those 22 games, the visiting team has won 10.
Venue doesn't mean very much when veteran teams are so evenly
matched.
</P>
<P>
   It is fashionable to label the Miami-New York games as eyesores.
If you're a fan of up-tempo, easy-on-the-eyes basketball, their
games are not for you. In all this time, a team has broken 100 only
once, and then not by much (Miami, 101-90 in Game 7, 1999). The
composite average score of the 22 games is 89-79. Fast breaks not
emanating from turnovers lead the 11:00 news.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes these games really are tough on the eyes. Teams go
long stretches without scoring. There is often a lot of grunting,
groaning, and growling, but very little finesse. We know that the
Lakers and Trail Blazers are watching all this with contempt. Shaq
is already on record as saying nobody in the East remotely matches
up with either one of the Western finalists, and most observers
agree.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that one of these teams will soon be in the
Eastern Conference finals, and either has a very good chance of
taking out the Indiana-Philly survivor. The stakes are high, and
so, too, is the intensity level. For what we have here is nothing
less than the best legitimate old-time rivalry in professional
basketball, and perhaps in all of American professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   When it started three years ago, it was all about Pat Riley. The
New York fans framed it in terms of revenge against the coach who
had not only jilted the team, but who had classlessly done so by
fax. For all we know the Knick players and higher-ups likewise
approached the rivalry with Riley in mind.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for the rivalry to develop its own flavor.
The 1997 series featured the brawl, the disastrous suspensions
imposed on the New York players who left the bench and Miami taking
full advantage of the circumstance to overcome a 3-1 series
deficit. A year later the Knicks, down, 2-1, in a best-of-five, won
Game 4 in New York and Game 5 in Miami. Last year they slugged it
out in alternating fashion, with New York again prevailing in
Miami, this time on Allan Houston's Golden Bounce shot at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   It's another year later, and not much has changed. They're still
alternating victories, and we still have the same story lines.
There are intriguing matchups (e.g. Latrell Sprewell-Jamal
Mashburn, Houston-Dan Majerle and, of course, Patrick Ewing-Alonzo
Mourning). There are major injury concerns on both sides. There is
nightly discussion of turnovers, offensive rebounds, and finding a
way to get to the line.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the Riley factor overshadowed everything,
since both teams were perceived to be Riley creations. You don't
hear that so much anymore. People now know who Jeff Van Gundy is.
Sprewell and Marcus Camby have also been added to the mix. It's no
longer all about Riley.
</P>
<P>
   No, it happens to be about a growing mutual respect. The Knicks
and Heat have evolved into the Tony Zale-Rocky Graziano or Muhammad
Ali-Joe Frazier stage of their relationship. They now have a
tremendous shared history. The players may hate the other team as
an entity, but they no longer regard the individual players on the
opposing side as ogres. Each player knows that his compatriot on
the other side is a competitor. There isn't a player on either side
who has not bought into his coach's defensive phliosophy. These
guys are all too smart as athletes not to recognize what is going
on here. They all know that they are making NBA history now.
</P>
<P>
   We talk all the time about the lack of rivalries and the lack of
continuity in modern professional sport. So let's celebrate what we
have in the Knicks and Heat. They are engaged in an ongoing
relationship that now stacks up against the best of Boston and
Philly, Boston and LA, or the wonderfully spicy Boston-New York
rivalries of the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever this ends _ and doesn't logic call for a Game 7? _
expect to see a lot of hugging and hand-shaking and back-patting.
These players respect what each other stands for. It's all about
the true nobility of sports competition, whether the average final
score is 125-124 or 80-79. Pat Riley knows better than anybody. He
may be sick of looking at the Knicks, but he's not sick of the
competition. It is, in fact, what drives him.

A GREAT STOCK TRADER SAILS OFF, AT LEAST FOR THE SUMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley Shopkorn is sailing away from the stock
market. But you can bet he'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Shopkorn has been a masterful stock trader for
longer than many of today's money managers have been alive. He's
made money in bull markets and in bear markets. (He's also lost
money in both, but mostly he's been on the right side.)
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he helped save Wall Street in its darkest hour.
We'll get to that later.
</P>
<P>
   When word spread this week that Shopkorn was taking a sabbatical
_ he'll spend the summer cruising the Mediterranean with his wife;
his son, who is graduating from college; and his daughter, who is
finishing a graduate degree _ there was a tendency to assume
another star had been shot down by this year's crazy stock market.
But it evidently isn't so. Details on his performance are not
available, because he runs the equity part of the $10 billion in
hedge funds managed by Moore Capital, and those figures are not
broken out from overall returns, but he seems to have done all
right. This is not a case of a grizzled veteran who has lost touch
with the markets and now sits around blaming the markets for being
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   He's done well over the years in part because he usually has a
view about where the economy is heading and what the big market
theme is likely to be. But he also has a profound respect for the
markets, and an ability to read the screen _ we used to say read
the tape, but there is no tape anymore _ and sense when it isn't
wise to play a trend.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when he was running the block-trading desk
at Salomon Brothers, he made lots of money shorting oil stocks on
the way down after they reached historic levels of overvaluation.
More recently, he did well buying such stocks, and he still thinks
that companies specializing in oil and gas exploration are cheap,
and that the price of natural gas is headed up. He got on the
technology bandwagon early, and he thinks that game is not over,
although future rallies are likely to be more selective in terms of
quality. He hopes, but is not certain, that the Federal Reserve
will be able to arrange an economic soft landing that will not
devastate markets.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkorn will reassess his future come fall. In the meantime,
he'll leave some of his money in funds run by people he trusts, and
put the rest in short-term Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   His finest hour came on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after Black
Monday, when the Dow industrials fell 23 percent. An early rally
faded, and the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in stock
after stock as sell orders poured in. Fear abounded, and it seemed
likely that America's financial markets were about to close for
lack of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Shopkorn, the head trader at Salomon, took a
call from Robert Mnuchin, his counterpart at Goldman, Sachs. They
agreed that the two firms _ then the most powerful ones in stock
trading _ would provide the money to reopen stocks that had halted.
Within minutes of that word being sent to the Big Board floor, the
market began to rally. You can't prove that decision was crucial to
ending the crash, but I believe it was.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday I asked Shopkorn why he had decided to risk Salomon's
capital at just that point. The trader wasn't about to admit to
being a good Samaritan. ``I thought we were making a good market
play,'' he said. ``We thought that it would bounce, and that people
just needed capital.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he paused. ``We thought we were helping the system as
well,'' he said.

BUSH'S ADMAN-IN-CHIEF SAYS DO NOT BE FOOLED BY NICE-GUY REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The words echo across the highly suspect
political road of good intentions. ``We're not going to run that
kind of race,'' insisted Stuart Stevens, one of Gov. George W.
Bush's advertising men. ``Tonally, we will run another kind of
race.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore campaign does get vicious, the Bush men say, it
won't be because the mud was slung first from Austin. ``They're
planning on running a mean, nasty, negative race,'' said Stevens'
colleague, Russell Schriefer.
</P>
<P>
   That view was repeated in the agency's headquarters here as if
it were a mantra: ``Gore has always run negative campaigns,'' said
Mark McKinnon, the Bush camp's adman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   To which Stevens added, ``They would take offense if you accused
them of running a positive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing do the members of Maverick Media, the
organization assembled for the express goal of cultivating Bush's
appeal on radio and television, operate out of a basement warren of
offices they call ``the bunker'': The first steady, 30-second
barrages of the general election have not even been set off yet,
and already the Bush message people are crying ``foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, it's reminiscent of the primary campaign, during
which the major candidates of both parties were accusing one
another of running low-down, dirty commercials, when, for the most
part, the spots were fairly tame.
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-emptive protests may also indicate a certain
jitteriness among the half-dozen principal members of the Maverick
team, some of whom are working on a national presidential media
campaign for the first time. There is inside the bunker the air of
a group of well-mannered folks who have stumbled into the toughest
neighborhood in town.
</P>
<P>
   In a cutthroat business, McKinnon is admired for his decency:
``He's known for running very fair campaigns,'' said John Weaver,
political director of the McCain campaign. But when the opposition
consists of the likes of Carter Eskew and Robert Shrum, veteran
media strategists for Vice President Al Gore who have
take-no-prisoners reputations, the question arises: Does Bush need
a team that plays by the Marquess of Queensberry's rules, or Mike
Tyson's? Can Maverick avoid the errors in Bill Bradley's political
advertising, which never adequately answered Gore's incessant
criticisms of Bradley's policies?
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, in fact, acknowledges he would much rather paint a
portrait than have to slash someone else's: ``It's much more
powerful and compelling to create a positive vision than it is to
tear somebody down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sensibility is reflected in many of the spots McKinnon
creates for Bush, warm-and-fuzzy images reminiscent of the upbeat
spots for Ronald Reagan. The McKinnon style is more documentary;
the innovation Maverick introduced in the primaries was the ``crash
ad,'' filmed, edited and on the air in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   And his spots feature lots of shimmering boilerplate: shots of
Bush wading into smiling crowds, posed in dazzling sunshine with
his wife, Laura, or offering his family-sampler takes on
heart-tugging issues. ``I believe every child can learn,'' he said
in one education spot.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon and company know they cannot run a general-election
campaign on happy talk; indeed, alongside the sunny spots, groups
and individuals allied with Bush ran some of the harshest
commercials of the primaries, including attack ads that portrayed
Sen. John McCain as an enemy of the environment and breast cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   And the question of tone is not their only challenge. Although
Bush is an immensely likable candidate, questions about his grasp
of foreign affairs and other issues could be magnified in
comparisons with Gore, and some political observers wonder if
Maverick will be able to fill in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the hard thing,'' said Paul Begala, a former adviser to
President Clinton who has known and liked McKinnon since their days
together at the University of Texas. ``Mark's greatest strength is
style, and Bush has a style that meshes well with Mark's. In small
settings Bush is very charming: the most charming politician to
come down the pike since Clinton. Mark does an excellent job of
capturing that. But at the end of the day there is no filter that
can be put on a camera to add gray matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of depth is clearly one of the candidate's most
vexing image problems. The governor's media advisers, though,
maintain that such doubts about Bush exist in a land where pundits
reside, but not the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the fall of last year to address substance,'' McKinnon
said. ``The rap on us that we don't have issues, or substance, was
effectively addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in a windowless conference room ringed with television
sets, the affable McKinnon would not be coaxed into a meditation on
any of Bush's perceived weaknesses. If it seemed a function of a
political advertising man's natural inclination to project only the
bright side, it also reflected what those who know him say is
McKinnon's genuine belief in Bush, a deep and abiding affection
characteristic of those in the governor's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston, for whom McKinnon made
commercials in all three of his successful mayoral campaigns, says
that there can be only one explanation for McKinnon's signing up:
``If he's supporting George Bush, it's because he thinks George
Bush would make a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are conventional routes to becoming commercial-maker to
this potential president, McKinnon did not take them. For one
thing, he climbed the wrong ladder: He was a longtime Democratic
media strategist before signing up with Bush, working on the
campaigns of, among others, former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas
and former Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McKinnon, a Colorado-born musician who in his younger
days was invited to Nashville, Tenn., to write songs for Kris
Kristofferson, had dropped out of politics entirely by the time he
fell into a long conversation with Bush at a dinner in Austin in
1997. The year before, McKinnon confessed in a most public way _ a
first person article for Texas Monthly _ that after 15 years of
politics, he was burned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I got tired of candidates' asking me what their firmly
held convictions should be,'' he wrote. ``Maybe I got tired of
accusing opponents of being right-wing extremists who wanted to cut
Social Security benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   At that Austin dinner, though, McKinnon's head was turned. Bush
seemed to him to evince an honest interest in education, an issue
dear to McKinnon; he was making a documentary about the
inspirational founder of a Houston charter school. ``I was amazed,
blown away, by how much attention he paid,'' McKinnon said of the
governor, and before long he had signed up to handle media in
Bush's 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon did not win friends among Texas Democrats for his
defection; he is unfazed. ``What does it say about me, my values?''
he asked. ``I think what attracted me to him is what is going to
attract a lot of independents and Democrats. I came to the
conclusion that in the end, good politics is about good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and rivals alike say personal attachment is a
characteristic of McKinnon; Lanier recalled that once McKinnon
moved into his home for a few weeks, ``to get a flavor so that his
ads would have a genuine-ness to them, so that I'd be comfortable
saying the words.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a reputation for not going for the jugular. ``I
can't recall any campaign where I've worked against him where he
even got close to crossing the line,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   That is high praise from a McCain aide, considering how
aggrieved his boss felt by some of the commercials Bush ran in
South Carolina. The Bush campaign had been expecting the most
intense media battering to come from the campaign of another
primary-election opponent, Steve Forbes, but it was McCain who
surprised Bush with the harder hitting commercials, including a New
Hampshire spot in which McCain said Bush's tax cuts would mostly
benefit the wealthy. Some of Bush's advisers believe their failure
to answer the commercial was a major factor in their sobering early
loss in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed to learn from their mistakes in South Carolina.
In one of the most effective media moves of the primary season,
Bush was able to turn McCain's clean-campaign vows against him. In
a spot shot at a fishing camp in South Carolina, a serious-looking
Bush responded to a now-famous McCain commercial in which the
senator accused the governor of twisting the truth, ``like
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disagree with me, fine,'' Bush intoned in his reply ad. ``But
do not challenge my integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a subtle and successful lesson in the art of the
double-negative commercial: suggest that an opponent was unworthy
because he said something mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we ran that ad, the numbers moved,'' said Matthew
Dowd, another member of the Maverick team. In fact, it worked so
well that it was used in states where McCain had not even run his
own advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark made the best ad of the primaries when Bush looked into
the camera and said, `He compared me to Clinton,''' said Begala,
now a commentator on CNBC's ``Equal Time.'' ``It gave Bush carte
blanche to turn his guns on McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Vast amounts of money will be spent on political commercials at
all levels this year _ $600 million, according to the Television
Bureau of Advertising _ and a lot of it by the Bush and Gore
campaigns. Commercials in Spanish will be more prevalent than ever
before: For instance, Maverick has its own unit headed by the San
Antonio-based team of Lionel Sosa and Luis Garcia to create spots
targeted for Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McKinnon does not think the 2000 election will be decided
inside the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe there are so many other facets in the campaign
that are so much more important,'' he said. ``The media, the free
press, is the wind that fills the sails. The advertising acts as a
rudder, to steer a little bit.''

TV STATION IN A BIND AFTER SELECTING `DR. LAURA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On one side are angry gay activists who insist that
radio talk-show host Laura Schlessinger, known as ``Dr. Laura,''
shouldn't be granted a TV platform to air views they see as
dangerous to gay people.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are free-speech advocates who worry that there
may also be a danger _ of censorship _ in the efforts to block
Schlessinger's syndicated TV talk program.
</P>
<P>
   Caught squarely in the middle is WCVB-TV (Channel 5), which
didn't anticipate the controversy now engulfing it when the station
agreed to air Schlessinger's show this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond Boston, there are growing signs of trouble for the
outspoken talk-show host. Procter &AMP; Gamble, one of the largest and
most powerful advertisers on television, decided this week to pull
its ads from her upcoming TV show. Then Thursday, United Airlines
announced it would drop ads for her radio show from its in-flight
magazine because of her remarks about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 5 got a flurry of phone calls Thursday, a slight
majority of them opposing Schlessinger, after the Globe reported
that Channel 5 is now uncertain whether it wants to air ``Dr.
Laura'' after all. No such uncertainty afflicts those who weighed
in Thursday in the dispute over Schlessinger, who has referred to
homosexuality as ``deviant'' behavior and a ``biological error''
for which ``reparative therapy'' is advisable.
</P>
<P>
   To Boston attorney and First Amendment specialist Andrew Good,
the issue is Channel 5's responsibility, as a federally licensed
broadcaster, to present ``a wide range of views, including
controversial views.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's protected speech,'' said Good. ``What (critics) are
saying is, `I don't want to hear it, and I don't want anyone else
to hear it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But to Steve Spurgeon of the Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation, which is leading a national campaign to get TV stations
to drop the show, the issue is that her ``defamatory rhetoric''
creates the belief that gays ``can be dismissed as `errors.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has a First Amendment right to a television show,''
said Spurgeon. ``It's about the platform that she gets. I daresay
if you insert any other minority slur of your choice in the
references she makes to gays and lesbians, no one would be talking
about the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger did not respond Thursday to a request for comment,
and officials of Paramount Television Group, the production company
behind ``Dr. Laura,'' could not be reached. In March, Schlessinger
said she was sorry that ``words that I have used in a clinical
context have been perceived as judgment.'' Paramount has previously
pledged to explore social issues on the show without ``contributing
to an environment of hurt, hate or intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth A. Cheng, Channel 5's director of programming, said
the station has still not decided among three options: not airing
Schlessinger's TV program, relegating it to a less prominent time
slot, or airing it in a high-profile morning slot as originally
intended.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng said the station believes that choosing not to carry the
program ``is an option that we have as a broadcaster.'' However,
the station does have a one-year deal with Paramount Television
Group, which could seek to enforce its contract with Channel 5.
Losing a station in Boston, the No. 6 TV market in the country,
would be a blow to the show.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the legal questions, Channel 5 is in an extremely awkward
position in terms of public relations. Known for its liberal
editorial positions, with a record of, in Cheng's words, ``being a
friend to the gay and lesbian community,'' the station now runs the
risk of antagonizing that community, along with other viewers who
may find Schlessinger's views offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Schlessinger also has many fans, who would likely take a dim
view of Channel 5 if the station pulled the plug on her show. Cheng
noted that the show Paramount promised was one that focused on
family life. ``Do we agree with some of the things she is purported
to have said? No,'' said Cheng. ``But that's not what the show is
about. It's not about gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng acknowledged that ``it gives us pause'' to see Procter &AMP;
Gamble bailing out, but said viewer response will be the key
factor. ``We're very in tune, we're very concerned, we're going to
be very judicious in this,'' she said. ``We're keeping an eye on
it, and we're going to listen to our viewers.'' Cheng declined to
say how much Channel 5 will pay to run the program.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment has run 2-1 against Schlessinger in the more than 100
calls, letters, and e-mails Channel 5 has gotten in the past two
weeks, according to Channel 5 spokeswoman Caroline Waddell.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Montgomery, one of the organizers of a protest planned
for Wednesday at the Park Street MBTA station, said Channel 5's
reputation is on the line. ``For me, this isn't about Dr. Laura (as
much as) it's about the local community and Channel 5,'' said
Montgomery. ``When the `Chet and Natalie station' is showing `Dr.
Laura,' it adds a certain imprimatur.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Spurgeon, GLAAD has met with executives at seven of
the largest TV stations that plan to air the new show, and asked
them not to air it. Several have expressed ``concern'' about airing
the show, he said. The group is also slated to meet with
representatives of Channel 5.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some people have already formed an opinion on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just trash,'' said Wendy Kaminer, a fellow at the
Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. ``It's the ravings of a
highly prejudiced woman. She's not a `doctor.' She's a pop
psychologist. And as far as I'm concerned, not a very responsible
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Arline Isaacson, cochair of the Massachusetts Gay &AMP; Lesbian
Political Caucus, argued that ``much of what (Schlessinger) says is
hate speech, whether she intends it that way or not.'' Isaacson
asked: ``Why in the world would a respectable television station
want to taint their reputation for respectable discussion by
providing a forum for egregious bigotry?''
</P>
<P>
   But others said foes are walking a slippery slope of censorship
in trying to deny Schlessinger a TV platform, and noted it might
pave the way for efforts by other groups to stifle shows whose
content they find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Chieppo of the Pioneer Institute for Public Policy
Research, while saying he doesn't agree with Schlessinger's views
on gay issues, added: ``I don't think we want to be in a situation
where anyone who espouses views that are not popular in a
particular area, that those views are censored.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcry from gay organizations is the latest example of
advocacy groups weighing in to sway decisions on the nation's most
powerful medium. Last year, the NAACP blasted the major TV networks
for a lack of diversity in prime time, and won pledges of more
diverse casts, writers and producers. When ``Ellen'' star Ellen
DeGeneres took her character (and herself) out of the closet in
1997, ABC was denounced by Moral Majority leader Rev. Jerry Falwell
and other Protestant ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In general, television has become more receptive to gay themes
in the last couple of years. Programs like NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace''
and the WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' feature gay characters in leading
roles, prompting relatively little outcry, especially compared to
the ``Ellen'' controversy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   By 1963, the push for civil rights had turned parts of America
into a battlefield. From 1940 through the 1960s, more than 50
bombings shook the city of Birmingham, Ala., according to FBI
files. No one died until Sept. 15, 1963, when dynamite planted
under the 16th Street Baptist Church exploded, killing four black
girls _ Denise McNair, 11, Addie Mae Collins, 14, Carole Robertson,
14, and Cynthia Wesley, 14.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing's message seemed clear: There would be no peace. The
country might lean toward racial equality _ the March on Washington
had been only weeks before _ but some people were determined to
burn progress to the ground. The name Birmingham became a synonym
for tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1977 that Robert Chambliss was tried and
convicted of murder for the bombing deaths. Authorities believed
three other men were also involved, but couldn't make a convincing
case. One of them died in 1994. This week, authorities lifted the
case from history books, charging Thomas E. Blanton and Bobby Frank
Cherry with murder.
</P>
<P>
   This merciful step toward closure still dredges up old grief and
weariness. It is a grotesque failure of humanity when children end
up as casualties in a just campaign. It is painful but important to
tell today's children of this historic assault that happened less
than a lifetime ago.
</P>
<P>
   Months before the bombing, Martin Luther King warned that
violence could profoundly disrupt the country, making people
sacrifice the fight for equality in order to achieve ``the absence
of tension.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Letter from Birmingham Jail,'' dated April 16, 1963,
King wrote: ``I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that
the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is
not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the
white moderate, who is more devoted to `order' than to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, it is still too soon to rest, to declare the work
of civil rights done. But these new arrests show a country bravely
struggling for order _ as long as it is based on justice.

NEW PRIMARY CALENDAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee deserves credit for taking on
a threat to the presidential selection process that is both
difficult and all too real: the truncated primary season.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis last week, the RNC's Rules Committee voted for a
new calendar under which primaries would be held on four dates from
February to May, with the small states going first.
</P>
<P>
   This is designed to stretch out the campaign, giving challengers
a better chance of becoming contenders. It would be a considerable
improvement over the current system, which gave the nation its
major-party candidates on March 7 this year _ far too early and
after very limited competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plan has several flaws in concept and implementation.
The proposal advanced for more than a year by the national
secretaries of state, for four regional primaries, would likely
prove superior, though it has problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   One serious drawback of the GOP plan is that it contains no
provision to keep Iowa and New Hampshire first. These two states
have proven ability to listen to candidates and to turn out voters.
Without an exemption for Iowa and New Hampshire, the GOP plan would
likely guarantee the nomination to the most heavily funded
candidate, since others could not compete effectively in more than
a dozen jurisdictions at once.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is how the GOP would coerce the states into
adopting its calendar. Severe penalties, such as reducing
delegations by half or more for those states that go early, would
generate powerful opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The secretaries, by contrast, have attempted to get states to
adopt their plan voluntarily, by passing model legislation. The
regional approach would avoid situations that occur in the GOP
plan, by which, for instance, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and
Massachusetts would vote in separate months.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP may improve the plan in time for its national convention
this summer. In any event, the Republican Party is showing better
citizenship than the Democrats, who have callously settled for the
discredited status quo.

DEAF MECHANIC DISPUTES UNITED'S DECISION TO GIVE HIM JOB

<P>
   BOSTON _ Being deaf hasn't kept John ``Skipper'' Sprague from
flying planes, riding motorcycles, or graduating from college. And
it didn't stop United Airlines from offering him a job as an
aircraft mechanic at Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But after United's upper management in San Francisco learned a
deaf mechanic was being hired in Boston, the company quickly
withdrew its job offer -- insisting that it wasn't safe for Sprague
to be out on the tarmac at a busy airport.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sprague, 38, an experienced aircraft mechanic who now
works for another airline, fought back, testifying in federal court
about the devastation of reaching his ultimate career goal, only to
be told he couldn't do the job because he was deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just can't see from my own background experience what I'm
capable of doing,'' said Sprague, 38, of Grafton, using sign
language as an interpreter stood in the middle of the courtroom,
translating. ``I was on cloud nine when they offered me the job and
then totally crashed when they withdrew it. I feel like I need to
stand and fight for this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague's wife, Susan, and his two daughters, Danielle, 10, and
Lauren, 8, who are also deaf, sat in the spectator section,
offering smiles of encouragement and following the testimony
through the interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague is suing United Airlines for discrimination under the
Americans with Disabilities Act. He is urging US District Judge
George A. O'Toole Jr., who is presiding over the non-jury trial, to
order United to give him the job at Logan.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 18, 1997 letter to Sprague that came just 10 days
after he had been offered the aircraft mechanic's job at Logan, a
United official rescinded the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a sincere effort was taken to make an accommodation on
your behalf, further reveiw by higher management determined this
could not be done related to safety issues,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, United gave Sprague a job as a shop mechanic in San
Francisco, working indoors on engine parts. After 15 months of
commuting home to his family every weekend, Sprague said he quit
when he realized the company would never give him a chance to work
at Logan. Today, he works as an aircraft mechanic for AirTran in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial began last week, attorney Douglas Dexter, who
represents United, told the judge that the company didn't believe
Sprague could communicate with the air traffic tower or with other
mechanics and pilots and feared his deafness could pose a serious
problem in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprague recounted how United officials seemed impressed by
his accomplishments during his job interviews. He earned a degree
in aircraft maintenance from Wentworth Institute in Boston, is
certified as an aircraft mechanic by the Federal Aviation
Administration, and worked on planes at the municipal airport in
East Taunton for 13 years before applying to United. He also has a
pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, who uses two digital hearing aids, said he can hear
aircraft noise. He communicates on the noisy tarmac through hand
gestures and with a pager that sends written messages within
seconds. He also uses the pager to send e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying earlier in the trial were two deaf aviation
mechanics, one who works on military aircraft in Jacksonville,
Florida, for the US Department of Defense, and the other who works
for Southwest Airlines in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sprague's co-workers and former supervisors also took
the stand to attest to his reputation as an excellent mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jane Alper, who represents Sprague, asked him, ``Is
there anything that other AirTran mechanics are able to do that you
are not able to do because of your hearing loss?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague said he met with Don Nielsen, a United official, in San
Francisco back in 1997 and urged him to reconsider hiring him at
Logan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke using my own voice,'' Sprague testified. ``I said, `If
I work with you one or two days, I will get to know you and you
will get to know me, and we will get to work together as a team.
Everything will go smoothly.' ''

<P>
   Alan Greenspan faces complicated crosswinds as he and the
Federal Reserve raise interest rates to keep the economy from
overheating. Tuesday's half-percent increase in the federal funds
rate, to 6.5 percent, put it at a level not seen since 1991. Many
forecasters believe it is not the final hike, because it may not
have much impact on the exuberance that has troubled Greenspan for
so long. But other issues, domestic and international, will have to
play a role in Federal Reserve thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on Europe is high on the list. Rising interest rates
affect more than the willingness to borrow in private markets to
finance expansion. High interest rates make the dollar more
attractive in international currency exchange markets, and the
dollar's strength against the euro, Europe's new multinational
currency, is impressive. The euro, which was valued at about $1.18
when launched at the start of 1999, tumbled as low as 87 cents. A
brief rally from that figure ran into fresh trouble right after the
Federal Reserve's action.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's fall has perplexed observers. The European economy is
strong except for a high unemployment rate _ over 10 percent _ but
the social effect has been dampened by unemployment compensation
and other support programs. Inflation is low. Efficiency is
gradually improving. But the European Central Bank has been
reluctant to raise interest rates, still below 4 percent, to help
bolster the euro. This makes imports, more expensive for Europeans
_ complicating life for American exporters at a time when chronic
trade deficits are a worrying factor.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's policy has been an attempt to address problems like
inflation before they occur. At some point, higher rates will slow
down the American economy and impact others around the world as
well. The danger, especially with stock markets still at levels
that could spawn selling and disturb consumer and business
psychology, is that a downturn might be fairly sharp. Better to
ease up on the constraints before that occurs than after; it is
harder to restart an economy than to slow it down.

TRIMBLE CANCELS UNIONIST VOTE ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a setback to the Northern Ireland peace process that
was resurrected just two weeks ago, Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble canceled Thursday plans to have his party vote Saturday on
returning to a power-sharing local government with Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said he needs more time to sell his skeptical followers
on the idea of rejoining the government in return for the Irish
Republican Army's promise on May 6 to allow its hidden arsenal to
be inspected by international observers.
</P>
<P>
   While the Irish and British governments sought to downplay the
significance of the postponement, it was a sharp blow to optimism
that had swept Northern Ireland after the IRA made its surprise
offer to let international arms inspectors verify that its secret
arms dumps are sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Britain had planned to restore the power-sharing government on
Monday. In February, over the objections of the Irish government,
Peter Mandelson, the British government's top official for Northern
Ireland, suspended the home rule assembly after just 72 days when
unionists vowed to walk out because the IRA had refused to turn in
any of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Initially furious, Sinn Fein officials softened their stance
when they learned that Trimble had publicly backed accepting the
IRA's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator and a former IRA
chief of staff, said, ``I welcome this positive recommendation from
David Trimble, that he is prepared to go for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Ulster Unionist sources denied they were stalling in an
attempt to win more concessions, such as preventing changes to the
name and badge of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the overwhelmingly
Protestant police force that is to be fundamentally reformed under
the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 that grew out of the peace
process. The Unionists, who seek to keep Northern Ireland as part
of the United Kingdom, said Trimble is convinced the IRA's offer
marks a genuine confidence-building gesture, even though it falls
short of the unionist demand that the IRA hand over some weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble told Ulster Television that he had won unspecified
concessions from the British on police reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is only appropriate that we take time to speak to
the community, to speak to the party, and for people to have the
opportunity of making an informed decision,'' Trimble said. ``We
have now made a degree of progress, so I believe that we can meet
the concerns of those in the party and the community who want to
see a fair deal on policing.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as the IRA's refusal to turn in or destroy any of its
weapons is driven in large part by a desire to avoid a potentially
bloody split in the organization, Trimble is also at pains to avoid
splitting his party, the largest in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   There are deep divisions within the 850-member Ulster Unionist
Council, the party's decision-making body. Among that number is a
sizeable minority that has always been opposed to the Good Friday
Agreement, the compromise between pro-British unionists and
pro-Irish nationalists that is aimed at ending a 30-year conflict
that has killed some 3,500 and maimed tens of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Trimble got the support of just 58 percent of the
council for his decision to form a power-sharing government that
included Sinn Fein before the IRA began disarming. Trimble sold the
compromise on the premise that, once two Sinn Fein members were
part of the government's 12-member cabinet, the IRA would begin
disarming, or at least declare uneqivocally that its war was over.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRA and Sinn Fein objected when Trimble unilaterally set
a Feb. 12 deadline for the IRA to disarm or or at least pledge to
begin. Trimble said the deadline it was the only way he could get
his council to back the compromise, and both sides dug in their
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government had functioned smoothly and largely
without rancor for 72 days, Mandelson suspended it, saying the
action would make it easier to restore the power-sharing government
than if the unionists walked out and collapsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's vulnerability in his own party was underscored in late
March when just 57 percent of the party council voted for Trimble
in the face of a leadership challenge by a 68-year-old Presbyterian
minister, Martin Smyth, a vehement opponent of the Good Friday
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While Irish nationalists of all stripes seem to accept that the
IRA can only go so far, they are less understanding of Trimble's
difficulties, and are especially critical of the British
government's efforts to shore up Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the moderate Social Democratic, and Labor Party and
the Irish government have all insisted this week that the British
government cannot unilaterally water down the proposed reform of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary as a sop to the unionists, even if
that sop was just to relent on changing the name or badge of the
force.

FOREIGN POLICY MISCHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acting as the presumptive Republican presidential candidate,
George W. Bush properly chastized senators of his own party for
backing a provision in a military spending bill that would have set
a deadline of July 1, 2001, for withdrawal of US troops from
Kosovo. Fortunately, the amendment was defeated in a Senate vote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On substance, the amendment was bad policy. In a lucid warning
about the folly of legislating what she called a ``premature''
withdrawal from Kosovo, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
cautioned Wednesday that senators supporting the measure were
``playing with fire.'' Albright was not indulging in hyperbole when
she said: ``In the Balkans, signs of impatience can be
misinterpreted as symptoms of weakness. We cannot afford that in a
region where weakness attracts vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with justification, also objected to the measure on the
grounds that it distorts the balance of executive and legislative
powers in a matter of foreign policy. A statement issued by the
Bush campaign said: ``Governor Bush views it as an executive
overreach on powers of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Bush's intervention noteworthy is that it illuminates
the point at which a tussle over constitutional prerogatives
intersects with partisan politics. Many Republicans in Congress
have taken out their political enmity toward President Clinton by
seeking to thwart foreign and security policies of his
administration. Arms control treaties have been rejected, funds for
the United Nations withheld, and peacekeeping obligations
short-changed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Kosovo deadline, the Senate is proposing to cut $1.7
billion in foreign spending, including a senseless reduction of
funds for destroying Russian nuclear warheads and a 35 percent cut
in a program to help provide North Korea with energy _ part of a
crucial deal to reward Pyongyang for halting its nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should certainly defend its power of the purse. But
Bush has done the country a favor by reminding the Senate that a
delicate balance must be preserved between the White House and
Congress in foreign policy and that an excess of partisan mischief
can harm the national interest.

 &HT;    CLINTON INTENSIFIES CAMPAIGN FOR CHINA TRADE BILL: 'WE'VE STILL
GOT A ... FIGHT'
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Locked in his biggest trade fight in seven years,
President Clinton on Thursday hauled out Washington's most
authoritative economic voice _ that of Fed chairman Alan Greenspan
_ to add gravitas to the White House push for strengthening
commercial ties with China.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's proposal facing a do-or-die vote next week in a
sharply divided U.S. House of Representatives, the president also
plans to appeal directly to the American people for support in a
televised address from the Oval Office Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lobbied a handful of undeclared House members on the
issue Thursday after he signed into law two bills aimed at
strengthening U.S. trade ties with African and Caribbean nations.
He met privately with several members of the Congressional Black
Caucus _ where Clinton hopes to pick up four or five votes on the
China issue _ but the White House press office had no further
details on the meetings late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained hopeful, though, of persuading as many as a
dozen undeclared House Democrats to support his China initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Clinton wants Congress to approve so-called
permanent normal trade relations, or PNTR, for China. That would
end a 20-year practice by which Congress extends favorable trade
terms _ virtually unfettered access to the rich U.S. market _ to
China on a year-by-year basis.
</P>
<P>
   PNTR is seen by Clinton as an essential compliment to China's
agreement last November to reduce impediments to its fast-growing
market in exchange for membership _ as early as this fall _ in the
135-nation World Trade Organization, or WTO, the Geneva-based court
of global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of House members scheduled a press conference for
Friday morning to announce their support for PNTR. It is Clinton's
highest-stakes trade initiative since he won support from a
reluctant Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or
NAFTA, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although privately, some administration officials and their
congressional allies were optimistic about the vote, other
supporters remained publicly cautious, saying they still lack the
218 affirmative votes needed for House passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum is building,'' for PNTR, Clinton said, ``but we've
still got a challenging fight.''
</P>
<P>
   To help press his case, Clinton invited Greenspan to stand by
his side before White House reporters Thursday morning in the Rose
Garden, where the influential Federal Reserve Board chairman gave
his unqualified endorsement to the president's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome of the debate on permanent normal trade relations
with China will have profound implications for the free world's
trading system and the long-term growth potential of the American
economy,'' Greenspan said. ``I believe extending PNTR to China, and
full participation by China in the WTO, is in the interest of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the economic benefits, deepening and extending
commercial relations between the United States and China ``will be
a far stronger vehicle'' for promoting individual rights and
respect for the rule of law in China, Greenspan said, ``than any
other alternative of which I am aware.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of internal debate, the White House announced
Thursday morning that Clinton would make a nationally televised
address on the China deal. But CBS and ABC said Thursday they will
not carry the speech, despite the White House request. NBC will air
a live broadcast of the five-minute address, as will CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And, said White House aides, former President Jimmy Carter has
been working the phones on Clinton's behalf, telling more than a
half-dozen undecided Democrats that strengthening U.S.-China trade
ties will help promote human rights and democratic reform in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked if he would help in making some calls to some key
congressional folks, which he did,'' said Carter's spokeswoman,
Carrie Harmon. ``He does feel strongly about the China trade
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions run high, as well, for opponents of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that knitting the U.S. and Chinese economies more
closely together will drive down wages and job opportunities for
American workers. Others contend the increased commerce with China
only emboldens the ruling Communist Party, and discourages
political reform and attention to human rights concerns. Still
others contend that China is bent on a strategy of exporting, but
not importing, large volumes of goods, an argument buttressed by
the lopsided U.S.-China trade gap _ $69 billion last year alone, in
China's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think public opinion clearly understands that it is not wise
to give the 'Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' to a regime which
has time and time again proven itself deficient in terms of human
rights, labor concerns and environmental concerns,'' House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters Thursday on Capitol
Hill. ``This is a fundamental issue of fairness and human rights
and freedom and decency, and it's a tough issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has vowed to oppose the bill when it comes up for a
House vote as early as next Wednesday. Gephardt predicted a close
vote, as do White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is slated for a June vote in the Senate, where
it is expected to pass easily.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed into law Thursday the Trade and Development Act
of 2000, passed by Congress last week. The legislation included two
separate bills _ the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and the
U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act _ as well as a handful
of other trade-related provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The main acts, though, reduced U.S. barriers to imports from
Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the event to press further for House approval next
week of PNTR for China, saying that surging imports have been one
factor in the country's nine-year economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our exports and our open markets have given us the longest
expansion in our history, with low inflation,'' Clinton said.
``This bill reaffirms that position, and I hope it will be
reaffirmed next week, when Congress votes on permanent normal trade
relations with China.''

</P>
<P>
   A handful of House members scheduled a press conference for
Friday morning to announce their support for PNTR. It is Clinton's
highest-stakes trade initiative since he won support from a
reluctant Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or
NAFTA, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although privately, some administration officials and their
congressional allies were optimistic about the vote, other
supporters remained publicly cautious, saying they still lack the
218 affirmative votes needed for House passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum is building,'' for PNTR, Clinton said, ``but we've
still got a challenging fight.''
</P>
<P>
   To help press his case, Clinton invited Greenspan to stand by
his side before White House reporters Thursday morning in the Rose
Garden, where the influential Federal Reserve Board chairman gave
his unqualified endorsement to the president's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome of the debate on permanent normal trade relations
with China will have profound implications for the free world's
trading system and the long-term growth potential of the American
economy,'' Greenspan said. ``I believe extending PNTR to China, and
full participation by China in the WTO, is in the interest of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the economic benefits, deepening and extending
commercial relations between the United States and China ``will be
a far stronger vehicle'' for promoting individual rights and
respect for the rule of law in China, Greenspan said, ``than any
other alternative of which I am aware.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of internal debate, the White House announced
Thursday morning that Clinton would make a nationally televised
address on the China deal. But CBS and ABC said Thursday they will
not carry the speech, despite the White House request. NBC will air
a live broadcast of the five-minute address, as will CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And, said White House aides, former President Jimmy Carter has
been working the phones on Clinton's behalf, telling more than a
half-dozen undecided Democrats that strengthening U.S.-China trade
ties will help promote human rights and democratic reform in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked if he would help in making some calls to some key
congressional folks, which he did,'' said Carter's spokeswoman,
Carrie Harmon. ``He does feel strongly about the China trade
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions run high, as well, for opponents of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that knitting the U.S. and Chinese economies more
closely together will drive down wages and job opportunities for
American workers. Others contend the increased commerce with China
only emboldens the ruling Communist Party, and discourages
political reform and attention to human rights concerns. Still
others contend that China is bent on a strategy of exporting, but
not importing, large volumes of goods, an argument buttressed by
the lopsided U.S.-China trade gap _ $69 billion last year alone, in
China's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think public opinion clearly understands that it is not wise
to give the 'Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' to a regime which
has time and time again proven itself deficient in terms of human
rights, labor concerns and environmental concerns,'' House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters Thursday on Capitol
Hill. ``This is a fundamental issue of fairness and human rights
and freedom and decency, and it's a tough issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has vowed to oppose the bill when it comes up for a
House vote as early as next Wednesday. Gephardt predicted a close
vote, as do White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is slated for a June vote in the Senate, where
it is expected to pass easily.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed into law Thursday the Trade and Development Act
of 2000, passed by Congress last week. The legislation included two
separate bills _ the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and the
U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act _ as well as a handful
of other trade-related provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The main acts, though, reduced U.S. barriers to imports from
Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the event to press further for House approval next
week of PNTR for China, saying that surging imports have been one
factor in the country's nine-year economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our exports and our open markets have given us the longest
expansion in our history, with low inflation,'' Clinton said.
``This bill reaffirms that position, and I hope it will be
reaffirmed next week, when Congress votes on permanent normal trade
relations with China.''

&HT;     CHINESE DISSIDENTS OPPOSE TRADE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About 60 exiled Chinese dissident leaders joined
several Democratic House members Thursday to oppose a controversial
bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China. They said
more trade would only make China's communist government richer and
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Without freedom, ``the money you give to China all goes to
dictators,'' said Richard Long, an exiled activist from Beijing who
now publishes an e-mail political newsletter here. ``The people
don't benefit,'' added Long, speaking at a news conference on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Roeder, spokeswoman for Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., a
leading supporter of the permanent trade deal, called Long's claim
``ridiculous.'' She said that under the new agreement American
entrepreneurs would be freer ``to be directly in touch with the
Chinese people (and not) have to go through the Chinese
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The exiles and the lawmakers who oppose the bill cited Beijing's
censorship of information and its harsh treatment of political and
religious opponents.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., and several other
lawmakers joined the Chinese exiles in hoisting a 200-foot chain,
which they said represented imprisoned human rights, religious and
labor leaders in China. The activists also displayed signs listing
names of victims of the bloody 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior predicted China's government will continue to jail
dissidents if it wins permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this deal may protect intellectual property, it will do
nothing to protect intellectual freedom,'' Bonior said. ``While
this trade deal may lift tariffs, it won't pry open the door to a
single prison cell.''
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote on the contentious issue next
week, and the vote is still too close to call although momentum has
been building on the pro-trade side. If the measure passes, Senate
approval is expected next month followed quickly by a triumphant
signing by President Clinton, who has lobbied extensively for the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two decades Congress has annually reviewed
America's trading status with China and granted Beijing the same
low tariffs it gives most other nations. Although Beijing has
selectively reduced tariffs on some U.S. products, it has
maintained higher levies on others such as cars and farm products.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to gain admission to the 135-member World Trade
Organization (WTO), which oversees international commerce, Beijing
has agreed to lower tariffs for all nations that grant it permanent
trade status.
</P>
<P>
   China's acceptance into the WTO is almost assured.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-China deal would cut Beijing's tariffs on U.S. goods
significantly while Chinese goods would continue to flow into the
United States under the same low tariffs that exist now. Trade
proponents say that if Congress does not approve the permanent
agreement, China might continue charging high fees on many American
goods while granting other nations lower tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists have joined organized labor and
environmental groups to oppose the permanent status bill. They say
China's lax labor and environmental standards would give its
producers advantages over American companies and cost jobs in this
country. They also say that by ceasing the annual trade review, the
United States would forfeit the only leverage it has to change
China's human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said the deal would not ``provide us with any structure
to guarantee people their freedoms or a decent wage either in China
or here in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers at the rally were Democrats Nancy Pelosi and
Lynn Woolsey of California, Marcy Kaptur and Stephanie Tubbs Jones
of Ohio and Bill Pascrell of New Jersey.

   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ In a victory for the Clinton
administration, the Senate on Thursday narrowly killed a measure to
set a deadline for withdrawing U.S. ground troops from Kosovo, a
proposal that also had drawn fire from Gov. George W. Bush. By a
53-47 vote, senators stripped a provision from a military
construction spending bill that would have cut off funds for the
5,600 U.S. forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, forcing their orderly
withdrawal unless Congress authorized the mission's extension. By

THOUSANDS FLEE AS ETHIOPIAN FORCES CAPTURE KEY TOWN IN ERITREA

<P>
   SHELALO, Eritrea _ Hundreds of thousands of people fled their
homes Thursday in western Eritrea as Ethiopian troops captured a
strategic town and continued their rapid advance beyond the
trenches and into Eritrea's towns and farmlands.
</P>
<P>
   For two years the war has been fought in short, fierce bursts
along a thinly populated border. But aid agencies reported Thursday
that 250,000 civilians had been displaced by fighting around the
town of Barentu, the regional capital that Ethiopia captured
Thursday after a three-day bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the Eritrean government made a much higher
estimate of refugees: 550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Either number is huge for Eritrea, a poor nation of 3.5 million
people. With about 800,000 people already short of food, Eritrea
may face a new scale of problems, after already having lost 10,000
or more of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Ethiopian state television reported that
Ethiopia had bombed military targets near Massawa, Eritrea's main
port, at the Red Sea, at least 80 miles from the dusty, narrow
strip of border in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian president, Meles Zenawi, said Thursday that his
troops would continue to chase Eritrean soldiers anywhere in
Eritrea until they retreat from land along the border that Ethiopia
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve this, we do not share the point of view of some
military experts who suggest that the shortest distance between two
points is a straight line,'' Zenawi told the BBC in an interview in
the capital, Addis Ababa. ``On the contrary, it may be that the
indirect route is the shortest route.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said that Ethiopia had no designs on Eritrean land,
Eritrean officials cast the fighting as an outright invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reverse it,'' said Yemane Gebremeskel, an aide to
Eritrea's president. ``It may take some time, but I am sure we will
prevail because no Eritrean will accept an Ethiopian invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Ethiopia launched an offensive against Eritrea,
once a close ally and, until it became independent in 1993, the
northernmost province of Ethiopia. In the days before, Zenawi
warned diplomats that he wanted a quick end to the war, which has
cost at least 20,000 lives on each side and vast amounts of money.
The Ethiopian president conceded that the war was hampering efforts
to feed 8 million Ethiopians who face severe shortages of food from
a drought.
</P>
<P>
   The war began in May 1998 with disputes over a triangle of land
known as Badme. Eritrea, claiming the land under colonial treaties,
moved in troops. Ethiopia called that an invasion. Since then,
Ethiopia has regained much of the land, but Eritrea has accused
Ethiopia of dragging its feet on a peace accord brokered by the
Organization for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, after two days of heavy artillery exchanges,
Ethiopia captured Barentu, 43 miles north of the Ethiopian border.
The town is important because it was the last of two main supply
routes for the Eritrean army to the western front. With its
capture, Ethiopians say, the fighting is effectively over in
western Eritrea, and now the Ethiopian army is likely to move
toward a central front, which is heavily fortified.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies are well equipped and trained, so the fighting has
been intense, with aerial bombings and artillery and tank battles
as well as hand-to-hand fighting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Shelalo, which was one of the first towns the Ethiopians
attacked last Friday, an Eritrean prisoner, Amine Abe, 22, said he
had been caught in heavy fighting near Barentu, where he had been
sent with huge reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot three times: in the left leg, left side and
shoulder. He said he did not expect such force from the Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bit shocked,'' he said, lying bandaged on a plastic
tarp in a hut with four other wounded Eritreans. ``They were
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebremeskel, the Eritrean spokesman, said the Ethiopians had
advanced by fighting in huge numbers along areas with far fewer
Eritreans. ``At the end of the day,'' he said, ``it's a mere issue
of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fighting entered this region, civilians have started
fleeing along with the retreating Eritrean army. But Thursday after
the Eritreans left Barentu the numbers exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Food
Program, estimated the number of people fleeing at 250,000. She
said they were scattered around the countryside. She said her
agency was without supplies to give the refugees more portable food
than is given to people in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we are going to have to look elsewhere in order to get that
food into Asmara,'' she said. ``But then we will have another set
of challenges because we'll have to see how we can move that food
into the interior.''
</P>
<P>
   The war has worsened food shortages, particularly in Ethiopia,
which faces a far more serious drought problem. More than 200,000
people have already been pushed from their homes around the border
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yirgalem Abraha, a 20-year-old woman who has lived for
two years in one of the camps for the displaced, said she did not
receive food this month and so has begun to sell coffee and tea in
front of her hut. Because of the new fighting, the United Nations
has suspended food deliveries in the area. She is not sure how she
will feed herself if the fighting goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make much,'' she said, at her camp, near the town of
Wala Nehbee, on the border with Eritrea. ``It's just me
surviving.''

THIS BUSH SPEECH REMAINS A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BUSH-ADS)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Council for National Policy is a little known
group whose members are often very well-known and very
conservative. There are radio personalities like Oliver North and
James Dobson, and religious broadcasters, including Pat Robertson
and Jerry Falwell. There are business leaders like Holland Coors,
and members of Congress, including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of group a Republican presidential hopeful would
presumably want to address, which is exactly what Gov. George W.
Bush did last October when the council held a two-day conference in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly did Bush say?
</P>
<P>
   Skipp Porteous has certainly tried to find out, though as yet
without success.
</P>
<P>
   Porteous is national director of The Institute for First
Amendment Studies, a watchdog group from Massachusetts with about
3,000 members nationwide that tries to watch the Council for
National Policy. He regards the council as a secretive umbrella
group plotting strategy for the Republican right.
</P>
<P>
   The council says such talk is silly. They call themselves a
nonpartisan educational foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The council does like its privacy, though. The group holds three
meetings a year, all behind closed doors. Security guards shoo away
any interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, Porteous said his group has planted a
spy in several meetings, even making national news when the
institute's newsletter, Freedom Writer, reported a speech in early
1998 in which Dobson accused congressional Republicans of betraying
evangelical voters and threatened to abandon the party.
</P>
<P>
   But Porteous, who is a licensed private investigator, found his
group shut out when the council gathered in San Antonio. Eager to
know what Bush might say in private to conservative leaders,
Porteous sent off for audiotapes of the conference. The council
sells audiotapes of conferences to members only, but the institute
had obtained an order form from the company, Skynet Media, that
handles the recording.
</P>
<P>
   So when a package arrived earlier this year, Porteous thought
success was at hand. Except that the tape of Bush's speech was not
included. ``If he's speaking at meetings,'' Porteous said, ``the
American people should know what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton C. Blackwell, the council's executive director, said all
guest speakers are asked for permission to include their remarks in
the tape set and that the Bush campaign had declined. Blackwell
said other speakers over the years had also declined, though he
would not name anyone who had. In some cases, the speeches are
included in the council's publication, Policy Counsel, which is
distributed to libraries and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush entourage said they preferred that the tape not go
out, though I could not see any reason why they shouldn't,''
Blackwell said. He added, ``It was a standard speech, basically the
same one. Basically everything he said, he's said before, and I've
heard since.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes said he addressed the council about two years ago
and discussed ``the life issue in detail'' as well as taxes and
Social Security. He said he never considered excluding his remarks
from tape set of the conference.

<P>
   ``I'd just assume everything I say may be held against me,''
said Forbes, who joined the council a few months after his speech.
He added: ``At that stage, I appreciated that somebody wanted to
disseminate what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said if anyone
was ``hoping to hear something that the governor would say that he
hasn't said publicly, then they're on a wild goose chase.'' He
declined to characterize the speech, saying ``when we go to
meetings that are private, they remain private.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fleischer said, ``as far as we know, there is no
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   But Curt Morse, president of the recording company, Skynet
Media, said he has a copy and one was provided to the campaign
after the speech. ``Maybe they lost it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to make them a copy.

BERTINO LEAVING HILL HOLLIDAY; SHAKEUP PUTS CONNORS AT THE HELM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ Fred Bertino, the man who some thought might eventually
succeed Jack Connors as chief executive of Hill Holliday Connors
Cosmopulos, said Thursday he is leaving the Boston ad agency to
join a smaller shop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hill Holliday announced a ``reorganization'' of the
agency under Connors following its merger last month with Goldberg
Moser O'Neill, or GMO, a San Franciso ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization, June Blocklin and Michael Sheehan will
serve as presidents of Hill Holliday's Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Connors engineered the sale of Hill Holliday to
the Interpublic Group of Cos., a New York conglomerate known as IPG
that owns a slew of ad agencies and public-relations firms, for a
reported $115 million in stock. At the time, he agreed to stay on
with the agency he cofounded for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Connors hinted that he has no plans to quit and retire
to Florida any time soon. ``I love what I do,'' said Connors, who
will soon turn 58.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many ad agencies IPG owns is GMO. In April, IPG
announced that GMO would be merged into Hill Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Connors said IPG could move at least one more of its
many ad agencies under Hill Holliday's management.
</P>
<P>
   Together Hill Holliday and GMO project annual billings of $1.2
billion and employ nearly 1,000 people in offices in Boston, San
Francisco, and New York. Hill Holliday now claims to be it one of
the 15 largest ad agencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With 1999 billings of $827 million, Hill Holliday was the second
largest ad agency in New England last year.
</P>
<P>
   The merger and the prospect of more mergers necessitated a
reorganization, said Connors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Fred to take over all creative (duties) outside the
Boston office,'' said Connors, referring to Bertino. ``Fred, who's
an extraordinary talent, decided he didn't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bertino, his departure is voluntary and amicable;
after 10 years at Hill Holliday, it was time for a change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertino, Hill Holliday's president and chief creative officer,
plans to join the newly opened Boston office of Dallas-based Square
One, one of the largest independent agencies in the Southwest.
Bertino will be president and a partner of Square One East and will
have an equity position in the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bertino will be succeeded at Hill Holliday by Blocklin, who had
held the title of executive vice president and director of
advertising services, and by Sheehan, who abruptly left Hill
Holliday last year.
</P>
<P>
   During Bertino's 10 years at Hill Holliday, the Boston shop
evolved from a regional ad agency into a national player.
</P>
<P>
   Square One may face the same challenge today that confronted
Hill Holliday a decade ago. Square One is a small, regional agency
looking to take its business to the next level. According to
Adweek, it had $84 million in billings last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great ride,'' said Bertino, 42, of his decade at
Hill Holliday. ``But I felt like this was a natural time to make a
move. . . . I think it's good to change and challenge yourself
every five or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertino is widely regarded as a creative talent. But running a
newly bulked up agency with more mergers on its dance card may
require a different skill set _ an MBA-type, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertino may not be a world-class manager when it comes to
running a multi-office, billion-dollar ad agency,'' said Skip Pile
of Pile and Co., a Boston consulting firm that helps manage ad
agency reviews. ``But he's a marquee-level, top-tier creative
talent. He knows how to motivate people, and he's terrific at
winning new business.''
</P>
<P>
   At Square One's Boston office, Bertino will be reunited with
Jamie Mambro, a Hill Holliday alumnus who has a national reputation
as a creative talent. The Bertino-Mambro combination ``holds a lot
of promise'' for Square One, Pile said.
</P>
<P>
   At Hill Holliday, the reorganization also establishes a
corporate management team that will oversee operations at the three
agency offices and will report directly to Connors.
</P>
<P>
   The team includes Joe Norberg as chief operating officer, Stever
Aubrey as general manager and executive vice president, and Laurel
Rossi, who as an executive vice president will be in charge of
``integrated strategic marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that he has no plans to retire, Connors said a
possible successor could likely come from this management team; the
names Blocklin and Sheehan should also be included on any list of
possible successors, Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday's clients include Fidelity Investments, Cisco
Systems, and Dunkin' Donuts. Square One's clients include Miller
Brewing Co. and Dr. Pepper.

COMMENTARY: WINNERS, DON'T TAKE ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At stake in next week's vote by Congress over whether to grant
China permanent normalized trade relations _ which in plain English
means a long-term, open trade relationship between the United
States and China _ is not just the future of U.S.-Chinese relations
but also the future of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest, we have a bizarre situation here that can't go
on indefinitely for the Democrats: We have the leadership of the
Democratic Party, including the president, at war with its
rank-and-file labor union base. Labor is now spending millions of
dollars on a nationwide jihad to kill what would be one of
President Clinton's most important foreign policy achievements:
bringing China's 1.3 billion people under the rules of the World
Trade Organization and into a long-term open trading relationship
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way to heal this breach in the Democratic
Party, and that is, first, for labor to be thoroughly defeated on
this China vote.
</P>
<P>
   Because only once this deal is passed, only once one-fifth of
humanity _ the Chinese people _ have been brought into the WTO and
into an open-ended trading arrangement with the United States, will
labor's leadership have to conclude that, at least for now, it is
time to stop fighting over whether we globalize and to start
focusing instead on how we globalize. Labor then might finally put
forward a positive global agenda that addresses how to strengthen
U.S. workers _ other than by pushing hidden and real trade
barriers. Labor's failure to do that up to now has only been
eroding its own power and put it in a reactionary corner with Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But while defeating labor on this issue is necessary, it's not
sufficient. As dangerous as losing this China trade bill would be
for the Democratic Party, and the country as a whole, equally
dangerous would be if the winners treat victory on this bill as a
final victory against all the forces in the United States
uncomfortable with globalization, and therefore a free pass to
forget the concerns about free trade.
</P>
<P>
   I disagree with labor's stand on China, but the zeal with which
labor's rank and file have fought this war, and the passive support
the unions clearly have around the country, underscore that there
are real anxieties out there _ about globalization, about losing
manufacturing jobs to lower-wage countries, about people feeling
that they are not winning from this new economy the way they would
like _ that would be reckless to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   If at this time of rising prosperity in the country as a whole,
with unemployment at record lows for all sectors of population, a
bill to extend permanent normal trade relations to China can only
win by one vote, then, folks, we have a problem. Imagine what will
happen when we have our next, inevitable, recession and
unemployment really rises. There could be a ferocious backlash
against all these free-trade initiatives and a real mass move to
put back the walls.
</P>
<P>
   That's why now is the time to be addressing the anxieties and
myths about globalization. That is what a united, progressive
Democratic Party agenda should be about. But while progressive
politics requires a labor base that is ready to embrace the new
economy, it also requires business and government leaders ready to
finance the training programs, health care reforms, public
education programs and labor laws that give workers the security to
try to master change rather than stop it, and to open up, rather
than hunker down.
</P>
<P>
   Right after this vote, if labor loses, would be the ideal time
for a labor-government-business conference in which government and
business say to labor: Look, we know you have concerns; what can we
do to address them without putting up walls?
</P>
<P>
   I believe you dare not be a globalizer in this world (and this
is business' mistake), an advocate of free trade and integration,
without also being a social democrat, ready to spend what it takes
to bring the have-nots, know-nots and left-behinds along _
otherwise they will eventually shut the doors on you. But you dare
not be a social democrat today (and this is labor's mistake)
without also being a globalizer, because without embracing
globalization and free trade you will never have all the resources,
markets, immigrants and knowledge needed to keep generating rising
incomes to redistribute.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is finding the right balance. Defeating labor on this
China bill is necessary for that, but it will be sufficient only if
the winners also draw the right conclusions.

SCULPTOR CHOSEN FOR THE VENICE BIENNALE; STEINBERG GIVES A RUBENS
TO ISRAEL MUSEUM; A LEONARDO DA VINCI WILL BE SOLD AT SOTHEBY'S,
AND AN EARLY WHISTLER GOES TO CHRISTIE'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wash., France, Italy)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The much-admired sculptor Robert Gober will represent
the United States at the 2001 Venice Biennale. Known for his
surreal and perfect re-creations of body parts and everyday objects
like sinks, urinals and drainpipes, he relates his work to the
explicit and social-political art of the late '80s and early '90s
in oblique and illusive ways.
</P>
<P>
   Gober, 46, lives in New York City. He was selected by the Fund
for U.S. Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions, a
public-private partnership of the National Endowment for the Arts,
the U.S. State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pew
Charitable Trusts after curators and contemporary-art museums
nationwide were asked to propose candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The curators of Gober's installation are James Rondeau,
associate curator of contemporary art at the Art Institute of
Chicago, and Olga Viso, associate curator at the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden in Washington. The installation is to consist
of eight sculptural works: seven designed specifically for the four
galleries of the United States pavilion, and one currently on view
in the Whitney Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the new sculptures will be variations on a large piece
of white Styrofoam that Gober found on the beach near his studio on
Long Island. ``They will be cast in bronze,'' Rondeau said. ``The
process of translation from the actual object to the symbolic is
always at play in Gober's work.'' Rondeau added that the sculptures
make loose reference to the theme of water, which has been
important to the artist.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition in Venice will be the first major site-specific
installation of Gober's work since one at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   RUBENS FOR THE ISRAEL
</P>
<P>
   Saul Steinberg may be selling much of his furniture at Sotheby's
next week ( and a stash of Old Master paintings through Richard L.
Feigen, the Manhattan dealer, but he has decided to give the Israel
Museum in Jerusalem an important Rubens.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, ``Death of Adonis (With Venus, Cupid and the Three
Graces),'' dates from around 1614. Steinberg bought it in 1982 from
Jeffrey H. Loria, the Manhattan dealer. The painting is monumental
in scale _ about 7 by 11 feet _ and depicts Ovid's tale of the
death and lamentation of Adonis.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second Rubens to enter the museum's collection. The
first, ``Romulus and Titus Tatius'' (circa 1630-34), was bequeathed
to the museum in 1986 by Sam Weisbord, a Los Angeles collector. The
one Steinberg has given is larger and far more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago we talked to Saul about our desire to
build our Old Master collection,'' said James Snyder, director of
the museum. ``This is a signature, mature painting and our first
major Rubens.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the museum began renovating its European art
galleries. It also initiated a drive to encourage benefactors to
strengthen its Old Master collection. Last year it received
Poussin's ``Destruction and Sack of the Temple of Jerusalem''
(1625-26) as a gift from the Rothschild Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said the Rubens would go on public view in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   SKETCHES BY LEONARDO DA VINCI
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the finest Old Master paintings and drawings
have been sent to auction in Manhattan for sale recently, Sotheby's
in London has made some important discoveries that will be included
in its July sales.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the Old Master drawings department announced
that on July 5 it would auction a sheet of unpublished drawings by
Leonardo da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   In 1878, members of the Calando family, Paris collectors, bought
the sheet at auction. It has been in the family ever since and has
remained unknown and unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they realized how rare drawings like this are,''
said Gregory Rubinstein, director of Sotheby's Old Master drawings
department in London. ``Apart from the listing in the Paris sale
catalog, no image or other details of the drawings have been
publicly seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The double-sided sheet depicts Hercules holding a club. Several
other pen-and-ink sketches depict an executioner, whirlpools and a
device for blocking the flow of a river.
</P>
<P>
   The work, expected to sell for $640,000 to $960,000, was seen by
Prof. Giulio Bora, a leading authority on Leonardo, who confirmed
that the sheet was by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study sheet, with its series of rapid sketches,''
Rubinstein said, ``contains so much of the essence of Leonardo's
art: the seamless transition between art and science; sketches of
waterworks combined with a heroic figure study; the free use of
whatever drawing medium was most appropriate to the task in hand;
and the surprises that the artist constantly springs on us.''
</P>
<P>
   AN EARLY WHISTLER
</P>
<P>
   The cover of Christie's catalog for its sale of American
paintings next Thursday features an early Whistler, ``Harmony in
Gray: Chelsea in Ice'' (1864), a landscape of figures against the
Thames embankment. The painting, estimated at $2.5 million to $3.5
million, comes from descendants of Denys Sutton, an English
collector.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's hung the Whistler with its Impressionist and
post-Impressionist art right before last week's sales, hoping to
lure collectors whose taste is more European to consider buying a
serious American painting. ``Whistler was a great late-19th-century
expatriate painter, and like Sargent and Cassatt, he appeals to
both types of buyers,'' said Paul R. Provost, head of Christie's
American paintings department.
</P>
<P>
   While early Whistler landscapes like this one are rare on the
auction market, some experts say the painting's muted palette may
not make it a popular choice. There has not been one like it for
sale at auction since 1987, when Sotheby's sold ``Variations in
Violet and Green'' (1871) for about $2 million. It is now in the
Musee d'Orsay in Paris.

 &HT;    AirTran plans brisk growth through 2001
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although AirTran Airways has slowed deliveries of its
new Boeing 717 jets for financial reasons, the airline plans to
significantly accelerate growth starting later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's second-largest carrier, which has grown little in the
past two years while a new executive team stabilized the company,
will boost seat capacity 12 percent in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That will be followed by a 15 percent capacity increase in 2001,
Chief Executive Joseph Leonard said at the carrier's shareholders
meeting Thursday. Those growth rates are three or four times the
industry norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``After stabilizing the company, we think it is now positioned
for strong and sustained growth,'' Leonard told an audience of
about 50 shareholders at the Georgia International Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran will add one or two new destinations later this year
from its Atlanta hub, and two to four a year for the next two
years, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be looking for cities where prices are high and
service is weak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More growth will be accomplished through added frequencies on
existing routes, and by adding point-to-point flights between
destinations outside Atlanta, Leonard said. For instance, this year
AirTran has opened three new nonstop routes to Florida from
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The growth will intensify AirTran's competition with
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, which handles about 80 percent of
traffic at Hartsfield International Airport. It comes after five
consecutive quarterly profits for AirTran, which until 1997 flew as
ValuJet and struggled for survival after a 1996 crash in the
Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran began buying 717s last year to replace its aging DC-9s
and 737s. But this week it disclosed a slowdown in deliveries
negotiated with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which now flies 10 of the new twinjets, had agreed
to buy a total of 50 by 2002. Under the new plan, those deliveries
are stretched out through 2003. To meet its growth goals, AirTran
will also slow the rate at which it replaces its older planes,
retiring one DC-9 for every two 717s delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching out 717 deliveries reduces financing costs and
deposits associated with buying the new planes. That will improve
cash flow and help AirTran refinance $230 million in debt coming
due in 11 months, Leonard said. He said he is confident the
refinancing will be done on schedule, calling it the top issue
facing management.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard also said AirTran will launch a new ad campaign in July
and that it is generating 23 percent of bookings at its Internet
site, airtran.com, helping to lower processing costs. Most big
airlines' Internet bookings are in the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   In his discussion of growth plans, Leonard said the airline
hopes to build a new hangar at Hartsfield and that it is making
itself available to other carriers as a code-share partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be a very attractive partner for anybody who doesn't
have a major presence in the Southeast,'' he said, adding that no
pact is imminent. Earlier this year, AirTran approached Northwest
Airlines and its foreign partner, KLM, about such a partnership but
was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   A few shareholders expressed frustration about AirTran's stock
price, which has remained stubbornly below $5 a share despite the
carrier's profits and improved outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody more frustrated with the stock price than the
management team,'' Leonard said. He said high fuel prices this
winter torpedoed airline stocks just as AirTran's was poised to
take off but that ``sooner or later the market will take care of
that.''

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS PROPOSE BARRING FEMALE PASTORS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Ky.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, proposed revising the denomination's basic
statement of faith on Thursday to say that the Bible allows only
men to be church pastors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change _ to a document called the Baptist Faith and
Message, which must be affirmed by Southern Baptist seminary
professors and denominational workers _ would declare that ``the
office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed phrase reflects the theologically right-ward turn
by the denomination, historically a conservative body in which few
women have been hired as pastors. If adopted by the denomination,
it would have the effect of strongly discouraging Southern Baptist
congregations from calling a woman as pastor. But it could not
legally prevent them from doing so, as such congregations are
self-governing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed revision would also be another in a series of
recent moves that sharply distinguishes Southern Baptists from
other major Protestant bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their denomination underwent a wrenching internal
power struggle in the 1980s, Southern Baptists have been guided by
leaders who regard the Bible as ``inerrant,'' literally true in all
matters, and have been firm in saying Scripture prohibits women
from being spiritual leaders over men.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at their annual convention, Southern Baptists
amended the faith statement to declare that ``a wife is to submit
herself graciously'' to her husband's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the convention adopted a resolution calling for new
efforts aimed at converting Jews to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saying women should not be pastors, the proposed
revisions to the faith statement call on Christians to oppose
racism, homosexuality and pornography, to speak out against
abortion and to bring government and society ``under the sway of
the principles of righteousness, truth and brotherly love.'' The
revisions will be voted on at the 15.8 million-member
denomination's convention, in Orlando, Fla., on June 13-14.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes are ``historically significant,'' said R.
Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
in Louisville, Ky., and a member of the committee that proposed the
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A confession of faith is a very concrete representation of
what Baptists believe,'' he said, adding that it was ``appropriate
that every generation'' have the opportunity to consider such
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues that is important here,'' he added, ``is
that the opposition to the idea of a woman serving as pastor is not
culturally driven. It is a matter of biblical conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the proposed revision was consistent with what
most Southern Baptists believed, as expressed in a resolution at a
convention in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But Carolyn Weatherford Crumpler, a former executive director of
Woman's Missionary Union, the major women's organization within the
Southern Baptist Convention, said she disagreed with the proposed
revision of the faith statement and would not support it. ``I think
it's a misinterpretation of Scripture,'' said Crumpler, who is also
a former moderator of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a network
of theologically more moderate congregations within the
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Vestal, the fellowship's top official, also said the
proposed revision ``is based on a bad interpretation of Scripture,
an insensitivity to the Holy Spirit and an unwillingness to see
what God is doing in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vestal said that were the clause against women as pastors to
be incorporated into the faith statement, it would have a profound
effect among the denomination's 40,000 congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbol is sometimes substance,'' he said. ``It will definitely
affect the local congregation over time, because the document is a
document for hiring and firing in all institutions, so it's going
to affect faculty and it's going to affect missionaries, and that
has an effect on all congregations.''
</P>
<P>
   The faith statement was written in 1925 and revised in 1963.
Since the last major revision, several Protestant denominations (as
well as the Reform and Conservative rabbinate) have ordained women
as clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   These days, women make up a significant proportion of clergy
members within, for example, the United Methodist Church, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Episcopal Church.
All three denominations also ordain women as bishops. In one small
religious body, the Unitarian-Universalist Association, women now
make up a slight majority of all clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Frances Anders, a retired sociology professor who is
moderator of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, said that in 1964,
the first Southern Baptist woman was ordained as a minister since
before the Civil War. But that woman, she said, found a job as a
pastor in another denomination, the American Baptist Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she said, about 1,600 Southern Baptist women have
been ordained, although many work as chaplains, ministers of music
or supervise educational programs in churches. She said that about
100 women serve as pastors and about 100 others as associate
pastors in Southern Baptist congregations.

   SHELALO, Eritrea _ Hundreds of thousands of people fled their
homes Thursday in western Eritrea as Ethiopian troops captured a
strategic town and continued their rapid advance beyond the
trenches and into Eritrea's towns and farmlands.
</P>
<P>
   For two years the war has been fought in short, fierce bursts
along a thinly populated border. But aid agencies reported Thursday
that 250,000 civilians had been displaced by fighting around the
town of Barentu, the regional capital that Ethiopia captured
Thursday after a three-day bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the Eritrean government made a much higher
estimate of refugees: 550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Either number is huge for Eritrea, a poor nation of 3.5 million
people. With about 800,000 people already short of food, Eritrea
may face a new scale of problems, after already having lost 10,000
or more of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Ethiopian state television reported that
Ethiopia had bombed military targets near Massawa, Eritrea's main
port, at the Red Sea, at least 80 miles from the dusty, narrow
strip of border in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian president, Meles Zenawi, said Thursday that his
troops would continue to chase Eritrean soldiers anywhere in
Eritrea until they retreat from land along the border that Ethiopia
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve this, we do not share the point of view of some
military experts who suggest that the shortest distance between two
points is a straight line,'' Zenawi told the BBC in an interview in
the capital, Addis Ababa. ``On the contrary, it may be that the
indirect route is the shortest route.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said that Ethiopia had no designs on Eritrean land,
Eritrean officials cast the fighting as an outright invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reverse it,'' said Yemane Gebremeskel, an aide to
Eritrea's president. ``It may take some time, but I am sure we will
prevail because no Eritrean will accept an Ethiopian invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Ethiopia launched an offensive against Eritrea,
once a close ally and, until it became independent in 1993, the
northernmost province of Ethiopia. In the days before, Zenawi
warned diplomats that he wanted a quick end to the war, which has
cost at least 20,000 lives on each side and vast amounts of money.
The Ethiopian president conceded that the war was hampering efforts
to feed 8 million Ethiopians who face severe shortages of food from
a drought.
</P>
<P>
   The war began in May 1998 with disputes over a triangle of land
known as Badme. Eritrea, claiming the land under colonial treaties,
moved in troops. Ethiopia called that an invasion. Since then,
Ethiopia has regained much of the land, but Eritrea has accused
Ethiopia of dragging its feet on a peace accord brokered by the
Organization for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, after two days of heavy artillery exchanges,
Ethiopia captured Barentu, 43 miles north of the Ethiopian border.
The town is important because it was the last of two main supply
routes for the Eritrean army to the western front. With its
capture, Ethiopians say, the fighting is effectively over in
western Eritrea, and now the Ethiopian army is likely to move
toward a central front, which is heavily fortified.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies are well equipped and trained, so the fighting has
been intense, with aerial bombings and artillery and tank battles
as well as hand-to-hand fighting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Shelalo, which was one of the first towns the Ethiopians
attacked last Friday, an Eritrean prisoner, Amine Abe, 22, said he
had been caught in heavy fighting near Barentu, where he had been
sent with huge reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot three times: in the left leg, left side and
shoulder. He said he did not expect such force from the Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bit shocked,'' he said, lying bandaged on a plastic
tarp in a hut with four other wounded Eritreans. ``They were
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebremeskel, the Eritrean spokesman, said the Ethiopians had
advanced by fighting in huge numbers along areas with far fewer
Eritreans. ``At the end of the day,'' he said, ``it's a mere issue
of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fighting entered this region, civilians have started
fleeing along with the retreating Eritrean army. But Thursday after
the Eritreans left Barentu the numbers exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Food
Program, estimated the number of people fleeing at 250,000. She
said they were scattered around the countryside. She said her
agency was without supplies to give the refugees more portable food
than is given to people in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we are going to have to look elsewhere in order to get that
food into Asmara,'' she said. ``But then we will have another set
of challenges because we'll have to see how we can move that food
into the interior.''
</P>
<P>
   The war has worsened food shortages, particularly in Ethiopia,
which faces a far more serious drought problem. More than 200,000
people have already been pushed from their homes around the border
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yirgalem Abraha, a 20-year-old woman who has lived for
two years in one of the camps for the displaced, said she did not
receive food this month and so has begun to sell coffee and tea in
front of her hut. Because of the new fighting, the United Nations
has suspended food deliveries in the area. She is not sure how she
will feed herself if the fighting goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make much,'' she said, at her camp, near the town of
Wala Nehbee, on the border with Eritrea. ``It's just me
surviving.''

 &HT;    China trade stand threatens Gore's labor support
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CANTON, OHIO _ Armed with leaflets denouncing unfettered
trade with China, shop steward Jerry Warfield stood outside the
Hoover vacuum factory here and braced for the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., the factory's gates opened and disgorged a stampede
of plant workers, who paused just long enough to grab one of
Warfield's leaflets _ a form letter addressed to Rep. Ralph Regula
(R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   After the rush, Warfield vented his frustrations over the
Clinton administration's proposal to grant permanent trade
relations with China, which Congress considers next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill, as far as I'm concerned, pretty much destroys
manufacturing,'' said Warfield, a 26-year employee of Hoover
Appliances. About Vice President Al Gore, who supports the accord,
Warfield pursed his lips and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be hard for me to vote for him,'' said Warfield, a
staunch Democrat. ``I don't like (George W.) Bush. And if Gore's
position on some of these issues don't change, it'll be hard for me
to vote for him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Warfield's sentiments, echoed by other rank and file union
members here, bode ominously for the vice president. The support of
organized labor is critical to Gore's election prospects,
particularly in the industrial Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Senior labor leaders and rank and file members, even those
strongly supporting Gore, said they are uneasy about trying to turn
out union votes for Gore after the vice president so vocally
supported legislation they believe could kill their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder and harder to tell them, the working
folks, to vote for someone who has done something against their own
interest,'' said Bill Burga, president of the Ohio AFL-CIO, who is
supporting Gore. ``Well, the voters are going to say the hell with
it, we aren't going to support these people who voted against us.
We just won't vote, or vote for a third party or throw it away
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kathleen Begala minimized the the impact of the
disagreement with organized labor on China, saying labor voters
understood that Gore will not agree with them on every issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the issues that are vitally important to these folks
and many other folks, Al Gore is right on them, and George W. Bush
is wrong on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of President John Sweeney, the 13 million
member AFL-CIO is waging the most aggressive campaign to defeat the
China trade bill since Congress passed the North American Free
Trade agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would end the annual review of China's human
rights record in deciding whether to grant the country low tariffs
for imports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Union members are writing letters to wavering members of
Congress, working phone banks and delivering anti-trade literature
to plant gates in more than 30 congressional districts across the
country. Here in eastern Ohio, the AFL-CIO is targeting Regula and
Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio), two undecided members.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense lobbying is being conducted by the AFL-CIO's
three large industrial unions _ the Teamsters, the United Auto
Workers and the United Steel Workers _ and, to a lesser extent, the
industrial locals of the electrical workers union, which represents
the 2,300 hourly workers at the Hoover plant.
</P>
<P>
   Problematic for Gore is that these unions are heavily
concentrated in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin
_ toss-up states where the presidential election between Gore and
Bush could be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Union voters comprised 46 percent of Ohio's presidential primary
this year, according to exit polls. They voted for Gore 74 percent
to 22 percent over former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Labor turnout in November may very well hold the key to Gore's
chances of defeating Bush, and could also determine the Democratic
Party's bid to reclaim the House.
</P>
<P>
   While Sweeney and the AFL-CIO endorsed Gore last October, both
the UAW and the Teamsters withheld their endorsement because of
their anger over Gore's position on trade.
</P>
<P>
   The two unions, with 2.2 million active members combined, have
also sent signals they are willing to look at alternatives to Gore.
Two weeks ago, UAW president Steve Yokich met privately with
consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before that, at a boisterous rally involving 5,000
Teamsters in Washington, Teamsters President James Hoffa shared a
platform with Reform party candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Both Buchanan and Nader, who have a strong anti-trade message,
have the potential to siphon votes away from Gore. At a labor rally
in Canton, Ohio, on Wednesday, steel worker Richard Cordes showed
up wearing a yellow ``Buchanan 2000'' button.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have a third choice this year,'' Cordes said.
Mike Mathis, the Teamsters political director in Washington, said
the 2000 elections could wind up like 1994, when union voters
stayed home and Republicans wrested control of the House for the
first time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ``are in for a rude awakening,'' Mathis said. ``The
local leadership is upset about this. For them to take time to
campaign for somebody and entice their memberships to get involved,
it's a lot of time for them. They are going to be less likely to do
it for a Democrat who voted wrong on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Much hinges on the outcome of the voting next week. If the
legislation is defeated, it will be much easier for union members
to forget about Gore's support of it.
</P>
<P>
   If it passes, then steel worker union members such as Richard
Hiles, who plans to help Gore in Canton, have their work cut out
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many months do we have? Four? Five?'' said Hiles, glancing
around for a calendar. ``Hopefully, this will be old news by
then.''

A BRAZILIAN CITY RESURRECTS ITS BURIED JEWISH PAST

<P>
   RECIFE, Brazil _ The Street of the Benevolent Jesus traverses an
area of restaurants and nightclubs just off the docks of this port
city of 1.5 million people. And right in the middle of the busiest
block, one of the most unusual archaeological projects ever
undertaken in Brazil is under way: the excavation and
reconstruction of the first synagogue built in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue, Kahal Zur Israel, or Rock of Israel, flourished
in the mid-1600s when the Dutch briefly controlled this part of
northeastern Brazil and the sugar and tobacco plantations that made
it rich. With the return of the Portuguese, though, Recife's Jews
made their way to Manhattan, where they founded New York City's
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Excavation began last September under the direction of Marcos
Albuquerque, an archaeologist from the Federal University of
Pernambuco who previously uncovered forts, churches, battlefields
and sugar mills from the Dutch period. Maps and property records
offered a general idea of the location of the temple, but because
the Inquisition had done everything possible to obliterate all
signs of the Jewish presence, the dig began with some doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty certain we were in the right place, but it
wasn't until we found a well that we were sure,'' Albuquerque said.
``In Brazil the well is always placed outside the house, never
inside, and so we suspected that what we had come across was a
mikvah,'' the ritual bath used by observant Jews, ``and we were
very pleased when a rabbinical tribunal confirmed that
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   With the support of the Brazilian government and several
foundations, the small Jewish community here plans to turn the site
into a museum and Cultural Center of the Jewish Presence in Brazil.
Reconstruction of the building's interior is to begin at the end of
May, with the goal of finishing by Rosh Hashana, the start of the
Jewish new year, in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot talk of restoring the synagogue because we have no
evidence what it really looked like,'' said Boris Berenstein, a
doctor who is president of the Israelite Federation of Pernambuco,
the main Jewish group here. ``But we can rescue the historical
memory of this first community, and that is what we intend to do
through documents, archives and exhibits.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Katia Mesel, a documentary filmmaker here, is
working on a movie titled ``The Rock and the Star,'' which will
examine the early Jewish presence here. Like most of Recife's
modern-day Jews, she is descended from immigrants who came from
Eastern Europe over the last century with no awareness that others
had preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always were told that a synagogue had once existed here,''
Mesel said, ``but the documentation was vague, and even when I went
to New York to research the subject in 1997, very few people there
had any idea what I was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Jewish population today, around 170,000, is barely
one-tenth of 1 percent of the country's 170 million people. But as
Henry Sobel, senior rabbi of the Congregacao Israelita Paulista,
the country's largest Jewish congregation, noted, ``There is no
doubt that Jews contributed greatly to the construction of
Brazil,'' especially in the crucial early years of Portuguese
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   The first Portuguese expedition to land in Brazil, 500 years ago
last month, included a Polish-born Jew as its chief interpreter, as
well as astronomers and map makers who are believed to have been of
Jewish origin. Early settlers included many so-called marranos,
Jews from the Iberian Peninsula who had converted to Christianity
under duress but were eager to escape the clutches of the
Inquisition to resume openly practicing their faith.
</P>
<P>
   By 1590, however, the Inquisition had installed itself in Brazil
and begun persecuting these ``new Christians.'' So when the Dutch
seized the colony of Pernambuco in 1630 and announced a policy of
religious tolerance, those who moved to Recife included not only a
rabbi and cantor from Amsterdam but many Jewish families from
territory under Portuguese control.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of the Dutch period, Recife may have had a
larger Jewish presence than Amsterdam itself,'' said Tania Kaufman,
a history professor at the Federal University of Pernambuco here.
``The most reliable calculations indicate about 1,400 Jews, or more
than one-tenth the total population of Recife and nearly half its
population of free white civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1654 the Portuguese drove out the Dutch, and fear of
reprisals led to the dispersion of the Jews here. A group of 23
returning to Amsterdam were captured by Spanish pirates, but were
rescued by a French vessel, which dropped them off at a fledgling
Dutch colony called Nieuw Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Their difficulties did not end when they reached what is today
New York City. Peter Stuyvesant, governor of the settlement, sent a
letter to the Dutch West Indies Co. recommending ``most seriously
that this deceitful race, such hateful enemies and blasphemers of
the name of Christ, be not allowed further to infest and trouble
this new colony.''
</P>
<P>
   The response he received ordered that the newcomers be permitted
``to live, trade and travel'' freely and given a burial ground of
their own, which was established near what is today Chatham Square
and came to be known as the Brazilian Cemetery. But it was only
after the English displaced the Dutch that the Jews from Recife
were permitted to build a synagogue, named Shearith Israel, which
stands today at 70th Street and Central Park West.
</P>
<P>
   Some other families, though, were unable to book passage on
ships leaving here. They fled to the remote hinterland where they
were forced to resume the clandestine practice of their religion
and eventually blended in with the local population.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, when Kaufman lectures in the interior, ``I am often
approached by people who tell me, `I think I might be Jewish,'''
she said. ``When I ask them why, they produce a menorah or a
tattered prayer book and tell me it was handed down to their
grandparents by their grandparents before them, or they tell me of
family customs that fit squarely within the Sephardic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of elements of faith to persist for so long in
such isolation is truly an amazing thing,'' she said.

 &HT;    School of Americas fends critics' plans for closure
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new name and mission at the School of the
Americas could not stave off attacks Thursday as congressional
critics tried unsuccessfully to shut down the controversial
military academy located at Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) introduced an amendment to the
Defense Authorization bill that would close the school and assign a
congressional task force to determine whether the U.S. government
should train soldiers from Latin America. It was defeated by a vote
of 204-214.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1949, the school near Columbus has taught Latin American
soldiers how to fight insurgencies. The school is controversial
because, critics say, a number of its graduates have violated basic
human rights in their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding those concerns, the Pentagon has recommended that the
academy change its name to the Defense Institute for Hemispheric
Security Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Defense Department is recommending that the
school expand its charter to include civilian personnel and require
a minimum of eight hours of instruction on preserving human rights,
the rule of law, due process and the role of the military in a
democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, an independent board to oversee the school and
its curriculum would also be created.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have the blessing of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen. Both the House and
Senate Armed Services Committees have backed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Moakley said those changes would amount to little more than
``putting a perfume factory on top of a toxic waste dump.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Cynthia McKinney was the only member of the Georgia
delegation to vote for closing the school. John Lewis (D-Ga.) did
not vote but expressed support for closing the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always supported the amendment to close the school,''
Lewis said. ``I think it should be closed because of its history
and some of the people who have been associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) and Georgia Republican Reps. Saxby
Chambliss and Mac Collins were among those strongly defending the
school Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military-to-military exchanges are an integral component of
American foreign policy and provide valuable education and
training,'' Chambliss said. ``These exchanges increase cooperation,
help professionalize militaries and teach them the role of the
military in democratic civilian societies.''
</P>
<P>
   Army Col. Glenn Weidner, who runs the Fort Benning school, said
that fewer than 1 percent of the school's 60,000 graduates have
been linked to crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponents continue to trot out half-truths about the
school being responsible for a small number of graduates,'' Weidner
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, Weidner said, because the main thrust of the school
is to educate military and law enforcement officers to prevent
human rights violations and to foster a dialogue so they will adopt
American values.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Georgia's senators support the Pentagon plan to overhaul
the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of these reforms is to produce a more professional
military
</P>
<P>
   culture in Latin American countries,'' said Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.), a co-sponsor of the Senate version of the Pentagon reform
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Unrest in countries such as Equador, Columbia and Venezuela is
evidence that continued engagement by the United States is
necessary to stabilize the region, Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), a member of the Senate leadership,
agrees. The school is critical to improving relationships and
maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school performs a valuable mission for the entire
hemisphere,'' Coverdell said. The critics of the school should be
satisfied that a dozen investigations have found the school in
compliance with U.S. law and foreign policy, he said.

 &HT;    S. Carolina aquarium so realistic it's uncanny
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ We are standing at the edge of a blackwater
swamp at twilight.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly flares dance among the dark stands of nearby trees.
Cypress knees press up from the muck of the bottom. A cool fog
blankets the swamp's surface, engulfing the low-hanging Spanish
moss and dead wood. And bullhead, skink and shortnose sturgeon _
looking for all the world like dinosaur fish _ riffle the dark
water here and there, suggesting a shadow life below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear that?'' asks Chris Andrews, cupping an ear to discern the
croaking of ... something uncertain. A frog perhaps. Or something
larger?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' my son Josh asks, seeking refuge behind my
knees. ``It's OK,'' I tell him. ``It's just make-believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's making that noise?'' he asks, summoning all the
courage a 5-year-old can muster. ``It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Even within the safe, secure and dry confines of this
spectacular exhibit at the South Carolina Aquarium, the Blackwater
Swamp _ the third stop on visitors' self-guided tour _ the illusion
of this engineered reality is powerful. You can't see the cooling
coils chilling the room. Or the fog machine kicking out mist. Or
the speakers and wires tucked among the cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But what you don't see is making you feel chilled and alert _
very alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what it's like to be in a blackwater swamp at
dusk,'' says Andrews, 47, the jovial director of the new aquarium,
during a recent tour of the $69 million facility. ``Those
fireflies? Fiber optics. And the sounds of the frogs and insects
are piped in to give you the sense of what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, of course, is not simply to frighten or dazzle.
Andrews wants aquarium visitors to feel what it's like to be knee
deep in a blackwater swamp _ to immerse themselves in the
experience _ so that it stays with them when they leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do this kind of clever representation,'' he says,
taking in the exhibit with a sweep of his hand. ``But it's nothing
compared to the real thing. We want people to come here and get a
taste of it _ maybe where it feels safe and where they can bring
the kids and learn something about the habitat. But then we want
them to go out to the real thing and see it for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that's the mission _ and magic _ of the aquarium,
which opened this weekend on Charleston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The facility replicates a variety of South Carolina habitats and
ecosystems, all designed to educate visitors about the state's
natural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is just remarkable,'' Andrews says. ``It is so
lush and semitropical in places, and biologically very diverse. We
have a great range of animals and plants here to (represent) that.
It's not just a big fish tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits have been assembled with painstaking attention to
detail. Only fish native to the Carolina bays are seen swimming in
the aquarium's bay exhibit. Only birds you'd find in the state's
mountain forests are chirping in the exhibit of that name. And only
plants that populate a real coastal marsh grow out of the
prefabricated muck.
</P>
<P>
   The tour begins at the Riverside Terrace entrance, a stunning
waterfront platform overlooking the harbor. Visitors then move
through a series of multimedia exhibits in six major galleries
showcasing the key regions of the South Carolina Appalachian
Watershed: the Mountain Forest, Piedmont Plateau, Coastal Plain,
Saltmarsh, Coast and Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors follow a mazelike trail from one gallery to the
next, they mirror the path that a hypothetical raindrop might take
on a journey from the mountain streams of the Appalachian highlands
to the ocean.

 &HT;    Weighty bio wends through life of late bloomer, his great work
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 21.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you know the conventional wisdom about Marcel Proust _ i.e.,
he was a mousy hypochondriac who only left his bed to gather gossip
at society parties _ then you're liable to panic when presented
with this new biography. Yikes: 810 pages! Are we to be dragged
through an inch-by-inch itinerary of the writer's hermetic,
cork-lined bedroom?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the richness, the fullness of Proust's life was
strictly inside his head. He set that inner life to paper with
breathtaking brilliance. An eccentric asthmatic who in his adult
life rarely woke before sunset or fell asleep before dawn, Proust
spent 13 years completing his 15-volume, semi-autobiographical
opus, ``In Search of Lost Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Proust was everything that, say, Ernest Hemingway wasn't _
frail, hypersensitive, verbose, sometimes filling a page with a
single sentence. Someone has probably already written the parody
``Papa and Marcel on Safari,'' which would have the Frenchman
wearing his all-season fur coat in tropical heat, whining and
chattering so busily that he doesn't notice an elephant about to
stomp him. But the truth is that Proust has a place with Hemingway,
Joyce and Faulkner as fearless trailblazers in fiction during the
first three decades of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, biographer William C. Carter, a professor of French
at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has enough appreciation
of Proust's soaring mind to make up for the tedium of the writer's
daily regimen. Yes, ``Proust'' does start lethargically, but it
gathers force. It's diligently researched and written _ if not with
flair, exactly, then with a probing intelligence worthy of its
complex subject.
</P>
<P>
   Born to a wealthy doctor and a mother to whom he was obsessively
attached (as his ``Search'' makes clear), Proust lived with his
parents until well into his 30s. He knew early that he had a gift
for writing but was apparently too ill, with asthma and shaky
nerves, to make a timely career start.
</P>
<P>
   Or was he just too lazy and childish? Or was closeness to his
childhood self essential to Proust's ability _ through the magic of
the warm tea and famous madeleine cake _ to recapture his earliest
years with such vividness and wonder?
</P>
<P>
   Proust could be as repellent as he was appealing. To some he was
the most loyal of friends, writing tributes to them in the Paris
journals on any pretext; to others he was a society toadie, fawning
over salon hostesses. He paid waiters to be his spies and sniff out
scandals. He was so attached to a male brothel that he helped to
pay for its furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Carter brings to life not only Proust but his times: the
Parisian belle epoque of artistic ferment, affluence and joie de
vivre. Sarah Bernhardt, Andre Gide, Claude Debussy and Jean Cocteau
make their interesting appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the detail Carter brings, it's still mysterious how,
and why, Proust finally grew up, conceived his literary mission and
threw himself into it, at about age 40. Perhaps when he became too
ill to even attend soirees, he was sobered and steeled by his
disease _ as, say, Franklin D. Roosevelt was by his polio. Proust's
portraits of society life become sharply satiric in ``Search'' _
little battlefields of pettiness compared with the profound
beauties he describes so memorably in nature, art and relationships
of love.
</P>
<P>
   Carter describes well Proust's ``intimate voice ... pouring into
the listener's ear the rich music of his enchanting, nocturnal
musings.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Proust makes his life turn, and his great book takes shape,
length is no longer a deterrent in the biography. In some ways
we're even left hungry to know more: the unknowable sources, and
secrets, of genius.

THE BULLISHNESS THAT ISN'T BULLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21) 
 By MARK HULBERT 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In the hands of many investment advisers, contrarian
analysis has become the occasion for no end of shoddy thinking.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Las Vegas Money Show, I heard many a market guru
invoke contrarian analysis to argue that, because he alone believes
in his particular forecast, it therefore must come true.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the advisers cannot all be right; their forecasts go
every which way. The whole thing reminds me of a war in which all
the factions claim that God is on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The kernel of truth embedded in contrarian analysis is that the
market rarely follows forecasts that are very widely held. Bull
markets typically end, for example, once everyone becomes convinced
that the market has nowhere to go but up. That is the origin of the
old saw about bull markets liking to climb a wall of worry.
Similarly, bear markets generally come to an end when everyone has
turned bearish.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy thinking is introduced when advisers try to transplant
this kernel of truth into a particular market-timing strategy. The
biggest mistake is expecting contrarian analysis to always yield a
forecast about the market's direction. Most of the time it cannot,
because extremes of bullishness or bearishness are relatively rare.
In ambiguous times, contrarians must be silent.
</P>
<P>
   Market gurus are paid not to be silent, so that limitation is a
major inconvenience. As a result, contrarian advisers have a habit
of detecting extremes even when they aren't there. For example,
about half the so-called contrarians I heard here asserted that
advisers on balance were extremely pessimistic; the other half were
sure that extreme optimism prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side is right, judging from the nearly 200 investment
newsletters tracked by The Hulbert Financial Digest. On average,
these letters are recommending that subscribers allocate 55 percent
of their equity portfolio assets to long positions in stocks, with
the remainder in cash. Over the last two decades, the long-position
average has been as high as 83 percent, and as low 9 percent, so
the consensus of these advisers is only moderately more bullish
than the midpoint of the historical range.
</P>
<P>
   In times like these, when market sentiment is far from extreme,
contrarians would do better to watch how advisers react to
corrections. The analysis won't yield a precise prediction, but it
will reveal much about the underlying health of the market. It's a
sign of strength when the advisers, on balance, quickly become
bearish during a correction, but cause for concern when they react
bullishly.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the reactions over the last 18 months among a group of
particularly sensitive market timers _ newsletter editors who
communicate with subscribers daily and who vary their equity
exposure sharply when they switch from being bullish or bearish. I
have found trends among this subset to be a reliable early warning
system for the market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, these market timers were quick to jump out of the
market at the first sign of trouble. After the correction last
fall, in fact, the average timer in this group became incredibly
bearish, recommending that 83 percent of equity portfolios be
allocated to investments that increase in value when the market
falls, like mutual funds that sell stocks short. Not surprisingly,
the bull market rose briskly in the face of such extreme pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   No such ultrabearishness has swept over the advisers this year.
They have not been extremely bullish, either, but that isn't the
point. Significantly, they have not reduced their bullishness in
the face of the market's decline _ a downturn that dwarfs the one
last fall. In fact, there were days in April when the Nasdaq
composite suffered near-record declines and the advisers became
more, not less, bullish.
</P>
<P>
   Their sanguine attitude will not immediately doom this
long-running bull market, but it is disturbing. Stubborn optimism
in the face of significant declines is more indicative of a market
top than a bottom. &QL;

 &HT;    The inns and eats of Charleston

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The dust never settles in this beguiling
coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   Even as residents cheer the opening of the South Carolina
Aquarium _ a marvel of modern architecture looming over the harbor
_ their longstanding commitment to historic preservation remains
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Quicker than you can say she-crab soup, a former military school
building becomes an all-suites hotel, another musty warehouse opens
as a trendy restaurant or a rundown mansion is reborn as a
distinctive inn.
</P>
<P>
   Horse-drawn carriages packed with sightseers roll slowly through
neighborhoods where once-stately homes reclaim their former
grandeur as young families invest money and lots of sweat equity.
</P>
<P>
   That ``everything old is new again'' vibe is what makes the city
of 80,000 so inviting to the 3.7 million people who visit each
year.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Charleston is busy setting the stage for the annual
Spoleto Festival USA and an influx of families visiting the new
aquarium. And with the town's reputation as a gastronomic mecca
growing ever stronger, it seems like a restaurant opens every
month.
</P>
<P>
   As sure as sweet grass basket vendors ply their trade in the Old
City Market and carriage drivers crack lame jokes about their
horses' city-mandated ``diapers'' being ``emission control
devices,'' visitors this spring and summer will find some hot new
spots as well as some reliable favorites.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to the historic peninsula, we scoped out
the best bites and great places to spend the night. Here are just a
few of your options:
</P>
<P>
   Sweet dreamsa
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wentworth Mansion: When cotton was king, Francis Silas Rogers
was one of the kings of cotton. The wealthy merchant built his
dream home, this Second Empire-style manse, in 1886 at 149
Wentworth St. Since opening as a 21-room inn in September 1998, the
spectacular 24,000-square-foot mansion has been welcoming
discriminating guests who luxuriate in the trappings of the Gilded
Age.
</P>
<P>
   Exquisite architectural details include Tiffany windows,
hand-carved marble fireplaces, carved plaster ceilings and
moldings, colored mosaic floor tiles in the reception hall and
hardwood floors. Topping the four-story inn is a cupola, reached
via a spiral staircase, that provides a 360-degree view of the
city. (See how many church steeples you can count!) The rooms
include king beds clothed in rich linens, fireplaces, large
bathrooms with separate showers and Jacuzzi tubs.
</P>
<P>
   Wine is served in the afternoon in the library; cordials after
dinner. A European-style breakfast _ a lovely spread of freshly
baked breads, fresh fruit, cold cuts and smoked salmon, cheeses and
such _ is served in the sun room.
</P>
<P>
   Such indulgence does not come cheap. Tariffs are $295-$695.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Holiday Inn Historic District: Open since last summer, this
126-unit hotel with deluxe rooms and suites looks not the least bit
like its former incarnation, the Quality Inn Heart of Charleston,
which was gutted to its frame before extensive interior and
exterior renovation began. With a pool and on-site restaurant, it's
a good choice for families. And its location at Calhoun and Meeting
streets is close to the visitors center, the aquarium and the
market. Summer rate is $169.95 double occupancy. 125 Calhoun St.
</P>
<P>
   1-877-805-7900.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On a tight budget? You'll need to look outside the historic
district, where even moderate accommodations such as the Best
Western King Charles Inn, Days Inn and the Hampton Inn are in the
$150-$200 range in the summer (and more during Spoleto). For help
in finding lodging, contact the Charleston Area Convention and
Visitors Bureau (see information at end of article).
</P>
<P>
   Great eatsa
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Circa 1886: The Wentworth Mansion's restored carriage house
opened last fall as an elegant dining room under the supervision of
chef Patrick Ramsey. The grilled beef tenderloin ($26) _
beautifully presented on wild mushroom and foie gras ragout with
haricots verts, chateau potatoes and sauce Diane _ was one of the
best plates of food I've ever eaten. A salad of riesling poached
pear, Danish blue cheese, bacon cracklings and toasted walnuts on
spinach with a warm bacon vinaigrette ($7.75) and a dessert of
pan-fried angel food cake with peach ice cream and warm berry
compote ($6.95) were memorable. 149 Wentworth St.
</P>
<P>
   1-888-466-1886.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  McCrady's Tavern: The story goes that George Washington
quaffed a pint at this tavern built in 1778 by Edward McCrady. Too
bad he missed out on chef Michael Kramer's grilled double-cut pork
chop with sweet potato puree, buttermilk onion rings and apple
cider glaze ($16). It's a perfect example of how Kramer puts a
gourmet spin on a Southern standard. I'm still thinking about the
salad of balsamic grilled pears, red onions, toasted pecans and
Maytag blue cheese ($8) and an exemplary creme brulee ($7). Under
new ownership, McCrady's reopened last summer after an extensive
six-month renovation. The 222-year-old building has been redesigned
with a sleek modern look that complements the brick walls, exposed
beams, massive fireplaces and hardwood floors. Oversize, colorful
oil paintings of fruits and vegetables and a photo-realistic view
of Charleston's rooftops grace the walls. 2 Unity Alley.
843-577-0025.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High Cotton Maverick Bar &AMP; Grill: As in ``fish are jumpin' and
the cotton is high.'' Or maybe as in ``stepping in high cotton.''
For that's what it feels like in this upscale saloon that opened in
November. It's a red-meat kind of place with mahogany woodwork,
brick walls and heart pine floors. Manly men and their ladies may
wish to share a 44-ounce porterhouse for two ($60). Chef Jason
Sholz's no-nonsense menu also features game _ South Carolina squab
($22) and venison medallions ($24) _ along with veal, lamb, pork,
fowl and seafood prepared on the grill or rotisserie. 199 E. Bay
St. 843-724-3815; www.high-cotton.net.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hank's: With its faded hand-painted signs on the facade, this
seafood restaurant in a turn-of-the-century warehouse a block off
the market looks like it has been here for years. Truth is, it
opened in February 1999. The ambience recalls a Charleston fish
house of the '40s with white-jacketed waiters serving chef Frank
McMahon's Lowcountry classics and innovative Southern seafood. We
are intoxicated by the very thought of Seafood a la Wando, a
melange of crab, shrimp and scallops in a great onion and
mushroom-studded cream sauce laced with sherry and served over
fried grits. Entrees from $13.95. 10 Hayne St. 843-723-3474.
</P>
<P>
   Two old favoritesa
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Magnolia's: Since introducing his ``Uptown/Down South'' fare
to Charleston a decade ago, chef Donald Barickman has defined _ and
refined _ the concept of the new cuisine of the Old South.
Barickman's menu relies on locally available ingredients such as
McClellanville lump crab meat, Wadmalaw Island-grown greens,
Clemson blue cheese and Carolina plantation rice. If one menu item
says it all, it's the Down South egg roll with collard greens,
chicken, tasso, spicy mustard and peach chutney ($8.25). It was one
of our starters as we lunched on shrimp, crab and avocado salad
with lemon vinaigrette ($9.50), spicy shrimp and sausage with tasso
gravy over creamy white grits ($9.95) and yellowfin tuna salad on
croissant ($8.95). The dinner menu features such stick-to-your-ribs
entrees as veal meatloaf with mashed potatoes and tobacco onions
($15.25), sauteed crab cakes with black beans and rice and summer
squash ($19.95) and grilled salmon with a Parmesan herb crust,
served with collard greens and red rice ($18.50). 185 E. Bay St.

   &QR;  Slightly North of Broad: Or ``SNOB,'' as locals call it. This
so-called maverick Southern kitchen has been packing crowds in the
19th-century warehouse since 1992 for chef Frank Lee's inventive
take on Southern food. We love this place of faux-finished walls,
painted chandeliers, bold, colorful fabrics and wrought iron _ set
off by brick walls, a 15-foot ceiling and exposed heart-pine beams.
We considered such tantalizing entrees as sesame-crusted tuna with
nori rolls, house-made kim chee, cucumber salad, miso, pickled
ginger and wasabi ($9.50) and grilled pork tenderloin with hoppin'
John, seasonal greens and sweet pepper relish ($8.75). But we
settled on lighter fare: a grilled scallop salad ($10.95) and a
cleverly prepared sauteed chicken salad with country ham, blue
cheese, Granny Smith apples, pecans and arugula with balsamic
vinaigrette ($7.50). A tasty Key lime tart ($5) finished off lunch
in fine style. 192 East Bay St. 843-723-3424.

 &HT;    A STYLE CHAT WITH... Judge Janice Shoob
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 21.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Judging from her clothes, Wendy Shoob doesn't wear
stuffy courtroom attire.
</P>
<P>
   The Fulton County Superior Court judge has her mother, Janice
Shoob, to thank for the little, spaghetti-strap black dresses, slim
skirts and tailored jackets she wears under her black judicial
robe.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 18 years, Janice Shoob, wife of U.S. District Judge
Marvin Shoob, has been designing classic suits, dresses, separates
and evening gowns under the label elan by Janice Paradies. She
works out of her home and tailors beautiful silk, linen, crepe,
cashmere and gabardine into made-to-measure clothing. Prices range
from $175 for a sleeveless shell to $699 for a silk and cashmere
evening gown. (For information: 404-233-8731).
</P>
<P>
   The clothes are quiet classics, but they shout style to her
loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her clothes are distinctive, and they fit,'' says longtime
client Jackie Lassiter, a consumer consultant. ``I love how she
lines her jackets and pants with colorful silks. She adds beautiful
buttons to jackets, too. And the designs are timeless. I bought a
black-and-white dotted silk dress this spring and it goes with
jackets she designed for me six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, writer Marylin Johnson caught up with Janice Shoob at
her daughter's office.
</P>
<P>
   Q:When and how did you get into the ``rag'' business?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had two older sisters and was always reworking their
clothes for them while growing up in Druid Hills. Also, during the
'50s, I did some modeling and in 1962 opened the Casual Bazaar
boutique in East Point. But a fire closed the shop in '73, so I
stayed home to play tennis and do wardrobe consulting. In 1982, I
had a client who couldn't find anything she liked in the stores.
She asked me to design several suits, which she liked. Other
friends asked me to make their clothes. I was hesitant at first to
go into business, but my son Michael said, ``Go for it. You are
always cheerleading for everyone else. It's your turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:How has your business evolved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I started out with one dressmaker and myself. And one client
has grown to 50. I went from having two fashion showings around the
pool of my house for clients and their friends to several small
shows each season in my home workroom for women only. Today, my
niece Jodie Skorecki is my assistant; she helps with the designs,
fittings and billings. And two dressmakers, Karen Meyers and Cindy
Ganoe, make the samples and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are your sources of inspiration?
</P>
<P>
   A:My glamorous memories, old fashion books and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Key to current success?
</P>
<P>
   A:Since I'm a cottage industry, I can stay small and be
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Designer you most admire?
</P>
<P>
   A:Givenchy.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Clothing style you most abhor?
</P>
<P>
   A:Midcalf length. It cuts you at an awkward place on your leg.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Your personal motto?
</P>
<P>
   A:If you are fortunate, you share with others.

<P>
   Style is not about getting noticed, it's about being remembered.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mantra women of all shapes and sizes should say to
themselves, says Michele Weston, author of ``Learning Curves:
Living Your Life in Full and With Style'' (Crown Publishers, $24).
</P>
<P>
   During a recent stop in Atlanta to promote her book, Weston said
she wants to help full-figured women like herself see their own
power and beauty so they can find self-love and acceptance. Part of
that spiritual journey is realizing they can wear whatever style
and color they want, as long as it's flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so busy asking everybody's opinion of what we look like
that we forget to ask ourselves,'' says Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a great bustline, play it up. If you have
beautiful hands, take care of them. Make sure you put your best
foot forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston, 38, doesn't mind telling her age. But don't ask her
weight or dress size.
</P>
<P>
   ``What size am I? My size,'' she replies. ``The right size for
me, right now, this minute in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As fashion and style director of Mode magazine, one of the
hippest magazines on the market for plus-size women, Weston knows
her stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a woman is a size 12, 14, 16 or larger, Weston says
seven basic pieces will get her through any season looking sharp.
Those items are a single-breasted blazer, a narrow skirt of any
length that celebrates her curves, a simple dress, a classic white
shirt, a great pair of trousers, any garment in matte jersey
because it can be worn year-round and a twin sweater set for
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``For summer, look for fabrics that let you breathe and be
comfortable,'' she advises. ``And if you're a person that loves
color, there's a lot of color out there this season that can draw
your eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Lippincott, spokeswoman for Lane Bryant, one of the
leading retailers of fashion-forward clothing for full-size young
women, says ``bare looks are very, very hot for summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for T-shirts with cutout backs, handkerchief tops with
skimpy ties, Capri pants, shirts with three-quarter-inch sleeves,
camisoles with built in bras, short skirts and sun dresses with
lingerie straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say `bare,' it doesn't mean you have to walk out with
every part of your body showing,'' says Lippincott. ``You choose
the part and then buy the article of clothing that accentuates that
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Tips from ``Learning Curves'' on how to accentuate the positive:

 &HT;    A sparkling new aquarium in Charleston, S.C., offers best of all
watery worlds
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 21.
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charleston, S.C. _ The most striking attraction at the new South
Carolina Aquarium is the one that isn't surrounded by glass.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Atlantic bottlenose dolphins perform elegant water ballet
several times an hour. Playful sea otters make cameo appearances.
And coastal birds swoop and soar above visitors' heads, while
turtles paddle through shallow waters at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the aquarium's most striking attraction isn't an
exhibit at all. It's Charleston harbor, which surrounds the
facility on three sides _ enveloping visitors and giving new
meaning to the phrase ``natural setting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just one of many distinguishing features that make the
South Carolina Aquarium, which opened this weekend, a unique
addition to the historic city's tourist draws _ and a worthy
destination for families and nature lovers throughout the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other aquarium in North America has this kind of approach,
where it opens up to a working harbor,'' notes Chris Andrews, the
aquarium's energetic director.
</P>
<P>
   From the waterfront terrace, you can see dockworkers at
Charleston Port Terminal _ barely a stone's throw away _ offloading
some of the $47 million in goods the dock handles daily. And as
sailboats and cruisers zip past, you can watch construction crews
carry out other elements of Charleston's burgeoning waterfront
redevelopment _ an initiative that mirrors similar harbor face
lifts in Boston and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Carolina Aquarium's spectacular riverfront
entrance is only the beginning of the experience here. What's
inside this high-tech fish tank and natural-history museum is also
dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 exhibits in six major galleries showcase the wide
variety of plant and animal life native to South Carolina's
Appalachian watershed _ from cool mountain streams to ocean reefs
miles offshore. Displays range from a small tank of jellyfish to a
massive 330,000-gallon central aquarium with hundreds of species.
Some 10,000 animals call the aquarium home _ from tiny shrimp and
dainty angelfish to a 50-pound cubera snapper.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium was 14 years in the making; its opening caps a
knotty history of planning, funding and development. In preparing
the site for construction, for instance, city officials discovered
toxic wastes from a coal gasification plant.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the city, state and federal government _ and the
utility responsible for the contamination _ came up with the $69
million in mostly public funding needed to clean up the site and
build the facility. And today, this stretch of Charleston
waterfront is a showcase for a significant environmental success
story.
</P>
<P>
   The private nonprofit organization that operates the aquarium
projects 1 million visitors a year. They will encounter a facility
that has combined, and expanded upon, some of the best elements of
the nation's most prominent aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chattanooga's Tennessee Aquarium, the Charleston facility
replicates a variety of ecosystems _ but goes further by depicting
specific South Carolina habitats, with native plants and animals.
Like aquariums in Boston and Baltimore, it sits on the waterfront _
but takes greater advantage of its location by providing an
open-air harbor-side terrace. And like Miami's Seaquarium, the new
aquarium promotes interaction with wildlife _ but offers more for
younger visitors, with many ground-level exhibits for toddlers to
examine and manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every new aquarium that opens steals from the best of the
others, but the trick is to bring something unique to it,'' says
Andrews, 47, a native of Bath, England, who worked at the London
Zoo and Baltimore's National Aquarium before coming to Charleston
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the South Carolina focus, another distinguishing feature
is the aquarium's science-education program. It meets the minimum
testing requirements for math and science for South Carolina
elementary and high school students, says spokeswoman Tara Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good cities do is increase the education and edification
of their citizens,'' says Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. ``We
are building this for our citizens, and most especially for every
child in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   A primary goal, he adds, is for each aquarium visitor to leave
``with a new set of environmental goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews knows it will take goose bumps for the South Carolina
Aquarium ``to show people why they should care about the natural
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you touch people's emotions, all the science in the
world won't make a difference.''
</P>

 &HT;    If Sprint's deal fails, BellSouth in spotlight
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should regulators move to block the WorldCom purchase of Sprint,
BellSouth would watch closely_ but it might just stay a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's interest had to be piqued when news broke Thursday
that Justice Department staff is apparently recommending rejection
of the deal. After all, BellSouth threw $100 billion on the table
in October in what proved a failed bid to win Sprint, only to be
outgunned when WorldCom raised its offer to $115 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Jeff Battcher declined to speculate one way or
another. ``We don't comment on our own deals, much less somebody
else's.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that acquisition falters, shouldn't BellSouth reopen the
checkbook? Maybe, but a lot has changed.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth in October seemed to see Sprint as one big bet. It
seemed the deal in a flash would have reshaped BellSouth into a
national player that could compete with the likes of AT&AMP;T, Bell
Atlantic and _ of course _ WorldCom. BellSouth would have Sprint's
national wireless unit and its network of high-speed lines _ an
Internet backbone. Sprint's long-distance unit was alluring as
well, since BellSouth expected to have approval for long-distance
within months.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now, BellSouth seems to need different things _
and maybe even to be different.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, BellSouth has forged a deal with SBC to
merge wireless businesses and buy whatever new licenses are needed
for a national offering. BellSouth has announced plans for a
tracking stock to represent its Latin American unit. In Europe,
BellSouth inked an alliance with KPN Telecom, promising an expanded
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The company most recently announced plans to deliver television
and other digital services via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Even what hasn't changed seems to speak against a merger:
BellSouth is still not permitted in long-distance and may not be
until next year. Buying Sprint would require either a creative
arrangement or a prolonged wait to enjoy all its fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sprint also comes with some baggage that is only
moderately attractive. For instance, it has a large but slowly
growing local phone unit, some of which borders BellSouth turf.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, BellSouth has proved willing to gamble. And Sprint's
high-speed lines remain especially enticing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule out another BellSouth bid,'' said analyst Jeff
Kagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the timing was right and the value was there for
the shareholders, I think they could make another go of it.''

 &HT;    Ailing Finster bounces back for folk art fest
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMMERVILLE, Ga. _ Howard Finster, who has used his folk art to
preach about getting ready for God before he gets ready for you,
has faced death in the face this spring. And the score is: Finster
1, Death 0.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old artist developed double pneumonia after a March
speaking engagement at New York's Museum of American Folk Art. ``I
thought he was gone,'' Beverly Finster said of her father's third
subsequent hospital visit, following an insulin reaction. ``He's
grown a lot weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for his prodigious output _ more than 46,000 numbered
works since 1976 _ Finster was unable to paint anything for five
weeks. Nor could he make appearances at Atlanta's Dogwood and Inman
Park festivals or his usual Sunday visits to Paradise Gardens, the
folk art environment here that is considered his greatest creation.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sounds dire, except when you check in on Finster
himself, busily painting a wooden cutout of a giant Coca-Cola
bottle in his studio one afternoon this week. Sporting a healthy
glow, if walking unsteadily with a cane, he pauses during a nonstop
preach-a-thon to extol the virtue of direct sun daily. ``You're
looking pale, kind of German,'' he informs a visitor, sunnily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fixing to leave this here world,'' he goes on to state
matter of factly. ``I've got a limited distance left to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But before he checks out, he says, he has work to do, trying to
restock Paradise Gardens' gallery and readying for this weekend's
Howard Finster Fest.
</P>
<P>
   He wearies just thinking about the endless line of autograph
seekers. ``I don't look forward to nothing at this point,'' Finster
harrumphs, before quickly adding, ``but I'll try to be there for
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard
</P>
<P>
   Finster Fest
</P>
<P>
   Sixty folk artists show and sell their works.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. $5 adults, $2 children. Paradise
Gardens, three miles north of downtown Summerville. 1-800-
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Series hype aside, networks jockey for advertising billions
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Drew Carey walked out onto the stage of Radio City
Music Hall this week and passed judgment on the spectacle that
brought his audience of advertisers, ad buyers and TV station
managers together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, this is like hype with a capital `YPE,''' Carey cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is. This week, the six broadcast networks announced
their fall schedules in a dizzying round-robin of high-profile
presentations and parties. Television viewers themselves are
secondary in this process; the target is the advertising community,
which in the coming weeks will spend between $7 billion and $8
billion on the 2000-2001 television season. Much of that will come
from big-bucks companies _ the Coca-Colas, General Motorses, Kodaks
and beer makers.
</P>
<P>
   The money is spent upfront, before the season begins in the
fall. Hence, the announcements are known in the industry as ``the
upfronts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal way would be for every advertiser to see every
show,'' said David Marans, a senior partner at J. Walter Thompson
advertising agency. ``But this is the shortcut method. We get more
of an understanding of the concept behind the scheduling.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisers also get the royal treatment. The networks go
all out: NBC rented the Metropolitan Opera House to make its
announcement Monday; ABC took over Radio City Music Hall on
Tuesday; CBS made its presentation at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday,
then moved the whole shebang of several hundred people to Tavern on
the Green for a party with CBS stars. Radio ``shock jock'' Howard
Stern showed up at the classy restaurant (wearing sunglasses
indoors), but you could hardly get near him for all the young media
buyers lined up to pay homage. There was sushi and prime rib and
cameo appearances by the likes of David Letterman, Faith Hill and
WWF wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars are at stake, many high-powered people are
here, yet one of the main things to do at the upfronts is stand in
line to get your picture taken with TV stars. At ABC's party
Tuesday night under a tent behind the New York Public Library, the
longest line was for ``NYPD Blue'' with Dennis Franz and newcomer
Henry Simmons, who plays hunky detective Baldwin Jones. Heather
Locklear and Charlie Sheen of ``Spin City'' (Sheen replaces Michael
J. Fox in the fall) drew big crowds as well. NBC didn't muster up
any of the cast of ``Friends'' (despite their multimillion-dollar
contract renewal deal) or ``ER,'' but the Polaroid groupies didn't
mind because the casts of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and ``The West Wing''
were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather be fishing,'' admitted Ryan Stiles, who stars
in ``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you gotta do it. ABC pays us good money.'' That was about
all he had time to say, as he was yanked back for another picture
with his ``Carey'' castmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little strange,'' WB star Jamie Foxx said. ``But I'm
very good at schmoozing _ that's what this business is about.''
</P>
<P>
   The slightly surreal upfronts are only a small part of the very
big business of selling TV advertising. In the season that draws to
a close next week, the six networks reportedly took in almost $17
billion in advertising revenue, a record. Sales for the coming
season are expected to top that. A 30 second spot runs from $80,000
for a low-rated show to $400,000 on an ``ER'' or ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire.'' In addition, it is an election year, which means
lots of political advertising, and an Olympic year, which benefits
only NBC but will push overall spending even higher. Plus, dot-com
companies, most of which didn't exist a few years ago, continue to
pump millions into TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   All this despite the broadcast networks overall declining
audience. For years, the networks have been fretting about
``erosion'': the slow drop-off of their audiences as viewers surf
over to upstart networks (Fox, the WB, UPN), cable networks, or
turn to home computers, the Internet and video games. This season
the combined Nielsen ratings of ABC, CBS and NBC were up slightly,
but virtually all of that increase was because of one show: the
unstoppable phenomenon ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Regis
Philbin's game show is expected to generate more than $400 million
in ad revenue next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' remains the elephant in the living room of
network TV. CBS President Leslie Moonves fantasized Wednesday about
taking out a mafia contract on Philbin's life, but Ray Romano, star
of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' had another idea. In a quick
stand-up routine for advertisers Wednesday at Carnegie Hall, Romano
joked that he had pitched CBS on the one show that could beat
``Millionaire'': ``Who Wants to Spank a Supermodel?''
</P>
<P>
   New shows are introduced with about five minutes worth of clips,
and already some deals were being made, said J. Walter Thompson's
Marans. But most of the ad buyers will wait until next week, when
the networks will send them the full pilot episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually wait to see them, but then it goes very fast,''
said Jennifer Leavans, national broadcast manager for Round Two
Communications, an ad-buying agency. ``We'll make most of our buys
in a week or two, usually based on time slot and potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Time slot is key. ``The Steven Weber Show,'' a new NBC comedy,
will rake in mega-bucks because it will air after ``Friends,'' and
is therefore almost guaranteed a large audience.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really matter whether the ad buyers like the shows
they're buying time on. ``It's all about serving the clients'
needs,'' said Mike Callahan, a negotiator for ad agency Mindshare.
``Personally, I like Yasmine Bleeth,'' he added, making it clear by
his expression that he was referring to the former ``Baywatch''
actress, who wore an extremely tight copper bodysuit to NBC's
party, rather than her new show, the soap opera ``Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do many advertisers care that much about content, said
Jessica Reif, media analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``Some of them care
about what's surrounding their message in the medium,'' Reif said.
Extreme shows, such as ``The Jerry Springer Show'' and ``WWF
Smackdown!'' (UPN's pro wrestling show), don't bring in advertising
revenue commensurate with their ratings, but most prime-time shows
don't raise eyebrows. The days of advertisers trying to influence
content are largely over, Reif said.
</P>
<P>
   So the biggest unanswered question of the upfronts is this: Why
aren't they on television? The medium seems to put on everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one of the highest-rated specials of the year,''
said Marans. ``Twenty million people would die to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's a lot here the average viewer wouldn't enjoy:
a parade of network suits spinning like mad, talking about
demographics and using terms like ``over-indexing,'' which
basically means a show is doing really well.
</P>
<P>
   But with Letterman telling jokes as he did at the CBS
presentation Wednesday, along with David Copperfield doing magic
tricks and Faith Hill singing a gospel number, or with Hank
Williams Jr. rocking out on ``Are You Ready for Some Football?''
accompanied by a dozen dancers in hot pants to promote ABC's
``Monday Night Football,'' the networks probably could have grabbed
a few ratings points.

TAIWAN LEADER SAID TO PLAN NO SHIFTS THAT WOULD ANTAGONIZE
BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ On the eve of an extraordinarily sensitive
transfer of power here, Taiwan's soon-to-be foreign minister said
the new president, Chen Shui-bian, would make no sudden shifts in
Taiwan's policy toward China and would continue to send soothing
signals to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian will not give China any easy excuse to
retaliate with force,'' said the minister, Tien Hung-mao, referring
to the closely watched inaugural address that Chen will deliver on
Saturday. ``It's going to be a very conciliatory kind of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tien also warned outsiders not to expect any dramatic
overture from Chen, who swept the Nationalist Party from power in
March after a half-century of rule. Having won with less than 40
percent of the vote, he said the president-elect did not have a
mandate to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the fundamental principles that our country stands for, he
will not make a concession,'' Tien said. ``He cannot. He's not
mandated to make a concession.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes it very unlikely that in the speech, or in the near
future, Chen will grant Beijing's demand for reopening negotiations
across the Taiwan Strait: that Taiwan accept the idea that it and
the People's Republic are part of a single China. Since his
election, Chen has said he is willing to discuss the concept of
``one China,'' but will not accept it as a precondition for talks.
</P>
<P>
   China has repeatedly warned that if Taiwan veers toward
independence, it will use force to take the island. With Beijing
likely to scrutinize Chen's words, Tien said the president-elect
was putting the passage of the speech that deals with China through
endless drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope there will be enough of a way out for China to say,
`At least Chen Shui-bian did not say that. He met our minimum
criteria for continuing,''' Tien said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deadlock between Taipei and Beijing on ``one China'' has
brought relations to one of their tensest points in years. China's
leaders were rattled by the election of Chen, whose Democratic
Progressive Party formally espouses independence. Chen has said
such a step is unnecessary, but recent remarks by his vice
president, Annette Lu, have led China to unleash threats.
</P>
<P>
   Tien denied a recent report that the new Taipei administration
had requested that the United States play a more active role in
mediating the dispute. He also played down recent remarks by the
new head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, Tsai Ying-wen, in
which she expressed hope that Washington would be a ``facilitator''
of new talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been happening for many years,'' Tien said, referring
to frequent discussions about cross-straits policy held in the
United States. Those talks, though not official, bring together
Taiwanese, Chinese and American scholars and former government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tien, who is the chairman of a policy research institute, said
that as foreign minister he would push for more such exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a political breakthrough, Tien said he counted
on flourishing economic ties between Taiwan and China to bridge the
gap. Shortly after the election, Chen proposed to lift the ban on
direct trade, transportation and postal service between the two
countries. He also said he would consider lifting strict limits on
Taiwanese investment on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwanese companies are not allowed to invest more than
$50 million in any single project in China, there are an estimated
35,000 Taiwan companies with operations there. Businesses are
pushing to be allowed to invest in Chinese infrastructure projects,
investment that is now prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that business people are starting to be
subjected to the same pressure as politicians like Chen. The
Chinese government recently summoned the local representatives of
Taiwanese companies with ties to Chen and his party to warn them
that their mainland operations would be penalized if they were
perceived as advocating independence for the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pressuring a lot of businessmen to verbally express
their loyalty to the `one China' principle,'' Tien said.
``Taiwanese businessmen will have to come to a decision whether it
is worth it for them to make a political concession to make a few
extra dollars in China.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Taiwan's leading industrialists, Stan Shih, visited
Beijing two weeks ago to try to assure the Chinese authorities that
he planned to steer clear of the independence debate. Shih,
chairman of the computer maker Acer Inc., is a longtime supporter
of Chen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been worried by unnecessary political pressure from the
Beijing authorities,'' said Rick Lei, the president of Acer's
digital services division, who accompanied Shih on the trip. Acer
recently obtained a license to run a test of an Internet-access
service in mainland China.

 &HT;    Ray Lewis jury pool cross-examined on `hot seat'
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One potential juror described how he was falsely
accused of fondling a girl. One talked about his wife being raped.
Another had to recount his two DUIs.
</P>
<P>
   This week in the courtroom of Fulton County Superior Court Judge
Alice D. Bonner, stories of regular people _ not an NFL star _ are
the stories that count. One by one, potential jurors for the
Buckhead stabbings case have been grilled by as many as four
lawyers at a time and sometimes the judge herself.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes irritated, often fidgeting and usually stone-faced,
jurors sit in what Bonner calls the ``hot seat,'' the middle chair
of the jury box. To shield their identities, they are referred to
only by designated numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers have qualified 32, enough
prospective jurors to pick a 12-person jury. But questioning
continues so they can get six alternates for the anticipated
month-long trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner expressed frustration late Thursday at the pace of
questioning and expected length of the case, saying, ``This trial
should last one week in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some potential jurors have been quizzed for 45 minutes,
explaining their opinions about law enforcement, professional
sports, O.J. Simpson's acquittal and rap music.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, a stagehand who likes old Westerns, wondered
aloud toward the end of his inquisition what could be worse:
serving on this jury or keeping a dentist's appointment next week
to get a tooth pulled.
</P>
<P>
   With testimony expected to begin Tuesday, the trial of All Pro
linebacker Ray Lewis, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting is
expected to provide up to a month of grand courtroom theater. But
this week the spotlight is on the trial's most important audience _
those who will be picked to decide whether the defendants are
guilty of killing two Decatur men on Jan. 31 after a night of
post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   TV courtroom dramas highlight emotional closing arguments and
blistering cross-examinations. But to attorneys who try cases for a
living, victory depends on picking the right jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important process in a criminal trial,'' Atlanta
criminal defense lawyer Brian Steel said. ``Most people think this
isn't a big deal. But this is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, jury selection is a time to plant ideas in jurors'
heads before they hear a single witness, Steel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical,'' said District Attorney Paul Howard, who
starts off apologizing to each potential juror for the personal
nature of his questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case we have a football player, and you have to look
for someone who is not enamored or intimidated by that,'' Howard
said Thursday during a courtroom break. ``That's important because
this is America and we as a society pay a lot of attention to
people in entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   While about four dozen Fulton residents who have been questioned
do not constitute a representative sample of Fulton's 750,000
residents _ 53 percent black and 45 percent white. But they do
offer a snapshot of mindsets and life experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Many have loved ones who were gunshot victims or are serving
time in prison. Many don't trust the news media. Some have great
faith in law enforcement. Some have no trust in it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they enjoy TV crime shows. ``COPS'' is a big favorite.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted lawyer David Wolfe, who represents Oakley, to ask
one juror if he thought it would be appropriate if TV aired a
program that showed the police arresting the wrong man. ``They can
call the show `Oops,' '' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   While some folks are clearly eager to serve on the high-profile
case, several, like Juror 21, were surprised at the serious task at
hand. ``This is my first time (in jury service); I was anticipating
something a lot lighter, like maybe traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Several tried everything they could to wiggle out of it. Bonner,
who excused jurors for family emergencies, has had little sympathy
for other perceived woes.
</P>
<P>
   One college student complained about the imposition and said she
would be ``resentful'' if chosen as a juror. ``I don't think she
has a mature attitude,'' said Bonner as she excused the young woman
from the pool.
</P>
<P>
   A technology consultant complained jury duty would hurt his
business, making him incapable of giving the defendants a fair
trial. Bonner promptly excused him, but not before firing a parting
shot: ``We'd be in trouble,'' she said, if more citizens ducked
their civic responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   While jury selection offers a glimpse into the lives of everyday
people, it also allows observers _ and the opposing side _ to glean
glimpses of trial strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the defenses seem to be:
</P>
<P>
   _ people were drunk, the victims' group picked a fight and Lewis
tried to be a ``peacemaker''.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweeting was defending himself and his friends, especially the
women with him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oakley was knocked senseless by a champagne bottle and in no
shape to kill anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defense will be able to eliminate 12 potential
jurors. Prosecutors can ``strike'' six.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers like what they see in the jury pool. Initially,
the defense asked Bonner for additional jury strikes. But
Wednesday, they waived that request, so prosecutors wouldn't get
extra strikes too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can certainly understand that,'' Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   Juror No. 38 said of Lewis, ``He's a good football player; You
got to respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   This same juror said he believed ``half of the police in Atlanta
are dirty.'' He was asked very few questions by defense attorneys.
Prosecutors tried to get him stricken, but Bonner refused.
</P>
<P>
   One older woman had both a godson and grandson murdered and
appeared to be a prosecutor's dream juror _ until she was asked
what she remembers most about the case. ``He (Lewis) was at the
scene but he actually didn't do it,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Howard tried to get Bonner to remove her for cause. The judge
disagreed and prosecutors must now use one of their six strikes to
keep her off the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Another, a young man, said he didn't like sports or defense
lawyers. ``It's not right a lot of guilty rich people go free,'' he
wrote in a questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' team asked Bonner to strike him. She refused. Now Lewis's
team must use a strike on him.
</P>
<P>
   One juror said ``You can't judge a book by it's cover,'' and
Juror 35 was certainly an example of that.
</P>
<P>
   The man, a white, older middle-aged Sandy Springs man appeared
to be a prosecutor favorite when he told of his initial reaction to
news about the killings: ``Obviously, at 4 a.m. the parties were
probably drunk or on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis attorney Ed Garland then asked what he thought about
people being out in Buckhead at that hour.

 &HT;    Farewell forecast: Growth to slow
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mortgage rates approaching 10 percent and a sluggish
stock market over the next two years will chill the nation, but
that will seem doubly true for the red-hot Atlanta economy, Georgia
State University economist Donald Ratajczak said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and the rest of the nation probably won't enter a
recession unless there's a stock market crash or slowdown in
economic growth around the globe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it may feel like the local economy has slowed to a crawl
after so many years as being one of the fastest-growing in the
nation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good times (in Georgia) have been so good that this return
to more normal economic behavior will appear as if the economy has
stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown will result from the Federal Reserve's turn toward
a tighter money policy this week, he said. The Fed raised a key
borrowing rate by a half percentage point Tuesday after several
previous quarter-point increases, and signaled that more rate
boosts are likely.
</P>
<P>
   In his final forecast as head of GSU's Economic Forecasting
Center, Ratajczak predicted that Georgia's economy will still grow
by a healthy 4.5 percent this year and by less than 3 percent next
year. Ratajczak has headed GSU's economic forecasting center for 27
years.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the nation's economy will grow by a robust 5.1
percent this year but slow to a little over 3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The economy in Georgia and its leading city will slow more
dramatically than the nation's economy, he said, and it will be the
first time in a decade that the state's economy will lag the
nation's.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's economy grew by 5.5 percent last year, GSU estimated,
while Atlanta accounted for almost three-fourths of the 149,000 new
jobs in the state last year.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's job growth will drop to about 124,300 this year and
78,800 next year because of corporate restructurings at Coca-Cola
and other companies, slowing residential construction and starting
a shakeout in the overbuilt retail industry, GSU's economists
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta home builder John Wieland said he has already seen a 10
percent drop in sales by his firm, which last year sold 800 homes
with an average price of $340,000. ``I wouldn't be surprised to see
the market drop 20 percent'' within three months, said Wieland, who
is also chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The drought in Georgia will also hurt farm incomes and cause
scattered bank closings and weak farmland prices in rural Georgia,
said Ratajczak.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia's job growth should still be enough to keep the
apartment and condo market hopping, said Ellen Burnstein, senior
consultant at Dale Henson Associates, an Atlanta multifamily
residential market analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a lot of jobs,'' she said. ``The demand for apartments
is still there as long as employment stays high.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Turner, an agent with Re/Max of Atlanta, said he
probably won't notice a slowdown in home sales for another month
because most clients already have locked in lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But if mortgage rates top 9 percent, he added, his home sales
will probably drop off 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the nation's home buyers and other consumers will soon
feel deceleration's grip since the Federal Reserve has ``lost
patience'' with small rate boosts of a quarter percentage point,
said Ratajczak.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed will ``get into the dramatic area,'' said Ratajczak, if
it repeats this week's action by raising rates twice more by a half
percentage point each.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a mistake the Fed has a history of repeating, he
added, by not waiting long enough for earlier rate boosts to take
effect before piling on more draconian measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking two aspirin for a headache, then 10 minutes
later, taking two more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed ``knows its history, too,'' said Wieland. ``I think
the Fed is sensitive to that issue. Hopefully ... it won't overdo
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak predicted that mortgage rates will hit 9.5 percent by
early next year and that real interest rates (after inflation) will
be about 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At that level, the U.S. economy historically declines at least
for a quarter, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak also predicted that the stock market, as measured by
the Dow Jones industrial average, will rise only about 5 percent
this year, compared with 20-plus percent gains in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   When interest rates rise that high, it's ``very difficult for
stock market values to rise significantly,'' he said.

 &HT;    New fall TV schedule
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David E. Kelley will do to high school teachers next
fall what he's been doing to lawyers for years: turn them into
heroes and clowns, examining them through his own strange vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Public,'' a comedy-drama with a large interracial
ensemble cast set in a Boston public high school, will be Kelley's
next series venture for Fox. It will air at 8 p.m. Mondays in the
fall, making it a companion piece to Kelley's ``Ally McBeal.''
There's even the possibility of crossovers between the shows, since
``Ally'' is set in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of five new series Fox announced to advertisers at the
New York ``upfronts.'' The others:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dark Angel'' (9 p.m. Tuesdays) is a strange looking
futuristic thriller that looks as if it blends ``Blade Runner''
grunge with ``X-Files'' paranoia. It stars Jessica Alba CQ and was
created by James Cameron (''Titanic'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Don't Ask'' (8 p.m. Wednesdays) stars John Goodman
(``Roseanne'') as a divorced, gay father.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Schimmel'' (8:30 p.m. Wednesdays) is loosely based on the
life of stand-up comedian Robert Schimmel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Street'' (9 p.m. Wednesdays) is from Darren Star,
creator of ``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex in the City.'' It's a drama
about the personal and professional lives of young Wall Street
hotshots and stars Tom Everett Scott (``That Thing You Do'').
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for midseason are ``The Tick,'' a comic-book adventure
starring Patrick Warburton (``Seinfeld'') as a clueless crusader,
and ``The Lone Gunmen,'' the ``X-Files'' spinoff about the three
geeky paranoids who help and hinder Mulder and Scully on that show.
</P>
<P>
   And Mulder and Scully were on hand Friday, in the form of David
Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. As previously reported, ``The
X-Files'' will return for an eighth season, but with Duchovny in a
limited number of episodes (Daily Variety reports 11). Fox
Television Entertainment Group chairman Sandy Grushow said that
Mulder will be abducted in the season finale that airs Sunday
(5/21), and will be missing when the season opens next fall. Scully
will be paired with a new partner, but Mulder will return some time
into the show's run.
</P>
<P>
   `The guy network'
</P>
<P>
   UPN also announced its new fall lineup Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud to be known as the guy network,'' said CEO Dean
Valentine, who saw his network surge in the ratings this season by
adding ``WWF Smackdown!'' ``Somebody needs to stand up for the
high-testosterone American male.''
</P>
<P>
   That somebody is UPN, which adds:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Freedom'' (8 p.m. Fridays), an action-adventure drama about
a future in which the military has taken over the United States,
and a band of former soldiers become freedom fighters. It features
lots of Hong Kong film action stunts, such as balletic slo-mo
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Level Nine'' (9 p.m. Fridays), another action-adventure
series, this one about cops who fight cybercrime.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Girlfriends'' (9:30 p.m. Mondays), a sitcom about several
affluent African-American women, led by Tracee Ross, Diana's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Hughleys'' (9 p.m. Mondays), the sitcom starring D.L.
Hughley that ABC dropped and UPN picked up. ``I'm glad to have a
job, I ain't gonna lie,'' Hughley said Thursday at UPN's upfront
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   UPN also confirmed that next season, the seventh, will be the
last for ``Star Trek: Voyager.''

 &HT;    Taiwan to inaugurate chief amid `one China' strife
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In Taiwan on Saturday, Chen Shui-bian will deliver his
inaugural address as president of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Weidong won't be there.
</P>
<P>
   But, across the Taiwan Strait on the Chinese mainland, he will
be paying close attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the Taiwan issue is becoming more important, more
urgent, more complex, more complicated and more sensitive,'' said
the director of the political section of China's Research Institute
of Taiwan Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, like the leaders of his government, takes an uncompromising
stance toward Taiwan. He has kept a wary eye on Chen and his
Democratic Progressive Party for years. And he's not swayed by the
conciliatory gestures Chen has made to the mainland since his
election March 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, he is a separatist,'' said the scholar, speaking
through an interpreter. ``He has advocated for Taiwan's
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Taipei mayor's election as president is the most
significant development in the past half-century of cross-strait
relations, Zhu suggested, and it has made relations between China
and Taiwan ``more unpredictable'' than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Before Chen's election, China issued a White Paper declaring it
would not wait indefinitely for Taiwan to reunify with the
mainland. Blood could flow if the island balked, political and
military leaders warned.
</P>
<P>
   With Chen's inauguration nearing, Beijing has pumped up the
pressure. A Hong Kong daily reported this week that a central
government task force was considering deadlines for reunification.
If no progress is made by 2003, the paper said, the task force
might ask the National People's Congress to decide whether force
would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China's People's Daily editorialized that ``no
lasting peace'' is possible unless Chen embraces the ``one China''
principle and accepts ``the fact that Taiwan is part of China.''
And the China Business Times threatened that ``war in the Taiwan
Strait will be difficult to avoid'' if Chen's speech ``inclines
toward Taiwan independence.''
</P>
<P>
   China's menacing behavior has been condemned from abroad, and
the heightened cross-strait tensions appear to have flared at an
unfortunate time for Beijing's other pressing interests. While
issuing war threats, the government is also seeking closer trading
status with the United States and Europe. A critical vote on
granting China permanent normal trade relations is scheduled in the
U.S. House next week.
</P>
<P>
   A stony-faced Zhu insisted his government will stay the course
on the Taiwan issue, however. Bristling at what he called
``malicious actions'' against China by ``some elements in your
country,'' he lashed out at the House vote in February to deepen
America's military ties to Taiwan. That measure has been placed on
a back-burner in the Senate, but, if the bill ever does become law,
Zhu said, ``it will do great harm to bi-lateral relations. ... The
Chinese government is really watching with vigilance about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Americans are involved deeply in the Taiwan
issue right now,'' he added sternly. ``This is not a wise choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's president-elect, who began his political career as a
lawyer defending democracy advocates, has said he is willing to
discuss the ``one China'' principle but will not commit to it in
his inaugural address because Taiwan lacks consensus on its
relationship with China. Even so, Chen predicted this week, his
inaugural address will not give Beijing any excuse to find fault.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, for one, will be a tough audience, however. He doubts that
Chen, who won election with just under 40 percent of the vote, will
try to declare independence formally. But he sees Taiwan pursuing
de facto separation from China while dragging its feet on
re-unification.
</P>
<P>
   China controlled Taiwan for only four years in the 21st century,
between the end of Japanese occupation of the island and the advent
of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But to Zhu, only a traitor to China would consider giving up the
claim to ownership. ``Chinese people and Chinese leaders cannot
accept that the territory of the country become smaller,'' he
argued.
</P>
<P>
   With Hong Kong and Macau back under Chinese control, resolving
the Taiwan issue has taken on new urgency, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to regain control over the prosperous island already
has hampered plans for the nation's overall economic development,
he said. And China also considers Taiwan vital to its national
security: ``It is a strategic post for the international community.
That's why during the Cold War the Americans called Taiwan the ...
unsinkable warship.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu _ whose institute is part of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences think tank _ said repeatedly that he speaks for ``1.2
billion Chinese people,'' all of whom favor reunification and a
quick resolution of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is not so easily measured, but the government's
bellicose attitude does appear to be playing well, at least on the
streets of Beijing. A taxi driver, soft-drink vendors, a peddler
and retirees out for a walk with their grandchildren all agreed
that Taiwan should reunite with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong press has reported China may engage in military
exercises and step up its propaganda campaign against Taiwan if
Chen fails to accept the ``one China'' concept.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military, meanwhile, has been placed on a state of
``heightened alertness'' for the inaugural period.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu declined, however, to discuss what he called ``hypothetical
questions'' about China's likely response to Chen's speech.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he said, his government is ``adopting a stance
to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The scholars with his institute and other research institutions
focusing on Taiwan ``hope this issue can be resolved peacefully,''
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he added, ``the better the military preparations are,
the more possible it is that reunification takes place.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Q I have been an administrative assistant at this
company for many years, and until recently I shared an office with
another assistant who moved away. Her replacement is a very
difficult person who talks on the phone all the time and is rude to
everyone here, including customers. I have spoken to her manager,
but she refuses to do anything about her. What should I do now?
F.P.
</P>
<P>
   A When sharing an office with an administrative assistant who
does not do much administering or assisting, you have already
played one important card by going to her manager. The fact that
her manager refuses to even look into the situation indicates that
her managerial skills are in the skimpy range.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are still a couple of cards that you may
want to play. If you have a solid working relationship with your
own manager, you should consider discussing the situation with him
or her. Your manager may be better able to prevail on your nasty
associate's manager. Another option is for you to have a
businesslike conversation with the new administrative assistant
yourself. The likelihood of her changing her ways as a result of
anything you might say is slim, but it may be worth a try if she
can spare a few moments between personal calls.
</P>
<P>
   If she is truly as difficult as you described, it should just be
a matter of time before complaints from customers and other
employees start to roll in. When this occurs, either her manager is
going to have to take action to deal with her, or senior management
may have to take action to deal with both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q I've been with this company for almost a year, and now that
summer is approaching I want to take my vacation. When I joined, I
did not think that much about the amount of vacation time, but now
I'm very annoyed that it's only one week. It seems too short. What
do you think? M.R. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A When you ask people how they enjoyed their monthlong vacation,
their typical response is that it was too short. Either way, the
time to focus on your company's vacation benefit is not when your
vacation is around the corner, but when you are first considering
the employment offer.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that one week's vacation after one year is slightly
below average for most companies. If there is a trend, it is that
larger companies tend to grant more days of paid vacation than
smaller companies, but even this is not always the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, perhaps your company has other paid time off
benefits that compensate for this vacation package, such as through
the number of paid holidays or paid personal leave. Depending upon
what's available, perhaps you can batch some of your other paid
time off with the vacation benefit.
</P>
<P>
   If the number of paid vacation days in your company is
considerably lower than that provided by similar companies in your
industry and area, you should discuss this with your manager or the
human resources representative if there is one. In this labor
market, employers will take all sorts of steps to prevent their
employees from packing their bags permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Q I quit my job due to a co-worker's interference with my work.
This person was messing with my remittance reports when I was at
lunch, among other devious tactics. I spoke to my employer several
times, but my employer did not believe me! How do I answer the
question, ``Why did you leave your last job,'' without sounding
like I can't get along with people? S.A.
</P>
<P>
   A At one point or another, everyone has worked with an
impossible co- worker, and this applies to job interviewers as
well. If you simply tell the truth about what happened here, there
is no reason for any professional interviewer to conclude that you
are a troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Job interviewers typically look for trends and themes in your
work history. If you left several jobs because of difficulties with
fellow employees, then one might start to wonder about your
interpersonal skills.
</P>
<P>
   In your paperwork and job interview, be sure to mention several
examples of ways that you worked easily and productively with
others. In other words, do not simply say that you get along well.
Rather, describe the situations where you worked effectively with
others, such as through your team projects, friendships you made,
your formal or informal leadership responsibilities, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to reference checks, you should try to have names
of more than one person who can be contacted from your old job.
There are obviously two sides to your situation, and a potential
employer should hear both.
</P>

LIGHTING UP A LESSON IN CHINA TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By TOM REDBURN 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meandering through a flea market in Shanghai, China, earlier
this year with Craig Smith, The New York Times' new correspondent
there, I stopped at a stall that was selling cheap cigarette
lighters with pictures of Mao Tse-tung pasted on them. Flick one
open, and it plays the tune of ``The East Is Red.'' I don't smoke,
but I couldn't resist buying a handful.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, another merchant offered hundreds of hand-painted
posters from the days of the Cultural Revolution. I bought one
dated 1976, showing a smiling Mao leading a parade of workers and
students into the promised land. We bargained a bit before settling
on a price of about $5.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about capitalism, but you must admit it has a
marvelous way of turning even the most violent and earthshaking
upheavals into safe, salable kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   That, above all, is why it is worth continuing to encourage
Beijing to move along the path toward freer markets, private
investment and open trade. Karl Marx (remember him?) said it as
well as anybody in, of all places, the Communist Manifesto:
</P>
<P>
   ``The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments
of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication,
draws all nations, even the most barbarian, into civilization. The
cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which
it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the
barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to
capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   What does this have to do with today's debate over China?
Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The choice facing Congress this week over granting China what is
called ``permanent normal trade relations'' _ part of a deal to
admit China to the World Trade Organization _ turns on conflicting
views of how to best induce change in China's authoritarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   On one side _ opposed to normalizing trade _ are those who argue
that Congress should vote every year on China's trade status, thus
maintaining outside pressure on Beijing to respond to complaints of
human rights abuses. The annual vote should not be given up, they
say, because it is Washington's only stick for persuading China to
ease repression and to free dissidents. Treating China as a normal
trading partner, they say, will just entrench the current regime
and encourage its belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing that view are those who believe that change inside
China can exert greater leverage for reform than any diplomatic
pressure. Through broader trade and contact with the outside world,
the Chinese people will be exposed to the full range of Western
life, from the sublime to the ridiculous. In the end, the
temptation will prove irresistible. Treat China as a normal
country, this side argues, and it will eventually turn into one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Openness is a two-way street,'' Nicholas Lardy, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution, said last week in a telephone
interview from Beijing. ``Already there are thousands of foreigners
living in China and interacting on a daily basis across a very
broad spectrum. That will only grow as China joins the WTO. At the
same time, tens of thousands of the most promising Chinese have
gone to the West as students. They've come back _ often to very
high positions in government, banking and business _ changed for
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Visited China for the first time this year. But even without an
earlier point of reference, it was clear that though the economy
remains very basic, the country has changed immensely in the last
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the early 1980s, nearly everybody in Shanghai,
the most Westernized city in China, still wore the famous blue Mao
suits. Only top officials had cars; everyone else pedaled bicycles
or rode buses. Lights were dim. Public restaurants and private
enterprises barely existed. Architecture seemed frozen in a
pre-World War II time warp. Today, everything is different: jeans
and khakis are ubiquitous; cars and taxis compete with bikes on
crowded streets; glass-sheathed skyscrapers abound; Shanghai throbs
with activity day and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to forget,'' Lardy said, ``how much change has already
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   As private enterprise spreads and markets open to real
competition from domestic and foreign companies alike, tens of
millions of Chinese are shedding their dependence on the state.
They are richer and freer. It's not democracy, but it is the first
step toward a genuinely pluralistic society.
</P>
<P>
   That is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``China now feels competitive heat across continents and
oceans,'' Robert Wright wrote in a recent issue of The New
Republic. ``It must face the same logic the rest of the world
faces. In the age of the Internet, even more than in the age of
industry and print, granting enough liberty for cutting-edge
prosperity while denying political liberty is a tall order.'' &QL;

A PRIMER ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social Security is slowly going broke, says Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, and the best way to avoid painful benefit
cuts or tax increases is to establish private investment accounts
through which workers could seek higher returns on their
contributions to the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is slowly going broke, says Vice President Al
Gore, and the best way to avoid painful benefit cuts or tax
increases is to channel the benefits of the federal budget surplus
into the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the presidential candidates are clear
enough. But behind their approaches are complicated policy and
political considerations regarding the problem and the possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
</P>
<P>
   Benefits to current retirees are paid out of payroll taxes
levied on nearly all workers and their employers. Because the work
force at the moment is large relative to the number of people who
have retired, those taxes generate more revenue than is needed to
pay benefits _ a surplus of about $150 billion this year and $2.3
trillion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The excess revenue goes into a trust fund out of which future
benefits can be paid. But the trust fund is not quite what its name
implies. Rather than accumulating cash, it contains bonds issued by
the federal government to the retirement system _ a promise to pay
back to Social Security the surplus funds when they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Social Security surplus goes to other
purposes. For years, the government simply spent it. More recently,
Congress and the Clinton administration have agreed to use the
excess cash only to reduce the $3.5 trillion in national debt held
by the public.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOOMING PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   The current surplus in Social Security could turn to a deficit
because of a demographic shift. Right now there are more than three
workers paying taxes to support each Social Security recipient. By
2030, as the population ages and the baby boom generation retires,
the ratio will shrink to 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Under projections by Social Security's trustees, payroll taxes
would no longer cover benefits starting around 2015, forcing the
system to begin relying in part on the interest payments from the
trillions of dollars worth of bonds in the trust fund. By around
2025, the system would have begun redeeming the bonds out of
general tax revenues to cover benefit payments, and by 2037 the
trust fund would be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, if no changes are made, Social Security would be
able to pay less than three-quarters of promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the projections could change substantially as the
economic climate shifts. Over the past few years alone, the date of
insolvency has been pushed back to 2037 from 2029 because of
economic growth that was stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the economic assumptions underlying the projections
are quite conservative, defenders of the current system say the
odds are strong that Social Security will weather the next three or
four decades without needing any major surgery. But the leaders of
both parties say it is prudent to assume there will be a financial
squeeze, and to deal with it as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING A SOLUTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton put an overhaul of Social Security on the
table in 1998. But the two parties found no consensus on what to do
_ and with the problem so many decades ahead, they were unable or
unwilling to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There are only three basic options: Cut benefits. Increase the
revenues coming into the system. Or increase the rate of return on
the money coming into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties have been willing to support
benefit cuts as part of a broader package of changes. Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has proposed reducing cost-of-living
adjustments. Reps. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., and Charles W. Stenholm,
D-Texas, have proposed legislation that includes an increase in the
normal retirement age, which is already gradually rising to 67 from
65, to account for further increases in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk of raising or eliminating the ceiling
on earnings subject to payroll taxes (currently $76,200). But most
politicians have steered clear of supporting anything painful in
terms of higher taxes or lower benefits.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE ACCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   In supporting private investment accounts, Bush's approach
centers on increasing the rate of return on the money coming into
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not provided a detailed plan. But most privatization
proposals call for diverting 2 percentage points of the 12.4
percent payroll tax into accounts that would be owned and
controlled by individuals. A worker earning $50,000 a year would
have $1,000 a year going into a private account.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the chance to invest the money themselves, workers
would accept a lower guaranteed benefit from Social Security at
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is that the guaranteed benefit could be reduced
by more than the amount diverted into the personal accounts _ but
that the returns generated for each worker by Wall Street would
more than make up for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign notes that stocks earned an average annual
return, after taking account of inflation, of 7.2 percent from 1926
to 1997. By contrast, workers born after 1963 can expect on average
a return from their Social Security contributions of just 1.9
percent, according to Social Security statistics cited by the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Private accounts would provide a start on restoring Social
Security to solvency over 75 years, the standard normally used in
assessing the system's health, Bush has said. He has acknowledged
that other steps, like benefit cuts, would be needed to finish
closing the gap, but has not said what steps he would support.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE AGAINST PRIVATE ACCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   However strong the performance of stocks in the past, there is
no assurance that they will do well in the future. And even if they
do match their historical performance, there will inevitably be ups
and downs along the way.
</P>
<P>
   People who retire and cash out their holdings during a bull
market would do far better than people who have to sell while the
market is depressed. And some people would no doubt make smarter
investment decisions than others. Should large numbers of people
lose money in the market, there would be tremendous political
pressure to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   Some portion of any investment gain might be eaten up by the
administrative costs of maintaining the accounts. And to the degree
that payroll taxes are going into private accounts rather than to
pay benefits to current retirees, the government would have to put
additional money into the system, presumably by using the Social
Security surplus. That in turn would reduce the amount of money
available for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   A diversion of 2 percentage points of payroll tax revenue would
equal just under $1 trillion over the next decade. By not using
that money for debt reduction, the government would add $300
billion to its interest bill in that period. So about $1.3 trillion
of the $2.3 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years
would be needed to finance a private accounts plan.
</P>
<P>
   THE GORE APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   Gore starts with the premise that the current system should be
left more or less intact. His plan is built on the idea that there
should be a way to use the current budget surplus to help Social
Security down the road. While the basic idea may be simple, the way
the government handles its finances makes executing it quite
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Social Security system cannot keep big cash reserves
of its own under the government system, the vice president wants to
use all of the Social Security surplus and some of the general
revenue surplus to eliminate, in 13 years, the $3.5 trillion in
national debt held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the debt would leave the government better able to
borrow, if necessary, later on. By putting downward pressure on
interest rates, debt reduction would also stimulate economic
growth, creating jobs and producing more payroll tax revenue to
help keep Social Security healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 2011, Gore would funnel to Social Security an amount
of money equal to the annual interest savings from debt reduction _
$100 billion a year at first, growing to more than $200 billion a
year by 2015. According to Gore, the infusion would extend Social
Security's solvency to 2054 from 2037 without having to cut
benefits or otherwise alter the system.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE AGAINST THE GORE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   While eliminating the debt would have substantial benefits,
transferring the interest savings to Social Security would be
little more than a paper shuffling exercise, and would still leave
taxpayers on the hook to pay for the shortfall in Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Since Social Security cannot hold cash, the transfers would be
in the form of government bonds that would have to be redeemed at
some point out of general tax revenues. In that sense, Gore's plan
would in essence transform Social Security into a welfare program,
Moynihan said. And Gore's plan would do nothing to address the
underlying imbalance between how much the system takes in and how
much it has promised to pay in benefits.

CONGRATULATIONS! REMEMBER ME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 21)  
 By ABBY ELLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have never understood celebrities who wipe their eyes and
lament the terrible cost of fame _ no privacy, no job security,
never knowing if someone likes them for who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Please. No one knows the whole truth about why _ or if _ other
people like us. Are they deeply enamored with the innermost core of
our being, or just impressed with our access to the Lincoln
Bedroom?
</P>
<P>
   Still, it must be grating when one person after another whom you
haven't seen since the late '80s _ an ex, a long-lost pal, a
passing acquaintance _ calls ``just to say `Hi,''' but also just as
your stock, real or figurative, happens to be soaring. Even I,
hovering somewhere between Nobody and Next to Nobody on the fame
scale, find people getting in touch after they have read something
I have written.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, of course, I am happy to hear from them. I would be
considerably less pleased if they asked me for money, which is the
often-unspoken point of calls that descend unbidden on dot-com
millionaires and others among the newly celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a Boston Globe article about me, I received 58 phone
calls from stockbrokers, real estate people and charities asking
for money,'' said Ben Mezrich, 30, whose newfound wealth came from
a breakthrough as a novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Mezrich, whose pen name is Holden Scott, has sold
six books, all for six-figure advances. Along the way, he said, he
traded his ``dumpy'' apartment in Boston for ``a cool one on the
26th floor,'' acquired a 63-inch television with a $12,000 sound
system and garbed himself in $20,000 of Armani clothing. His calls
came from struggling writers, from agents and editors who
previously ignored him, and from a few mothers of daughters who
ache to date a writer. (The disadvantages of dating writers, of
course, are a different column.)
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Peter Klamka, 31, of Ann Arbor, Mich., saw his net
worth climb to somewhere between $4 million and $30 million, he has
heard from many people. ``I've gotten calls from old friends and
girlfriends, from people who passed on the deal _ lots of
`I-should-haves,' `if onlys' and `I didn't think you could pull it
offs,''' said Klamka, the founder of PTN Media, a publicly held
company that produces and distributes fashion, style and
beauty-related content for Web sites. That's not to mention
``college buddies, mostly lawyers, who want me to bring them on as
an in-house counsel for a huge salary and lots of cheap options,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   What brings them out of the woodwork? ``People can find out
anything quickly and easily via the Internet,'' he said. ``They see
that I have two-million-plus shares of PTN, and they look at the
price of the stock and just assume I can access that amount with my
ATM card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks you're a VC'' he added, referring to a venture
capitalist. ``They have deals, inventions, various business
opportunities that range from nightclubs to car washes.''
</P>
<P>
   Klamka has not yet invested in any of that; most of what he has
seen have been ``wild dreams with no shot of success _ their idea,
my money and Rolodex and they get all the profits if it works,'' he
said. But he is not opposed to helping someone if there is a viable
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Mezrich has done things like paying a friend's rent, and he
picks up checks at nightclubs without expecting others to ever do
the same. ``It feels weird asking for cash from someone who I know
doesn't have it,'' he said, ``when I've got three books on the
shelves right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Do people like him merely for his financial status? He is
philosophical. ``I'm not concerned with people's motivations,'' he
said. ``If they like me because I'm a successful writer, well,
that's part of who I am. If they like me because I go to Paris for
$10,000 weekends, that's part of who I am, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not a fool. He knows the phone may stop ringing if the
inkwell dries up. ``That's the way of the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Luckily, the rest of us, without the dot-com millions
or the six-figure advances, needn't worry our little heads about
it. We know exactly why people like us: for our charm and
scintillating wit _ or at least, our self-delusions.

STUDY OFFERS NEW LOOK AT HOW WOMEN RESPOND TO STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a half-century, scientific gospel has held that
animals, including humans, respond to stress by preparing to do
battle or to flee, a physiological syndrome commonly known as
``fight or flight.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a newly released report, a group of researchers asserts
that females often show a very different reaction to stress, one
that revolves around nurturing and seeking the support of others
rather than aggression or escape.
</P>
<P>
   This ``tend and befriend'' response, seen both in humans and in
animal species, is based in hormonal differences between the sexes,
the researchers suggest. And it may help explain why women are less
vulnerable than men to stress-related illnesses like hypertension
and alcohol and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the researchers contend, in a long-ago world, women's
more social response to stress may have conferred an evolutionary
advantage, promoting survival and reducing the risk to females and
their offspring posed by predators, natural disasters and other
Pleistocene Epoch threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight or flight is basically a response that doesn't involve
the hands-on protection of others,'' said Dr. Shelley E. Taylor,
professor of psychology at the University of California at Los
Angeles and lead author of the report, which is to be published in
the journal Psychological Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``But females needed to protect their young, and affiliating
with a social group afforded more protection for females with one
or more young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many links in the researchers' theory still await
scientific confirmation, evidence from a variety of research areas
supports their basic thesis. And if the link between the
differences in physiology and behavior in men and women is
confirmed, it may shift the way scientists approach stress
research, as well as research in other areas of health.
</P>
<P>
   The theory, said Dr. Bruce McEwen, professor and director of the
Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller University, ``still
has to reach out and connect to biology.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Taylor's work offered ``a new and broader
framework'' for thinking about responses to stress, and that ``it
captures something I do not think has ever been captured before in
describing gender differences that seem to apply across animal
species.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said her study of ``tend and befriend'' responses began
with an offhand comment by a post-doctoral student, who noted that
most animal studies of stress were conducted using only male rats.
</P>
<P>
   Doing a little digging, Taylor and her colleagues discovered
that the same was true for human studies. In laboratory studies of
biological responses to stress conducted before 1995, for example,
only 17 percent of subjects were women.
</P>
<P>
   And the notion of a lone warrior locked in combat or surrender
mode that emerged from such research did not mesh neatly with
evidence from psychological studies, which showed that in stressful
situations, women often sought out the company and support of
others, or coped with stress by nurturing their children.
</P>
<P>
   A 1989 study, for example, found that mothers returning home
after a stressful day at the office were more likely to devote time
to their children. Fathers, in contrast, were more likely to
withdraw from their families or incite conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For the journal report, Taylor and her colleagues reviewed
several hundred studies in a variety of scientific areas, including
human and animal research on the body's hormonal response to
stress.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they found that oxytocin, one of a cascade of
hormones released in response to stress, appeared to play a central
role in females' response.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have linked oxytocin, which is also produced during
childbirth and nursing, both with maternal behavior and with social
affiliation. And animals and people with high oxytocin levels,
researchers have found, are calmer, more relaxed, more social and
less anxious.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects of oxytocin during stress, Taylor and her
colleagues found, appear to vary between males and females. In
males, male hormones like testosterone, which studies have shown
increases during stress, seem to mitigate the more calming,
affiliative impact of oxytocin.
</P>
<P>
   The female hormone estrogen, in contrast, appears to enhance the
action of oxytocin. In a study at UCLA, for example, Taylor and her
colleagues found that post-menopausal women who were receiving
estrogen therapy had more than three times the level of oxytocin as
women not receiving hormone replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may explain why women are more likely to turn to others,
both their children and friends, than men are in response to
stress,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, she cautioned, should not be taken to mean that
``it is only or primarily women who can and should take care of
children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any implication of that sort in this
model,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that females of course also displayed aggression in
some circumstances. But studies show they are less likely to be
physically aggressive, and more likely to express aggression
indirectly. And while the revving up of the sympathetic nervous
system that occurs during stress appears intimately tied to high
testosterone levels and aggression in men, the same mechanism may
not be at work in female aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' study adds to the growing evidence that men and
women differ markedly in the way their bodies respond to a number
of health-related conditions, and in some cases may help scientists
understand more about why this is so. Studies show, for example,
that the ``classic'' symptoms of heart attack _ pain radiating down
the arm _ occur much more often in men than in women, who may
experience shortness of breath instead.
</P>
<P>
   The growing awareness of these differences led the federal
government in 1995 to insist that women be included in
health-related studies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is convinced that the differences in
behavior that men and women show during stress are tied to
physiology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alice Eagly, professor of psychology at Northwestern
University, said that the gender differences could be rooted in
hormones, but that alternatively, they could be a result of
learning and cultural conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a certain amount of evidence that women are in
some sense more affiliative,'' Eagly said. ``But what that's due to
becomes the question. Is it biologically hardwired? Or is it
because women have more family responsibility and preparation for
that in their development? That is the big question for
psychologists.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Taylor hopes that an awareness that people can
respond to stress by becoming more social will also widen the lens
through which scientists study men. Most studies of stress
response, she pointed out, not only use male subjects, but study
male subjects by themselves, not in groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are greatly benefited from participating in social
groups,'' Taylor said. ``And those responses are clearly quite
vital, but we don't know as much about them.''

BOTTOM FISHING IN THE CLASS B REAL ESTATE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Conn. Texas, Okla., Calif., Wash.)   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By JOEL KOTKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh out of New York University Law School, Andrew Segal moved
to Texas in the early 1990s to seek his fortune. Although he
started with an inheritance of roughly $1 million, he felt that New
York was too tough and expensive a place to build his own business
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went looking where the pickings seemed easier,
moving first to Dallas, where he bought some ``see through'' office
buildings left virtually vacant in the aftermath of the oil crisis
in the early 1980s. Yet as the real estate market improved there,
he had to dig deeper for new opportunities, and began buying aging
office buildings along Houston's downtrodden and dangerous Main
Street.
</P>
<P>
   This made some locals think he was out of his mind _ or at least
a very gullible outsider. ``At the time,'' Segal recalled, ``it
looked like it was just another holdup on Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his strategy of buying old, unwanted office buildings seems
more like a stroke of genius. In the last five years, his Boxer
Properties, based in Houston, has bought some 70 of them, 17 of
which are of pre-World World War II vintage, in a string of cities
that also includes Baltimore, Hartford, Dallas and Tulsa, Okla.,
not to mention Hempstead, N.Y. Nearly all the deals have proved
successful, with occupancy rates, rents and property values
doubling, tripling or rising even more.
</P>
<P>
   Segal, 33, appears on the verge of becoming a veritable king of
the once-disdained niche of so-called class B urban office space.
His method is simple: He buys older buildings, fixes them and puts
signs on them offering space for rent. As word gets around of the
improved conditions in the buildings and of the low rents, which
are sometimes as little as half those offered by fancier landlords
nearby, the tenants come and stay.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur, whose low-cost business style includes
extensive traipsing from Baltimore to Tulsa and places in between
on budget flights, seems to have seized the right niche at the
right time. According to statistics from Reis Inc., a New York real
estate information firm, class B vacancy rates nationwide have
dropped to roughly 11 percent from nearly 20 percent on average in
1995. In some key urban centers, like San Francisco and Seattle,
the rates are as low as 3 percent. Even in such long distressed
markets as Tulsa, Baltimore and Houston, they have dropped by as
much as half.
</P>
<P>
   Segal credits the recovery of this niche in the last five years
to broader changes in the economy. The burgeoning of Internet,
media and related businesses like advertising has not led to huge
growth in demand for space in the new shiny class A high-rise
buildings that have typically attracted more traditional,
white-collar companies. Instead, many new-economy concerns have
moved into older, funkier spaces. To some extent, this trend
reflects the tastes of these nouveau companies. Though they may
have originally been lured by the lower rents, they also see these
older buildings _ some of them stunning examples of Art Deco or
Beaux Arts architecture _ as a reflection of their sense of
themselves as creative, non-hierarchical and unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Segal notes, the appeal of such buildings is not
unconditional. They often require upgraded telecommunications
infrastructure and central air-conditioning systems, fresh paint,
and sometimes the removal of outdated features like carpeting over
hardwood floors to make them as functional as their more modern
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, such structures also benefit by being located in
or next to districts that are attractive to the young people
critical to the operation of many information era companies. Unlike
high-rise buildings, these structures _ often less than eight to 10
stories _ were usually built to accommodate ground-level businesses
that open to the street. They also tend to have more light, and
therefore less of the ``concrete canyon'' coldness characteristic
of many 1950s downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, districts dominated by class B
buildings, like Deep Ellum in Dallas, Boston's Leather District,
Lower Manhattan and San Francisco's South of Market, have
re-emerged first as magnets for artists and denizens of hip clubs
and cool restaurants before becoming hotbeds of Internet and other
new-media activity. That, plus the presence of nearby loft and
other residential spaces, also helps create the kind of vibrant,
24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week environment sought by dot-com
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where the single people are, where you go to a bar to
meet them,'' Segal said. ``That's what makes it work. In Houston
there are few places for people to walk around and promenade;
downtown is the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, he said, the movement of the Web-related companies
into these districts enhances their appeal for more traditional
white-collar companies that he called ``dot-com wannabes'' _ those
advertising agencies, publishers, fashion design companies,
executive recruiters and even small law firms that seek out the
latest ``cool'' space to impress both clients and prospective
employees with their new-economy savoir faire.
</P>
<P>
   Other pioneers include Richard Kirshenbaum, founder of
Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners in New York, an ad agency that prides
itself on being hip. Kirshenbaum Bond moved from midtown to Lower
Manhattan more than a decade ago, in part to identify with the
image of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in a traditional area, you say you are a
traditional business,'' Kirshenbaum, 40, said in his art-filled
headquarters on Hudson Street. ``It's taking risks, but we're a
young agency and the area has sprouted up. It's having your own
point of view and knowing your own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   For Segal, who tends to be a bottom-fishing King of the B's,
markets like New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston, where
class B rents can now reach $50 a square foot, have become too
pricey. He prefers places like Tulsa, where he has bought seven
prewar structures in the recovering downtown area, Kansas City,
Mo., and Baltimore. Space there can still be rented for as little
as $10 a square foot and class B buildings bought for $1 million or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Segal is the first to acknowledge that these markets barely
exist on the radar screen of big-name speculators and real estate
investment trusts. He sees that as a plus. ``I think the market
will reward places that are cheaper and still offer a unique urban
experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These second-tier markets, he added, offer him the chance to
duplicate the kind of windfall he has enjoyed on Houston's Main
Street, now that downtown Houston itself may be getting a bit too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   With the $525,000 he spent in 1996 to buy two 70-year-old office
buildings in the city, he has made money two ways. Last year, he
sold his 711 Main Street building for $2.1 million to a condominium
developer. Each of the 40 lofts at the location, he estimates, is
now worth more than the entire building was five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the other Main Street building, which he still owns, the
rental income has soared as commercial tenants have flooded in. The
vacancy rate at the building, near 80 percent in 1996, has dropped
to the single digits. New Web companies, including SalvageSale.com,
have moved in, helping to push rents from $6 a square foot to
closer to $15, a big increase since 1996 but still $5 or more
cheaper than nearby class A structures.
</P>
<P>
   The ancillary growth of restaurants and clubs around the area,
said Charlie Wilson, SalvageSale.com's president, has greatly
enhanced the value of the space _ a phenomenon seen in other cities
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different, it's cool and it has history,'' said Wilson,
32, whose company now occupies 10,000 square feet in the building.
``If you're going to be in Houston, this is where we want to be.''

JOINING THE FREE-TRADE CLUB: JORDAN CLEANS UP ITS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By WILLIAM A ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Mohammed A. Halaiqah trip to Seattle last
November was to have been the culmination of his career. As
Jordan's most experienced trade negotiator, he had spent five years
arduously preparing for his country's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After a thorough and painful overhaul of its tariffs and
investment rules, putting domestic industries like pharmaceuticals
at risk, Jordan was finally poised to become the WTO's next full
member. As the only country scheduled to join the group at its
Seattle summit, it hoped to attract worldwide publicity _ and
American investment in the high-technology industries it sees as
the key to its future.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't to be. Halaiqah (pronounced ha-LI-kah) was stunned to
find himself trapped in a hotel lobby as the police fought
protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting something, but we didn't expect it to be so
fierce,'' he said. ``We were literally besieged in the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos outside and policy clashes inside the meeting forced
Jordan off the suddenly truncated Seattle agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting for that big moment, we felt that Jordan was the
victim of the contradictory interests of these different groups,''
said Halaiqah, now Jordan's minister of industry and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, at its Geneva headquarters, the WTO ratified
Jordan's entry, making it the 136th member and just the seventh
Arab state to join. While Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and
several North African nations are members, many Jordanian trading
partners, including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Kuwait, are not.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan won some important concessions: Agricultural subsidies
can be maintained at their current high level for a 10-year
transition period, and majority ownership of retailers is still
reserved for local investors.
</P>
<P>
   Most barriers to foreign investments and products must be phased
out, exposing many Jordanian companies to international competition
for the first time. For an economy that still depends on potash,
used in fertilizer and chemicals, from the Dead Sea for the bulk of
its export income, exploiting the opportunities of WTO membership
will be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO membership was granted almost exactly a year after
Jordan's new king, Abdullah II, had summoned Halaiqah for a
briefing on the effort to join the WTO. The king, whose father,
King Hussein, had died just two months earlier, was determined to
make economic growth his focus.
</P>
<P>
   The king was convinced that Jordan needed to open up quickly.
Per capita income had been declining. Money sent home by Jordanians
living and working in the Persian Gulf states had dried up after
the 1991 gulf war, and sanctions against Iraq _ Jordan's biggest
trading partner _ reduced trade to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   As the king saw it, Jordan's only alternative _ a quick foreign
capital influx from privatization sales and high-technology
industrial development _ would require strict adherence to
international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Halaiqah told King Abdullah during their April 1999 meeting that
after more than four years of talks, Jordan was still far from
complying with WTO demands. After the Seattle assembly, he warned,
the organization would begin a new round of global trade
liberalization, raising membership hurdles higher.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to move quickly: ``There was a lot of sympathy
for Jordan after the death of His Majesty King Hussein, and I
thought that we should take advantage of that,'' Halaiqah said.
</P>
<P>
   So King Abdullah gave Halaiqah an ambitious order: Get Jordan
into the WTO in time for Seattle. For his part, the young king
promised to ram through the balky legislature a whole new set of
trade and investment laws. They had only six months.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Jordanian officials concede, it would have been hard to find
a country that was a less likely candidate for such a rapid
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Fuzzy law and lax enforcement had made Jordan a capital of
counterfeiting and patent piracy. Software, books, videos, cassette
tapes _ all were produced and sold without copyright permission or
royalty payments, often for export to neighbors. Media and computer
industry lobbies in Washington and Brussels put Jordan near the top
of their lists of intellectual property violators. Governments
friendly to Jordan warned that without drastic changes, WTO entry
would not even be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Most problematic were prescription drugs. By estimates of
Jordan's own pharmaceutical industry, at least 15 percent of its
patented drug output was manufactured without the patent holders'
consent. Foreign analysts said the proportion was far higher.
American drug companies calculated that Jordanian piracy cost them
$25 million to $50 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pharmaceutical companies here were living in cuckoo-land,
thinking that you could keep on stealing and stay in business,''
said Bassem I. Awadallah, the chief economic adviser to King
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than 4,000 employees and $140 million in export
sales, the drug companies were one of this small economy's few
growing sources of skilled jobs and foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   Mazen S. Darwazah, the president of the Jordanian Association of
Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers, says few of these companies are
prepared to compete under WTO rules, which make patent infringement
grounds for costly trade sanctions. ``Half of them will close down,
and the families of 2,000 breadwinners will be out on the street,''
he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Darwazah acknowledged, his own company, Hikma
Pharmaceuticals, is a potential model. Specializing in generic
drugs on which the patents have expired, and with modern production
facilities, Hikma exports to 30 countries from plants in sites
including Eatontown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recognized that in order for us to survive, we need a
niche,'' he said. ``The world is run by the big corporations,
whether we like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But few companies have the capital or technological
sophistication to manage this transition, he said. Many Jordanians
cannot afford imported medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make Jordan a safe haven for intellectual property
rights, we know that health care prices will rise dramatically,''
Darwazah said. ``People are willing to sacrifice for three or four
years, but then they expect Jordan to get the benefits the
international community has promised.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Jordan became one of the few Middle Eastern
nations to be removed from the U.S. Commerce Department's watch
lists of intellectual property violators. Its new patent
protections are lauded by former critics in the computer and
pharmaceutical industries. In March, dozens of American executives
traveled to a Dead Sea resort to hear King Abdullah itemize
incentives for software and telecommunications investors. Jordan
offers high-technology companies a significant but underemployed
pool of English-speaking engineers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   With WTO membership in hand, Jordan is now negotiating
free-trade pacts with Europe, having already reached agreements
with other Arab states. Jordan's main goal now is a free-trade deal
with the United States, an advantage already enjoyed by Israel and
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials know from their Seattle experience that any
free-trade proposal will meet resistance. Halaiqah is still irked
by the contentions of American demonstrators that they were
defending poor countries like his against the predations of the
global trading system _ a system Jordan had labored to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the fears of environmentalists, of labor, but
they should do their homework,'' he said. ``No country has
benefited more from international trade than the United States.
These people cannot speak on behalf of the world, and certainly not
on behalf of developing countries.''

OWNER OF FUSAICHI PEGASUS NO STRANGER TO EXTRAVAGANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Book title in 10th graf is cq)  
 By JOE DRAPE AND HOWARD FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In July 1998, Fusao Sekiguchi traveled from Japan to Lexington,
Ky., with a horse on his mind: an extraordinary one listed as Hip
No. 228 at Keeneland, Ky., race track's annual yearling sales. This
was a regally bred colt, the equine equivalent of a Rembrandt
painting, and he was no secret; he had been targeted by a
multinational group of bidders from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The group's members had banded together rather than risk driving
up the price by bidding against one another. But Sekiguchi wanted
it more. He outbid that group and everyone else, paying the
extremely high price of $4 million for the colt that he would later
name Fusaichi Pegasus. He says now that he would have paid whatever
he had to in order to get the horse _ and in fact, he had financial
backing from some partners, whom he had to repay within 10 days, to
ensure that he came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I own it entirely now,'' he said. ``I am sure, though, that
many others would like to come forward and offer to buy a piece of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi has no plans for the moment on sharing the horse.
Fusaichi Pegasus scored an overpowering victory in the Kentucky
Derby and is the odds-on favorite in Saturday's Preakness Stakes at
Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. If he wins, he will then try to
become the first horse in 22 years to capture racing's triple crown
at the Belmont Stakes in New York on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a dazzling payoff for Sekiguchi, the flamboyant
Japanese entrepreneur who only two weeks ago was a stranger to the
U.S. sporting scene, but who prompted fascination at the Derby with
his long ponytail and splashy entrance to the winner's circle at
Churchill Downs, where he was accompanied by several incandescently
powdered geishas.
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi, 64, won his prized colt the same way he has lived his
life and made his career in Japan: with extravagance, daring and
creativity. In Japan, he is a member of a loose class of men who
are referred to as ``bubble gentlemen,'' a label attached to those
who built dizzying individual fortunes in the booming 1980s. It
also implies that the source of one's wealth is never quite clear,
though signs of it are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He collects modern and vintage racing cars, and two of them _ a
blue 1935 Bugatti and a blazing red Formula One-style machine built
by his own engineers _ grace the lobby of his new company _
Venture-Safenet _ near Tokyo Bay. He orchestrates spectacles to
welcome company recruits, last year importing matadors from Spain
and bulls from Mexico, another year renting a disco, piling $100
million yen (about $921,000 at Thursday's rates) on the stage and
exhorting his new charges to ``aim high and be a player.''
</P>
<P>
   With his bold charcoal pinstripes or the yellow leather jacket
he donned at one Louisville soiree, Sekiguchi projects the role of
a Hollywood classic perhaps from the Los Angeles of ``Chinatown''
or the Las Vegas of ``Casino.'' ``I am a rebel,'' he said of his
style. ``It is true that I always take care of my appearance, but
my attitude is not always appreciated by others.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Sekiguchi wrote a book titled ``Challenge to Japan
Dream,'' which became a best seller and offered a vision for
success different from the country's traditional approach. That
devoting a career to one company was not the only way to succeed
and even the world's most formidable corporations sometimes needed
help from outside problem solvers. In 1974, he started a business
called Meitec that trained engineers and then leased them out to
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurs are not well received in Japan,'' said Gen. Bill
Dyke, a retired general who first met Sekiguchi in 1987 when he was
commander of the U.S. Army in Japan. ``People who sign on with a
company and keep their head down are better regarded. He wanted to
move people around, which is a pretty novel concept for Japan. He
had this promoter's flair that also didn't go over well.''
</P>
<P>
   If this high-tech temp service seemed very American, it was for
good reason. Sekiguchi says he has been fascinated and appreciative
of western culture since the age of 10, when American GIs occupied
his hometown as World War II was coming to an end. They fed him.
They told him stories about the States _ including one about the
Kentucky Derby. In 1992, according to Dyke, Sekiguchi donated $2
million to the USO.
</P>
<P>
   Not unusual for Sekiguchi, he followed up this extravagant
gesture with a quieter one. At a dinner honoring Sekiguchi at the
Madison Hotel in Washington, D.C., he insisted that a glass of milk
and a Hershey bar be placed at each setting. When it was his turn
to speak, he spoke of the U.S. soldiers who confounded his and his
community's expectations by bringing food and aid to his town. ``He
said what he remembered most was the milk and chocolate,''
remembered Dyke, who was a USO board member. ``So he asked
everybody to toast with the milk in thanksgiving for their
kindness. There wasn't a dry eye in the place.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Sekiguchi headed down the high dollar horse path
that would cost him his position in the business he built and
launched him on this current Triple Crown campaign. He had been
involved in horse racing in Japan since the early 1970s, but
decided to increase the level of his participation. He asked Dyke
to find him a representative in Kentucky to establish a U.S.
presence. So Dyke introduced him to John Ward, a third-generation
horseman from Lexington, who, with his wife Donna, is a successful
breeder and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   The Wards showed Sekiguchi central Kentucky horse farms, the
Kentucky Derby Museum and most memorably, feted him at sundown with
Japanese food on the lawn of the famed Calumet Farms overlooking
the gravestones of seven Kentucky Derby winners _ including the
1941 Triple Crown winner Whirlaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was moved,'' Ward said. ``He believes in history and
tradition, but he also was able to say where he wanted his horse
business to be in five years: the top.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an expensive climb, as Sekiguchi found out
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the year he won his first important race, the Japan
Derby with Fusaichi Concorde, the Meitec board did something seldom
done in the staid Japanese business culture _ they ousted him.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? His love for expensive horses. The new president,
Mitsuo Otsuki, told a leading newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, that
Sekiguchi had told him he wanted ``to invest 1 billion yen or more
in the horse racing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi said, ``They were afraid that I was becoming too
powerful, that I was getting too big, and that they couldn't
control me,'' Sekiguchi denied he wanted the company to invest in
his hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, a Nagoya district court ruled it was justified for
the Meitec board to demote Sekiguchi _ though it ruled he was due
back pay _ and cited the horses, as well as his lavish spending, as
reasons. Both sides are appealing to a higher court. A lawyer for
Meitec, Jun-ichi Tsutsumi, said that Sekiguchi was, in effect,
draining the company of its resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sekiguchi was earning 27,500,000 yen per month at the time
he was ousted, in 1996,'' Tsutsumi said, which about $253,000 a
month at Thursday's exchange rates and three quarters of what the
entire board of directors was making at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was awful. He had just bought seven yearlings for
$5.75 million at the Keeneland sale. He was forced to return them
for resale and promised Keeneland officials that he'd would make up
any shortfall. It was substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled the transaction responsibility and expeditiously.
It is why the people at Keeneland have welcomed him back,'' said
his Washington-based attorney Anthony Bisceglie.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sekiguchi returned to Keeneland in July 1998, he had
little profile on the U.S. racing scene.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when he forced the deep-pocketed and
willing-to-use-it consortium of Satish Sanan of Florida-based Padua
Stables, John Magnier of Ireland's Coolmore Stud and Michael Tabor,
a former betting shop owner in England, out of the bidding for
Fusaichi Pegasus. The name Fusaichi (pronounced foo-sah-eech-ee) is
a combination of part his given name and the Japanese phrase for
``No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bisceglie said, there have been numerous inquiries about
purchasing part of the colt _ who on the strength of the Derby
victory is far more valuable than his purchase price _ from the
leading stud farms across the world. Still, Sekiguchi shows no
indication of selling. So far he's allowed trainer Neil Drysdale
make all the decisions about his superhorse.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he demonstrated recently in Japan, he can be a
strong-willed owner. He believed one of his trainers, Seiki Tabara,
was appearing on television too much and threatened to take horses
away from him. ``It is the owner's role to be out front,'' he said,
which is another against-the-grain notion in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi also prefers to keep his own financial situation a
mystery. He said he owed his entire fortune to a ``major capital
gain'' when he sold the 38 percent of Meitec he owned for 18
billion yen, or about $166 million at Thursday's exchange rates. He
wouldn't say how much he was worth. ``That might create tax
problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sekiguchi concedes the new company he started in 1997,
Venture-Safenet _ in the same outsourcing niche he pioneered in
Japan with Meitic _ has yet to soar to Pegasus heights. He
acknowledged reports that the company is badly extended and losing
money. ``We don't have any profits,'' he said of his 1,200-employee
operation. ``This company lives from my own capital. I am spending
my own money here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still he is intent on putting on a good show. To spend a couple
of hours with a sole geisha, for example, can routinely cost $500
and extend as high as $3,000. In an interview in his office in
Tokyo this week, however, Sekiguchi shrugged and said he had no
idea what it cost to bring two geisha, a maiko (a trainee) and
their oka-san, or ``mother'' to Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel any stress about the price I paid for this,'' he
said. ``But I was nervous about what would happen if I lost. The
press would just be talking about the money I had spent. I had to
think only of winning, and having the three women there was
intended to be part of the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't be in Baltimore at the Preakness Saturday when his big
horse tries to race one step closer to the Triple Crown. He is busy
trying to build a business, the trip is taxing and, as appreciative
he is of America, he doesn't like to venture too often from home.
His daughter-in-law, Yukari, who manages the 40 horses Sekiguchi
currently races, will represent him.
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi barely suppressed a sigh and explained his Triple
Crown experience is as hard as it is glorious.``In the U.S., when I
won, everyone congratulated me,'' he said. ``Here, in Japan, people
just turned their heads and looked away.''
</P>
<P>
   But this horse, he said, makes it all worthwhile. ``When I laid
my eyes on the colt,'' he said, ``I knew he was going to be a Derby
winner.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years from now, astronomers will have seen the first
glimmerings of light as stars and galaxies coalesced in the gloom
of the early universe, observed how the powerful gravity of a black
hole warped the very fabric of space, and perhaps searched for
signs of life in the glow of blue planets like Earth as they
circled nearby stars.
</P>
<P>
   That sweeping, and expensive, vision for astronomical discovery
over the next decade is described by an influential panel of
scientists in ``Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium,''
a report released on Thursday by the National Academy of Sciences.
Often referred to as the decadal survey, the report is one of a
series issued every 10 years by astronomers, giving their
priorities and hopes for new observing instruments.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the survey has wielded great influence on the
roster of instruments that were built. The co-chairmen of the
committee that wrote the new report are Joseph H. Taylor Jr., a
Princeton University astrophysicist and Nobel laureate, and
Christopher F. McKee, an astrophysicist at the University of
California, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of this year's list is an audacious successor to the
orbiting Hubble Space Telescope that would be 100 to 600 times as
sensitive, two to three times as large, and able to look far more
deeply into the low-energy radiation, called the infrared, that
arrives from the young, star-forming universe. Close behind are a
giant, ground-based telescope with an eye 100 feet across and a
fleet of four large spaceborne telescopes working in concert to
discover Earth-like planets.
</P>
<P>
   With a minimum cost of $4.7 billion for instruments that would
require a wide range of new technologies, the recommendations are
nothing if not daring for fields as abstract as astronomy,
astrophysics and cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that most of those instruments are built, ``we are in a
position to ask, `How did the universe begin? How did it evolve
from a soup of elementary particles into the structures that we see
today? Is there life elsewhere in the universe?''' said Dr. Michael
Turner, chairman of the astronomy and astrophysics department at
the University of Chicago and a member of the committee that wrote
that report.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anneila Sargent, another committee member, who is a
professor of astronomy at the California Institute of Technology
and director of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, said the impact
of many of the discoveries envisioned in the report would be great
enough to be felt beyond the narrow community of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, across the spectrum, would agree that if we could
find a planet that could support life like on Earth, we would be
stunned,'' Sargent said. ``It would be the kind of thing that would
change our philosophy of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers of the report also had their eye on the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done the best job we can at setting a number
that we can live with,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional staff member who is knowledgeable about science
issues said that because the panel members ``do the heavy lifting
of actually trying to prioritize,'' the report has had much
influence in garnering support for programs in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has also traditionally been well-received at crucial
agencies like NASA and the National Science Foundation, a fact that
should help boost the prospects of the panel's big winner, the Next
Generation Space Telescope, or NGST.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing it says to me is their top priority is my top
priority, which is NGST,'' said Dr. Anne Kinney, program director
for the Astronomical Search for Origins at NASA's Office of Space
Science. ``It really helps to hear that that is the number one
priority of this extremely distinguished group of astronomers.''
</P>
<P>
   The telescope, which Kinney said could be launched by the end of
the decade, would cost roughly a billion dollars and involve
gossamer-like materials that would fold up on launch and be
unfurled to create a mirror perhaps 20 feet across once the
instrument is in space. The needed technology for this feat is
still in development. The NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center is
developing one design, while two contractors, TRW and Lockheed
Martin, are working on two others. The Hubble carries a much more
conventional mirror which is about 7 feet across.
</P>
<P>
   Detectors on the telescope would also be sensitive to radiation
that is much farther into the infrared, or long-wavelength, part of
the spectrum than Hubble can see. Because the universe is
expanding, light from more and more distant objects gets stretched
farther and farther into this region.
</P>
<P>
   The new telescope's keener infrared eyes would let it see
objects shining just a few million years after the universe was
born, compared to one billion or two billion years for the Hubble.
The earlier time is thought to mark the end of the ``dark ages,''
before the light from stars began penetrating the universal murk.
</P>
<P>
   Both the search for small planets and the probe of radiation
emitted in the warped space around black holes would involve
several satellites flying in formation and working in tandem. The
huge telescope on the ground would call upon yet another type of
futuristic technology, involving mirrors built of moveable segments
rather than in one continuous piece.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggested projects would look for waves in the fabric of
space, called gravity waves, that arrive at Earth from collisions
of black holes and other processes, and radio emissions from
objects deep in space.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Geoff Marcy, an astronomer at the University of
California, Berkeley, who discovered by indirect evidence a number
of the 40 planets much larger than Earth that are now known to
orbit other stars, the search for life elsewhere in the universe
carries the greatest excitement of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would love to know is whether a blue dot orbiting a
yellow star has the building blocks of life,'' he said. The
space-based instrument the panel recommended to make that search,
he said, ``is the most glorious telescope that has ever been
conceived by humanity.''

THE RIGHT THING: TELLING THE TRUTH, OR AT LEAST MOST OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 21)  
(EDS: Jeffrey Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston and is
the author of ``The Good, the Bad, and Your Business'' (John Wiley
&AMP; Sons). His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of
each month. E-mail may be sent to: righthng(at)nytimes.com.)

<P>
   When the results of an annual honesty and ethics poll were
released last fall by the Gallup Organization, I had just begun a
stint as a college professor and was feeling quite smug. There
among the 10 professions ranked most honest by the American public
was my new calling, with 52 percent of respondents judging its
honesty as high or very high.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after just a few minutes of basking in professional glow,
I saw where the survey ranked another of my incarnations, that of
online journalist: firmly among the bottom 10 on the list of 45,
with only one respondent in 10 giving people in that line of work a
good score. Talk about professional disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   The findings present a puzzle. When introducing myself, what do
I tell people I do? If I want them to trust me from the get-go, do
I just say ``college teacher'' and withhold the part about writing
for online publications?
</P>
<P>
   If disclosing the complete picture leads people to an unfair
conclusion about me, isn't it right, not to mention advantageous,
to withhold some information? In a legal context, the answer is no.
``It's better to include and explain than to omit and cast doubt,''
said Andrew J. Sherman, a lawyer at Katten Muchin Zavis in
Washington. Of course, it is the job of a good lawyer to look
through the lens of legal vulnerability and to caution against
anything that may lead to trouble. But real life is rarely so
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you are applying for a job during the McCarthyite
1950s. Years earlier, in college, you flirted briefly with radical
politics. Should you disclose it and risk having the interviewer
unfairly take you for a subversive, or hide it and be surer of
getting the fair treatment you deserve?
</P>
<P>
   Those pernicious days are behind us, thankfully, but ethically
analogous situations still crop up. A few years ago, when a
colleague was on vacation in the northern part of Ireland, he
wanted to rent a car and was asked the name of his employer (an
American newspaper). The rental agent told him that the company
could not rent to people in certain ``risky'' occupations,
including journalists. My friend swallowed hard and pleaded,
somewhat disingenuously, that his job _ preparing maps, charts and
diagrams for the newspaper _ was really more that of a commercial
artist and not of a journalist. He got the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all practice selective disclosure,'' said Daryl Koehn,
director of the Center for Business Ethics at the University of St.
Thomas in Houston. ``If we have been a professor at both Iowa State
and the University of Chicago, we tell people we taught at the
latter, because it is more prestigious. There is simply not enough
time in the day to divulge our entire past history.''
</P>
<P>
   The ends figure in how we view these means. Sacrificing
integrity to save a life is often, usually rightly, seen as heroic.
Trimming the truth for personal gain _ landing a plum contract, for
instance _ is difficult to justify. Somewhere in between is
withholding true information that you think will lead people to
false conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've stopped saying we are consultants, because as soon as we
do, we find ourselves faced with a barrage of negativity and
preconceived notions,'' said Michelle Reina, co-author with her
husband, Dennis, of ``Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace''
(Berrett-Kohler), as well as, well, a consultant: The Reinas are
principals of Chagnon &AMP; Reina Associates in Stowe, Vt. Too often,
she said, people have difficulty separating individuals from
professions and assume that any journalist is like all journalists,
that any consultant is like all consultants. Now, she tells
prospective clients she ``works with organizations that want to
bring trust into the workplace.'' As words go, ``trust'' strikes a
better chord than ``consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust is also the key to solving the puzzle. Gallup polls
notwithstanding, in all but the most extreme cases we simply cannot
know with certainty how what we say will be perceived. Deciding to
be less than honest about something trivial because we think the
truth might provoke an unfair judgment of us is just a few steps
away from deciding that deception for naked gain is appropriate any
time we think we ``deserve'' it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust by its very nature is an act of reasonable faith,''
Professor Koehn said. ``It exists precisely because we cannot
control all circumstances. We should not make the mistake of
thinking that all trust is contingent upon full disclosure.'' When
in doubt about how the facts will be perceived, she advised, look
gently for more clues. Otherwise, she said, she would proceed on
the assumption that most people can be trusted to draw fair
conclusions about us, regardless of what we do for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Good advice. Did I mention that I was an online journalist? &QL;

EUROPE REGULATORS RAID COCA COLA OFFICES IN BRUSSELS AND LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators from the European Commission raided Coca-Cola's
office in Brussels, Belgium, early Thursday as well as the office
of the company's largest bottler, in London, expanding an inquiry
into Coke's marketing practices that began last summer.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are many of the methods Coke uses to bolster sales of
its soft drinks: contracts that prohibit competitors' products,
sales incentive programs and discounts for certain customers. Last
July, investigators seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola
Beverages in London; the offices of Coke's principal German
bottler, Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke, and Coca-Cola Nordic
Beverages in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing Coca-Cola Enterprises into the investigation,
regulators seem intent on examining the entire European operation.
Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta, bottles Coke products in
France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and
controls about 70 percent of Coke's bottling in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the European Commission said its inquiry ``aims
to assess whether CCE's distribution practices may constitute an
abuse of a dominant position in violation of EU competition
rules.'' It added that the investigation focused on the Belgian and
British markets, and began after complaints were received by the
commission. Pepsico and Virgin Cola have acknowledged that they
complained to regulators about Coke, setting off the investigation
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said it was cooperating with the authorities. ``We are
confident that our actions are in compliance with all national and
European regulations,'' said the company's spokesman, Rob Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, confirmed
that regulators had entered its offices in London and Brussels.
``We are disappointed that the European Commission felt the need to
execute a dawn raid,'' said the spokesman, John H. Downs Jr.
``However, we are not surprised that the commission included our
European operations since it has a continuing investigation into
the Coca-Cola system.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investigators remained at the Coke offices throughout the
day, examining files and removing documents that pertained to the
inquiry, which has no deadline. ``The length of investigations
depends largely on complexity of cases, and on whether the
commission's suspicions turn out to be justified,'' the commission
said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Coca-Cola Enterprises disclosed that its profits
were falling, citing a flood of cheaper products into Britain, the
bottler's second-biggest market. European Union law permits
companies based in one country to import products from other member
nations, so the bottler cannot prevent the flow of soft drinks from
countries like Spain or Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Downs said there was ``no connection'' between the cheaper
imports and the European Union's inquiry into Coca-Cola
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's new chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft,
has pledged to improve the company's battered image in Europe as
well as its conduct there. Coke's efforts in recent years to buy
Orangina and the Cadbury Schweppes brands ran into trouble from
regulators on competitive grounds, with the plans ultimately
scuttled or trimmed back. Last June, Coke recorded its biggest
product recall in company history after people in Belgium said they
felt ill after drinking Coke products; the recall cost Coke $200
million and cost Coca-Cola Enterprises $103 million.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Italian authorities fined Coke $16 million over the
practices of Coca-Cola Beverages, a bottler in which Coke holds a
majority stake. The authorities objected to several of the
bottler's practices, including discounts to retailers carrying
Coca-Cola products exclusively and year-end bonuses to wholesalers
carrying only Coca-Cola. The investigation began in 1997 after
complaints from Pepsi and an Italian supermarket chain, Esselunga.
</P>
<P>
   Daft told the British and American Chamber of Commerce earlier
this month that ``1999 e was a pretty tough year for Coca-Cola,
particularly in Europe.'' He added, ``We've said the series of
setbacks we suffered last year served as a clear wake-up call for
us.''

ADVERTISING: ABC SEEKS YOUNGER AUDIENCE FOR SOAP OPERAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is increasingly common for marketers to focus advertising on
teen-agers and 20-something consumers in the hope of developing
shopping patterns that become lifelong buying habits. Now the ABC
television network is joining the ranks of advertisers like Kraft
Foods and Procter &AMP; Gamble with an ambitious campaign intended to
stimulate demand among consumers 16 to 24 for four of its own
``products'': daytime soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   The four ABC soaps, which include mainstays like ``All My
Children'' and ``General Hospital,'' are suffering declines in
viewership as millions of women work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there fewer potential viewers at home in the
afternoons when the daytime dramas are broadcast, but younger women
coming home from school or after-school jobs find no mothers or
grandmothers there to fill them in on when Luke met Laura. As a
result, the interest among those younger viewers in episodic drama
is increasingly being satisfied at night rather than during the
day; the WB network has capitalized on that with prime-time series
like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Felicity''
and ``Roswell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a genre that built its success on generational
viewing,'' said Angela Shapiro, the New York-based president for
the ABC Daytime division of the network, owned by Walt Disney Co.
``We're looking for more and more ways to bring in younger viewers
so they'll be there for us in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if they're not tuned in by 25, fuhgeddaboudit,
as a character on that nighttime soap ``The Sopranos'' might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the daytime genre, you have shows that last for decades, so
once viewers get hooked, they watch through the ages,'' said Marc
Berman, media analyst for the Mediaweek.com unit of VNU USA, who
writes The Programming Insider, a daily e-mail newsletter. ``You
don't see that in any other day part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the biggest problem is to build the franchise, to get new
viewers to watch the soaps,'' he added. ``Otherwise the audience
will be older women glued to the set.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC Daytime effort, by M/K Advertising Partners in New York,
carries the theme ``Plunge in this summer,'' to encourage sampling
of the soaps while viewers are out of high school and college. The
television, print, poster and postcard campaign, with a budget of
$7 million, was researched for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the genre because it has a really loyal following,''
said Karin Henderson, principal and executive creative director at
M/K. ``So we wanted to find aspects that might draw in somebody who
was unfamiliar with these soaps.'' The others are ``One Life to
Live'' and ``Port Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the ending of certain shows appealing to this audience is
an opportunity for us,'' she added, referring to the wrap-ups of
two nighttime soaps on Fox Broadcasting, ``Beverly Hills 90210''
and ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign concentrates on certain core elements, said
Henderson, who also worked on campaigns for ABC Daytime with her
business partner, Mary Beth Weil, at Grey Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dialogue is great, so we use that,'' Henderson said. ``The
talent is appealing and the story lines can be a little outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's the aspirational value to the viewer: `I want to
be like that. I want to look like that.' You're seeing someone more
relatable to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   So all the ads present younger cast members from the four soaps,
shot in delectable black and white to look their tastiest. Each is
identified with a word meant to define or describe the character he
or she plays; the pithy labels include ``Rebel,'' ``Vixen,''
``Hottie,'' ``Gutsy,'' ``Smooth,'' ``Player'' and ``Virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads use character names rather than the names of the actors,
perhaps because the actors portraying the characters come and go
but the characters remain soap stalwarts. For instance, the ads
running with the label ``Rebel'' identify the young man as Lucky
Spencer of ``All My Children''; the actor shown is Jacob Young, who
recently took over the part from Jonathan Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercials, the actors speak and behave in character.
Young preens and says: ``Rules? I don't play that game.'' Erin
Hershey, who plays Alison Barrington on ``Port Charles,'' the
character identified as ``Trouble,'' prances, slaps herself on the
rump and declares: ``Watch and learn, kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Fumero, who is Cristian Vega on ``One Life to Live,''
lives up to his designation, ``Hottie,'' by smoldering into the
camera and asserting: ``Trust me. I know exactly what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to convince younger viewers that ``the stories,'' as
many soap fans call their shows, are easy to begin following; are
worth watching day after day, week after week; and are a fun summer
escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a daunting task,'' Henderson said, ``but we've always
approached daytime advertising by going after the available viewer.
As erosion in viewership has occurred, we need to try and attract a
different viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials begin running Friday night on the ABC broadcast
of the 27th annual Daytime Emmy Awards and will continue through
the summer on prime-time shows that are intended for teen-age and
younger female viewers, like ``Making the Band'' and ``Sabrina the
Teen-age Witch.'' The print ads will run in magazines like Allure,
Cosmopolitan, Entertainment Weekly, Glamour, Marie Claire,
Seventeen, Soap Opera Digest and Teen People.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be ads on the ABC Web site (www.abc.com) under
the breathless rubric ``Summer-sational Hot Teen Site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is admirable,'' Berman, the analyst, said,
``but I don't know if it will help that much. Even in summer, it's
difficult to reach the young, who are traveling, at the beach and
working, not necessarily home.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the campaign, he added, is that it may persuade
younger women to start taping episodes of soap operas or watching
them on SoapNet, a new cable television network from ABC and Disney
that presents reruns of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the members of the boy band 'N Sync could take turns
playing Lucky on summer Fridays.

TIME WARNER, DISNEY REACH TENTATIVE RESOLUTION OF CABLE DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing.)   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have reached an
agreement in principle that will end their rancorous dispute over
the cable carriage of television networks owned by Disney, Time
Warner chairman Gerald Levin told shareholders at the company's
annual meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Time Warner nor Disney executives would discuss the
specific details of the agreement Thursday, saying that it needs to
be committed first to contractual language. But one executive with
knowledge of the agreement said that it was ``completely an
economic deal,'' meaning that it would not specifically address
Disney's demands for assurances about the pending merger between
America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had raised concerns that the new company would deny
access on the Internet or cable television to competitive providers
of entertainment and information.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the shareholders, Levin said that the deal was
a result of direct negotiations between Robert Iger, the president
of Disney, and Richard Parsons, the president of Time Warner, and
that they had reached what he called a handshake agreement. A Time
Warner spokesman, Edward Adler, later labeled it as a ``telephonic
handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both companies said senior executives' refusal to
discuss the details was a result of the previous bitterness that
has surrounded the negotiations. The bitterness led to Time
Warner's decision to take Disney's ABC stations off its cable
systems on May 1. Time Warner had declined a Disney offer of a
one-month extension in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The move proved calamitous for Time Warner. The company was
criticized by consumers, editorial pages and politicians in New
York and Washington. Time Warner restored the service one day
later, agreeing to an extension until July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the effects of that fallout, Levin said in his
remarks at the annual meeting that Time Warner had apologized to
consumers and regulators for terminating access to ABC stations.
Then he added that the companies had reached an agreement in
principle to resolve what he called their commercial dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The executive with knowledge of the deal said that Levin's
careful language was an indication that the resolution will deal
solely with the financial details of Time Warner's agreement to
continue carrying the ABC stations, and will not specifically
address Disney's concerns about the merger with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this agreement is an enormously positive step,'' the
executive said. ``Whether it's the last step or not, time will
tell.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Disney executives challenged some aspects of the merger in
meetings with both congressmen and representatives of the Federal
Communications Commission last week. Though Disney did not ask the
FCC to block the merger itself, Disney did request that it issue
certain directives that would insure that competitors receive the
same full access to consumers that any AOL or Time Warner company
receives after the two companies merge.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's worries about whether a combined AOL and Time Warner
would wield too much control over access to both the Internet and
cable distribution became a factor in what had been long-standing
negotiations over how Disney would be compensated for the
transmission on Time Warner cable systems of the ABC stations that
Disney owns.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had backed off a deal that was near completion when the
AOL merger was announced. Time Warner charged that, after the
merger announcement, Disney greatly increased its financial
demands, to a point where it would have cost Time Warner another
$300 million over 10 years. Disney disputed that figure.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to come to Disney in fees for carrying cable
channels that Disney owns, including the Disney Channel, the Soap
Channel and Toon Disney.
</P>
<P>
   The rancor escalated into the showdown at the beginning of the
month, when Time Warner pulled ABC off the air in such cities as
New York, Los Angeles, and Houston. ABC reacted by placing
advertisements in many papers for consumers to purchase satellite
dishes to circumvent Time Warner's cable service. ABC agreed to pay
the cost of the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   That move greatly angered Time Warner officials, who said Disney
was directly threatening their business.
</P>
<P>
   But there were indications early this week that the two sides
were getting closer because the ads for ABC's satellite deal were
pulled from newspapers starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this week, Time Warner reached agreement with NBC
for transmission of that network's stations. ``That move sort of
isolated ABC,'' said a Time Warner executive. ``It helped move
things along.''

SENATE REJECTS DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWING GROUND TROOPS FROM KOSOVO

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for the Clinton administration, the
Senate on Thursday narrowly rejected a measure to set a deadline
for withdrawing U.S. ground troops from Kosovo. Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas had also criticized the measure, and influenced a number
of votes against it.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 53-47, senators stripped a provision from a
military construction spending bill that would have cut off funds
for the 5,600 U.S. troops forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, forcing
their withdrawal unless Congress authorized the mission's
extension.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, several of President Clinton's cabinet
officers waged an all-out campaign to defeat the measure, phoning
wavering senators and sending military commanders to Congress to
warn of the dangers to U.S. troops and Washington's commitment to
the NATO operation if the measure passed. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said he would recommend that Clinton veto the legislation if
it passed.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was close enough, and important enough for the
administration, that Vice President Al Gore presided over the
roll-call, prepared to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have been forced to withdraw in this manner would have
demoralized our allies and emboldened those in the region who favor
violence as a solution to their disputes,'' Gore said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 55 Republicans voted for a Democratic amendment
to strike the withdrawal language from the $8.6 billion military
construction spending bill. At least two or three Republicans,
including Thad Cochran of Mississippi, said they were swayed by the
opposition of Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Bush said what he said, because it showed this was
not aimed at this president in particular,'' Cochran said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bush criticized the provision, calling it a
``legislative overreach'' that would tie his hands if he became
president. Thursday, a spokesman for Bush, Scott McClellan, said,
``The Senate made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation revealed the restiveness in Congress over
America's open-ended commitment in Kosovo and Bosnia, which so far
has cost $20 billion. It also stoked the smoldering debate over
competing prerogatives: Congress' constitutional power of the purse
and the president's authority to send U.S. forces to far-flung hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   In several hours of heated debate Wednesday and Thursday, both
sides accused the other of jeopardizing the safety of U.S. troops,
America's commitment to its European allies and the long-term
security of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of the amendment is to restore congressional
oversight over the Kosovo mission,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia, the provision's chief Democratic sponsor. ``Of
course, the administration doesn't like it. They want a free hand
to participate in military adventurism whenever and wherever they
please. They don't want to hear a peep out of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics said imposing an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal
would send a dangerous signal of uncertain U.S. resolve to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, and undermine the unity
and morale of the allied peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would precipitate a year of dangerous uncertainty and
wavering commitment to our allies,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
a leading foe of the provision and sponsor of the amendment to kill
it.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Republicans joined 38 Democrats in supporting Levin's
decisive amendment, while 40 Republicans and seven Democrats
opposed it.

   Levin's measure also eliminated a second contentious provision
to withhold 25 percent of the military's funds in Kosovo this year,
unless the president certified by July 15, 2000, that the European
allies were meeting their commitments for reconstruction aid,
police officers and assistance with food and medicines in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Without the presidential certification, the measure required
that money could be spent in Kosovo only for an orderly withdrawal
of U.S. forces.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The defeated provision's chief Republican author, Sen. John W.
Warner, R-Va., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
remained undaunted after Thursday's vote. Warner vowed to offer the
provision as an amendment to the Pentagon's budget bill for fiscal
year 2001 when that legislation reaches the Senate floor in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House approved, by a vote of 264-153, a
amendment similar to the Senate's. But the House version gives the
president until April 1, 2001, nearly nine months longer than the
Senate, to certify that the European allies are meeting their
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The House version actually sets even higher standards than the
Senate provision. Under the House measure, for instance, the allies
would be responsible for 50 percent of reconstruction aid; the
Senate version required at least 33 percent. The House version
would require allies to pick up 90 percent of the new civilian
police in Kosovo; the Senate version required at least 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the allies are providing 63 percent of the police and
are close to providing 75 percent of basic human aid, the White
House said. The United States has pledged 15 percent of the total
financial support to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,
Jacob J. Lew, said Thursday that the allies use different
bookkeeping practices, which ``could prevent certification of
numeric burden-sharing shares.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment of American forces aboard should not rest on
mechanical formulas and record-keeping technicalities,'' Lew said
in a letter to the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said he would recommend that Clinton veto any bill that
contained the burden-sharing provisions, setting up a clash between
the administration and both chambers of Congress, if Warner carries
out his plan to tack the measure onto the Pentagon budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It seemed almost certain Thursday night that the fight over U.S.
military involvement in the Balkans would not end with Thursday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no long-term plan for Kosovo,'' complained Sen. Trent
Lott, the majority leader, who supports imposing the deadline on
withdrawal. ``We don't know how long we're going or how much it's
going to cost. Commitments are not being fulfilled by the
Europeans, and that's unacceptable.''

TEST OF INEXPENSIVE DRUGS MAY IMPROVE AIDS TREATMENT IN AFRICA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston researcher's campaign to change the AIDS
battle in the Third World has launched a landmark clinical trial
that will test Botswana children with a drug combination uniquely
suited to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor College of Medicine pediatrics specialist Dr. Mark Kline
and other team members Thursday announced the latest chapter in
their effort to bring affordable AIDS care to Africa, home of 70
percent of the world's HIV-infected population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest trial of AIDS treatment for children ever
undertaken on the African continent,'' said Kline, whose AIDS work
in the last four years has taken him to Africa, Romania, Mexico and
Panama. ``It combines drugs that are safe, effective and dirt cheap
_ drugs that could represent potentially health-restoring and
life-prolonging treatment to millions of Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being funded by Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co. as part
of its $100 million Secure the Future initiative, a five-year
project training AIDS specialists, strengthening community
prevention and treatment programs and setting up research trials in
five southern African nations. The $100 million includes $5 million
for the new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The overall project, begun a year ago, was born of frustration
that the long-term care and research that has brought great
advances in the United States has never been tried in Africa
because AIDS treatment is too expensive for most patients. AIDS
kills 6,000 people a day in Africa and has orphaned 15 percent of
children in the worst-affected cities.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of the populations of the nations in the
project _ South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotoho and Swaziland _
live with HIV/AIDS and their general life expectancy has dropped
from the 60s to the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Meyers, Kline and other team physicians made the
announcement of the new clinical trial at a Chicago interfaith
breakfast where clergy from 30 denominations were asked to support
the project. Members of their congregations may ``adopt'' a child
for $1,000, money that would be matched by Bristol-Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   The project has already brought African doctors to Houston _ one
attended Thursday's breakfast _ and Houston doctors to Africa for
training purposes. Drug-combination therapy, previously unavailable
in Africa, can be dangerous if not administered properly.
</P>
<P>
   The new trial consists of two antivirals _ stavudine and
didanosine _ and hydroxy urea. The latter drug interrupts cellular
activity and would by useless by itself, but it helps suppress the
AIDS virus when used in conjunction with other drugs. A daily dose
of hydroxy urea costs only 78 cents and stavudine and didanosine
are also relatively inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, but as a combination they have been studied
sparingly, mostly in Europe, with adults. The combination has never
been studied with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pivotal first step in learning how best to treat
pediatric HIV and AIDS in a resource-limited environment,'' said
Kline. ``It should also mark a first step in building the capacity
for Botswana health-care workers to stage future trials concerning
issues of critical health importance.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial of 500 children, administered and monitored by Baylor
and Botswana hospital staff, is scheduled to begin July 1 and last
two years. If it is successful, Kline said, it will become standard
treatment in many Third World settings.

DERBY WINNER'S TRAINER REMAINS CALM DURING SWARM OF HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ An 8-foot tall chain-link fence topped with coils of
prison-style security wire _ the stuff that looks like it has razor
blades sticking up from it _ runs along Belvedere Avenue. It forms
a border between a residential area of rowhouses and the
backstretch barn area at Pimlico Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   On the side of the fence where the low-income housing project is
located, people struggle to pay for $50 of groceries. On the other
side, there's a four-legged animal who uses the restroom where he
sleeps, and he's worth $50 million, and counting.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus is spending
his time before he runs in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus, could have stabled
the colt on the other side of the track in the stakes barn with the
rest of the horses who are running in the Preakness. Not 25 feet
away from the stakes barn, there's a strip of green grass where the
colt could graze in the afternoons. A couple of trees provide some
shade. Birds chirp.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a pack of media, and at least 25 members of the
throng carry minicams and swarm around like gnats trying to get a
picture of the horses.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale decided to get away from that in favor of the
backstretch, Barn No. 7. Not many cameras back there, but plenty of
concrete, dirt and manure pits. And the prison wire.
</P>
<P>
   This is Drysdale. In a sporting world fed by radio talk shows
and chat rooms, where everyone has to have a ``take,'' where
everyone is encouraged to ``bring it,'' where everyone is searching
for the next sound bite full of trash talk, Drysdale gets away from
it all and doesn't participate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 days, from the time Fusaichi Pegasus rumbled past
the finish line at Churchill Downs, people have been bringing their
takes.
</P>
<P>
   A few people want to place the Triple Crown upon Fusaichi
Pegasus right now. The best since Secretariat, they say, their eyes
inexplicably scanning past horses named Seattle Slew, Affirmed,
Spectacular Bid, some of the best horses to ever wear a bridle.
</P>
<P>
   Others live in the ha-rumpff camp. Triple Crown winner?
Ha-rumpff. This is the Preakness Stakes. They don't hand over the
trophy until a horse wins the Derby, Preakness and Belmont. Only 11
horses in more than 120 years have done that. Ha-rumpff.
</P>
<P>
   People hear how this horse easily won the Derby on one hand, and
how it's so hard to win the Triple Crown on the other. They're
looking for a story. They haven't been around the sport that much.
They see this colt cost $4 million as a yearling and people now are
talking about syndicating his breeding rights for more than $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   So they come here and they want to know just how great this colt
is. Then they run into Drysdale, and they leave thinking that it
was a brick wall instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the greatest horse you've ever trained?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early days,'' Drysdale says.
</P>
<P>
   Care to elaborate?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won two major races. He's raced six times. It's way too
early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Drysdale. Substance over style.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it must have been like for reporters covering Tom
Landry. A pleasant man who responsibly and intelligently answered
questions, but not a lot of flash or unusual inflection coating his
answers. He'll wear nice clothes on game day, but he has his
coaching garb on at workouts. Attention is on detail.
</P>
<P>
   Landry put the team first. It looks like Drysdale does, too.
That became apparent when someone asked him one of those ``You know
I don't answer touchy-feely'' questions, and he was persuaded to
give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does it feel to train a Kentucky Derby winner and be
inducted into the Hall of Fame the same week?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for the horse,'' Drysdale said. ``The horses get
you here. Without the horses, there isn't a sport. That's probably
what keeps one humble.''
</P>
<P>
   The horses first. It's a pain for the media. It may not give
horse racing a splash of sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Drysdale. And the horses often speak for him. nn

HEALTH CARE COMPANY AGREES TO SETTLE FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas)   By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the nation's largest health
care company, has agreed in principle to pay $745 million in civil
penalties to resolve a portion of the government's inquiry into
whether its success was achieved in part by cheating federal health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, if ultimately approved, will be by far the
largest health care fraud settlement ever obtained by the Justice
Department, exceeding the next highest by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal announced Thursday does not bring an end to the
sprawling investigations into the health care company, some of
which have lasted more than seven years. Criminal and other civil
investigations into some of the company's business practices remain
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement addresses civil allegations that the company
fraudulently increased patient billings to the government from its
hospitals and home health care businesses, as well as charging for
unnecessary laboratory tests. The allegations that remain
unresolved have long been at the heart of the case: whether
Columbia hospitals fraudulently overstated their expenses to
increase reimbursement from federal health programs and engaged in
illegal financial relationships with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's deal included an unusual structure that will
put immense pressure on both Columbia and the government to resolve
the entire case before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the criminal cases against
Columbia must be settled by Dec. 31. If that does not happen _ or
if the government does not grant certain extensions for
negotiations _ Columbia can withdraw the settlement offer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the two sides do not resolve the criminal
case this year, the government stands to lose hundreds of millions
of dollars, while Columbia would return to square one in the
negotiating process _ or be on its way to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an elegantly crafted settlement to put the arm on
everybody to get the rest of the deal done,'' said Stephen Meagher,
a lawyer who represents some of the people who first brought
allegations of fraud at Columbia to the government's attention.
``It's a settlement time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a statement Thursday acknowledging
generally that a tentative agreement had been reached with Columbia
on certain issues. Officials declined to comment further, as did
Michael Chertoff, a lead lawyer in Columbia's defense efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Campbell, a senior Columbia executive, said that the
company had hoped to resolve the entire case but that both sides
had decided to announce the progress so far. ``Our goal had been to
get a total global settlement,'' he said. ``But we were at a point
in time on three areas where we felt we could get a settlement and
thought we should proceed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, the largest health care fraud settlement was for
$486 million, by Fresenius Medical Care AG, the nation's largest
provider of dialysis services. The settlement, which was announced
in January, involved allegations of fraud at National Medical Care,
a dialysis provider that was being investigated by the government
when it was bought by Fresenius in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The three areas covered by the tentative settlement with
Columbia all involve technical financial issues that the government
contends resulted in overpayments to Columbia by federal health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those areas involves a practice known as upcoding,
in which hospitals receive larger payments from Medicare by
inflating the seriousness of illnesses they treat. A 1997 computer
analysis by The New York Times of more than 30 million billing
records found that many Columbia hospitals billed Medicare for
high-paying treatments far more often than competing hospitals
serving similar populations. Federal authorities at the time called
such findings an indication of possible overbilling.
</P>
<P>
   The second portion of the settlement addressed allegations of
fraud in Columbia's laboratories. In this area, Columbia is facing
allegations that have been made against several other health care
companies. Over the last decade, these other companies have settled
charges that they improperly ``bundled'' additional and unnecessary
diagnostic analysis onto simple blood tests _ in the end billing
the government for the unneeded tests.
</P>
<P>
   The last area of the settlement, involving Columbia's home
health care business, is the most complex. Home care reimbursement
from the government is based on expenses reported to federal health
authorities in documents called cost reports. But the government
has contended that Columbia fraudulently added improper expenses
onto the home-care business to increase reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   This settlement, according to the company, would resolve
allegations that Columbia's home care business reported expenses
for marketing in its cost reports as being for community education
_ a shift that, through the federal formula, would result in higher
reimbursements to the home-care business.
</P>
<P>
   The home care settlement would also resolve allegations that a
series of 1994 transactions between Columbia and a home care
manager, now known as the Olsten Corp. had been improperly
structured to maximize management fees to Olsten _ which the
government would partly reimburse _ and minimize other expenses
that brought less, if any, reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the home care settlement would resolve allegations that
Columbia fraudulently billed for services to patients who did not
qualify for such care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long expected that one portion of the
investigation that now remains unresolved could cost Columbia
hundreds of millions of dollars alone. That portion, involving
cost-reporting fraud by the company's hospitals, has already led to
criminal convictions of executives at one Columbia hospital in
Florida. Campbell of Columbia declined to discuss whether the
company had any projections for the ultimate cost of settling all
of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement served as a final denouement for Richard
L. Scott, the former chairman of Columbia who was once celebrated
as a visionary reformer of the hospital industry, but who was
ultimately forced to resign under pressure as allegations of
wrongdoing at his company mounted.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a decade, Scott had built a company he founded with
two small hospitals in El Paso, Texas, into the world's largest
health care company _ a $20 billion giant with about 350 hospitals,
550 home health care offices and scores of other medical businesses
in 38 states.
</P>
<P>
   The company held itself out as a model for the increasingly
cost-conscious world of health care, applying the competitive
practices of corporate America to an industry still dominated by
nonprofit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1997, Scott's dream was unraveling. In July of that year,
law enforcement agents raided Columbia offices and hospitals in
seven states, seizing documents related to business practices.
Scott played down the action, saying that investigations were
common in health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's board saw it differently. In a matter of
weeks, Scott was pushed to resigned. He was replaced by Dr. Thomas
F. Frist Jr., a co-founder of the Hospital Corporation of America,
the granddaddy of the profit-making hospital corporations, which
Columbia acquired in 1994.

OATES KNOWS HE'S RIGHT ONLY IF RANGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers closer John Wetteland had
thrown 56 pitches Friday and Saturday, and there was little doubt
he was unavailable during Sunday's game against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   There was also little doubt manager Johnny Oates was doing the
right thing when, with a 6-5 lead, he left Francisco Cordero in the
game to pitch the ninth inning. Cordero gave up home runs to Troy
Glaus and Scott Spiezio to lose the game, but, given all the
options, leaving him in still seemed the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   All that was needed was confirmation from Oates that Wetteland
was indeed unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Oates couldn't resist saying, ``I want to even out
my mail. It's been overwhelmingly against bringing him in lately,
so I wanted to give people the chance to write me about not
bringing him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully he was joking, but perhaps the manager is growing
weary of constant questions about his pitching staff. If so, it's
somewhat understandable.
</P>
<P>
   CBS newsman Dan Rather once said the president of the United
States should hold a news conference once every week to 10 days as
a way to maintain trust between the leadership and citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rather: ``The critical point is that the president must
stand up, stripped of all his protection, and field questions
coming at him from various directions in an unprepared context.
Thus, the viewer can see how he reacts to the unexpected when he
catches a snowball, and, sometimes, what he really thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the Rangers, unlike the most powerful man in the
world, does not have the luxury of waiting seven to 10 days between
news conferences. Every single day, Oates has to do not one, but
two, news conferences _ before and after each game _ plus two radio
shows and one television interview. Every single day.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't include occasional interviews with opposing
television and radio reporters, out-of-town writers, national
outlets, columnists and other assorted media. On any given day,
Oates could be asked 30 to 50 questions about his team, none of
them coming from general manager Doug Melvin or owner Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are scrutinized more fiercely than the manager of a
major-league baseball team, especially when his pitching is going
bad. And right now, given the state of baseball, the great
preponderance of postgame questions directed at any manager are
about pitching. After all, what more is there to say about Ivan
Rodriguez except he's the best catcher in the known universe.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be you'd ask about a particular bunt, hit-and-run or
pinch hitter, or the lack of those. But that was in a 3-2 game.
When it's 8-7, and it's all about bashing, who cares if the manager
had Jason McDonald bunt or not. The Rangers usually score anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Oates' biggest headache is how to use his pitching
staff, particularly his bullpen. It's become a touchy subject
because even when Oates makes the extremely logical move, it
doesn't always work. And whether it does or doesn't work, an
explanation is almost always requested after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have taken the philosophy that it doesn't matter what move I
make, because if it doesn't work out right, it's the wrong move,''
Oates said. ``I'm not going to beat myself up trying to defend the
move you know is the right one, but it turns out to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there is no right move, not when Tim Crabtree busts a
95 mph fastball in on Jose Canseco's fists, breaks his bat and
watches the ball bloop into left field for a single. Not when Jeff
Zimmerman breaks off one nasty slider after another, then throws a
fastball in some utility infielder's eyes and it's hit into the
seats in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Being a pitcher right now is not easy. But being a manager
handling the pitching might be even worse. There are no easy
answers, but there are always an endless stream of questions that
have to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, how about that Pudge Rodriguez? nn

PENTAGON POSTPONES TEST OF MISSILE-DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon announced on Thursday that a decisive
test of a national missile-defense system has again been delayed,
increasing pressure on the project's managers to meet the Clinton
administration's timetable for deciding whether to deploy the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization had
planned to conduct the test on June 26, but late last month the
project's managers discovered a wiring problem in the interceptor
missiles to be tested, officials said. Because of required repairs,
the scheduled test has now been pushed back at least another week
and perhaps longer, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The missile office has still not scheduled a new date for the
test, but the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said on
Thursday that the delay ``should not have any impact whatsoever''
on the Clinton administration's timetable for making a decision on
whether to deploy later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The test has already suffered another delay, a longer one that
pushed the timing of President Clinton's decision into the heart of
this year's presidential campaign. The administration's plans to
proceed with testing the system and deciding on the deployment of
it has provoked a highly partisan debate at home and a diplomatic
furor abroad.
</P>
<P>
   With a decision nearing, the administration's plans have become
increasingly unsettling to the Russians and the Chinese, who view
it as a threat to their own strategic nuclear deterrence, as well
as some allies who fear it could upset decades of arms-control
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to meet next month with the Russian
president, Vladimir Putin, to discuss amending the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty of 1973 to allow the construction of a limited
national missile defense. Clinton's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, met with Putin in Moscow on Thursday, and while the
meeting was described as friendly, Berger evidently made little
progress in overcoming Russia's opposition to the system.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pentagon proceeds with the test _ the fourth and final
one the military has planned before Clinton is to make his decision
_ an interceptor missile will be launched from Kwajalein Atoll in
the Marshall Islands toward an intercontinental ballistic missile
fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   In the last test in January, the first of a fully integrated
system of missiles, radars and sensors, the interceptor approached
the incoming missile but failed to hit it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest delay has created concern among Pentagon officials.
Under an agreement with the Marshall Islands to protect fishermen,
the Pentagon must suspend testing for a month beginning July 12.
Thus the window for testing in July has narrowed considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Further delays could postpone the test until August, making it
unlikely that Secretary of Defense William Cohen would have time to
review the test data, confer with the military and make a
recommendation to Clinton before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The final test has already faced considerable delays, which the
project's managers said they needed to correct a problem with the
infrared sensors that caused the interceptor to miss its target
during January's test.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and the administration have come under bipartisan
pressure to slow down what officials acknowledge is a compressed
testing schedule. Members of both parties have said the timetable
is based on political, rather than technological considerations,
and called for delaying the decision. But Bacon reiterated on
Thursday that Cohen was determined to make a recommendation to
Clinton according to schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air Force, a spokesman for the
missile organization, said the problem with the latest interceptor
was discovered on April 30 during a test at Lockheed Martin's plant
in Sunnyvale, Calif. The problem did not involve the interceptor
missile itself, but rather a transmitter used to monitor the test.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, which is building the interceptor's warhead, repaired
the problem at its plant in Tucson, Ariz. Once the warhead is
reattached to its booster rocket, it will be flown to Kwajalein for
final test preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll get the test done before the range closes,''
Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why officials disclosed the problem nearly three
weeks after it was discovered. Bacon said the project's managers
did not consider it a serious setback.

NELSON EXCITED ABOUT COACHING MAVS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Don Nelson returned to his Reunion Arena office
Thursday after vacationing in Hawaii and said he'll probably
finalize a deal with owner Mark Cuban soon to coach the Dallas
Mavericks again next season.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, who is vacationing in London and plans to return to
Dallas late this month, said Wednesday that Nelson is his only
candidate to coach the team next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really excited about this team,'' Nelson said
Thursday. ``I don't think anybody can coach them better than I can.
Mark seems to want me to come back, and I'm leaning that way. I
think it's just a matter of us getting together more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson had said he would retire from coaching after this season,
but Cuban's persuasion and overwhelming support from key players
convinced Nelson he should return.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start looking for people, it's not easy to find a
good coach,'' Nelson said. ``There's about five or six teams
looking for a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks closed the season with an impressive 16-5 record
in their last 21 games. They were 40-42 overall, four games behind
Sacramento in the race for the final Western Conference playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cuban, Nelson wants to build on that momentum, saying the
prospects of advancing to the playoffs next season is ``one of the
reasons I want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is under contract to continue as the Mavericks' general
manager for the next three seasons. PARKER RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Parker, the only one of Don Nelson's nine assistant
coaches who doesn't have a contract, will get another deal soon,
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson had said Parker, Del Harris, Donnie Nelson and Sidney
Moncrief would be his ``bench coaches'' during games next season.
But NBA rules permit only three assistants on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll figure that out,'' Don Nelson said. ``But those guys are
going to be with me. I'm not going to have any titles with the
assistants on the bench. We're just going to be coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Roth, a bench assistant last season, is now an advance
scout for the Mavericks. JONES LIKELY GONE
</P>
<P>
   Guard Damon Jones' career with the Mavericks appears to be over
because Dallas has Michael Finley, Steve Nash, Greg Buckner, Hubert
Davis, Erick Strickland and possibly Robert Pack on board in the
backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for Damon to make our team next year,''
Don Nelson said. ``So we told Damon that he should look around for
another team.'' nn

BABBITT RIPS RESPONSE TO LOS ALAMOS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Ore.)  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ With a scathing indictment of the federal
response to fires that have now burned nearly 80 square miles of
northern New Mexico and more than 400 homes, Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt said Thursday that the government was wholly to blame
and would do whatever possible to compensate victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calculations that went into this were seriously flawed,''
Babbitt said at a news conference in which federal officials
described how a planned burn for a small section in Bandelier
National Monument quickly raged out of control, overtaking wide
areas beyond, including the city of Los Alamos and the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, a nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's compared the combination of poor planning and bad
decisions by people in the national parks and forest services to
``a cascading series of events, like a rock being dislodged down a
hill, leading to a landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes began with missing weather information and led to
problems from a lack of firefighters, equipment and judgment about
a situation that grew increasingly dangerous by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's remarks were timed with the release of the results of
a federal investigation into what happened from the evening of May
4, when park service personnel at Bandelier National Monument
ignited what officials call a ``prescribed fire,'' a means commonly
used to remove dead and dried timber in an effort to reduce the
possibility of a catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that almost every aspect of the plan for the
prescribed fire was poorly conceived and carried out, beginning
with the critical omission of wind predictions for several days
into the burn. For some reason, the investigators found, that
information was not passed along to officials responsible for
authorizing the burn and for managing it.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said that the park official who was in charge
of the burn, Mike Powell, lacked the proper experience to manage a
fire once it raced out of control. Powell's boss, Roy Weaver, the
superintendent of Bandelier National Monument, has been on
administrative leave since the fires became out of control. Powell
is still working at the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical and operational experience of the burn boss was
not adequate,'' said Dick Bahr, a burn specialist with the park
service from Boise, Idaho, and one of the investigators. ``He had
not seen a fire of this complexity and size.''
</P>
<P>
   As forceful as he was in ascribing blame, Babbitt was equally
strident in saying that the federal government would accept full
blame for the wildfire, which was about 65 percent contained
Thursday. He said Congress was developing emergency legislation
that would compensate people who lost their homes and businesses. A
similar measure in 1976 helped people affected by a break in the
Teton Dam in Wyoming to receive compensation within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also said the Clinton administration ``is on the
wavelength'' to sign the pending legislation, once it passes the
House and Senate, which he predicted was likely to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he and others in
the state's congressional delegation had met with administration
officials, adding that they were planning to work together ``to
establish some principles that we ought to incorporate in a law
that will permit us to pay damages to the New Mexicans and other
institutions that have been damaged by this fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Domenici was also critical of what he called ``this
negligence'' that led to the destruction, adding that ``the people
of New Mexico and this country deserve to be very, very upset and
to demand a much better performance and to insist that we find a
way to recompense the people in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Cerro Grande Fire, as it is now known, has claimed
405 homes and closed many businesses, most of them in the Los
Alamos area, which is about 45 miles from Santa Fe, the state
capital. Early estimates put the aggregate loss at more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Several of New Mexico's leading elected officials here built on
Babbitt's remarks to assuage fears of those who suffered losses
from the fires. Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican who spent much of
the day with Babbitt, urged New Mexicans to ``document, document,
document your losses'' to expedite the paperwork in making claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government could not have done a better job
responding to a terrible situation,'' Johnson said. ``Los Alamos
was hit by an 18-wheeler, and the government was driving the
18-wheeler. But don't hire an attorney yet. Give the government a
chance to make good on this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The thrust of the report was to review how decisions were made
leading to the initial burn, how the authorities responded, whether
management personal had proper training and experience and whether
existing procedures were adequate to cover all contingencies once
the fire spread.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were nearly universal in their condemnation, with
these as some of the major conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _ The plan for the prescribed burn was inadequate in that
federal personnel did not take into account the complexities of the
terrain and the material to be burned.
</P>
<P>
   _ No one analyzed the plan with a critical eye toward unexpected
developments, which resulted in ignoring the possible need for
additional firefighters and equipment if the fire spread. As the
fire spread, state and local firefighters found themselves
critically overwhelmed, with some people on the lines working 24
hours and longer without a break.
</P>
<P>
   _ The plan did not take into account predictions of wind
conditions over the three to five days after the ignition. The
information was missing in Weaver's assessment, and no one else he
consulted mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coordination among federal, state and local agencies was
lacking, and when other opinions were sought, there was a lack of
critical analysis. ``You can't rubber stamp these things,'' Bahr
said. ``Everybody has got to be involved in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Once the fire spread, suppression tactics that were used did
not comply with federal standards in effect since 1995, a
transgression that aided the fire's growth. ``The policy is
sound,'' said Joe Stutler, a fire operations specialist from
Redmond, Ore., who was a member of the investigation team. ``But
federal agencies working jointly did not put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The report released Thursday is only the first step in assessing
procedures that are routinely used throughout the West, which is
highly susceptible to raging fires, especially in the dry months of
spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has appointed a four-member board of inquiry that will
take a harder look at what happened here, with technical experts
reviewing what happened and possibly recommending administrative or
punitive actions. That board, Babbitt said, is expected to complete
its work by late next week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Babbitt said the federal officials are now working
in Flagstaff, Ariz., to develop a new model for planned burns that
takes into account safety factors that were absent here, causing
such widespread property destruction and evacuations.

FORECASTERS SAY WEATHER LOOKS GOOD FOR SHUTTLE LAUNCH 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Forecasters on Thursday promised perfect
conditions for a change as NASA readied the shuttle Atlantis for a
weather-delayed repair mission to the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis, with a crew of seven astronauts, is scheduled to blast
off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center Friday at 5:12 a.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Three times late last month, high winds at the shuttle's
emergency runways in Florida, Spain and Morocco spoiled otherwise
trouble-free launch attempts. Three days ago, the shuttle's liftoff
was bumped again by 24 hours when winds grounded another rocket
vying with Atlantis for the use of military radar tracking
equipment here.
</P>
<P>
   Weather is crucial for this mission's five-minute launching
periods. The timing of the shuttle's liftoff is constrained by the
orbital motion of the space station, which is whipping around Earth
at 5 miles a second and at an altitude of 206 miles.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, shuttle weather officer Ed Priselac wiped away even
a slight concern earlier this week that fog in Florida would
threaten the dawn liftoff. Conditions at emergency runways in
Europe, Africa, California and New Mexico also looked favorable,
ready for a shuttle if it suddenly was crippled as it climbed to
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The countdown is going very smoothly,'' reported NASA's Dave
King, director of ground processing for the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew plans to dock with the uninhabited first
components of the new station late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The linkup will kick off five to six days of intense activity as
astronauts replace failing power storage batteries, repair a
communications antenna and attempt to raise the altitude of the
orbital outpost by nearly 27 miles. During a lengthy spacewalk, two
astronauts plan to secure a wobbly external cargo crane.
</P>
<P>
   All of the activities are intended to prepare the station for
the arrival of the long overdue Russian crew module in July; the
first resident crew of astronauts and cosmonauts late this year;
and a U.S. research module by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Construction has been stalled since the first two modules were
joined in Earth orbit in December 1998, largely by Russian
financial problems that have raised doubts about that country's
commitment to the project.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam should disappear, though, with the arrival of the
Russian crew module, according to NASA's Robert Cabana, the station
program's manager of international operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to build this station,'' he said. ``It's going to
happen. I think when you see more hardware in orbit and get a crew
on board, people will develop a lot of belief in this program.``

 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mother and son described by prosecutors as a
prolific and pitiless con artist team were convicted Thursday of
murdering a wealthy widow as part of an intricate scheme to steal
her Upper East Side town house.
</P>
<P>
   The convictions of the mother and son, Sante and Kenneth Kimes,
was a triumph for Manhattan prosecutors who brought a rare type of
murder case: one in which the body was never found, and one built
entirely on circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors said it was the
first case in New York, and one of only a handful in the nation, in
which murder convictions were won without a body, a witness, a
confession or any forensic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said that the pair's murder of the widow,
Irene Silverman, was just one of a number of crimes they had
committed: By the time the Kimeses arrived in New York in June
1998, they had left behind what investigators described as a huge
mosaic of fraud, theft, arson and murder that reached across the
country, as far away as Hawaii. ``They are the most ingenious, evil
con artists we've seen in a long time,'' a senior law enforcement
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews and a review of court records revealed a story of a
tyrannical mother and a malleable son caught in a love-hate
relationship, living a life of scams and aliases.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching Thursday's verdict, jurors called the evidence
against the Kimeses overwhelming and said their first vote for a
murder conviction was unanimous even though the body of the victim
has never been found. Silverman was last seen on July 5, 1998, and
the Kimeses were charged with murder in December 1998 in an
indictment that outlined a plot involving disguises, false
identities, tapped telephones, forged deeds, false addresses and
burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors said the most damning pieces of evidence presented by
prosecutors during the three-month trial were 14 notebooks with
detailed lists and notes written by Sante Kimes. Prosecutors
contended that the notes pointed to an elaborate scheme to murder
Silverman and steal her $7.7 million Upper East Side town house.
During the four days of deliberations, the jury said there was no
real dissension on the most serious charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes, 65, blinked, rocked forward slightly and then sat
motionless as the first of a total of 118 guilty verdicts for her
and her son were read aloud in a packed courtroom in the Manhattan
Criminal Courts Building Thursday afternoon. Kenneth Kimes, 25, who
struggled to contain his emotions throughout the trial, winced and
swallowed as the first guilty verdict, on a charge of murder, was
read.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury forewoman continued announcing guilty verdict after
guilty verdict, Kenneth Kimes turned to his mother, said ``Mom,
it'll be OK,'' then frantically talked with his lawyers. The
Kimeses were found guilty of murder, robbery, burglary, criminal
possession of a weapon, forgery and eavesdropping. They both face
25 years to life in prison and will be sentenced by Justice Rena K.
Uviller of state Supreme Court on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes' compulsive note-taking, which she continued
throughout the trial, appeared to be her downfall. In the
notebooks, she repeatedly wrote reminders like ``get s.s. No.,''
``get keys,'' ``get signature'' and ``get checks.'' Her lists
included items like: ``when goes to sleep,'' ``blood type,'' ``what
kind of movies does she like?'' ``any exits in her apt.?'' ``is
there a burglar alarm in her apt.'' and ``help there on weekends?''
On another list, she wrote, ``get Lincoln,'' ``practice'' and
``park close,'' references to the Kimeses' plans for murdering
Silverman and disposing of her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept writing `get her Social Security number.' They had
in there, `need Social Security of Silverman','' said Michael
Alvarez, a juror who lives on the Upper East Side and is a
librarian. ``There was a lot of evidence, so for us, it wasn't that
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses' lawyers said they would appeal the verdict, but
their clients' legal troubles are only beginning. They now face
trial in Los Angeles in the fatal shooting of a longtime friend and
former business partner of Sante Kimes' late husband. If convicted
in that case, Kenneth Kimes, who is charged with being the gunman,
could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the verdict, a visibly stunned Sante Kimes
called the 118 guilty verdicts a ``temporary setback.'' She
predicted that she would win her appeal and insisted that she and
her son had been framed by police. ``I want to cry out for help to
anyone in the country who believes in justice to help us, help
us,'' she said, as tears welled in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hardy, a defense lawyer in the Silverman case,
complained that a ruling by Uviller prevented Sante Kimes from
taking the witness stand in her own defense. He said that the
ruling would be the main basis for the defense's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made it impossible for her to testify and have the jury
see her testimony as having any integrity,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   When they were arrested in midtown Manhattan shortly after
Silverman's disappearance on an unrelated warrant for passing a bad
$14,000 check in Utah, the Kimeses were carrying Silverman's keys,
passport, Social Security card and bank books. They also had what
prosecutors said was a forged deed selling Silverman's $7.7 million
mansion at 20 E. 65th St. to their off-shore corporation, for only
$395,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alvarez, a man who traveled with the Kimeses to New York,
testified that Kenneth Kimes announced, ``This would be a good
place to hide a body'' while they were driving through New Jersey,
and that the Kimeses wished each other ``good hunting'' when they
entered the city. But the most chilling evidence was the notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's home, which friends said was the center of her life,
now sits empty. Its lone resident is Silverman's longtime
caretaker, Mengistu Melesse, a soft-spoken man whom jurors called
one of their favorite witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman left all of her property, including her town house, to
the Kobe Foundation, a nonprofit charity she established to honor
the work of her mother, an embroiderer, and others in the field.
What will become of the mansion is up to the foundation's board,
according to lawyers administering Silverman's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, one of the jurors, said he was struck by the way
Silverman's employees said she treated them and how they spoke of
her.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hansen, a close friend of Silverman's who was with her on
the night before she disappeared, said she was overwhelmed by the
guilty verdict, but still haunted by the loss of a spirited woman
who rose from a working-class family to become a generous host and
benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's a bittersweet victory. Irene is gone,''
Hansen said in a halting voice. ``Just put a note in there about
how much we all love Irene. She was a remarkable woman.''

   CONCORD, N.H. _ Reflecting a mounting national unease over the
death penalty, New Hampshire's generally conservative Legislature
Thursday became the first in the country to approve a bill banning
capital punishment since the Supreme Court allowed executions to
resume nearly 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats,
voted 14 to 10, after an emotional hourlong debate, to approve a
bill repealing the state's death penalty. The House passed the same
bill in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who not only favors the death penalty
but wishes to expand it, has vowed to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some murders so heinous that the death penalty is an
appropriate punishment and, accordingly, I will veto this
legislation,'' the governor, a Democrat, said in a statement issued
after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vote here, in a state that has not executed
anyone since 1939 and has no prisoners on death row, was greeted by
opponents of the death penalty as a striking indication of changing
public attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, polls have shown that somewhat more than half
the population approves of capital punishment. And while even death
penalty opponents say no other state is likely to abolish the death
penalty, over the past few years more concerns have been raised
about its fairness and application, even among death penalty
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a historic vote and may signal a trend by
states away from the death penalty,'' said Richard Dieter,
executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a group
in Washington that opposes capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a growing concern about the accuracy and
fairness of the death penalty in many other states,'' Dieter said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant change came in January, when Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who was a longtime proponent
of the death penalty, ordered a moratorium on executions after
discovering that since 1987 the state had freed 13 prisoners from
death row because they were found to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than the number of convicts executed in that time.
Some who were ordered to be freed had been exonerated after
investigations by student journalists in a workshop at Northwestern
University.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's legal counsel, Judy Reardon, had tartly dismissed that
example in the debate here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Governor Shaheen were the governor of Illinois, she'd have
imposed a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, too,''
Reardon said. ``We don't have those problems in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dieter, the death penalty opponent, said the possibility of
wrongful convictions and executions, as well as publicized cases of
death row convicts exonerated with newly available DNA evidence,
was a major factor in the changing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the issue of innocence is what has triggered much
of this concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents in the New Hampshire Legislature appear
unlikely to be able to muster the two-thirds vote in both houses
necessary to override the governor's veto. Nevertheless, the votes
this spring indicated a major shift. Two years ago, the House
rejected a similar repeal bill by 40 votes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when the vote on repeal came up in the House in
March, the speaker of the overwhelmingly Republican body, Donna
Sytek, who is noted for controlling party line votes with an iron
hand, decreed a ``free vote'' in which the representatives should
vote their consciences.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed 191-163. While its main sponsor, James
Splain, a Democrat from Portsmouth, is regarded as one of the most
liberal legislators in the House, the measure was also backed by a
number of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of executions carried out in error weighed
heavily in the debate. One Republican representative, a lawyer,
argued that economics fundamentally skewed the system of justice,
leaving high numbers of poor blacks and Hispanics awaiting
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no millionaires on death row,'' the representative,
Anthony DiFruscia, said. ``Can you honestly say that you're going
to get equal justice under the law when, if you've got the money,
you're going to get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the measure moved to the Senate, early political soundings
suggested that the 24-member body was just about evenly split.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks leading up to the vote Thursday, three senators
_ including the Democratic chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee,
Debora Pignatelli _ changed their minds and voted to repeal the
death penalty, providing the margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Trombley, a Democrat from Boscawen, had favored the
death penalty. But rombley became troubled by testimony before the
House Judiciary Committee over the case of a man, Richard Buchanan,
who was charged with the murder and rape of a 6-year-old girl but
was later exonerated by DNA evidence. Even so, prosecutors still
held Buchanan in jail for months after the new evidence was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If scientific evidence today shows that we're making mistake
after mistake after mistake, the Legislature ought not to allow for
the possibility of that mistake being made,'' Trombley told The
Concord Monitor in an article that detailed the anguished decisions
of the three senators. ``The only way to do that is to abolish the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pignatelli had also favored the death penalty until the
Legislature began holding hearings. In January, one witness, Paris
Carriger, told lawmakers that he had spent 21 years on Arizona's
death row, and once came within three hours of being executed,
before being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something unseemly about the state being in the
position of executing people,'' Pignatelli finally concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Fraser, a Republican from Pittsfield, the third senator who
changed his mind, said that several factors figured in his
decision, including doubts that capital punishment was a deterrent
to crime, but that he was particularly struck by a letter from a
woman in Guilford.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wrote to me that she considered me her agent,'' Fraser
told The Monitor. `` `And as my agent,' she said, `I'd be
devastated if I thought you'd put someone to death.'''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's death penalty is limited to a short list of
crimes, including murder of a law enforcement or corrections
officer, murder for hire and murder during rape or attempted rape.
Gov. Shaheen has advocated expanding the list to include categories
like killing witnesses or informers.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3,600 people on death rows nationwide, and 87 death
row inmates have been freed since 1973, according to the Death
Penalty Information Center.

ANALYSIS: COULD BUSH'S INTERNATIONALISM PUT HIM AT ODDS WITH GOP
CONGRESS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With his recent statements on China trade and
the deployment of U.S. troops in Kosovo, Gov. George W. Bush has
placed himself squarely in a Republican tradition of favoring
internationalism and presidential supremacy in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is how much of a challenge he would face as
president from his own party, which has been increasingly fractured
over foreign policy in the post-Cold War era between
internationalists and an isolationist wing suspicious of many
foreign entanglements?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even though the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 53-47
shelved a measure _ opposed by President Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore and Bush alike _that could have terminated U.S. military
participation in Kosovo next July, it was mostly Democrats who
ensured the provision's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 of the 55 Senate Republicans heeded Bush's warnings that
this was a ``legislative overreach'' that would step on the foreign
policy prerogatives of the next president. Among those who voted to
keep a Kosovo withdrawal deadline was Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this is not an isolated vote. Even though most
congressional Republicans are rallying behind Clinton on granting
normalized trade relations to China, legislation that Bush also
supports, this is an issue of paramount importance to Republicans'
business constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Across other areas of foreign policy, where business is less of
a factor, there have been a host of occasions over the past years
in which Congress has declared independence from the president on
foreign policy and shown a suspicion of mutlilateral engagements.
Certainly the idea _ which Bush was trying to reestablish in his
statement on Kosovo _ that Congress bows to the president on
foreign policy has long disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998 when the United States began bombing Iraq just
as the House was about to vote to impeach Clinton, Lott refused to
back the military action and questioned Clinton's motives, asking
whether the timing of the raids was related to the impeachment
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, when Clinton was acting as the leader of the NATO
airstrikes on Kosovo, many Republican lawmakers opposed his policy.
And in the House, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip who is
currently rounding up votes for China trade alongside Clinton,
helped engineer the House defeat of a resolution endorsing the air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the Senate defeat last fall of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, followed this year by the floor proclamation by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that he would block ratification of any
treaties negotiated by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A key question is how much of this could come back to haunt
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Politically it is advantageous for him right now to look like
the new Republican who is trying to rein in the excesses of
Congress. In a speech last fall, he warned that the protectionist
wing of his party was pursuing ``a shortcut to disaster,'' and he
called for a policy of ``decidedly American internationalism.'' But
as president he would have to show that he could really define and
carry out such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans say that Bush would not face problems from a
Republican Congress _ that many of these votes across the years
have stemmed not from Republican isolationism but from the
poisonous relations between Congress and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is about on the Republican side is a deep dislike
and distrust for President Clinton, `' said Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, one of the 15 Republicans who joined with Democrats to
defeat the time limit on funds for the deployment. Hagel had
reached out last week to Bush's chief foreign policy adviser,
Condoleezza Rice, to alert the Bush campaign of the implications of
pending Kosovo vote and find out where Bush stood.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel said Thursday that he thought only eight of the Senate
Republicans truly reject internationalism. ``If you have a
President Bush,'' he said ``you'll find all this settle down
considerably in the Republican caucus next year. There will be a
new-found trust and confidence that he's our guy. And if our guy
says it's okay to be in Kosovo, that makes somewhat of a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush is more in synch with Republicans in Congress on
a number of foreign policy issues. He is interested in building a
robust anti-ballistic missile defense and like Helms has said he
would rather leave it up to the next president, not Clinton, to
negotiate with the Russians on the issue. He did not split with
Senate Republicans when they voted down the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty last year. Like the majority of them he said he thought the
treaty was unverifiable.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bush called for a ``distinctly American
internationalism'' in a major foreign policy speech last year, he
said that while America must be involved in the world, ``that does
not mean our military is the answer to every difficult foreign
policy situation _ a substitute for strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Republicans took control of Congress, Democrats
have often branded such views as isolationism. And the Republicans
have certainly given them fodder, such as when Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, the House majority leader, once bragged about his
disinterest in foreign travel. ``I've been to Europe once,'' he
told reporters in the Capitol. ``I don't have to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also wielded the isolationist label against Bush. The
vice president recently accused him of being ``stuck in a cold war
mindset.'' Stressing Bush's lack of foreign policy experience, Gore
added, ``One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's
foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the
ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party _ the
right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican congressional
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans take umbrage at such remarks. ``It is far, far
from an isolationist caucus,'' Hagel said speaking of Senate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs Thursday that some Republicans are ready to
flex their muscles on foreign policy no matter who is president.
``I'm in the legislative branch and I'm protecting my
prerogatives,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., who voted in
favor of the time limit for funding the Kosovo deployment.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had confidence that Bush, as president, would
immediately set a time limit for disengagement in Kosovo. But if
Bush did not do so, Hutchinson said, ``I think you'd see efforts to
set deadlines and Congress would move to try to disengage there
regardless if there's a President Gore or a President Bush.''

PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR HIGH ON BUSH'S LIST FOR A RUNNING MATE &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
on Thursday said he is seriously considering Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge as his running mate, despite Ridge's support for abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans opposed to abortion consistently express opposition
to Ridge, especially after his recent suggestion that the
anti-abortion plank be removed from the national Republican
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports the plank.
</P>
<P>
   But Ridge's name keeps turning up repeatedly as leading Bush's
short list of potential picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll consider Tom Ridge. He's a friend of mine. He's been a
good governor of Pennsylvania, and he's under serious
consideration, as are a lot of other people,'' the Texas governor
said Thursday during an interview on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Parro, executive director of the Republican National
Coalition for Life, said Bush would risk losing his base support if
he chooses Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridge has a terrible record on right-to- life issues,'' Parro
said. ``Many of us would be unable to support the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Parro said many Republicans would either not vote or shift to
Reform Party candidate Patrick Buchanan if Bush selects an
abortion-rights running mate. But Parro said the Republican Party
rules make it unlikely that anti-abortion activists could do
anything at the Republican National Convention to block Ridge's
selection as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention will be in Philadelphia this summer. The
state's 23 electoral votes are important to a national Bush victory
strategy. Pennsylvania went Republican in each presidential
election of the 1980s but has twice given Democrat Bill Clinton a
plurality in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's name keeps surfacing because several other potential
running mates have taken themselves out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is heading the vice
presidential search for Bush, recently told shareholders of
Halliburton Co. that he intends to stay on as CEO rather than take
a job in any new Bush administration, including vice president. And
Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Connie Mack of Florida have said
they are not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Fox News Thursday, Bush all but ruled out retired
Gen. Colin Powell as a potential running mate. Bush was scheduled
to meet with Powell Thursday in Austin as part of a promotion for
Powell's ``America's Promise, The Alliance for Youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take him (Powell) for his word when he said quite
adamantly that he does not want to be vice president,'' Bush said.
``I understand that, but I sure hope I can count on his support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush described Powell as a ``great, distinguished citizen'' whom
he might want in a Bush administration in a Cabinet position.
Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian
Gulf War under Bush's father, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include former American Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole; Govs. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, John Engler
of Michigan, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and Frank Keating of
Oklahoma; Sens. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, George Voinovich of
Ohio and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska; and U.S. Reps. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington, John Kasich of Ohio and Deborah Pryce of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush sent a letter to 450 Republican leaders
nationally, asking them for input into his vice presidential
selection, both on individuals and issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give a very thorough look and make a solid
decision,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to make a decision based on
these principles: Who can be the president? Do we share the same
philosophy, which is do we trust individuals as opposed to trusting
the federal government? And can we get along?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is one difference between Tipper Gore and
Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Million Mom March on behalf of gun control,
Clinton, wearing a light spring pant suit and straw hat, was so
busy working the crowds, she created rally gridlock. Gore, wearing
a white T-shirt tucked into her blue jeans, marched arm in arm with
other women, without an entourage and relatively unheralded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, is first lady, a candidate for Senate, and
an international celebrity. But, if any political wife in America
has been presumed to be her heir, and has had an opportunity to
study Hilary's example up close, it is the fellow blonde baby
boomer who rode the bus with her and their husbands in the 1992
presidential campaign and who broke into a spontaneous dance-like
hug with her at the 1992 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the two women's different styles at the march provided a
vivid contrast between their current approaches to their public
roles. Clinton's high-stakes political ambition has thrust her into
a public life with very little private space. Gore, on the other
hand, appears somewhat reluctant and ambivalent about her public
role yet firm in her conviction that she can maintain a zone of
privacy _ a phrase that Clinton coined _ even if her husband Al
happens to be running for president.
</P>
<P>
   One person who knows them both put it this way: ``Hillary went
as a candidate; Tipper went as a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 51, has spent nearly half of her life as a political wife.
She has had plenty of opportunity to consider what may lie ahead if
her husband, who has been vice president for seven years and is the
presumptive Democratic nominee, becomes president. But, she said
with some trepidation in a recent interview, ``It's a whole new
territory for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is reluctant to talk about the public-private balancing
act, but campaign aides say she is fearful of how a presidential
campaign might consume her family life. At times the Gores'
26-year-old daughter, Karenna, seems more comfortable in the public
spotlight than her mother. ``She wants to maintain her
individuality,'' one of the vice president's aides said about his
wife. ``That will be a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that even as the campaign heats up, she hopes to
continue doing a number of things that she does now with relative
anonymity _ traveling in a van at night searching out the homeless
and encouraging them into shelters, or going with her husband to
the movies in actual movie theaters, rather than sitting in a
private screening room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still been able to do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's mixed feelings about her public and private lives may
stem from her very public role as the voice of parental outrage
over the sexual and violent content of rock music lyrics, a
self-styled crusade in the mid-'80s that earned her the enmity of
many in the music industry. Frank Zappa branded er a ``cultural
terrorist'' and dismissed her effort as a ``housewife-hobby
project.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore still defends those efforts, which led to the recording
industry placing warning labels on records with explicit content.
``Music labeling has been going on long enough now that it's just
part of the cultural tableau,'' she said. ``The generations change
and people who might have had a different opinion understand it
now, actually appreciate it and actually use it.''
</P>
<P>
   But while she insists on her privacy _ Friday is their 30th
wedding anniversary, an occasion that her husband has trumpeted on
the campaign trail, but that she has insisted be spent privately _
she also lives a public life.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for instance, she appeared on stage at RFK
Stadium and played the drums in front of 45,000 people at a concert
on the eve of a gay-rights march on Washington. (Gore played the
drums in a girl band, the Wildcats, in high school, and is surely
the only candidate's wife to have played with members of the
Grateful Dead.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked to do it and I believe in the cause,'' she said in
the interview of her appearance. ``And I thought, yeah, it'll be
fun. It's a continuation of my commitment to have fun on the
campaign trail.''
</P>
<P>
   How much fun she is actually having is not clear, nor is her
precise role, which seems to be a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   She campaigns separately from her husband, adapting to each
occasion and generally steering clear of policy. She provides what
campaign advisers say is a much-needed human, down-to-earth
dimension to the legendarily stiff vice president.
</P>
<P>
   She frequently talks to youth audiences and, having disclosed
last year that she fought her own battle with depression, the
conversations often touch on the darker side of teen life. On
Wednesday, she represented her family at the funeral for the son of
Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich. The 17-year-old had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent speech in Virginia to the parents of gays and
lesbians, Gore talked in a soft hesitant voice about the need for
``unconditional love.'' But she also advocates on behalf of her
husband's causes. At an organized labor event last week in
Cincinnati, she called for equal pay for women.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign advisers say Gore has ``a seat at the table'' but this
is more figurative than literal. She is not involved in the
campaign's day-to-day tactical discussions or strategy conference
calls, they say. But she is perceived as a valuable asset who can
cover the so-called secondary media markets, and when she travels
she is given poll numbers and strategy analyses for guidance. Her
real value, say those who know her well, is helping him relax and
keep the family priorities in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does not much like questions that ask her to describe how
she would see her role as first lady or how she would compare
herself to Hilary Clinton, but from all indications, she would be
in the more traditional mold.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year with The Associated Press, Gore said:
``With four children and aging parents, I find that I only spend so
much time on issues that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on
keeping the family together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's counterpart on the Republican side of the presidential
race, Laura Bush, has also seemed somewhat uncomfortable in the
spotlight. She was a reluctant participant in his first political
race, in 1978, and was not eager for him to run for governor of
Texas or for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearances on the campaign trail have subsided since her
husband effectively wrapped up the nomination in March. In
February, she campaigned on 20 of 28 days of the month in 22
states. By April, that had been scaled back to 10 days. ``We expect
to be back in action fairly soon,'' said Camille Johnston, Gore's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by her very nature, she would like to remain a private
person,'' Johnston added. ``But she expects to be on the trail, she
expects people have questions about her family,'' she said. ``It's
not a matter of trying to be a public person without opening up and
shedding some light on yourself; it's about maintaining a line of
privacy _ certain things she'd like to be able to keep private.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, the traditional campaign role of chief family
helpmate sometimes seems to be occupied by her oldest daughter,
Karenna Gore Schiff, 26, who graduated from Columbia Law School on
Tuesday. Schiff has emerged as an influential adviser to her
father, particularly regarding her generation of young
professionals. And the vice president appears keen on grooming her
for a life in politics.

   Over the years, and especially during this campaign, the vice
president has sent mixed signals about what he views as private,
often reaching in to the family's private archives to help define
and soften his image.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 convention, he talked extensively about his son's
near-death experience; at the 1996 convention he discussed his
sister's death from lung cancer. When he and his son hiked up Mount
Ranier last summer, reporters were not informed of the outing until
the two had safely reached bottom. But before the Washington state
primary this year, his campaign used the trek in a political
commercial.

<P>
   Gil Troy, a professor of American history at McGill University
and author of a book about presidential couples (``Mr. and Mrs.
President, from the Trumans to the Clintons,'' University Press of
Kansas, 2000), said that much of Tipper Gore's life was ``poignant
and frustrating'' but also a bit disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a searing experience in the '80s with the crusade
against the cultural pollutants in Hollywood, and she was badly
abused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``If Tipper Gore really wants her privacy, she
should have told Al to run for president of the Kiwanis Club.''

GENE RESEARCHER SAYS LAPSES LED TO PATIENT'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gene therapy researcher Dr. Jeffrey Isner, slapped last
month with federal allegations of failing to protect human research
subjects, conceded Thursday to lapses in reporting a patient's
death. But, he said, most of the US Food and Drug Administration's
findings against him are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Isner's comments, his first since the FDA leveled its charges,
are contained in a 19-page response to the agency's warning letter
of April 28 that said he violated regulations governing clinical
trial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Isner agreed that the stress of chest surgery
to perform the gene implants might have played a role in the deaths
of two people in the program. But he maintained that the FDA found
no evidence that the therapy itself actually caused the fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Isner, 52, a superstar cardiologist at St. Elizabeth's hospital
and professor of medicine at Tufts University, said he and the
hospital were eager to cooperate with regulators and resume his
experimental trials. If successful, he said, the gene therapy ``is
likely to change the way medicine is practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinical gene therapy trials are to test a method aimed at
growing new blood vessels to bypass arterial blockages in the heart
or the leg. The trials are sponsored by Vascular Genetics Inc. of
Durham, N.C., a company Isner co-founded in 1997. The American
Society of Gene Therapy has said Isner's financial stake in the
company is a potential conflict of interest, but Isner and hospital
officials say the link doesn't influence the research.
</P>
<P>
   Isner contended that two deaths out of the 85 treated in several
gene therapy trials was actually a good record, given how
chronically ill the patients were. It was a mistake, he agreed, not
to report one of those deaths to a hospital watchdog committee, but
said it had been properly reported to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   In the written response to the FDA, the hospital and Isner say
that 16 of the FDA's 21 findings were in error: some were minor
issues of documentation while others involved whether patients not
medically eligible for the research were wrongly admitted to the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   On another major complaint, Isner said a chain of slipups led to
a patient undergoing the gene therapy despite having a lung tumor
which enlarged subsequent to the therapy. Patients with cancer are
supposed to be excluded from the therapy trials, because the genes
used produce a protein that potentially could speed the growth of a
tumor. Among the mistakes, says the response, was a
``communications error'' in which a report of a chest X-ray was
never filed in the patient's chart.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says, however, that in the course of screening
patients for the trial, doctors diagnosed many other cancer cases
and the one cancer victim admitted to the trial has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Isner, who spoke to the Globe along with hospital president
Michael F. Collins, said the St Elizabeth's gene therapy trials
differ significantly from highly publicized trials going on at the
University of Pennsylvania, in which a healthy 18 year-old patient
died last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dealing with healthy young patients,'' Isner said.
The volunteers for the trial were either about to lose their legs
because of blocked arteries or suffered from terminal heart
disease.``This is as sick as you get,'' he said, adding that in
every case he told the patients that the experiment was ``a roll of
the dice'' and wasn't a therapy they could count on.
</P>
<P>
   One patient died in October 1998, four months after she suffered
an abnormal heart rhythm and two days after receiving the gene
implants. It was this death that the FDA said the researchers
failed to report to the hospital's Institutional Review Board
</P>
<P>
   In February the FDA directed St. Elizabeth's to halt all gene
therapy trials: six have already been completed and two active ones
remain on hold, said a hospital spokeswoman. FDA investigators
spent five days in March at St. Elizabeth's scrutinizing research
records.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusions were contained in the warning letter, accusing
Isner of ``a serious lack of knowledge of your responsibilities as
a principal investigator.''
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the FDA, Isner and hospital officials said they
had already or would in the future take a number of corrective
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were to follow all research protocols and enforce the
criteria for admission to a trial; report all serious adverse
events including deaths as soon as they're discovered; communicate
more closely with a patient's other doctors to check on his or her
health and train staff in following protocol rules. In regards to
the missed cancer diagnosis, hospital officials said a committee
will set up to focus on the health histories of all patients in
whom ``suspicious lesions'' are revealed during screening.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Collins and Isner said that henceforth research
volunteers will be informed about previous adverse events or deaths
of patients receiving the treatment. They will also be advised that
Isner and St. Elizabeth's have a financial interest in the research
because they hold equity in Vascular Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the hospital president, said that he takes ``full
responsibility'' for the flaws highlighted by the FDA. ``I'm not
happy that things were found that could be improved upon, but we
have taken a good faith effort to review all of our policies and
practices. I'm very anxious to cooperate with the FDA and get off
hold and go on with the research.
</P>
<P>
   The next move in the case is up to the FDA, which can impose a
range of penalties or simply re-open the trials if it is satisfied
with the response and plan for corrections.

<P>
   RECIFE, Brazil _ The Street of the Benevolent Jesus traverses an
area of restaurants and nightclubs just off the docks of this port
city of 1.5 million people. And right in the middle of the busiest
block, one of the most unusual archaeological projects ever
undertaken in Brazil is under way: the excavation and
reconstruction of the first synagogue built in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue, Kahal Zur Israel, or Rock of Israel, flourished
in the mid-1600s when the Dutch briefly controlled this part of
northeastern Brazil and the sugar and tobacco plantations that made
it rich. With the return of the Portuguese, though, Recife's Jews
made their way to Manhattan, where they founded New York City's
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Excavation began last September under the direction of Marcos
Albuquerque, an archaeologist from the Federal University of
Pernambuco who previously uncovered forts, churches, battlefields
and sugar mills from the Dutch period. Maps and property records
offered a general idea of the location of the temple, but because
the Inquisition had done everything possible to obliterate all
signs of the Jewish presence, the dig began with some doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty certain we were in the right place, but it
wasn't until we found a well that we were sure,'' Albuquerque said.
``In Brazil the well is always placed outside the house, never
inside, and so we suspected that what we had come across was a
mikvah,'' the ritual bath used by observant Jews, ``and we were
very pleased when a rabbinical tribunal confirmed that
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   With the support of the Brazilian government and several
foundations, the small Jewish community here plans to turn the site
into a museum and Cultural Center of the Jewish Presence in Brazil.
Reconstruction of the building's interior is to begin at the end of
May, with the goal of finishing by Rosh Hashana, the start of the
Jewish new year, in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot talk of restoring the synagogue because we have no
evidence what it really looked like,'' said Boris Berenstein, a
doctor who is president of the Israelite Federation of Pernambuco,
the main Jewish group here. ``But we can rescue the historical
memory of this first community, and that is what we intend to do
through documents, archives and exhibits.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Katia Mesel, a documentary filmmaker here, is
working on a movie titled ``The Rock and the Star,'' which will
examine the early Jewish presence here. Like most of Recife's
modern-day Jews, she is descended from immigrants who came from
Eastern Europe over the last century with no awareness that others
had preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always were told that a synagogue had once existed here,''
Mesel said, ``but the documentation was vague, and even when I went
to New York to research the subject in 1997, very few people there
had any idea what I was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Jewish population today, around 170,000, is barely
one-tenth of 1 percent of the country's 170 million people. But as
Henry Sobel, senior rabbi of the Congregacao Israelita Paulista,
the country's largest Jewish congregation, noted, ``There is no
doubt that Jews contributed greatly to the construction of
Brazil,'' especially in the crucial early years of Portuguese
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   The first Portuguese expedition to land in Brazil, 500 years ago
last month, included a Polish-born Jew as its chief interpreter, as
well as astronomers and map makers who are believed to have been of
Jewish origin. Early settlers included many so-called marranos,
Jews from the Iberian Peninsula who had converted to Christianity
under duress but were eager to escape the clutches of the
Inquisition to resume openly practicing their faith.
</P>
<P>
   By 1590, however, the Inquisition had installed itself in Brazil
and begun persecuting these ``new Christians.'' So when the Dutch
seized the colony of Pernambuco in 1630 and announced a policy of
religious tolerance, those who moved to Recife included not only a
rabbi and cantor from Amsterdam but many Jewish families from
territory under Portuguese control.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of the Dutch period, Recife may have had a
larger Jewish presence than Amsterdam itself,'' said Tania Kaufman,
a history professor at the Federal University of Pernambuco here.
``The most reliable calculations indicate about 1,400 Jews, or more
than one-tenth the total population of Recife and nearly half its
population of free white civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1654 the Portuguese drove out the Dutch, and fear of
reprisals led to the dispersion of the Jews here. A group of 23
returning to Amsterdam were captured by Spanish pirates, but were
rescued by a French vessel, which dropped them off at a fledgling
Dutch colony called Nieuw Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Their difficulties did not end when they reached what is today
New York City. Peter Stuyvesant, governor of the settlement, sent a
letter to the Dutch West Indies Co. recommending ``most seriously
that this deceitful race, such hateful enemies and blasphemers of
the name of Christ, be not allowed further to infest and trouble
this new colony.''
</P>
<P>
   The response he received ordered that the newcomers be permitted
``to live, trade and travel'' freely and given a burial ground of
their own, which was established near what is today Chatham Square
and came to be known as the Brazilian Cemetery. But it was only
after the English displaced the Dutch that the Jews from Recife
were permitted to build a synagogue, named Shearith Israel, which
stands today at 70th Street and Central Park West.
</P>
<P>
   Some other families, though, were unable to book passage on
ships leaving here. They fled to the remote hinterland where they
were forced to resume the clandestine practice of their religion
and eventually blended in with the local population.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, when Kaufman lectures in the interior, ``I am often
approached by people who tell me, `I think I might be Jewish,'''
she said. ``When I ask them why, they produce a menorah or a
tattered prayer book and tell me it was handed down to their
grandparents by their grandparents before them, or they tell me of
family customs that fit squarely within the Sephardic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of elements of faith to persist for so long in
such isolation is truly an amazing thing,'' she said.

   SHELALO, Eritrea _ Hundreds of thousands of people fled their
homes Thursday in western Eritrea as Ethiopian troops captured a
strategic town and continued their rapid advance beyond the
trenches and into Eritrea's towns and farmlands.
</P>
<P>
   For two years the war has been fought in short, fierce bursts
along a thinly populated border. But aid agencies reported Thursday
that 250,000 civilians had been displaced by fighting around the
town of Barentu, the regional capital that Ethiopia captured
Thursday after a three-day bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the Eritrean government made a much higher
estimate of refugees: 550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Either number is huge for Eritrea, a poor nation of 3.5 million
people. With about 800,000 people already short of food, Eritrea
may face a new scale of problems, after already having lost 10,000
or more of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Ethiopian state television reported that
Ethiopia had bombed military targets near Massawa, Eritrea's main
port, at the Red Sea, at least 80 miles from the dusty, narrow
strip of border in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian president, Meles Zenawi, said Thursday that his
troops would continue to chase Eritrean soldiers anywhere in
Eritrea until they retreat from land along the border that Ethiopia
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve this, we do not share the point of view of some
military experts who suggest that the shortest distance between two
points is a straight line,'' Zenawi told the BBC in an interview in
the capital, Addis Ababa. ``On the contrary, it may be that the
indirect route is the shortest route.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said that Ethiopia had no designs on Eritrean land,
Eritrean officials cast the fighting as an outright invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reverse it,'' said Yemane Gebremeskel, an aide to
Eritrea's president. ``It may take some time, but I am sure we will
prevail because no Eritrean will accept an Ethiopian invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Ethiopia launched an offensive against Eritrea,
once a close ally and, until it became independent in 1993, the
northernmost province of Ethiopia. In the days before, Zenawi
warned diplomats that he wanted a quick end to the war, which has
cost at least 20,000 lives on each side and vast amounts of money.
The Ethiopian president conceded that the war was hampering efforts
to feed 8 million Ethiopians who face severe shortages of food from
a drought.
</P>
<P>
   The war began in May 1998 with disputes over a triangle of land
known as Badme. Eritrea, claiming the land under colonial treaties,
moved in troops. Ethiopia called that an invasion. Since then,
Ethiopia has regained much of the land, but Eritrea has accused
Ethiopia of dragging its feet on a peace accord brokered by the
Organization for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, after two days of heavy artillery exchanges,
Ethiopia captured Barentu, 43 miles north of the Ethiopian border.
The town is important because it was the last of two main supply
routes for the Eritrean army to the western front. With its
capture, Ethiopians say, the fighting is effectively over in
western Eritrea, and now the Ethiopian army is likely to move
toward a central front, which is heavily fortified.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies are well equipped and trained, so the fighting has
been intense, with aerial bombings and artillery and tank battles
as well as hand-to-hand fighting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Shelalo, which was one of the first towns the Ethiopians
attacked last Friday, an Eritrean prisoner, Amine Abe, 22, said he
had been caught in heavy fighting near Barentu, where he had been
sent with huge reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot three times: in the left leg, left side and
shoulder. He said he did not expect such force from the Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bit shocked,'' he said, lying bandaged on a plastic
tarp in a hut with four other wounded Eritreans. ``They were
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebremeskel, the Eritrean spokesman, said the Ethiopians had
advanced by fighting in huge numbers along areas with far fewer
Eritreans. ``At the end of the day,'' he said, ``it's a mere issue
of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fighting entered this region, civilians have started
fleeing along with the retreating Eritrean army. But Thursday after
the Eritreans left Barentu the numbers exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Food
Program, estimated the number of people fleeing at 250,000. She
said they were scattered around the countryside. She said her
agency was without supplies to give the refugees more portable food
than is given to people in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we are going to have to look elsewhere in order to get that
food into Asmara,'' she said. ``But then we will have another set
of challenges because we'll have to see how we can move that food
into the interior.''
</P>
<P>
   The war has worsened food shortages, particularly in Ethiopia,
which faces a far more serious drought problem. More than 200,000
people have already been pushed from their homes around the border
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yirgalem Abraha, a 20-year-old woman who has lived for
two years in one of the camps for the displaced, said she did not
receive food this month and so has begun to sell coffee and tea in
front of her hut. Because of the new fighting, the United Nations
has suspended food deliveries in the area. She is not sure how she
will feed herself if the fighting goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make much,'' she said, at her camp, near the town of
Wala Nehbee, on the border with Eritrea. ``It's just me
surviving.''

CARTER TURNS STATE STREET LEADERSHIP OVER TO SPINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Marshall N. Carter stepped down Thursday as chief
executive of State Street Corp., handing the reins to his deputy as
the financial giant's earnings and stock price are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Carter will remain chairman until year's end.
</P>
<P>
   President David A. Spina, a 31-year veteran of the company, was
named chief executive. At 57, he knows the ropes at the investment
firm like no outsider could, investors said. But he has big shoes
to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who turned 60 last month, is deeply respected on Wall
Street. He has overseen vast growth in his nine years as chief,
including embracing State Street's investment management business
and pushing its use of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to see Marsh leave. He's been extraordinary,'' said
Tom Theurkauf, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods in New York.
He said Carter's announcement came as something of a surprise,
sending the stock down briefly but then up 50 cents for the day, to
$112.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The board's choice of Spina to replace Carter was seen as a sign
that the company's current, successful strategy would continue. Of
Spina, Theurkauf said, ``He's had a long, distinguished track
record at the bank. I think he'll be well-received.''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a war, Carter might be declaring victory and
planning his trip home. He said passing the torch at this juncture
fulfilled his commitment to stay at State Street for eight to 10
years and paved the way for fresh talent and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company has to continually remake itself to stay at the
top,'' Carter said, noting that he's leaving the company in good
shape. ``We're seeing significant challenges ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's decision to retire disappointed many business people in
Boston. A former Marine and decorated Vietnam war hero, he is a
leading figure in Boston financial circles, with local charities
and arts groups, and holds sway in Washington, D.C. as well. He is
a close friend and supporter of US Senator John McCain, who
recently pulled out of the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he had no immediate plans to take another job. There
is speculation he could be appointed to a political job in the next
presidential administration. He has worked in politics before, as a
fellow in the Ford White House. He has deep ties to political
leaders through his military service, during which he won a Purple
Heart, Bronze Star, and the Navy Cross, and rose to the rank of
major. His father was the second-in-command of the Central
Intelligence Agency during the Cuban missile crisis under John F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Carter co-wrote a book on Social Security reform, which
was used in Congressional discussions of the controversial issues.
Carter takes a nonpartisan view on the subject but believes
strongly that the system needs to be overhauled, both to protect
the country's financial standing and to make workers more
comfortable in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's announcement appeared to be largely personal. Since age
16 when his father urged him to attend West Point, Carter has been
either in the military or at work. An engineer by education, he
became a banker at Chase Manhattan within days of his discharge
from the Marines. He said he left Chase one morning in 1991, and by
afternoon was in his office as president of State Street. He became
chief executive the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Said Carter, ``I've been operating on somebody else's schedule
for 44 years.'' He said he plans to continue teaching courses, as
he now does at MIT, Babson, and Harvard. And he wants to become
more deeply involved in nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   He can claim credit for overseeing the company's growth from
$912 billion under custody to $6.2 trillion, and its managed assets
from $66 billion to $720 billion. State Street has also grown
vastly overseas under his watch.
</P>
<P>
   What Carter has not relished, he said, is keeping up with Wall
Street's quarterly demands. He complained about the pressure to
report short-term gains rather than to be strategic. But he even
battled that giant, laying out a plan in the early 1990s to spend
millions on technology. Wall Street punished him short term,
battering the stock. But the move positioned the company to handle
complex global transactions at a rapid-fire pace.
</P>
<P>
   Spina emphasized that he would be making no changes to the
company's core strategy but continuing its current path. Major
objectives on the horizon, he said, include growing the company's
business in Europe, building strategic alliances across its
business lines, and exploiting the Internet in terms of services to
customers and investment houses.
</P>
<P>
   Said Spina, ``I see no reason why we can't go head-to-head with
the dot-coms and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Spina, who joined the company as a credit analyst, making
business loans, is only the third chief executive to lead the
company in 25 years.

DOMINICAN WINS PRESIDENCY AS OPPONENT SHUNS RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Hipolito Mejia's path to the
Dominican presidency was cleared of its last obstacle Thursday when
his opponent from the governing party declined to seek a runoff,
averting what he said could be a prolonged and costly electoral
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually all the votes tallied, Mejia, the candidate of
the Dominican Revolutionary Party, was first with 49.87 percent.
Danilo Medina of the ruling Dominican Liberation Party was second
with 24.94 percent, and Joaquin Balaguer, the blind nonagenarian
and seven-time former president, had 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At an early morning news conference, Medina said that while it
was clear to him that Mejia had not won an outright majority, a
June 30 runoff would have cost too much in time, money and tension,
adding that a continued campaign would have hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although his announcement was praised by some as an elegant
exit, it drew jeers from party militants, who heckled him with
shouts of ``traitor'' and repeated cries for a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Dominican Liberation Party, or PLD, said their
decision came after Balaguer had warned them on Wednesday night
that he could not guarantee that all members of his Social
Christian Reformist Party would support Medina in the runoff. The
absence of a solid alliance would have guaranteed a victory for the
Dominican Revolutionary Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program of the PLD is for the general good of the country
and not for our organization's or any individual's interest,''
Medina said. ``The leaders of our party decided not to create
problems in the Dominican Republic and acknowledge the victory of
the PRD.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the electoral council still needs several more days to
certify the election formally, Medina's departure from the race
sets the stage for Mejia's inauguration on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his vice president, Milagros Ortiz Bosch, take
office, they will preside over an economy whose phenomenal growth
presents them with the challenge of providing improved social
services to the thousands of Dominicans who supported them.
Befitting his background in agriculture and past service as
minister of agriculture, Mejia said he would find ways to help
farmers who have been hurt by the privatization of state-run
enterprises in sugar production and the nearly fourfold increase in
food imports since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz Bosch said their administration would have to spur housing
construction as well as improve delivery of electricity and water,
all part of their vow to provide better opportunities to the vast
majority of residents who have not benefited from the robust
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country needs 750,000 units of new housing, we have a
deteriorated health system and social security covers only 6
percent of the population,'' she said. ``Apart from economic
growth, we have not had economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the country's history of acrimonious
relations with Haiti, its impoverished neighbor, Ortiz Bosch said
their administration would seek to help it, enlisting the support
of the international community. She raised the possibility of
relocating assembly plants to the border and easing travel rules to
allow Haitians to come in and work for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The new government's ability to fulfill those promises will be
closely watched, although improving the circumstances of older
residents who have been on the economic margins for decades could
prove difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fairly affluent country, yet you still have a
terribly high level of social debt that has to be paid on education
and other programs,'' a diplomat said. ``How do you deal with those
workers who are between 25 and 45 years old, a large number of
semiliterate people who do not have many skills? In any country
it's hard to include people who were left out in the past during a
rapidly changing economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of several delegations of observers said that despite
the cumbersome electoral process, which included long waits and
numerous double checks of voter cards and lists to prevent
corruption, the vote was carried out smoothly and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the absence of major problems reflected the
country's economic good times, said Bernardo Vega, a former
Dominican ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a service economy dependent on tourism, business and an
assembly sector that can leave the country and relocate elsewhere
produces and economic model that implicitly needs political
stability,'' he said. ``These elections reflected that.''

JUSTICE DEPT. OPPOSITION SEEN AS ROADBLOCK TO WORLDCOM AND SPRINT
MERGER  
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The staff of the Justice Department's antitrust
division recently recommended that the government block the
proposed $115 billion merger of WorldCom Inc. and Sprint, people
involved in the matter said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was made in a ``fact memorandum'' sent to
Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, who has scheduled a series of meetings with
government lawyers and company executives to decide whether to
accept the memorandum's findings. The talks are expected to last
through most of the summer and may lead to negotiations over what
assets the companies need to divest themselves of to satisfy
regulators' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The findings threaten to unhinge a deal that was questioned by
federal officials even before it was officially announced. But
company executives say they hope to convince Klein and officials at
the Federal Communications Commission that the deal should
nonetheless be approved. They contend that the long-distance
telephone market is changing so rapidly that it defies a
conventional antitrust analysis that relies heavily on reviewing
market share. The companies say they hope to convince Klein that
the telephone market is changing so profoundly because of the
development of the Internet and its ability to be used as a
telephone service that it would be impossible for one phone company
to truly dominate.
</P>
<P>
   But if the memorandum submitted to Klein is any indication, the
companies face an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and antitrust experts have said that, absent
significant divestitures, they expect both the Justice Department
and the FCC to object to the deal, which proposes to merge the
nation's second-and third-largest long-distance telephone services.
Sprint executives have said that the company will sell its Internet
backbone as part of the deal, although government officials have
indicated that will not be enough of a divestiture to satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also under review by the European Commission, which
last month warned of antitrust problems.
</P>
<P>
   The fact memorandum critical of the merger was prepared by
Stephen M. Axinn, an antitrust litigator from New York who was
retained by Klein to review the deal. People involved in the review
said the memorandum concluded that the proposed merger would
violate federal antitrust laws. If the deal were approved, it would
mean that the merged companies and AT&AMP;T, the largest long-distance
carrier, would control about 80 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But executives from WorldCom and Sprint say the Justice
Department should not rely solely on an analysis of market share
because the industry is changing so rapidly, particularly as the
Internet offers new hope as a vehicle for telephone service. They
also say that one of the clearest signs that the long-distance
market is changing so quickly is the decision by AT&AMP;T to rely less
on its long-distance business and instead transform itself into the
nation's largest cable company.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Axinn was preparing to oppose the deal was
reported on Wednesday by Scott C. Cleland, a telecommunications
analyst at the Legg Mason Precursor Group, who has long predicted
that the Justice Department would block the deal. After similar
views were published Thursday in The Wall Street Journal and The
Washington Post, the shares of both companies slid, with Sprint
dropping $1.75, to $56.25, and WorldCom falling $2.4375 to
$39.5625.
</P>
<P>
   The companies maintain that it is impossible for one company to
dominate the telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we signed the merger deal we knew the government would
take the traditional long-distance market into account in its
consideration of the deal,'' said Peter Lucht, a spokesman for
WorldCom. ``We believe that the dramatic changes affecting the
telecom industry, including technology, the competitive landscape
and consumer demand, will lead the DOJ to decide that this merger
should be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's possible objections to the deal arose even
before the merger was announced by senior executives. Moments
before a news conference by the companies' top executives, William
E. Kennard, the chairman of the FCC, issued a statement asking
``How can this be good for consumers?'' Kennard, who normally
refrains from discussing pending deals and has not blocked a single
large telecommunications merger, also said that the companies would
``bear a heavy burden to show how consumers would be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also signaled that it was skeptical of
the merger when it hired Axinn rather than rely on its in-house
staff, which has approved the vast majority of telecommunications
and other mergers before it. Axinn has spent months amassing a huge
record of evidence that would be the legal backbone to any court
challenge to the deal.

  Estragon: ``He should be here.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Vladimir: ``He didn't say for sure he'd come.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Estragon: ``And if he doesn't come?''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir: ``We'll come back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Samuel Beckett, ``Waiting for Godot''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vladimir is the press corps. Estragon is the
Republican Party. For three weeks now, they've been sitting on the
road to the US Senate, waiting for this Godot named Rudolph
Giuliani to come along and tell them what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, word comes down that the mayor hasn't made up his
mind whether he's running for the U.S. Senate _ come back maybe
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   They come back tomorrow, and it's the same story. Over and over
and over.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the mayor himself came out and said he would have to
think it over ``tomorrow and the next day,'' then he'd decide.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, he appeared once more and said, ``I have not made
a decision. . . I don't believe I'll make a decision today.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, he sat for an interview with NBC television
correspondent Andrea Mitchell, at a long-scheduled town-hall
meeting. Certainly, many predicted, this would be the occasion for
an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani repeated that he still has not made up his mind
about the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicos were heard chanting, before and after the
event, ``I really think it's going to happen tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will.
</P>
<P>
   It has to happen soon. The state Republican Party will hold its
convention May 30. If the candidate is not going to be Giuliani,
someone else has to get out on the campaign trail by then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Vladimir says in Beckett's dark, absurdist play,
``Charming evening we're having.''
</P>
<P>
   Estragon: ``Unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir: ``And it's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Hillary Rodham Clinton comes into this production is not
clear. The polls show absolutely no erosion in the mayor's support,
either since he announced that he had prostate cancer or, more
recently, that he has taken up with another woman and is separating
from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a teary announcement from his wife _ blaming their
failed marriage on a previous affair the mayor had with his former
press secretary _ the race is still a tie.
</P>
<P>
   And, as in Beckett's play, the Godot character is the focus of
all attention, while all the mere mortals running around _ Hillary
Clinton, for example _ count for naught.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been invisible through all this,'' George Arzt, a
leading Democratic political consultant, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican notable said of the state Democrats, ``They need an
enemy, but they don't have one. They need a message, but they don't
know what it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   And as long as Godot-Giuliani keeps everyone wondering what he
will do, the Democrats are as paralyzed as the press and the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Estragon: ``Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir: ``We can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Estragon: ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir: ``We're waiting for Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   Estragon (despairingly): ``Ah!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the buzz was that the mayor certainly would not run,
his treatment for cancer would be too onerous, his personal
pressures are too great, he'll drop out tomorrow, the next day, the
day after that.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the buzz has been that the mayor will run, he's going
to treat his illness with radiation pellets, which means he'll be
back on his feet in days, he'll declare he's running tomorrow, the
next day, the day after that.
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder if the back-and-forth is, at least in part, the
mayor's manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Arzt, who has worked with the mayor as well as several
Democrats, said, ``This is a man who likes nothing better than
torturing reporters and the state Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has invited several state Republicans to attend the
town hall meeting _ clearly a sign that he's running! The state
party chairman, William Powers, has dispatched aides to the
convention site to set up the big ``Rudy'' banners _ another Go
signal, clearly!
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the psychoanalytical clues. One former Giuliani
employee said Thursday, ``If he doesn't run, what's going to be his
legacy? That he was kicked out of politics by a skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and his spokesmen laugh off all these complexities.
``It's a simple matter,'' said one person who calls himself a
Giuliani adviser. ``If he thinks his medical treatment will allow
him to run, then he'll run. If he thinks it won't, then he won't.
All the other stuff is absolutely extraneous.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Thursday ended the way all of Vladimir and Estragon's
days end:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(itals)
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir: ``Well? Shall we go?''
</P>
<P>
   Estragon: ``Yes, let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   (They do not move.)

SIERRA LEONE'S WOBBLING GOVERNMENT TALKS OF PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Sierra Leone's minister of justice sat
in his office Thursday and spoke of the need for reconciliation _
even with the warlord Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Sankoh's surprise capture sparked popular calls for
his prosecution or execution, the justice minister, Solomon Berewa,
who led the government's negotiations for a peace accord that has
all but collapsed, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are angry, they are annoyed, they have been
suffering for long. But the role of the government should be to get
people to realize that vengeance would not bring peace. What we
need more than anything else is reconciliation. That cannot be
watered down at all.''
</P>
<P>
   When Berewa was asked specifically whether reconciliation
applied to Sankoh, whose men have killed 19 unarmed civilians,
taken 500 United Nations peacekeepers hostage and thrust this
country back into civil war, all since the beginning of this month,
he said, ``To everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered government of Sierra Leone has not said what it
plans to do with Sankoh, who remained in government custody
Thursday, or what kind of role, if any, he will have in the
country's future. The peace accord signed in July 1999 had granted
him amnesty for his actions before then, and had promised him a
role in a power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   But Berewa's comments Thursday underlined the weakness of a
government that is at the mercy of outside forces _ despite
statements by the United Nations and Washington that it is up to
the government to make decisions regarding Sankoh and the existing
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the government finds itself in a situation similar
to one it was in last year when it reluctantly signed the peace
accord with Sankoh's group, the Revolutionary United Front. At that
time, the government had no real army of its own. Nigeria, which
was leading a West African peacekeeping force in support of the
government, said it was pulling out its troops. Western nations,
led by the United States, pressed the government to make a deal
with Sankoh, considered by many to be a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the government still lacks a real army, and its
protection depends on two warlords with their own interests, as
well as the United Nations and British troops. How the government
treats Sankoh, how strongly or weakly it can move forward from the
1999 accord, will depend greatly on foreign commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said Sankoh was planning a coup and preparing
to traffic in diamonds, and it holds him responsible for the 19
deaths outside his house, but it has not said whether he will be
charged with those crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``has to consult with a lot of subregional
partners who have been working very hard to bring peace to Sierra
Leone,'' Berewa said. ``The government cannot unilaterally decide
to change any term of the agreement without due consultation,
though the population would like it to do otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Freetown, deceived so many times by Sankoh and
terrorized by a campaign of amputation by the rebel group, seem
opposed to any reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. should be given a different, stronger mandate,'' said
Elizabeth Alpha-Lavalie, an outspoken member of the national
legislature. ``They should be able to enforce peace. We have not
been treated fairly by the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems certain is that outside nations' commitment to Sierra
Leone will have to increase once the dust settles here, even if all
parties agree to restart the peace effort. If the remaining 270
U.N. hostages are released and fighting between pro-government
forces and the rebels stops, the estimated 45,000 combatants will
have to be disarmed again. About half had disarmed before the
recent rebel uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we can have a voluntary disarmament next
time,'' said a United Nations military observer who was involved in
the disarmament process. ``It will have to be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the city's newspapers and talk radio have been
filled with comments expressing anger at any sign of accommodation
toward Sankoh. And in a turn that seemed to allow the public to
vent its frustration, anger was directed at the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
President Clinton's special envoy for Africa, who began a peace
tour of West Africa Thursday with a stop in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Jackson said Sankoh should be coaxed back into
politics and could play a positive role in the hostage crisis. The
comment was not too different from what the government has been
saying. But perhaps Sierra Leone, the world's poorest country, did
not want to hear it from the world's richest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot help believing that the Rev. Jackson is a
collaborator of Foday Sankoh _ that he has a hidden agenda,'' said
Abu Mbawa Kongonba, an American-educated member of the national
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   And so, because of the hostility directed at Jackson, his
mission to bring peace to Sierra Leone will probably not include a
stop in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the emotion focused on Jackson, there lurks a
simmering anger against the United States. It is the country that
endorsed the peace accord, and its secretary of state, Madeleine
Albright, made a point of visiting Freetown _ touring its amputee
camp and meeting Sankoh last October _ in a well-orchestrated show
of support for this forgotten country.
</P>
<P>
   To many Sierra Leoneans, Britain's involvement in the crisis has
made America's absence even more conspicuous. ``The American
diplomatic support has been very strong,'' said Berewa, the justice
minister. ``But that is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Berewa, whose government was chosen in 1996 in an election
considered free and fair, added: ``The Americans are good at
criticizing countries that do not practice democracy, but this
country had set itself on a course toward democracy. So we believe
that we are a good candidate for American assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are saying is we do not expect U.S. marines to fight
and die here. Perhaps that's too much to expect from America. But
they could come and help us with so many things _ technical advice,
equipment, transportation. The obligation is moral.''

EXPECTING FRAUD, CHALLENGER DROPS OUT OF PERU RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The outspoken challenger in Peru's presidential
race said on Thursday that he was pulling out of the runoff
election scheduled for later this month because he believed the
vote would be a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Alejandro Toledo asked President Alberto K. Fujimori to
delay the vote for three weeks so international election monitors
could test computer systems to ensure a clean vote. Even then,
Toledo did not promise to participate unless he received equal time
on the main television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori rejected such an idea before Toledo made the
request. For several days, Toledo had threatened to back out of the
race, and earlier on Thursday, Fujimori told campaign audiences
that he would not change the election day.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's withdrawal leaves Fujimori open to win a third
five-year term when balloting begins May 28. But it could prove to
be a Pyrrhic victory, capping a campaign tainted by international
observers' complaints of dirty tricks and tampering in the first
round of voting, on April 9. In that vote, the president fell just
shy of an absolute majority, forcing a runoff with Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Should Toledo and Fujimori hold firm, the Clinton administration
and the Organization of American States would be put in the
difficult position of having to validate an uncontested re-election
victory or reject it because of irregularities. A decision to
reject the election could lead the U.S. Congress and the OAS to
apply economic and political sanctions to Peru that would be
damaging not only to the country's weak economy but to its alliance
with Washington in the fight against cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope President Fujimori will not push the country over the
cliff,'' Toledo said at a brief news conference on Thursday
evening. ``We are firm. We will not participate in a fraudulent
election process like the one of the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, Fujimori is not one to be pressured in
public. Over the last several days he has publicly pledged in no
uncertain terms that he would not change the election date no
matter what Toledo or the OAS' election observation team said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who say we should postpone the elections,''
Fujimori told a rally in the city of Chiclay on Wednesday night,
``but we just won't do it.'' He ridiculed Toledo, saying he was
trying to destabilize the country by traveling to Washington and
Buenos Aires, Argentina, in recent weeks to complain that the
election process had been so corrupted that it was probably
impossible for him to win.
</P>
<P>
   In the April round of voting, ballots were counted over three
days amid calls by the Clinton administration and the OAS that a
second round was necessary to assure a fair result.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a 54-year-old, American-educated business professor, has
been threatening to drop out of the race ever since he came in
second in that vote, a tactic that has sometimes made him look
indecisive and like a sore loser. But on Thursday he was able to
use a new report by the OAS observation team calling for a delay in
the election as a buffer, as he claimed only to be following the
recommendations of a nonpartisan body invited by the Fujimori
government to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released on Thursday, the organization's team
sharply criticized the election authorities for choosing an
entirely new computer software program for the May vote without
consulting foreign or Peruvian opposition monitors. The report
called on the government to postpone the election, in order to
avert a series of irregularities that plagued the initial round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
   OAS monitors said there had been tampering with ballots, but
most important, it said that the disappearance of ballots and tally
sheets for hours at a time when they were supposedly being counted
made it impossible to verify the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This second round of the presidential election has to choose a
winner with a clear and transparent result,'' the report concluded.
``But confidence continues to be lacking and the calendar conspires
against recuperating that confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the new computer software, the report continued:
``When did they initiate the development of this new application
and why did the National Office of Election Processes not share
this information?'' It added that ``the election calendar makes it
impossible to do a complete test'' of the new software to assure
that it would give the opposition access to the final count as the
votes are being counted.
</P>
<P>
   In another press conference on Thursday, officials at the
National Office of Election Process disputed the OAS report. They
said they needed to change the computer program because unlike the
first round of voting the May 28 ballot would not include
congressional races. It also said that all of the software was
being properly shared with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In endorsing the findings of the report, Toledo said that even
if the vote was postponed, he would only participate if the main
television channels also gave him equal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirty war against my candidacy must end,'' Toledo said,
referring to a campaign by several tabloid newspapers and several
television stations of either not covering his campaign or filling
its coverage with stories about his marriage, allegations that he
has an illegitimate daughter and claims that he has a drinking
problem.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides to Toledo said they concluded that they needed to take
dramatic action to prevent fraud after they completed their own
study that showed that in scores of voting sites in remote
provinces Fujimori had inexplicably high vote counts last month. In
some vote tables, Toledo received no votes.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's aides again demanded on Thursday that the April
poll-watchers, who were chosen by lottery and used in the first
round to guarantee the vote, be replaced by new monitors in the
second round. But Fujimori's allies in Congress have refused to
change a law that requires that the same poll-watchers who worked
in the first round be used in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday night, Fujimori denied that there
would be any fraud or problems in the vote May 28. ``At this moment
there are no more irregularities,'' he said. ``They have been
overcome since the first round and now we are in the runoff.''

A PRIMER ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs 2nd graf to clarify, avoid repeeating `benefit.') 
By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social Security is slowly going broke, says Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, and the best way to avoid painful benefit
cuts or tax increases is to establish private investment accounts
through which workers could seek higher returns on their
contributions to the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is slowly going broke, says Vice President Al
Gore, and the best way to avoid painful benefit cuts or tax
increases is to channel the money from the federal budget surplus
into the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the presidential candidates are clear
enough. But behind their approaches are complicated policy and
political considerations regarding the problem and the possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
</P>
<P>
   Benefits to current retirees are paid out of payroll taxes
levied on nearly all workers and their employers. Because the work
force at the moment is large relative to the number of people who
have retired, those taxes generate more revenue than is needed to
pay benefits, a surplus of about $150 billion this year and $2.3
trillion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The excess revenue goes into a trust fund out of which future
benefits can be paid. But the trust fund is not quite what its name
implies. Rather than accumulating cash, it contains bonds issued by
the federal government to the retirement system, a promise to pay
back to Social Security the surplus funds when they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Social Security surplus goes to other
purposes. For years, the government simply spent it. More recently,
Congress and the Clinton administration have agreed to use the
excess cash only to reduce the $3.5 trillion in national debt held
by the public.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOOMING PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   The current surplus in Social Security could turn to a deficit
because of a demographic shift. Right now there are more than three
workers paying taxes to support each Social Security recipient. By
2030, as the population ages and the baby boom generation retires,
the ratio will shrink to 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Under projections by Social Security's trustees, payroll taxes
would no longer cover benefits starting around 2015, forcing the
system to begin relying in part on the interest payments from the
trillions of dollars worth of bonds in the trust fund. By around
2025, the system would have begun redeeming the bonds out of
general tax revenues to cover benefit payments, and by 2037 the
trust fund would be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, if no changes are made, Social Security would be
able to pay less than three-quarters of promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The projections could change as the economic climate shifts.
Over the past few years, the date of insolvency has been pushed
back to 2037 from 2029 because of economic growth that was stronger
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the economic assumptions underlying the projections
are quite conservative, defenders of the current system say the
odds are strong that Social Security will weather the next three or
four decades without needing any major surgery. But the leaders of
both parties say it is prudent to assume there will be a financial
squeeze, and to deal with it as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING A SOLUTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton put an overhaul of Social Security on the
table in 1998. But the two parties were unable or unwilling to
reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There are only three basic options: Cut benefits. Increase the
revenues coming into the system. Or increase the rate of return on
the money coming into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties have been willing to support
benefit cuts as part of a package of changes. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., has proposed reducing cost-of-living adjustments.
Reps. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., and Charles W. Stenholm, D-Texas, have
proposed legislation that includes an increase in the normal
retirement age, which is already rising to 67 from 65, to account
for further increases in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk of raising or eliminating the ceiling
on earnings subject to payroll taxes (currently $76,200). But most
politicians have steered clear of supporting higher taxes or lower
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE ACCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   In supporting private investment accounts, Bush's approach
centers on increasing the return on the money coming into the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not provided a detailed plan. But most privatization
proposals call for diverting 2 percentage points of the 12.4
percent payroll tax into accounts that would be owned and
controlled by individuals. A worker earning $50,000 a year would
have $1,000 a year going into a private account.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the chance to invest the money themselves, workers
would accept a lower guaranteed benefit from Social Security at
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is that the guaranteed benefit could be reduced
by more than the amount diverted into the personal accounts _ but
that the returns generated for each worker by Wall Street would
more than make up for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign notes that stocks earned an average annual
return, after inflation, of 7.2 percent from 1926 to 1997. By
contrast, workers born after 1963 can expect on average a return
from their Social Security contributions of 1.9 percent, according
to Social Security statistics cited by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Private accounts would provide a start on restoring Social
Security to solvency over 75 years, the standard normally used in
assessing the system's health, Bush has said. He has acknowledged
that other steps, like benefit cuts, would be needed to finish
closing the gap, but has not said what steps he would support.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE AGAINST PRIVATE ACCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   However strong the performance of stocks in the past, there is
no assurance that they will do well in the future. And even if they
do match their historical performance, there will inevitably be ups
and downs along the way.
</P>
<P>
   People who retire and cash out their holdings during a bull
market would do far better than people who have to sell while the
market is depressed. And some people would no doubt make smarter
investment decisions than others. Should large numbers of people
lose money in the market, there would be tremendous political
pressure to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   Some portion of any investment gain might be eaten up by the
administrative costs of maintaining the accounts. And to the degree
that payroll taxes are going into private accounts rather than to
pay benefits to current retirees, the government would have to put
additional money into the system, presumably by using the Social
Security surplus. That in turn would reduce the amount of money
available for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   A diversion of 2 percentage points of payroll tax revenue would
equal just under $1 trillion over the next decade. By not using
that money for debt reduction, the government would add $300
billion to its interest bill in that period. So about $1.3 trillion
of the $2.3 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years
would be needed to finance a private accounts plan.
</P>
<P>
   THE GORE APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   Gore starts with the premise that the current system should be
left more or less intact. His plan is built on the idea that there
should be a way to use the current budget surplus to help Social
Security down the road. While the basic idea may be simple, the way
the government handles its finances makes executing it quite
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Social Security system cannot hold cash reserves of
its own under the government system, the vice president wants to
use all of the Social Security surplus and some of the general
revenue surplus to eliminate, in 13 years, the $3.5 trillion in
national debt held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the debt would leave the government better able to
borrow, if necessary, later on. By putting downward pressure on
interest rates, debt reduction would also stimulate economic
growth, creating jobs and producing more payroll tax revenue to
help keep Social Security healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 2011, Gore would funnel to Social Security an amount
of money equal to the annual interest savings from debt reduction _
$100 billion a year at first, growing to more than $200 billion a
year by 2015. According to Gore, the infusion would extend Social
Security's solvency to 2054 from 2037 without having to cut
benefits or otherwise alter the system.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE AGAINST THE GORE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   While eliminating the debt would have substantial benefits,
transferring the interest savings to Social Security would be
little more than a paper shuffling exercise, and would still leave
taxpayers on the hook to pay for the shortfall in Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Since Social Security cannot hold cash, the transfers would be
in the form of government bonds that would be redeemed at some
point out of general tax revenues. In that sense, Gore's plan would
in essence transform Social Security into a welfare program,
Moynihan said. And Gore's plan would do nothing to address the
underlying imbalance between how much the system takes in and how
much it has promised to pay in benefits.

EUROPEANS LEARN THEY'RE GROWING GENETICALLY-ALTERED PLANTS FOR
CANOLA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Netherlands, France, Britain, Canada)   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ If Europe is virtually allergic to the genetically
modified seeds that are so popular with North American farmers, it
got a reason this week to sneeze with fury.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of farmers in England, France, Germany and Sweden are
finding that they have unwittingly planted canola crops for two
years from bags of Canadian seed that inadvertently contained a
scattering of genetically modified seeds.
</P>
<P>
   European governments have emphasized that there is no health
risk from the oil produced from last year's crop or environmental
risk from the canola that is now growing. Less than 1 percent of
one company's seeds had bioengineered genes, meaning that just some
individual plants in the millions of acres of canola would be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   But European newspapers are referring to fields as tainted and
contaminated, and environmental groups are calling for all the
farmers who bought the company's seed to be tracked down and their
fields burned before the crops mature and produce pollen that could
blow to other plants.
</P>
<P>
   The seed company, the papers say, should pay for the destroyed
crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem extreme to Americans, but there are a lot of
people in Europe who don't want to eat GM food under any
circumstances,'' said Harry Hadaway of the Soil Association of
Great Britain, an organic-farming group.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Advanta of the Netherlands, pointed out that it did
not intend to import any modified seeds and that it had broken no
laws, because none govern the genetic content of seeds. Advanta
says testing for biotech material at concentrations of less than 1
percent is technically difficult and expensive. But it has halted
all its European sales of one variety of canola and asked European
governments to create reasonable standards that it can meet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the company, Kees Noome, the
problem was found last month, when the German government conducted
random checks of seed.
</P>
<P>
   Advanta is not sure what ``impurity'' the seeds have, Noome
said, but the company presumes that it is a resistance to weed
killer, a trait that is legal and sought after by many American and
Canadian farmers. Advanta also presumes that the trait entered some
seeds when pollen blew from other fields. The pollen, Noome said,
would have to have blown ``hundreds of meters,'' because the
company ``wouldn't buy seeds from a farmer whose direct neighbor
grew the crop.''
</P>
<P>
   Even nonbiotech seeds, he added, need to be grown as far as
feasible from accidental pollination, because farmers buy seeds for
particular crossbred traits like disease resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the finding occurred at an awkward moment. Prince
Charles delivered a lecture on the BBC just this week on ``the
sacred trust between mankind and our Creator'' and cautioned
against ``the artificial and uncontained transfer of genes between
species of plants and animals.''
</P>
<P>
   In The Independent newspaper Thursday, a text of his speech was
printed close to a prominent commentary that accused the prince of
denigrating science and suggesting that the strictly organic
methods that he proudly uses on his farms in Cornwall could produce
only enough food to feed a world of four billion people, leaving
the remaining two billion to starve.
</P>
<P>
   In the more conventionally testy political arena, a member of
parliament called for the resignation of the agriculture minister
for failing to protect the food supply against genetically modified
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   In France, where 1,500 acres have the Advanta seeds, the
government said there was nothing that it could legally do.
European regulations say only that food with more than 1 percent
genetically modified content has to be labeled. A spokesman for the
Confederation Paysanne, a farmers' group that opposes biotech
crops, said the government was ``treating citizens like
imbeciles.''

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Maybe it was a couple of 20-something
Filipinos who created the rogue e-mail program that disabled
computer systems on May 4. Maybe it wasn't. But there is no doubt
that a couple of young Filipinos played a big part in rubbing the
bug out.
</P>
<P>
   The two _ Richard Cheng, 24, and Maricel Soriano, 23 _ were on
duty at the Manila office of an antivirus software company, Trend
Micro Inc., when the company was first notified of the problem
shortly after lunch that day. As the scourge spread across time
zones from Australia to Europe, Cheng was already writing an
antidote, and by the end of the day, Soriano was disseminating
instructions to afflicted Trend Micro customers around the world on
how to apply it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents told me I was a hero,'' said Soriano, who joined
Trend Micro after earning her computer engineering degree from a
local college.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Philippines' image has not been helped much by its
failure to charge any suspects for the destruction or, indeed, to
pass a law against what they did. But the ``Love Bug'' episode may
have a positive side. ``This virus, if anything, brings a necessary
spotlight to the tech scene in the Philippines,'' said Pindar Wong,
chairman of the Asia Pacific Internet Association in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng and Soriano are part of a growing pool of high-technology
Philippine talent that is attractive to employers in Europe and the
United States, and is increasingly drawing multinationals like
Trend Micro, America Online and Motorola to move some of their
operations here.
</P>
<P>
   That same computer-literate population is now feeding a
surprisingly lively Internet start-up scene, in a country where
many annual incomes are typically around $1,000 and less than 1
percent of the population uses the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philippines may be a poor country, but part of it is
English-speaking and educated,'' said Fernando Contreras, vice
president-elect of the Philippine Internet Service Organization.
``That's what we're trying to emphasize for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years of U.S. rule, from the end of the
Spanish-American War in 1898 until World War II, gave the
Philippines an American-style educational system in which English
is taught to almost all of the country's 76 million people _ 95
percent of whom are literate. Its government and judiciary are
modeled on those of the United States. And the Philippines retains
a distinctly American feel: People here don't follow soccer, they
follow the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filipinos have two cultures,'' said Max Cheng, Trend Micro's
vice president for global support in Taipei, Taiwan. ``One is
Western, the other is Oriental.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a big part of why Trend Micro decided to open an office
here two years ago. Founded on Taiwan but based in Japan, the
company now has 124 employees in Manila, all of them Filipinos.
Some, like Richard Cheng (no relation to Max Cheng) and Soriano,
are engineers who dissect new computer viruses _ most of which
originate in the United States _ and write solutions. Others field
questions by e-mail from customers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   By October, the company plans to make the Philippines its global
call center. Trend Micro customers in the United States who phone
the company's toll-free help line may find themselves talking not
to a technician in America, but to one here in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines long ago attracted its fair share of
high-technology hardware makers: Intel, Acer, Texas Instruments,
NEC and Toshiba have all established production here. But as new
networking technologies made it possible to create corporate
telephone networks around the world, more and more companies began
moving their software development and behind-the-scenes processes
like accounting, data entry and payrolls to nations like the
Philippines and India, whose own English heritage makes it a major
rival for business and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of these two has been going on since the late 1980s,
but the Internet is turning up the tempo and the Philippines
appears to be keeping pace. Andersen Consulting, which first set up
a data center in the Philippines in 1986, now has 450 employees in
the country developing software and offering 24-hour customer
support. Fujitsu develops software here. Citibank does its
Southeast Asian accounting here.
</P>
<P>
   And on the former U.S. air base north of Manila, America Online
operates a nondescript installation where 830 employees field
questions from the company's American clients. Even Motorola plans
to begin routing some inquiries from the United States to the
Philippines later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cheap labor is a big part of this country's
attractiveness to corporations abroad. But in high-technology
industries, labor is only part of the cost of doing business. The
Philippines' real advantage, Cheng of Trend Micro says, is in the
quality and dedication of its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I thought it would be hard to find good
engineers in the Philippines,'' Cheng said. With training, though,
he says his engineers are as qualified as those in Taiwan. He even
sends them sometimes to train their counterparts in the United
States. Trend Micro plans to double its staff of Philippine
engineers over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a seemingly ample supply _ there are more than 200,000
students enrolled in computer-related courses at Philippine
universities _ Cheng said that finding engineers is getting tougher
as more and more companies move in.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of living in the affluent West is another source of
competition _ and a persistent drain of Philippine talent.
President Clinton's recent moves to raise immigration limits on
skilled foreign workers, for instance, could make talent here even
scarcer. This country already provides some 3,200 such employees to
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   The brain drain notwithstanding, does the Philippines have what
it takes to make the jump from subcontracting for multinationals to
creating innovative Internet ventures? Absolutely, said Rey Buzon,
a Filipino-American who left the San Francisco Bay area this year
to become president of a local venture capital firm, AJOnet
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've discovered that Filipinos are a lot more creative than
what I'm used to in Silicon Valley,'' Buzon said. His firm now
receives as many as 15 inquiries a day from Philippine
Internet-related start-ups looking for financing, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One that impressed Buzon with its youthful initiative was
Mp3Manila, a start-up that allows its Web site visitors to download
songs by more than 70 Philippine performers. Unlike many ventures
that come knocking with nothing more than a business concept,
Mp3Manila's five founders had their site up and running on $1,000
of their own savings _ all while juggling classes at their
university.
</P>
<P>
   Mark K. Escueta, who is 22, got the idea for Mp3Manila two years
ago while surfing in vain for digital recordings of his favorite
Philippine hip-hop groups. Last October, he and four classmates
established a site where local acts with no recording label could
get their music out to Filipinos around the world, with advertisers
paying the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The friends opened the Web site at a popular downtown bar in
January and within a month were getting up to 600 visitors a day.
But by March, the pressures of final exams and of financial
realities were setting in. The ad model was a failure. ``We told
ourselves we had to come up with a new model,'' said Rufino H.
Felipe, Mp3Manila's 22-year-old chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   They resolved to become an online record label, using their site
to sell Philippine artists' compact disks, downloadable music files
and the equipment to play them. To do that, they are now receiving
four million pesos in financing _ about $96,000 _ from AJOnet.
</P>
<P>
   The five founders have agreed that anyone who drops out of
school before graduating next March forfeits his stake in the
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Mp3Manila is counting on the appeal of home-grown music to the
roughly more than two million Philippine citizens living in the
United States, 80 percent of whom AJONet estimates use the
Internet, to overcome the reality that the Philippines remains a
minuscule market for online business. Although there are nearly 200
Internet services, there are less than a million Internet
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Filipinos do not have a phone and cannot afford a personal
computer. High prices for Internet access, moreover, make
downloading large amounts of data, as in music, prohibitively
expensive for many people.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines becomes exciting as an Internet market, industry
executives say, when new wireless technologies put the Internet
into the palms of people's hands. The Philippines already has more
mobile phone users than personal computers. Filipinos are such avid
users of digital mobile phone short-messaging that they have turned
this ``texting'' into a telecommunications subculture, sending more
messages a day than all of Europe combined.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phone executives hope that new services using the
Wireless Application Protocol, which shrinks Web pages onto mobile
phone screens, will find a fast following and help bring e-commerce
to more and more people.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics say that politics, not technology, may be the
biggest factor in determining whether the Philippines can bridge
the digital divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're a very literate country, but there's graft and
corruption,'' said Josefina Trinidad Lichauco, who resigned as
under secretary for transportation and communications in January.
``Our democracy is not working. The most valuable resource of the
Philippines is its people. But they haven't been harnessed in the
right direction.''

ONLINE FASHION RETAILER BOO.COM GOES OUT OF BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was supposed to follow the dot-com fairy tale
script. Two young entrepreneurs devise an idea for the next big
e-commerce Web site, raise enormous sums of cash, spend lavishly on
advertising, lose money on every sale, take the company public and
make every employee a billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Boo.com, a European fashion e-tailer backed by French
luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, the Benetton family, Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. and J.P. Morgan, among others, is insolvent and has
been forced to call the liquidators, six months after its Internet
debut.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for Boo.com seemed plausible enough. Ernst Malmsten
and Kajsa Leander, two 29-year-old Swedes, founded Boo.com in
London in 1998, planning to create an online fashion retailer that
would provide global service in seven languages and multiple
currencies. And, of course, the site would use the most advanced
technology. Boo.com bragged of its ability to let users view
products in three dimensions from 360 degrees, giving them a true
sense of how a garment looked.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were so taken with the idea and its two founders _
Leander had been an Elite model and both had started an online
bookstore called Bokus.com _ that Boo.com was able raise $125
million almost immediately from an elite roster of the extremely
wealthy. Before even launching Boo.com, the founders promoted the
site in trade journals and glossy fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also clear that the founders were excessively
ambitious. The company established its headquarters on swanky
Carnaby Street in London, with satellite offices in New York;
Paris; Stockholm, Sweden; Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Munich,
Germany. The staff expanded from 40 initially to more than 400.
Employees routinely flew first class and stayed in five-star
hotels, according to a former staff member. Many were given laptops
and Palm Pilots for home use, according to this person, and the
company used Federal Express to send regular mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had very little spending restraint, to put it mildly,''
said Noah Yasskin, an analyst at the London office of Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The site itself was also plagued by technical problems and
delays, and took twice as long as anticipated to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Once up and running, it became clear that users without fast
connections to the Internet could not use the site, a point Boo.com
boasted about. That e-snobbery alienated customers with more modest
modem speeds, which happened to be most of Europe and the United
States, Boo.com's two most important markets. ``Ninety-nine percent
of European and 98 percent of U.S. homes lack the bandwidth needed
to easily access such animation,'' wrote Therese Torris, an analyst
at Forrester Research in Amsterdam, in a report. And anyone with a
Macintosh computer could not use the site.
</P>
<P>
   While Boo.com later adjusted itself to allow users with slower
connections and Macs to gain access, the changes came too late.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the first three months of the site's operation were
$680,000, while the company was blowing through more than $1
million a month.
</P>
<P>
   The end came as Boo.com's founders, with only $500,000 left,
struggled in vain to find backers to plow more money into the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply disappointed that it has been necessary to ask
KPMG to become liquidators of the company,'' the co-founders and
investors said in a joint statement. ``The senior management of
Boo.com has made strenuous efforts over the last few weeks to raise
the additional funds which would have allowed the company to go
forward with a clear plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several weeks, Malmsten and Leander, who together
own about 40 percent of the company, had been pleading with
investors to ante up more.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for Arnault, ``he didn't want to take
the risk. He would have been willing to stay involved if he could
have had more control.'' In fact, in an interview in Paris several
weeks ago about his Internet holdings, Arnault refused to discuss
Boo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Boo.com's failure presages further problems for clothing
e-tailers is unclear. But some Internet analysts said Boo.com's
rise and fall reflects a problem that goes beyond just selling
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has woken up to the fact that the amount of
business e-tailers like Boo.com generate is a lot lower than we
anticipated,'' said Tony Shiret, an analyst at Credit Suisse First
Boston in London. ``A key turning point was what happened in the
U.S. over Christmas,'' he added, referring to many online retailers
that reported missed sales projections. ``It's been
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report
predicting that 25 percent of all Internet firms in Britain could
exhaust their cash within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the problems at Boo.com problems were somewhat
self-inflicted, Yasskin said. ``They tried to do too much,'' he
said. ``Opening up in multiple countries simultaneously is
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the major stumbling blocks for Boo.com may simply have
been the type of merchandise it was trying to sell. ``If you look
at successful sites, they are driven by price,'' Shiret said. ``It
is very hard to sell clothing at a cost base that makes sense
without the scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Boo.com never competed on price like most other
retailers; it hoped to woo customers with its interactive services
and convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Boo.com might be worth something, even if it is
only a fraction of the $400 million value its founders once
ascribed to the company. KPMG, which is managing the liquidation
process, said Thursday that it had received more than 30 inquiries.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph earlier this month,
Malmsten admitted he might have made missteps. ``We have made some
mistakes and we were late with our launch, yes,'' he said. ``But
people are welcome to come round here into our offices and see what
is going on now.''

SOUTH CAROLINA VOTES TO REMOVE CONFEDERATE FLAG FROM DOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Miss.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 38 years of conducting their state's business
under the Confederate battle flag, the two houses of the South
Carolina General Assembly voted Thursday to remove it from the
Capitol dome and their chambers. At noon on July 1, South Carolina
will become the last state to remove the old symbol of secession
from its seat of government.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote was 37-8; the House vote was closer, 66-43.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Jesus, thank you,'' state Sen. J. Verne Smith, a
white Democrat , said on the floor of the Senate, reflecting that
body's relief after so many years of fatigue and bitterness over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill, which Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, said he would
sign as early as next week, will not put an end to the racial
division that the flag has caused. To capture the support of the
flag's backers, the bill calls for a smaller version of it to be
flown atop a 30-foot pole in front of the Capitol, next to a
slightly taller monument to slain Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   That setting as well is too prominent for most of the 26 black
members of the House, only four of whom voted for the measure. The
NAACP has said it will not lift its tourism boycott of the state,
and may even expand it to discourage filmmaking and organized-labor
events in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Black officials are by no means unanimous in opposition,
however. Six of the seven black senators voted for the bill, and
several joined their white colleagues in calling the vote a
historic moment for race relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all of South Carolina can be a part of a great day, of a
great coming together of our citizens,'' said state Sen. Robert
Ford, a black Democrat. ``All of us should be proud, and I think
the coming together of the members of the General Assembly should
be the coming together of every citizen in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag has flown on the dome, beneath the American and South
Carolina flags, since 1962, when it was raised by the Legislature,
then all-white, for a Civil War centennial and to send a clear
message of defiance to the growing civil rights movement. Over the
years, leading blacks, many elected officials and one former
governor, David Beasley, have repeatedly called for its removal as
an offensive reminder of the slavery era, while white lawmakers
have kept it flying as an emblem of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The issue reached a fever pitch in the last year, after the
NAACP announced its boycott and the presidential candidates weighed
in, with the Democratic contenders calling for the flag's removal
and Republicans declining to take a position.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle, which has recently overshadowed almost every other
policy issue in South Carolina, became so intense because it
perfectly embodied a large political gulf between the races there
that has persisted since Reconstruction. Blacks have long felt that
they are barely tolerated as political equals, and have seen every
reference to ``Southern heritage'' as scarcely veiled nostalgia for
the days of white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag represents the Confederacy that enslaved, exploited,
murdered, raped and killed our people for over 300 years,'' said
Rep. Joseph H. Neal, a black Baptist minister, in explaining
Thursday why he and others would not vote to move the flag to the
Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   White legislators, on the other hand, maintained that the flag
was a legitimate expression of reverence for ancestors who died
fighting for the South, and said they resented being lumped
together with Klansmen and other racists who have embraced the flag
for their own purposes. But many made clear as well that they had
chafed over the years at the growth of affirmative action and other
policies sought by black residents, and considered the flag a last
remnant of a vanishing nobility.
</P>
<P>
   Many formerly hard-line flag supporters voted for the bill,
partly because they believed the flag's presence was hurting the
state economically, and because they considered the Confederate
monument to be an acceptable alternative setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was equally hard for both sides to take this step,'' said
state Sen. Glenn F. McConnell, a Charleston lawyer who owns a
gallery that sells Confederate memorabilia. ``Both sides had to
bleed on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a few flag supporters in the House who opposed the
plan tried to make the flag's new position even more prominent by
raising the height of the flagpole to 30 feet, 10 feet higher than
called for in the original compromise, forged in the Senate. This
last act of defiance, which the Senate was forced to swallow
Thursday for the sake of passage, helped persuade the NAACP to
continue its boycott. Kweisi Mfume, the organization's president,
said on Tuesday that the move was a ``slap in the face'' to those
who wanted to end racial division in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Hodges, who had long pushed for any compromise that would
move the flag off the dome, predicted Thursday that the boycott
would soon fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be differences about the final resolution,'' he said
in an interview, ``but what people will remember at the end of the
day is that the flag came down. Like other states, we're moving the
flag to a historical monument, and we will no longer be the only
state with the flag on our dome. And I think people will see that
as a major step forward for South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of national attention on the Confederate issue is now
likely to turn to Georgia and Mississippi, both of which
incorporate the Southern-cross design of the battle flag in their
own state flags. Efforts have begun in both states to change those
flags in legislative sessions next year.

PROTESTS FLARE AS BELGRADE TAKES CONTROL OF TV STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ About 20,000 people gathered again
Thursday night to protest the Serbian government's seizure of the
main opposition television station here, Studio B, but as they were
dispersing, policemen in riot gear charged them.
</P>
<P>
   There were clashes with the demonstrators, some of whom then
threw stones and homemade firebombs at the police, who responded in
turn with truncheons and a lavish use of tear gas. At least 19
people were hurt, beaten by the police, and ambulances picked them
up at City Hall, where once again opposition political leaders
conferred with one another but did not address the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   There were smaller rallies Thursday night in other Serbian towns
controlled by the opposition, including Kragujevac, Nis, Cacak,
Smederevo, Uzice and Novi Sad. In Nis, protesters reportedly beat
some local legislators of the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia's
president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the continuing absence of the leader of the Serbian
Renewal Movement, Vuk Draskovic, became a topic of increased
discussion. Belgrade is controlled by Draskovic's party, and the
seizure of Studio B, which the Serbian government said had called
for insurrection, is interpreted as a direct attack on Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   A Draskovic adviser, Predrag Simic, said Thursday night that
Draskovic was engaged in high-level discussions with foreigners.
Spasoje Krunic, head of the Belgrade City Council, said Draskovic
was in ``a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   But politicians from other parts of the opposition said
privately that Draskovic was still in Montenegro, Serbia's restive
sister republic, fearing arrest or an attempt on his life. During
the NATO bombing last year, Draskovic criticized the Democratic
Party's leader, Zoran Djindjic, for having gone to Montenegro when
he felt his life was threatened by the government. But Thursday
night, Djindjic refused to comment on Draskovic's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that one reason opposition leaders chose not to
speak to the crowds on Wednesday night or Thursday night was
because they had nothing new to say, and had not agreed on a
strategy, said Dragan Kopcalic, the former leader of the Democratic
Party's Belgrade branch. ``Few people really believe in these
leaders,'' he said. ``This is a serious moment, but there is no
serious political concept of how to motivate people.''
</P>
<P>
   But some opposition leaders and analysts believe that the
protests could grow, given the heavy-handed actions of the
Milosevic government and the high level of frustration among an
impoverished populace.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic is pressing the opposition leaders for a more
aggressive response to the crackdown on Studio B and the
independent radio stations B2-92 and Radio Indeks, he said in an
interview Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have rallies for a few more days,'' Djindjic said.
``But we must find a new concept to increase the pressure on the
regime, and the tool are the city halls we control throughout
Serbia. We've lost Studio B, but we have the other city halls, and
we must invest them in order to create the pressure to regain
Studio B and radicalize the situation with widespread protests and
civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   But Djindjic's efforts to do just that have failed in the past,
and Draskovic's party is not convinced, its officials say, fearing
that the central government could respond by taking over control of
Belgrade's government. In fact, Krunic said, a meeting of the
Belgrade city assembly was postponed Thursday when the leader of
the nationalist Radical Party, Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav
Seselj of Serbia, showed up with scores of heavily armed
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   For Belgrade's people, Thursday brought a total absence of
independent broadcast news. Studio B ran government material, B2-92
frequency played music, and Radio Pancevo, the reputable station of
a nearby town, was cut off, its transmitter to Belgrade seized by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the war last year, when B2-92, then called B-92 was
taken over by the state, there was Studio B and Radio Pancevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's nothing, only silence,'' said Roksanda Nincic, a
reporter for the independent weekly Vreme. ``I spent the morning
trying to get on to the Internet to find out what happened a
kilometer from my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Veran Matic, the editor in chief of B2-92 and head of an
association of independent media, said that the station was putting
news on the Internet, and that the BBC was retransmitting news by
satellite to some 30 local radio stations and 17 local television
stations in Serbia. But the stations could not be heard in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown has included restrictions on the ability of the
popular tabloid Blic to print its normal press run. Blic's
reporters and editors had been locked out of their offices, which
are in the same building as Studio B, but were allowed to return
this afternoon.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for the Clinton administration, the
Senate on Thursday narrowly rejected a measure to set a deadline
for withdrawing U.S. ground troops from Kosovo. Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas had also criticized the measure, and influenced a number
of votes against it.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 53-47, senators stripped a provision from a
military construction spending bill that would have cut off funds
for the 5,600 U.S. troops forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, forcing
their withdrawal unless Congress authorized the mission's
extension.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, several of President Clinton's cabinet
officers waged an all-out campaign to defeat the measure, phoning
wavering senators and sending military commanders to Congress to
warn of the dangers to U.S. troops and Washington's commitment to
the NATO operation if the measure passed. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said he would recommend that Clinton veto the legislation if
it passed.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was close enough, and important enough for the
administration, that Vice President Al Gore presided over the
roll-call, prepared to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have been forced to withdraw in this manner would have
demoralized our allies and emboldened those in the region who favor
violence as a solution to their disputes,'' Gore said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 55 Republicans voted for a Democratic amendment
to strike the withdrawal language from the $8.6 billion military
construction spending bill. At least two or three Republicans,
including Thad Cochran of Mississippi, said they were swayed by the
opposition of Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Bush said what he said, because it showed this was
not aimed at this president in particular,'' Cochran said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bush criticized the provision, calling it a
``legislative overreach'' that would tie his hands if he became
president. Thursday, a spokesman for Bush, Scott McClellan, said,
``The Senate made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation revealed the restiveness in Congress over
America's open-ended commitment in Kosovo and Bosnia, which so far
has cost $20 billion. It also stoked the smoldering debate over
competing prerogatives: Congress' constitutional power of the purse
and the president's authority to send U.S. forces to far-flung hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   In several hours of heated debate Wednesday and Thursday, both
sides accused the other of jeopardizing the safety of U.S. troops,
America's commitment to its European allies and the long-term
security of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of the amendment is to restore congressional
oversight over the Kosovo mission,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia, the provision's chief Democratic sponsor. ``Of
course, the administration doesn't like it. They want a free hand
to participate in military adventurism whenever and wherever they
please. They don't want to hear a peep out of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics said imposing an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal
would send a dangerous signal of uncertain U.S. resolve to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, and undermine the unity
and morale of NATO's peacekeeping operation, which involves forces
from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other nations, in and out
of Europe. They have been in Kosovo since NATO bombed Yugoslavia
early last year to protect Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would precipitate a year of dangerous uncertainty and
wavering commitment to our allies,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
a leading foe of the provision and sponsor of the amendment to kill
it.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Republicans joined 38 Democrats in supporting Levin's
decisive amendment, while 40 Republicans and seven Democrats
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Levin's measure also eliminated a second contentious provision
to withhold 25 percent of the military's funds in Kosovo this year,
unless the president certified by July 15, 2000, that the European
allies were meeting their commitments for reconstruction aid,
police officers and assistance with food and medicines in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Without the presidential certification, the measure required
that money could be spent in Kosovo only for an orderly withdrawal
of U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The defeated provision's chief Republican author, Sen. John W.
Warner, R-Va., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
remained undaunted after Thursday's vote. Warner vowed to offer the
provision as an amendment to the Pentagon's budget bill for fiscal
year 2001 when that legislation reaches the Senate floor in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House approved, by a vote of 264-153, a
amendment similar to the Senate's. But the House version gives the
president until April 1, 2001, nearly nine months longer than the
Senate, to certify that the European allies are meeting their
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The House version actually sets even higher standards than the
Senate provision. Under the House measure, for instance, the allies
would be responsible for 50 percent of reconstruction aid; the
Senate version required at least 33 percent. The House version
would require allies to pick up 90 percent of the new civilian
police in Kosovo; the Senate version required at least 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the allies are providing 63 percent of the police and
are close to providing 75 percent of basic human aid, the White
House said. The United States has pledged 15 percent of the total
financial support to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,
Jacob J. Lew, said Thursday that the allies use different
bookkeeping practices, which ``could prevent certification of
numeric burden-sharing shares.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment of American forces aboard should not rest on
mechanical formulas and record-keeping technicalities,'' Lew said
in a letter to the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said he would recommend that Clinton veto any bill that
contained the burden-sharing provisions, setting up a clash between
the administration and both chambers of Congress, if Warner carries
out his plan to tack the measure onto the Pentagon budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It seemed almost certain Thursday night that the fight over U.S.
military involvement in the Balkans would not end with Thursday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no long-term plan for Kosovo,'' complained Sen. Trent
Lott, the majority leader, who supports imposing the deadline on
withdrawal. ``We don't know how long we're going or how much it's
going to cost. Commitments are not being fulfilled by the
Europeans, and that's unacceptable.''

   PITTING BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER
</P>
<P>
   Trying to foment a bit of sibling discord, Vice President Al
Gore's campaign on Thursday circulated a newspaper article by Gov.
Jeb Bush of Florida that seemed to contradict a plan by his brother
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to allow taxpayers to invest some
Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 18 op-ed piece in The Tallahassee Democrat, Jeb Bush
argued that, because of the stock market's volatility, the state
pension system should put part of its $12 billion surplus in a fund
that would be reserved for a downturn. ``It makes sense that we
take the surplus we have now and place it in a reserve that is not
affected by changes in the market,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said that suggested that the Florida governor wants
to withdraw some pension funds from the stock market. A spokesman
for Jeb Bush said the Gore campaign had misread the article.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLING UPHILL IN INDIANA
</P>
<P>
   With a Presbyterian church as his backdrop, David Johnson, a
Democrat who serves as a policy adviser to Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon,
cast himself as a champion of Hoosier values this week in beginning
his campaign to unseat Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican seeking a
fifth term. Johnson declared it was ``time we have a new senator
who will put these values into action,'' as he stood outside the
Indianapolis church where his father was once pastor.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an uphill battle for Johnson, who has raised $412,000
in contributions. Lugar has amassed $2 million.

DAILY NEWS OWNER SAYS PAPER ISN'T UP FOR SALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Daily News of Los Angeles is not for sale and
there are no plans to sell it to the rival Los Angles Times now or
in the future, the newspaper's owner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some media reports Thursday suggested that the Times was likely
to buy the paper in the future because of an option it holds,
despite antitrust laws that would forbid such a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion arose after the Times published a story pointing
out that its parent, the Times Mirror Co., holds a two-year-old
option to buy the Daily News if it's put up for sale by
Denver-based MediaNews Group, owner of the San Fernando
Valley-based paper.
</P>
<P>
   William Dean Singleton, president and chief executive officer of
MediaNews Group, said that the option, part of a complex financial
deal, could be exercised only if he agreed to sell the paper, which
he doesn't plan to do.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that federal officials have said they would
not approve such a sale to the Times because of antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said the $2.4 million option provision was part of a
$50 million loan package from Times Mirror, which was used to
finance the Daily News' purchase for $130 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to be willing to sell and the Justice Department
would have to agree,'' Singleton said of the option, which was
disclosed in Securities and Exchange Commission documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I wanted to sell the Daily News to the Times _ which I
don't _ it would be legally impossible. So there is no exposure,''
Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Times Mirror could not sell the option without first
offering it to MediaNews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither executives with Times Mirror nor its new ownership, the
Chicago-based Tribune Co., returned calls for comments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company issued a statement: ``There is an option to
buy the Daily News that was part of a broad financial agreement
reached in 1998 between Times Mirror and Garden State Newspapers.
The earliest it would be exercisable would be 2003 at which time it
would be subject to all necessary government approvals.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal centered on the loan, and the papers later purchased
California Independent Postal Service, which distributes
pre-printed ads in the papers and to the homes of nonsubscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror and MediaNews have a long history of working
together. Times Mirror helped finance MediaNews' 1986 acquisition
of the Dallas Times Herald with a $60 million loan and the 1987
purchase of The Denver Post with a $70 million loan. Both papers
were owned by Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   If Singleton decides to sell the Daily News between 2003 and
2010, the option allows Times Mirror first right to buy it at a
fair market value. But Singleton said Justice Department officials
investigated the two companies' financial partnership and objected
only to the option provision allowing Times Mirror to buy the Daily
News, saying it would violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department did a one-year investigation, and they
blessed everything we were doing, but they said they would not
entertain the Times exercising the option,'' Singleton said.
``We've been told it couldn't be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department antitrust officials could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Massey, Daily News president, chief executive officer and
publisher, said the deal between Times Mirror and MediaNews'
predecessor company, Garden State Newspapers, requires both parties
to agree to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Mirror can't force the sale of the Daily News; there
must be a willing buyer and a willing seller,'' Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms, Times Mirror could sell the option back to
MediaNews at any time during the seven-year option window. If it's
still in force by 2010, MediaNews would have to repurchase it.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said he will buy the option back at the first
opportunity, noting its payback value is tied to the paper's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to buy it back today,'' Singleton said, citing the
Daily News' overall appreciation and steadily climbing performance.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton predicted Times Mirror will make an ``outstanding
return'' on its investment in the Daily News as the loan, including
the option, is retired.
</P>
<P>
   For the six-month period ending March 31, the Daily News had
average daily circulation of 200,798 and Sunday circulation of
212,434. Singleton has solidified his Southern California position
by creating the Los Angeles Newspapers Group, MediaNews Group's
largest operating division.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Daily News, the group includes the San Gabriel
Valley Tribune, Long Beach Press-Telegram, Pasadena Star-News,
Whittier Daily News, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, San Bernardino
County Sun, Redlands Daily Facts and Lompoc Record.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said that while he has no immediate plans for more
acquisitions in the area, he continues to be interested in
expanding his operations, now the seventh-largest newspaper group
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said Times Mirror and the Times have no control of nor
influence on the operations or contents of the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Daily News has outperformed expectations at the time
of its purchase. ``For every circulation reporting period since the
purchase, the Daily News' circulation has grown both daily and on
Sunday,'' Massey said. ``The Daily News will remain the voice of
the San Fernando Valley.''

ADVERTISERS SHUN DR. LAURA'S SHOW AS GAY PROTEST GROWS  

</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG and STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the Paramount Television studio has been left out of
the riches of daytime talk television as shows starring Oprah
Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell became wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   So, last spring, top Paramount executives jumped at a chance to
produce a talk show starring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the
conservative advice-giver whose radio show is the
second-highest-rated talk show in the nation. They scheduled it for
September and sold it to stations covering 96 percent of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But now they are facing an increasingly vociferous protest by
gay advocacy groups, who are angered by what they say is
Schlessinger's anti-gay message. The protests are getting results.
This week, the nation's second-largest advertiser, Procter &AMP;
Gamble, announced that it was dropping plans to sponsor the TV show
and would stop advertising on her radio program because of the
controversy generated by the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, United Airlines said it would not run any more
advertisements for the radio show in its in-flight magazine. A week
ago, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council issued a condemnation
of Schlessinger's radio commentary and recommended that stations
censor any anti-gay remarks by her.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists have complained about her descriptions of
homosexuality as ``deviant'' and derivative of ``biological
error.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger, who declined to be interviewed about the protest,
has said in articles and broadcast commentaries that her statements
are being taken out of context. She has said that while she opposes
homosexuality and a ``gay activist agenda,'' she does not oppose
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount executives said they were standing behind the program,
which they maintained would carry positive messages about family
values and would not promote ``hate, hurt or intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   The reactions to the protests reflect the growing political and
economic clout of gays.
</P>
<P>
   It has been far more common for mainstream marketers to listen
to activists on the right like the American Family Association,
which assert that they represent millions of consumers, than to
activists representing gays, a smaller group.
</P>
<P>
   About the only time that gay activists have won a big, visible
victory came two decades ago when their protests and boycott led
Florida citrus commissioners to end an endorsement contract with
the singer Anita Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Boycott threats from conservative activists have proved mostly
powerless _ as when the sales of the Clorox Co. a decade ago were
unaffected by a boycott called by the family association for
sponsoring shows with content it viewed as objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative organizations have achieved results by
generating controversy about a TV series or individual episode that
dissuaded marketers from buying commercial time in the first place,
rather than withdrawing commercials they had already agreed to run.
</P>
<P>
   That worked for two years to keep most mainstream advertisers
off ``NYPD Blue'' despite strong ratings in the initial two
seasons; only after seeing how that large viewership kept watching
the series week after week did large advertisers climb aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controversy is in general something advertisers want to
avoid,'' said Howard Buford, president and chief executive at Prime
Access in New York, an agency specializing in campaigns aimed at
gays. ``The idea of advertising is to pull people in, not drive
people away, so when a topic is divisive or polarizing, you want to
stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason advertisers would begin to listen to gay activists
about what upsets them is a result, Buford said, of ``the fact that
there's a very different picture now of who is gay and what it
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Tyler, a gay activist who was a co-founder of a Web site
that has rallied opposition to the Schlessinger TV show
(www.stopdrlaura.com), said one reason the anti-Schlessinger forces
were gaining momentum so quickly was that the Internet was enabling
the organizers ``to get out our messages instantly, reaching
millions of us in our own communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopdrlaura.com was the brainchild of a small group of
activists. But now, established gay and lesbian organizations like
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation are marshaling
their forces to join the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has said that while gays are ``entitled to love and
respect as are all human beings,'' homosexual activity is
incompatible with Scripture. She has said she supports the concept
of therapy for gays who wish to change their sexual orientation.
She supported a ballot proposition in California that outlawed
same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Procter &AMP; Gamble, which spends more than $2.6
billion a year in advertising for brands like Tide, Pampers and
Crest, could lead to defections by other advertisers because the
company is a pacesetter among the mass market advertisers that buy
most of the commercial time during syndicated talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount executives said Thursday that no other sponsors had
pulled out. Despite trepidation expressed by some station managers,
they said no local stations had moved to drop the show.
</P>
<P>
   The show is said to have offended employees at all levels of
Paramount, and some of the studio's executives want it dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The producer of ``Frasier,'' David Lee, who is openly gay, said
Thursday that he had repeatedly asked his studio to call off the
show, but to no avail.

CONFLICTING VIEWS HINDER DISSIDENTS ON CHINA TRADE VOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As political jockeying on a China trade bill
entered an intensive final stretch, both the Clinton administration
and its opponents claimed crucial backing Thursday from persecuted
democracy leaders in China and in exile.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling claims are possible because the dissident community
is sharply divided over whether China should have permanent trade
ties with the United States, a decision many see as the most
important test of U.S. policy toward China since 1989, when Beijing
ordered a bloody crackdown on democracy protesters.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the bill's backers say that it appears headed for
passage, both sides are continuing to fight for every vote in the
House, where scores of lawmakers remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper opinion pieces and lobbying calls on Capitol Hill,
Chinese democracy leaders are expressing opposite views about
whether permanent normal trade relations will increase or retard
human rights and political freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting messages have largely neutralized the
dissidents' impact on the vote, lawmakers said Thursday, and appear
to have driven a new wedge between opposition leaders who have long
tended to fight among themselves instead of unifying against the
Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment Congress says `yes' to permanent normal trade
relations is the moment that China stops listening to what the
United States says about human rights,'' said Wei Jingsheng, one of
China's best-known dissidents, who spent 18 years in Chinese prison
before becoming an exile in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Wei, 50, said he moved temporarily to Washington from New York
so that he could lobby full-time to defeat permanent trade ties,
one of the Clinton administration's top foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional opponents of the trade bill staged a rally on
Capitol Hill on Thursday in which they introduced several dozen
Chinese workers, student leaders and veteran activists who urged
Congress to vote down permanent trade ties.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton is also pointing to support from well
known opposition leaders in China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He has cited on opinion piece written by Dai Qing, a
Beijing-based human rights and environmental activist. He asked
Martin Lee, a leading Hong Kong democrat who supports permanent
trade ties, to help him lobby Congress. And the White House has
distributed copies of a pro-trade message from what it called an
underground democracy activist in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
   Several Tiananmen Square student leaders, including Wang Dang
and Chai Ling, have also said that they support granting China
permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that permanent normal trade status, with its
implication of openness and fairness, is among the most powerful
means of promoting freedom in China,'' Dai wrote in an essay
published in The Los Angeles Times. Dai is best known for seeking
to stop China's giant Three Gorges Dam construction project and for
investigating corruption within the ruling Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration Thursday sought to build momentum for
the vote after two congressional committees strongly endorsed the
measure Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton intends to make a short, prime-time
television address on China on Sunday night. But of the major
national networks, only NBC has agreed to grant air time to the
president, while CBS, Fox and ABC declined, network officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan joined Clinton in the White House Rose Garden to lend his
support. Though Greenspan has weighed in on legislation before,
especially on fiscal and financial matters, the Fed chairman
usually maintains impartiality on White House foreign-policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who was asked to speak out on China trade by Treasury
Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, said he supports the bill on
economic grounds. He said the trade bill would have ``profound
implications for the free world's trading system and the long-term
growth potential of the American economy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, some Democratic and Republican lawmakers were
still scrambling to secure Republican leadership support for a new
congressional-executive human rights commission to monitor China
and advise Congress and the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to create the commission is seen as essential to
rounding up support for the trade bill among the large number of
undecided lawmakers in both parties, many of whom say they are wary
of sacrificing their annual review of China's trade status unless
they create a new forum to monitor human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders have already agreed to support
one part of the so-called Levin-Bereuter proposal, a provision that
would help guard against sudden surges of imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders Wednesday night were still discussing
whether to include language authorizing a human rights commission
in the trade bill. Democrats are insisting that the trade and human
right measures must be considered together in one package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our colleagues are concerned that if the commission
moves only in parallel legislation that it could falter and not
become law,'' said Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., who co-sponsored the
proposal with Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters scheduled a press conference for Friday morning to
unveil details of the new legislative package, and Congressional
aides said they expected several undecided lawmakers to announce
their support for the trade bill at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill rally was intended to refute White House claims
that Chinese opposition leaders support elevated trade ties.
Participants argued that by ending the annual trade review,
Congress would sacrifice the only real leverage it has over China's
behavior toward its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will never change unless it's under pressure,'' said
Wang Xizhe, a gray-haired veteran of the opposition movement who
now lives in the United States. Wang wrote an influential essay
criticizing the excesses of the Cultural Revolution in 1974 and had
been in and out of prison for nearly 25 years before he fled China
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said that without the annual review of China trade status,
Beijing authorities might never have released him from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate in Congress each year was one of the few things to
lift my spirits when I was in jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged a deep split in the dissident community and
he criticized exiled Tiananmen Square student leaders who support
the trade bill as naive. ``Some of us understand the Chinese people
and some of us do not,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ Frustrated by the performance of the contractors
that it hires to run its nuclear weapons plants, the Department of
Energy will demand the right to fire the contractors' top managers
and control the managers' bonuses in future contracts, Secretary
Bill Richardson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under the new policy, decisions on what goals to
set for contractors and whether the contracting companies have met
those goals and should earn bonuses, will be reviewed directly by
the energy secretary. Previously, such decisions were usually made
by senior civil servants, not the secretary or assistant
secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to end the cozy relationship between the department
and its contractors,'' Richardson said in an interview. ``From now
on, contractors will be rewarded for results and not just get paid
for writing plans.''
</P>
<P>
   That has happened in the past, a problem caused by the
department itself, senior officials acknowledge. At one nuclear
cleanup project, they said, the department set goals for
achievements like writing a safety plan, but none for the number of
acres cleaned up or the number of pounds of radioactive material
sealed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department has not exercised proper oversight,''
Richardson said, ``and it needs to get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior government officials say they also need better
performance from their own contract managers. ``They should know
the technical details, and manage, and not just get the reports
from time to time,'' one senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's plan is the latest effort to cope with a program in
which the government owns everything but does nothing for itself.
</P>
<P>
   From the department's origins in World War II, when the
Manhattan Project set out to build the atomic bomb, almost all the
work has been done by private contractors, including planning,
constructing and operating reactors and chemical factories, and
later, cleaning them up and tearing them down. Energy Department
workers seldom, if ever, hold a shovel or a hammer or twist a knob
in a control room.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is that the department recently decided that the
workers at the emergency operations center at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, who have been trying to cope with
wildfires there, should be employed by the federal government, not
private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting employees in specialized agencies like the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, the department has 11,000 employees
supervising 110,000 contractors, and officials say that this
10-to-1 ratio is the highest in the federal government. Of its
$17.5 billion annual budget, 85 percent is spent on contractors.
</P>
<P>
   For years, all work was on a cost-plus basis _ the Department of
Energy reimbursed the contractors for all costs, and added a fixed
markup _ but in the 1990s the department moved more heavily into
setting incentives for good performance. It has seldom withheld the
bonuses, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the department has recently penalized two contractors for
poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   At Hanford, Wash., it ended a contract with BNFL to build and
operate a factory for mixing high-level nuclear waste liquids into
glass, because, Richardson said, cost increases had gotten out of
hand and managers had not kept the department informed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for similar reasons, it restructured a program to
build the National Ignition Facility, a laser device designed to
test the operability of nuclear weapons without actually exploding
them. The contractor was the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   The department administers more than 30 management contracts,
worth more than $50 billion in the next decade. But department
officials acknowledge that the government is not easy to work for;
to bid on the contract to manage the Mound plant, in southern Ohio,
contractors had to submit applications that ran to 15,000 pages,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside critics say that part of the department's problem is a
continuing struggle between political appointees in its
headquarters here and personnel in the field offices, many of whom
have far more experience in the department's actual operations.
</P>
<P>
   Many contractors know the government well because they are
former government employees.
</P>
<P>
   The project manager on the waste-processing plant at Hanford,
for example, was the former head of the Energy Department's office
in Richland, Wash., which is in charge of Hanford. BNFL also hired
away department contracting officers at the Idaho National
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, near Idaho Falls, and at
the Oak Ridge site, in Tennessee, to work on department projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is the revolving door,'' said Arjun
Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental
Research, a nonprofit group here that analyzes the Energy
Department. ``The secretary cannot make these judgments about what
is going on in the field on his own; he has to have a staff that is
thoroughly independent, empowered to evaluate these contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have one eye, and sometimes one foot, in the
contractor's operation, the secretary has no way to get the
information he needs to make sensible decisions.''

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS PROPOSE BARRING FEMALE PASTORS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Ky.)   (Eds: Subs 2nd graf to tighten phrase between hyphens; Adds `The
Rev.' title to Mohler and Vestal in 9th and 14th grafs.)

<P>
   Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, proposed revising the denomination's basic
statement of faith on Thursday to say that the Bible allows only
men to be church pastors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change _ to a document called the Baptist Faith and
Message _ would declare that ``the office of pastor is limited to
men as qualified by Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed phrase reflects the theologically right-ward turn
by the denomination, historically a conservative body in which few
women have been hired as pastors. If adopted by the denomination,
it would have the effect of strongly discouraging Southern Baptist
congregations from calling women as pastors. But it could not
legally prevent them from doing so, because such congregations are
self-governing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed revision would also be another in a series of
recent moves that sharply distinguishes Southern Baptists from
other major Protestant bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Since their denomination underwent a wrenching internal power
struggle in the 1980s, Southern Baptists have been guided by
leaders who regard the Bible as ``inerrant'' _ literally true in
all matters _ and have been firm in saying Scripture prohibits
women from being spiritual leaders over men.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Southern Baptists amended the faith statement to
declare that ``a wife is to submit herself graciously'' to her
husband's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the convention called for new efforts aimed at
converting Jews to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saying women should not be pastors, the proposed
revisions call on Christians to oppose racism, homosexuality and
pornography, to speak out against abortion and to bring government
and society ``under the sway of the principles of righteousness,
truth and brotherly love.'' The provisions will be voted on at the
15.8-million-member denomination's convention, in Orlando, Fla., on
June 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes are ``historically significant,'' said the
Rev. R. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky., and a member of the committee that
proposed the revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A confession of faith is a very concrete representation of
what Baptists believe,'' Mohler said, adding that it was
``appropriate that every generation'' be able to consider such
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues that is important here is that the
opposition to the idea of a woman serving as pastor is not
culturally driven,'' he said ``It is a matter of biblical
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carolyn Weatherford Crumpler, a former executive director of
Woman's Missionary Union, the major women's organization within the
Southern Baptist Convention, said she would not support the
proposed revision. ``I think it's a misinterpretation of
Scripture,'' said Crumpler, who is also a former moderator of the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a network of theologically more
moderate congregations in the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Vestal, the fellowship's top official, also said
the proposed revision ``is based on a bad interpretation of
Scripture, an insensitivity to the Holy Spirit and an unwillingness
to see what God is doing in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that were the clause against women as pastors to be
incorporated into the faith statement, it would have a profound
effect among the denomination's 40,000 congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbol is sometimes substance,'' he said. ``It will definitely
affect the local congregation over time, because the document is a
document for hiring and firing in all institutions, so it's going
to affect faculty and it's going to affect missionaries, and that
has an effect on all congregations.''
</P>
<P>
   The faith statement was written in 1925 and revised in 1963.
Since the last major revision, several Protestant denominations (as
well as the Reform and Conservative rabbinate) have ordained women
as clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   These days, women make up a significant proportion of clergy
members in the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America and the Episcopal Church. All three denominations
also ordain women as bishops. In one small religious body, the
Unitarian-Universalist Association, women now make up a slight
majority of clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Frances Anders, a retired sociology professor who is
moderator of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, said that in 1964,
the first Southern Baptist woman was ordained as a minister since
before the Civil War. But that woman, she said, found a job as a
pastor in another denomination, the American Baptist Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she said, about 1,600 Southern Baptist women have
been ordained, although many are chaplains, ministers of music or
supervisors of educational programs. She said about 100 women were
pastors and about 100 were associate pastors in Southern Baptist
congregations.

BUSH'S ADMAN-IN-CHIEF SAYS DO NOT BE FOOLED BY NICE-GUY REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The words echo across the highly suspect
political road of good intentions. ``We're not going to run that
kind of race,'' insisted Stuart Stevens, one of Gov. George W.
Bush's advertising men. ``Tonally, we will run another kind of
race.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore campaign does get vicious, the Bush men say, it
won't be because the mud was slung first from Austin. ``They're
planning on running a mean, nasty, negative race,'' said Stevens'
colleague, Russell Schriefer.
</P>
<P>
   That view was repeated in the agency's headquarters here as if
it were a mantra: ``Gore has always run negative campaigns,'' said
Mark McKinnon, the Bush camp's adman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   To which Stevens added, ``They would take offense if you accused
them of running a positive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing do the members of Maverick Media, the
organization assembled for the express goal of cultivating Bush's
appeal on radio and television, operate out of a basement warren of
offices they call ``the bunker'': The first steady, 30-second
barrages of the general election have not even been set off yet,
and already the Bush message people are crying ``foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, it's reminiscent of the primary campaign, during
which the major candidates of both parties were accusing one
another of running low-down, dirty commercials, when, for the most
part, the spots were fairly tame.
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-emptive protests may also indicate a certain
jitteriness among the half-dozen principal members of the Maverick
team, some of whom are working on a national presidential media
campaign for the first time. There is inside the bunker the air of
a group of well-mannered folks who have stumbled into the toughest
neighborhood in town.
</P>
<P>
   In a cutthroat business, McKinnon is admired for his decency:
``He's known for running very fair campaigns,'' said John Weaver,
political director of the McCain campaign. But when the opposition
consists of the likes of Carter Eskew and Robert Shrum, veteran
media strategists for Vice President Al Gore who have
take-no-prisoners reputations, the question arises: Does Bush need
a team that plays by the Marquess of Queensberry's rules, or Mike
Tyson's? Can Maverick avoid the errors in Bill Bradley's political
advertising, which never adequately answered Gore's incessant
criticisms of Bradley's policies?
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, in fact, acknowledges he would much rather paint a
portrait than have to slash someone else's: ``It's much more
powerful and compelling to create a positive vision than it is to
tear somebody down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sensibility is reflected in many of the spots McKinnon
creates for Bush, warm-and-fuzzy images reminiscent of the upbeat
spots for Ronald Reagan. The McKinnon style is more documentary;
the innovation Maverick introduced in the primaries was the ``crash
ad,'' filmed, edited and on the air in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   And his spots feature lots of shimmering boilerplate: shots of
Bush wading into smiling crowds, posed in dazzling sunshine with
his wife, Laura, or offering his family-sampler takes on
heart-tugging issues. ``I believe every child can learn,'' he said
in one education spot.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon and company know they cannot run a general-election
campaign on happy talk; indeed, alongside the sunny spots, groups
and individuals allied with Bush ran some of the harshest
commercials of the primaries, including attack ads that portrayed
Sen. John McCain as an enemy of the environment and breast cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   And the question of tone is not their only challenge. Although
Bush is an immensely likable candidate, questions about his grasp
of foreign affairs and other issues could be magnified in
comparisons with Gore, and some political observers wonder if
Maverick will be able to fill in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the hard thing,'' said Paul Begala, a former adviser to
President Clinton who has known and liked McKinnon since their days
together at the University of Texas. ``Mark's greatest strength is
style, and Bush has a style that meshes well with Mark's. In small
settings Bush is very charming: the most charming politician to
come down the pike since Clinton. Mark does an excellent job of
capturing that. But at the end of the day there is no filter that
can be put on a camera to add gray matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of depth is clearly one of the candidate's most
vexing image problems. The governor's media advisers, though,
maintain that such doubts about Bush exist in a land where pundits
reside, but not the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the fall of last year to address substance,'' McKinnon
said. ``The rap on us that we don't have issues, or substance, was
effectively addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in a windowless conference room ringed with television
sets, the affable McKinnon would not be coaxed into a meditation on
any of Bush's perceived weaknesses. If it seemed a function of a
political advertising man's natural inclination to project only the
bright side, it also reflected what those who know him say is
McKinnon's genuine belief in Bush, a deep and abiding affection
characteristic of those in the governor's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston, for whom McKinnon made
commercials in all three of his successful mayoral campaigns, says
that there can be only one explanation for McKinnon's signing up:
``If he's supporting George Bush, it's because he thinks George
Bush would make a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are conventional routes to becoming commercial-maker to
this potential president, McKinnon did not take them. For one
thing, he climbed the wrong ladder: He was a longtime Democratic
media strategist before signing up with Bush, working on the
campaigns of, among others, former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas
and former Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McKinnon, a Colorado-born musician who in his younger
days was invited to Nashville, Tenn., to write songs for Kris
Kristofferson, had dropped out of politics entirely by the time he
fell into a long conversation with Bush at a dinner in Austin in
1997. The year before, McKinnon confessed in a most public way _ a
first person article for Texas Monthly _ that after 15 years of
politics, he was burned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I got tired of candidates' asking me what their firmly
held convictions should be,'' he wrote. ``Maybe I got tired of
accusing opponents of being right-wing extremists who wanted to cut
Social Security benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   At that Austin dinner, though, McKinnon's head was turned. Bush
seemed to him to evince an honest interest in education, an issue
dear to McKinnon; he was making a documentary about the
inspirational founder of a Houston charter school. ``I was amazed,
blown away, by how much attention he paid,'' McKinnon said of the
governor, and before long he had signed up to handle media in
Bush's 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon did not win friends among Texas Democrats for his
defection; he is unfazed. ``What does it say about me, my values?''
he asked. ``I think what attracted me to him is what is going to
attract a lot of independents and Democrats. I came to the
conclusion that in the end, good politics is about good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and rivals alike say personal attachment is a
characteristic of McKinnon; Lanier recalled that once McKinnon
moved into his home for a few weeks, ``to get a flavor so that his
ads would have a genuine-ness to them, so that I'd be comfortable
saying the words.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a reputation for not going for the jugular. ``I
can't recall any campaign where I've worked against him where he
even got close to crossing the line,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   That is high praise from a McCain aide, considering how
aggrieved his boss felt by some of the commercials Bush ran in
South Carolina. The Bush campaign had been expecting the most
intense media battering to come from the campaign of another
primary-election opponent, Steve Forbes, but it was McCain who
surprised Bush with the harder hitting commercials, including a New
Hampshire spot in which McCain said Bush's tax cuts would mostly
benefit the wealthy. Some of Bush's advisers believe their failure
to answer the commercial was a major factor in their sobering early
loss in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed to learn from their mistakes in South Carolina.
In one of the most effective media moves of the primary season,
Bush was able to turn McCain's clean-campaign vows against him. In
a spot shot at a fishing camp in South Carolina, a serious-looking
Bush responded to a now-famous McCain commercial in which the
senator accused the governor of twisting the truth, ``like
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disagree with me, fine,'' Bush intoned in his reply ad. ``But
do not challenge my integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a subtle and successful lesson in the art of the
double-negative commercial: suggest that an opponent was unworthy
beause he said something mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we ran that ad, the numbers moved,'' said Matthew
Dowd, another member of the Maverick team. In fact, it worked so
well that it was used in states where McCain had not even run his
own advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark made the best ad of the primaries when Bush looked into
the camera and said, `He compared me to Clinton,''' said Begala,
now a commentator on CNBC's ``Equal Time.'' ``It gave Bush carte
blanche to turn his guns on McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Vast amounts of money will be spent on political commercials at
all levels this year _ $600 million, according to the Television
Bureau of Advertising _ and a lot of it by the Bush and Gore
campaigns. Commercials in Spanish will be more prevalent than ever
before: For instance, Maverick has its own unit headed by the San
Antonio-based team of Lionel Sosa and Luis Garcia to create spots
targeted for Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McKinnon does not think the 2000 election will be decided
inside the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe there are so many other facets in the campaign
that are so much more important,'' he said. ``The media, the free
press, is the wind that fills the sails. The advertising acts as a
rudder, to steer a little bit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ William F. Buckley Jr., a founder of modern
American conservatism who 49 years ago accused Yale of rejecting
God, is returning to campus on Monday _ this time to accept an
honorary degree from the university he has so devoutly castigated.
</P>
<P>
   After the university's Class of 2000 graduates, Yale officials
will award Buckley (Class of 1950) a degree that recognizes his
influence on political thought and his career as an iconoclast,
which began a half-century ago with a withering attack on his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
   In ``God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of `Academic
Freedom,''' published in 1951, Buckley assailed Yale for drifting
from its Christian foundations and teaching unalloyed liberalism in
its classrooms. The uproar that followed made the book a best
seller and catapulted Buckley, then just 25, to national
prominence.
</P>
<P>
   The book so scandalized university officials that they appointed
a committee, led by the president of the Union Theological Seminary
in New York, to look into Buckley's allegations, said Gaddis Smith,
a Yale professor of history. In November 1951, McGeorge Bundy, a
stalwart of Yale's liberal establishment, published a scathing
indictment of Buckley in The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Though Buckley, 74, has ventured back to Yale since then, the
honorary degree is the first signal that he and the school he
eviscerated so famously have patched up their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Bill Buckley, Yale became a symbol of the liberal
establishment that the conservative movement wanted to destroy,''
said Sam Tanenhaus, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair who is
writing a biography of Buckley. ``These enemies are now embracing
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The honor is supposed to be a big secret. Lawrence J. Haas, the
university's spokesman, would neither confirm nor deny that Yale
planned to give Buckley a degree, citing the school's tradition of
keeping the names of honorarians under seal until graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   But friends of Buckley _ and even Buckley himself, tacitly _
acknowledged Thursday that he would be given, and would accept, the
degree. ``What he told me was: `It's true. God has finally returned
to Yale,''' Tanenhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Massie, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian
who, despite divergent political views, has remained close to
Buckley since their Yale days, helped bring the university and its
most famous critic together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Yale is giving Bill a degree is very
significant, but I think we should do it their way,'' Massie said.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted via e-mail, Buckley initially responded by writing,
``Sorry _ tacent satis laudant,'' a Latin phrase meaning ``silence
is praise enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he wrote a second note: ``I HATE being coy, but what am I
supposed to do? There are heavy deposits over the years of
Yale-incited/encouraged/tolerated criticisms of me and my work, so
maybe we can leave it at that, that if it's true, Yale is
transcending itself.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's torment of Yale began as an undergraduate, when he
helped found a student group that published Lux et Veritas, a
conservative campus magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as the Cold War and communism consumed American
political debate, Buckley published a book defending Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, who had categorically denounced scores of prominent
citizens as communists.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley went on to start National Review, a conservative
magazine, in 1955, and the television program ``Firing Line'' in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``God and Man at Yale'' that remained his signature
achievement, one that catapulted American conservatism from an
obscure movement populated by isolationists, protectionists and
bigots into mainstream politics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckley was the most prominent and visible member of our
class, as I suppose he has been ever since,'' Massie said.
``Everybody was aware of what Bill was doing and what he thought,
and many of us admired him even though we didn't agree with his
views.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who referred to Buckley as ``an old friend'' and to the
book as ``a juvenile attack on Yale,'' said it was intended as a
warning to other prominent alumni.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's impact on Yale was positive,'' said Smith. ``It
made Yale re-examine itself and pay more attention to the alumni
than it had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley has returned to Yale before. As early as November 1972,
he gave a speech to more than 400 people gathered at the Yale
Political Union. In October 1990, Buckley joined the Yale Chamber
Symphony Players for a recital at Battell Chapel on campus, where
he performed a harpsichord solo. In 1996 and 1997, he taught two
popular seminars on English composition. Last winter, he spoke at
an alumni dinner held by the campus newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Buckley is no longer a polarizing figure on campus. Asked
about him, only about half of the dozen Yale undergraduates
interviewed Thursday said they knew much about him. And none of the
four bookstores surrounding campus carry ``God and Man at Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason a student would buy that book is to give it as
a gift to a grandparent,'' said Lynn Winningham, a sophomore
history major who works at Atticus Bookstore &AMP; Cafe across the
street from the university.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Kagan, 21, said he had read ``God and Man at Yale,'' but
disagreed with the book and with Buckley. ``I think he's an
articulate fool,'' Kagan said. ``He's the emblem of Old Yale _ he
comes from privilege and doesn't seem to know he comes from
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Brandler, 20, also a history major, said he was
``empowered by the fact he cringes and recoils at what Yale has
become.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a symbol of how much Yale has changed in the last 40, 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Buckley influence persists at Yale. Smith recently
taught a class called ``Yale and the External World'' that used
Buckley's famous book as a reference, and Smith is now writing a
book on the same topic. And every now and again, an editorial
appears in The Yale Daily News from a student lambasting or
praising Buckley's intellectual groundwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lack of faith in ourselves, and generalized disrespect
for religion, might be what Buckley feared 45 years ago,'' wrote
one student, Aaron Honn, in a February 1996 editorial. ``It is up
to us to make sure that there is always a place for God at Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   The place that Yale is officially making for Buckley is well
deserved, Tanenhaus said. ``Bill has become a kind of humanist,
which perhaps he wasn't before,'' he said. ``Politics has changed,
Yale has changed and Bill has changed. They have all converged at
this moment.''

BABBITT RIPS RESPONSE TO LOS ALAMOS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Ore., Idaho)  (Eds: Subs 9th graf, `As forceful ..., to CORRECT, Teton Dam is in
Idaho, sted Wyoming; Change `homes' to `housing units' in lede and
13th graf, So far ..., because some may be apartments.) 
By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ With a scathing indictment of the federal
response to fires that have now burned nearly 80 square miles of
northern New Mexico and more than 400 housing units, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt said Thursday that the government was
wholly to blame and would do whatever possible to compensate
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calculations that went into this were seriously flawed,''
Babbitt said at a news conference in which federal officials
described how a planned burn for a small section in Bandelier
National Monument quickly raged out of control, overtaking wide
areas beyond, including the city of Los Alamos and the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, a nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt compared the combination of poor planning and bad
decisions by people in the national parks and forest services to
``a cascading series of events, like a rock being dislodged down a
hill, leading to a landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes began with missing weather information and led to
problems from a lack of firefighters, equipment and judgment about
a situation that grew increasingly dangerous by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's remarks were timed with the release of the results of
a federal investigation into what happened from the evening of May
4, when park service personnel at Bandelier National Monument
ignited what officials call a ``prescribed fire,'' a means commonly
used to remove dead and dried timber in an effort to reduce the
possibility of a catastrophic fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that almost every aspect of the plan for the
prescribed fire was poorly conceived and carried out, beginning
with the critical omission of wind predictions for several days
into the burn. For some reason, the investigators found, that
information was not passed along to officials responsible for
authorizing the burn and for managing it.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said that the park official who was in charge
of the burn, Mike Powell, lacked the proper experience to manage a
fire once it raced out of control. Powell's boss, Roy Weaver, the
superintendent of Bandelier National Monument, has been on
administrative leave since the fires spread. Powell is still
working at the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical and operational experience of the burn boss was
not adequate,'' said Dick Bahr, a burn specialist with the park
service from Boise, Idaho, and one of the investigators. ``He had
not seen a fire of this complexity and size.''
</P>
<P>
   As forceful as he was in ascribing blame, Babbitt was equally
strong in saying that the federal government would accept full
blame for the wildfire, which was about 65 percent contained
Thursday. He said Congress was developing emergency legislation
that would compensate people who lost their homes and businesses. A
similar measure in 1976 helped people affected by a break in the
Teton Dam in Idaho to receive compensation within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also said the Clinton administration wass ``on the
wavelength'' to sign the pending legislation, once it passed the
House and Senate, which he predicted was likely to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he and others in
the state's congressional delegation had met with administration
officials, adding that they were planning to work together ``to
establish some principles that we ought to incorporate in a law
that will permit us to pay damages to the New Mexicans and other
institutions that have been damaged by this fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Domenici was also critical of what he called ``this
negligence'' that led to the destruction, adding that ``the people
of New Mexico and this country deserve to be very, very upset and
to demand a much better performance and to insist that we find a
way to recompense the people in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Cerro Grande Fire, as it is now known, has claimed
405 housing units and closed many businesses, most of them in the
Los Alamos area, which is about 45 miles from Santa Fe, the state
capital. Early estimates put the aggregate loss at more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Several of New Mexico's leading elected officials here built on
Babbitt's remarks to assuage fears of those who suffered losses
from the fires. Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican who spent much of
the day with Babbitt, urged New Mexicans to ``document, document,
document your losses'' to expedite the paperwork in making claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government could not have done a better job
responding to a terrible situation,'' Johnson said. ``Los Alamos
was hit by an 18-wheeler, and the government was driving the
18-wheeler. But don't hire an attorney yet. Give the government a
chance to make good on this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The thrust of the report was to review how decisions were made
leading to the initial burn, how the authorities responded, whether
management personal had proper training and experience and whether
existing procedures were adequate to cover all contingencies once
the fire spread.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were nearly universal in their condemnation, with
these as some of the major conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _ The plan for the prescribed burn was inadequate in that
federal personnel did not take into account the complexities of the
terrain and the material to be burned.
</P>
<P>
   _ No one analyzed the plan with a critical eye toward unexpected
developments, which resulted in ignoring the possible need for
additional firefighters and equipment if the fire spread. As the
fire spread, state and local firefighters found themselves
critically overwhelmed, with some people on the lines working 24
hours and longer without a break.
</P>
<P>
   _ The plan did not take into account predictions of wind
conditions over the three to five days after the ignition. The
information was missing in Weaver's assessment, and no one else he
consulted mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coordination among federal, state and local agencies was
lacking, and when other opinions were sought, there was a lack of
critical analysis. ``You can't rubber stamp these things,'' Bahr
said. ``Everybody has got to be involved in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Once the fire spread, suppression tactics that were used did
not comply with federal standards in effect since 1995, a
transgression that aided the fire's growth. ``The policy is
sound,'' said Joe Stutler, a fire operations specialist from
Redmond, Ore., who was a member of the investigation team. ``But
federal agencies working jointly did not put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The report released Thursday is only the first step in assessing
procedures that are routinely used throughout the West, which is
highly susceptible to raging fires.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has appointed a four-member board of inquiry that will
take a harder look at what happened here, with technical experts
reviewing what happened and possibly recommending administrative or
punitive actions. That board, Babbitt said, is expected to complete
its work by late next week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Babbitt said the federal officials are now working
in Flagstaff, Ariz., to develop a new model for planned burns that
takes into account safety factors that were absent here, causing
such widespread property destruction and evacuations.

ELSTER COULD BE READY SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Elster returns to game action today. It's just
not the game he thought he'd be playing.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did heavy rains and a tornado threat force the
cancellation of the Dodgers' game Thursday with the Chicago Cubs at
Wrigley Field (it was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader Aug.
25), it altered the Dodgers' plans for Elster.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, who went on the disabled list with a pulled right groin
May 5 (retroactive to May 4), couldn't get his final test because
of the wet grounds, so he'll do that in a simulated game today in
Miami before the Dodgers face the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Elster will be activated for Saturday's game
and regain the starting shortstop job. Alex Cora, despite playing
well in his two weeks with the Dodgers, is expected to be sent to
Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Elster will get his prep work by facing right-hander Orel
Hershiser in a simulated game, designed to keep Hershiser somewhat
fresh during his inactivity in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we have the simulated game, I'll hit in that and go in
the field and play the position and do that kind of stuff,'' Elster
said. ``I feel fine. I wasn't able to get on the field (in
Chicago). They want me to run the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said it's unlikely Elster would be
activated for today's game because they want to give the groin time
to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Elster changes the complexion of the Dodgers, both
in the lineup and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, 35, provides the power and experience the 24-year-old
Cora couldn't, but the trade off is in athleticism and range at
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Batting eighth in the lineup, Elster is hitting .250 with six
homers and 17 RBI, but he walked 14 times and had a .378 on-base
percentage as he extended innings to get to the pitcher to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Cora hit .321 with a pair of RBI and had a .367 on-base
percentage, but he was used in an exclusive platoon situation with
switch-hitting Jose Vizcaino. He had hit .394 with Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never came across my mind that I had to impress people,''
Cora said. ``The way I'm looking at it, the level of player is
different, this is the major leagues, the best players in the
world. I knew it wouldn't be the same as the minors, but I didn't
worry about that. It's a different uniform. Instead of the ugly red
(of the Dukes), it's Dodger Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't want to send Cora down, but they also want him
to play regularly and that isn't possible with Elster returning.
The Dodgers are also limited because of player options. It's a
tough decision, but one general manager Kevin Malone loves having
after experiencing a lack of flexibility last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Whomever is sent down), it's not a reflection on anyone's
performance,'' Malone said. ``We're glad we're in (this position)
from a management standpoint, but I feel for the player, especially
when someone shows they can perform up here.'' &QL;

THANKS TO RAINOUT, JOHNSON CAN SHUFFLE ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Dodgers right-hander Eric Gagne's last start was May
7. Thanks to the rain that postponed Thursday's game against the
Chicago Cubs, it'll be a few more days before he makes his next
one.
</P>
<P>
   The game was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader Aug. 25 at
Wrigley Field beginning at 11:05 a.m. But because the game never
got started, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson altered the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Chan Ho Park will open the series today against
Florida. Lefty Carlos Perez was pushed back a day and will start
Saturday, instead of Gagne. Right-hander Kevin Brown will keep to
his usual five-day cycle and pitch Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with righty Darren Dreifort scheduled for Monday,
Gagne (0-2, 4.30) slides into the Tuesday spot against the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' said Gagne, who pitched 3 innings Sunday in
relief. ``It's not that bad. I have plenty of rest and a throwing
program. (The long layoff) can't be an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the Dodgers' commitment to Perez. Other than the
seven runs in 1 innings he allowed in his Sunday start, Perez has
had good results for the past month. He's 3-2 with a 5.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at Sunday as being a big concern because
everybody has a bad outing,'' Malone said. ``I hope he gets back on
track this weekend and he'll be able to win five in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE FROM THE MELEE: Included in the many videos and photos sent
to New York from Tuesday's fight between the Dodgers and fans at
Wrigley Field is a still photo taken from Chicago's Fox Sports
camera in center field.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Fox Sports spokesman, the camera didn't catch the
beginning of the altercation because it was panning the field. But
the still image, once enlarged, shows a fan reaching over the brick
wall next to the bullpen with his hand behind catcher Chad
Kreuter's head, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter is at the center of the Major League Baseball's
investigation because he was the first to go into the stands. He
did so after a fan allegedly hit him in the back of his head and
took his hat.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations,
said it's inappropriate for a player _ under every circumstance he
could imagine _ to go in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Because of pending legal problems, Kreuter isn't commenting on
the situation. However, Kreuter's agent, Scott Boras, isn't pleased
with the focus of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're focusing on a response to an assault,'' said Boras.
``If we eliminate an assault, we don't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the players association is keeping a close watch on
the investigation, being headed by vice president of on-field
operations Frank Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   MEETING, LAS VEGAS: Representatives from the Dodgers will travel
to Las Vegas for a two-day meeting next week to gather more
information regarding a multiteam spring-training complex in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and five other teams met with Las Vegas officials in
March, but there hasn't been much movement on the issue. However, a
bill that could generate $7 million worth of funding for Vero
Beach, Fla., and Indian River County to keep the Dodgers in
Dodgertown has already passed through the House and Senate in the
Florida legislature and is awaiting Gov. Jeb Bush's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to sign the bill within two weeks, and the
Dodgers are hopeful to have a long-term answer to their
spring-training home in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you continue to meet, it's going to get more
detailed,'' said Dodgers senior vice president of communications
Derrick Hall. ``We have to get serious so (if) the Florida bill
gets signed, we have two things to look at so we can make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dodgers are the front team in the Las Vegas project,
they are the only organization that is definitely attending the
meeting. Representatives from the Texas Rangers might also be
there.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Malone said center fielder Devon White, on the
disabled list with a partially torn left rotator cuff, remains two
to three weeks away in the most optimistic estimation. ...
Right-hander Mike Fetters (right elbow inflammation) is scheduled
to throw a bullpen session today, but he remains a week to 10 days
away from being activated, Malone said. ... Fetters, White and
reliever Gregg Olson will also be examined again when the team
returns to L.A. after the weekend. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: DEFENDERS GET TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Allan Houston was played so closely by Dan
Majerle Wednesday in Game 5 of the Heat-Knicks playoff series that
it appeared he'd know if Majerle had eaten onions on his steak for
his pre-game meal, or had radishes in his salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell,'' Houston said Thursday at a gathering of the
team at SUNY-Purchase to discuss strategy for Friday night's
ultimate, or penultimate, series game. ``But then,'' added Houston,
with a pause and a shrug, ``I wasn't trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, truly, had other things on his mind. Like trying to
scrounge a few unoccupied inches to get liberated for a jump shot.
In fact, at some points, Houston darted around the court looking as
if he had grown a second head, one that mightily resembled Dan
Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Majerle hit a couple of late game-deciding shots,
but did so with such difficulty _ one 3-point shot was drilled from
so far away it would have been fair to award him four points _
illustrates the ferocious intensity, the delicious drama, the, yes,
Dear Diary, sheer power, beauty and magic of the entertainment of
this series between these two fabled rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatfields and McCoys never had it so good. Troy and Greece
might have looked on in envy. The Heat and the Knicks have played
10 straight desperately fought playoff games over two years and no
team has won back-to-back games. If the Heat, ahead in the series
3-2, accomplishes this feat Friday night, it moves on to the
Eastern Conference finals. The Knicks hit the beach. If the series
runs true to form, the seventh and final game will be played Sunday
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It has been heard in assorted precincts in New York that this
series is less than artistic. ``Ugly,'' actually. Beauty, however,
is in the eye of the beholder, as Voltaire, or Yogi Berra or
somebody said. And what is beheld here is some of the best
basketball that can be played, and under the most extreme
circumstances. Every possession is contested, every step is often
met by a counterstep, every loose ball is pounced upon like a purse
on a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Knicks in Game 5 had only seven turnovers and the
Heat 10, when those teams average about 15 turnovers a game during
the regular season. And the turnovers come not so much on a ball
dribbled out of bounds, but on a steal (Latrell Sprewell, for one,
had four steals Wednesday). And considering that every time someone
takes a shot he is covered like scaffolding, the shooting
percentages (42 for the Knicks, 40 for the Heat in the series, and
47 and 42, respectively, in Game 5) are superb. The Knicks,
moreover, shot 54 percent in the second half of the last game, and
still lost!
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so evenly matched,'' said Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks
coach. ``We've got good players, good character and both teams want
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams want to win so badly that Patrick Ewing, bad back,
aging knees and sometimes suspect ego, is willing himself to battle
with heart-rending vigor. And both teams want to win with such lust
that Tim Hardaway, who is playing on a left foot that makes him
wince with pain when he cuts, is driving to the hoop and opening up
generous scoring opportunities for his team. (And, as a side
virtue, also allows the substitute point guard, young Anthony
Carter, to play with more confidence).
</P>
<P>
   Some, even like Van Gundy, may complain about the paucity of
Knicks rebounding. But Miami is a taller team, and, except for the
too frequent vanishing trick of Marcus Camby, is scrambling for the
ricochets. Van Gundy, in his heart, understands. And the thing
always to expect when these two teams meet in the playoffs is the
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   One day the Heat shoots free throws as though aiming at a moving
target. Then Carter, a refugee from the Atlanta playgrounds, hits a
game-winner that soars from behind the basket, the ball looking,
for a moment, like it was a bag of peanuts flung from a vendor in
the nearby aisle. Then Charlie Ward woke up the other morning and
thought he was Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the middle of this thing,'' said Sprewell,
``it's hard to appreciate it like a fan. But, as a player, this
kind of hard fighting is fun. It's what you dream about as a kid in
the playgrounds. It's exciting to compete on this level. In the
playoffs the stakes are higher than the regular season, every play
is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, meanwhile, had his car destroyed when a large amount
of thrust emitted from one engine of the private plane carrying the
team from Miami to Westchester and lifted his Honda Civic and
caused it to roll over several staff and player cars. How did he
feel? ``Who cares,'' he said. ``We lost. If we had won, I'd have
been happy to walk back from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about playoff intensity.

 BIKE MESSENGERS WHEEL AND DEAL FOR UNION VICTORY  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco bike messengers, who have long
complained of hard work, low pay and scant benefits, scored a rare
win this week as workers at one delivery company agreed to the
first union contract in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than deal with a unionized workforce of 38
messengers, that company, UltraEx, said Thursday that it will
respond by selling off its San Francisco operation to local
managers.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how these moves will affect efforts to unionize the
Bay Area's courier services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' said Howard Williams, an UltraEx messenger
and former president of the San Francisco Bike Messenger
Association. ``We hope it will advance things in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Other couriers watched closely as UltraEx bargained with union
representatives for nearly nine months in what both sides termed
``very tough'' negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Pecker, an International Longshore and Warehouse Union
agent who led the talks on behalf of messengers, said he is
confident that other couriers will now feel emboldened to seek
union representation.
</P>
<P>
   But Sal Grassia, chief executive officer of UltraEx, said owners
of other firms will similarly resist unionization. ``They're very
concerned about this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UltraEx workers voted 22 to 1 to ratify a union contract _ the
first time a San Francisco messenger company has done so since the
Teamsters briefly represented workers at a now-defunct service in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The contract takes effect June 1.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ILWU, UltraEx bike messengers will see
commissions for each delivery rise from about 38 percent of each
bill to 40.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foot messengers will see raises of between 80 cents and $1.50 an
hour, while drivers will be guaranteed 41 percent commissions. All
messengers will receive printouts of delivery bills so they can
verify their commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bike couriers will receive $7 a day to maintain their equipment,
and drivers will be reimbursed for parking, bridge tolls and
mileage.
</P>
<P>
   UltraEx also agreed to give messengers a floating holiday each
year and to include domestic partners in employee health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a first contract, that's a big milestone,'' said
Peter Olney, ILWU's director of organizing. ``We're already
actively organizing at other companies.''
</P>
<P>
   However, industry sources said it won't be easy to bring other
companies into the union fold. While San Francisco's bike
messengers have been most vocal about the need for representation,
they represent only about 15 percent of the courier business.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BIKERS19 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Vehicle drivers comprise the majority of messengers, and they
have been less eager to confront employers through collective
bargaining. That's because the drivers make more money than their
cycling counterparts due to the longer distances traveled and
larger delivery bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to prove to the rest of the industry that we can
be a viable, union-organized company,'' UltraEx's Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But Grassia, the company's CEO, described his employees' embrace
of the ILWU as an act of ``betrayal and disrespect,'' and said
UltraEx had already provided workers with ``one of the best
benefits packages in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The average messenger at UltraEx is making $14 an hour,'' he
said. ``That's a lot of money. We're not talking about skilled
labor here. We're not talking about computer wizards.''
</P>
<P>
   The average messenger, who must bring an array of skills to
traversing frequently hostile terrain in the shortest possible
time, might dispute that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Grassia said the only thing that UltraEx employees have
gotten for their trouble is ``monthly dues and another layer of
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while UltraEx will still operate in San Francisco,
its union-represented messengers will belong to a new company, to
be called Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ILWU officials said they are hopeful that an outfit called
Professional Messenger will be the next courier service to seek a
union contract and are looking as well at DMS Corp., where
messengers staged a weeklong strike for higher wages in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more strikes,'' the union's Olney predicted.
``The strike is once again our friend.''

 FIBER-OPTICS EXECUTIVE OPTS TO RETIRE  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ JDS Uniphase chief executive Kevin Kalkhoven
abruptly retired Thursday, saying he was burnt out from putting in
years of 100-hour weeks at the San Jose fiber-optics parts maker,
which has quietly become one of the heftiest tech companies in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been nine years of high-intensity activity (and) it
has been a fairly stressful environment,'' Kalkhoven, 55, said in a
conference call with analysts, adding that he has spent only about
six full weekends at home on the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Kalkhoven, a veteran computer company executive who grew up in
Australia and England, said his doctor advised him to take a
medical leave because of his high blood pressure, but he decided to
step aside instead. He said he plans to remain with JDS as a
part-time consultant, but will also start a venture-capital fund to
invest in communications startups and work with some private
endowments and trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Jozef Straus, 53, who has already been running the company's
day-to-day operations as president and co-chairman, will take
Kalkhoven's place as chief executive. Charles Abbe, the company's
senior operating officer, was promoted to president and chief
operating officer. JDS Uniphase shares, which have soared more than
fivefold over the past 12 months, slipped $5.96, to $86.56,
yesterday on concerns about the management change.
</P>
<P>
   But Straus, known for sporting a beret, also has a strong track
record in the industry, analysts pointed out. Straus co-founded and
ran JDS Fitel, the Canadian fiber-optics components manufacturer
that San Jose's Uniphase merged with last year. JDS Fitel had
revenues of $227 million for fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jozef Straus has a proven track record of being able to build
a big, strong optics company,'' said PaineWebber analyst David
Wong. ``The new regime will be just as good as the old regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Straus said he plans to remain in Ottawa, but executives said
the company will keep its second headquarters in San Jose. ``I will
be moving on planes left and right,'' Straus said during the call.
</P>
<P>
   The change comes at a time when JDS and other fiber-optics
components-makers are struggling to keep up with demand from
telecommunications equipment-makers like Nortel Networks and Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel and Lucent's customers, phone companies and Internet
service providers, are rapidly bolstering their networks by using
packets of light instead of electrons to move mountains of data at
lightning speeds. JDS has ridden that wave.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had only about 1,000 workers a year ago, now
claims 13,100 employees and a stock market value of $70 billion,
slightly behind Yahoo's $72 billion, but well ahead of better-known
local brands like the Gap, Wells Fargo and eBay.
</P>
<P>
   And Chief Financial Officer Anthony Muller said there's no sign
of a slowdown. He predicted sales will jump 80 percent during the
next quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, up from the
75 percent growth forecast just a month ago. JDS is the largest
independent maker of fiber-optics components, including tiny lasers
smaller than the tip of a ballpoint pen, used to make optical
networks.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the company agreed to spend $15 billion buying E-Tek
Dynamics, another fiber-optics partsmaker in San Jose. Although the
deal is undergoing heavy scrutiny by the U.S. Justice Department,
Kalkhoven said he is optimistic it will go through.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Kalkhoven, who spends his free time piloting a
small jet and skiing, said he is looking forward to some rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to take some time to get what's left of this body
in some shape that vaguely resembles humanity,'' he said.

 BATTLE AGAINST H-1B VISA INCREASE IS UNDERWHELMING  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the effort to lift the cap on H-1B
visas has been an emotionally charged issue for some computer
professionals, the political battle against the legislation has
been pitifully small, loosely organized and largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the supporters of the bills have waged an
aggressive campaign, with lobbyists representing all of the
nation's major tech companies and millions of dollars in political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disorganized,'' admitted Terry Oldberg, chair of
the Bay Area chapter of the Programmer's Guild, a group
representing software workers.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that tech workers have been outgunned by the
high-tech industry on this issue, said Claude Barfield, an
economist for a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank called
the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't belong to a union. There's no association of
workers or professional association (in Washington) that have taken
it up,'' Barfield said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tech professionals are represented by only a handful of
organizations, including the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, Programmer's Guild and American Engineering
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying efforts of the guild and association have been
hampered by their small size and limited funds. Both are
encouraging their members to e-mail and call their federal
legislators this week, but neither has planned any formal protests.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the IEEE, the largest organization of computer
professionals, put its weight behind opposing a raise in the H-1B
cap.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the group has concentrated its efforts in advocating
that the H-1B program be replaced by a program that would make it
easier for workers to get ``conditional green cards.'' However,
that effort failed to get much notice and is not supported by any
legislation in Congress, IEEE spokesman Paul Donnelly acknowledged
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Davis professor and anti-H-1B
crusader Norman Matloff said the mobilization efforts against
raising the H-1B visa cap have been hampered by ``ignorance and
apathy'' among computer professionals. ``The vast majority of them
are not even aware that there is legislation pending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, one of the most active groups against raising the H-1B
cap has been an anti-immigration organization, Washington D.C.'s
Federation for American Immigration Reform.
</P>
<P>
   That group has spent an estimated $500,000 to $700,000 on local
television commercials in the district of Sen. Spencer Abraham,
R-Mich., attacking his proposal to increase the yearly visa limit
from the current 115,000 to 195,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO has spoken out against raising the quota,
it has focused its efforts on attaching provisions to the
legislation that would protect U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   One professional organization that has made an effort to fight
the legislation is the Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon
Valley, a group representing African American professionals in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the coalition placed an ad in Roll Call, the
newspaper that chronicles congressional actions, criticizing the
plans to raise the quota and complaining that an amendment that
would encourage companies to try harder to recruit African American
candidates before seeking H-1B workers was not included.

LACK OF BODY WAS NO BARRIER, JURORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KIMES-TRIAL) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no body, no eyewitness to an attack or even
any evidence of a struggle, yet jurors said it was not difficult
for them to convict a mother-and-son pair of grifters of murdering
a wealthy Manhattan woman.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of five men and seven women took 29 hours over four
days to reach a verdict, but there was no real dissension over the
charges of second-degree murder against the pair, Sante and Kenneth
Kimes, jurors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One juror had momentary qualms about the lack of a body during
the deliberations, said Michael Alvarez, a juror. But that juror
and the others quickly decided that the Kimeses had killed the
woman, Irene Silverman, 82, Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Manhattan courtroom after the verdict was read
Thursday, jurors said it should not come as any surprise that the
lack of a body did not present much of a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   Before testimony began, Justice Rena K. Uviller of state Supreme
Court and prosecutors had carefully dismissed from the panel all
prospective jurors who said they could not convict the Kimeses on
circumstantial evidence alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it seemed obvious,'' said Alvarez, an alternate juror
who was put on the panel on Monday, the day deliberations began.
``I wasn't sure about the others; I thought it might take longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The four jurors who gave interviews after the verdict said they
agreed with the prosecutors that notebooks made by the Kimeses
outlined their scheme to steal Silverman's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the pieces together with the notebooks,'' said Robert
Hernandez, a juror and Bell Atlantic technician. ``Everything that
was said in the case by the prosecutors was backed up by the
notebooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The notebooks contained lists of information to gather on
Silverman and equipment to buy, like leg irons and a stun gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was other evidence, but the notebooks played a great
part,'' said Ernestine Bridges, another juror.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to testimony for more than three months, the
jurors had become familiar with the Kimeses. Alvarez said that when
the trial began he was made uneasy by Sante Kimes' hard glare at
him and his fellow jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really staring at us,'' he said. ``In the beginning it
was uncomfortable. But after a while it didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors who spoke Thursday said they believed that Sante
Kimes, 65, controlled her 25-year-old son. Jurors said they saw her
as overprotective and demanding of Kenneth. ``I felt a little sorry
for him; he's a young guy, and he was doing what his mother told
him,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, who asked that his name not be used, said Kenneth
Kimes was in a difficult position. ``When your mother tells you to
do something, you do it,'' he said. ``But he's an adult, and he is
responsible for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said they were puzzled by the unusual relationship
between Sante and Kenneth Kimes. Alvarez said he was surprised by
some of the details that emerged in the trial, including testimony
that the mother and son shared a bed.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said the three-month trial was grueling, requiring them
to put their lives on hold, delay honeymoons, take leaves from work
and miss family engagements. ``I am truly exhausted,'' Bridges
said.

`PEGASUS' NOT YET READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Despite his trainer's best efforts, all eyes fell on
Fusaichi Pegasus Thursday as the Kentucky Derby winner stretched
his legs at Pimlico Race Course and cantered on the track in his
first exercise for Saturday's Preakness Stakes. The trainer, Neil
Drysdale, shielding his star right up to the starting gate, even
said he would saddle Fusaichi Pegasus in the inside paddock before
the race to avoid the crowd in the outside saddling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus has had a history of balky and unpredictable
behavior, although he comported himself with professional calm in
the Derby. Still, Drysdale was taking no chances. He elected to
avoid the Preakness Barn behind the grandstand where his horse's
seven rivals are stabled, and instead chose to keep him in Barn 7,
across the track on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, a cultivated Englishman and a man of few words,
reported that he had studied tapes of the Derby extensively and
agreed that Pegasus ``did have a very clean trip.'' When he was
asked if he was concerned that the other jockeys would try to make
things more difficult for his horse, he replied: ``No.'' Why?
``Because he's got an outside post.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus drew the No. 7 post in a field of eight, and
was made the 3-5 favorite. His trainer suggested that he should be
closer to the lead than in the Derby, where he was 15th rounding
the first turn. But was he confident?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never confident,'' Drysdale replied. ``I might be
optimistic, but not confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, the last horse to arrive at Pimlico for the
Preakness, made it in at 9:15 a.m. Thursday after a van trip from
Belmont Park in New York that started at 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The colt, third in the Arkansas Derby and third in the Kentucky
Derby, had an uneventful trip. His trainer, Todd Pletcher, who
started four horses in the Kentucky Derby, arrived Thursday
afternoon from Ocala, Fla., to tend his one horse in this race.
</P>
<P>
   One new story line involves Snuck In, second in the Arkansas
Derby, who is trained by Steve Asmussen and will be ridden by the
trainer's brother, Cash Asmussen, a top jockey in Europe for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash will be flying in from France later today,'' Steve said
Thursday morning. ``This will be my first starter in a Triple Crown
race, and it's great my brother can ride him. He rode one of my
first winners when I started training about 12 years ago.''

 U.S. TECHIES COMPLAIN THEY'RE IGNORED BY INDUSTRY LEADERS  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When he got his degree in computer science from
the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1997, Don Harlor
thought he could write his own ticket in Silicon Valley's booming
job market.
</P>
<P>
   But after three years of sending out resumes, relentlessly
networking, attending job fairs and going through two to three
interviews a month, Harlor is working as a census taker to keep
himself occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Although he hasn't given up his dreams of landing a job in
software quality assurance, Harlor realizes that at 56, he's
fighting an uphill battle in an industry that puts a premium on
younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   That point was brought home recently when he walked into an
Internet startup for an interview. The young receptionist asked,
``Who are you?'' as if he couldn't possibly be the young job
applicant she was expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Age discrimination has always been acknowledged by many as a
part of Silicon Valley's culture. Just last week, a 55-year-old
former manager sued Oracle for age discrimination after he lost his
job in February.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Harlor and other older techies face further frustration: As
they struggle to find work, the very industry that keeps rejecting
them is lobbying Congress to vastly increase the number of foreign
professionals who can work in the United States using H-1B visas
each year.
</P>
<P>
   With support from the president and both political parties,
legislation that would double, or remove limitations on, the number
of such workers is virtually assured to pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill that
would allow U.S. companies to hire an unlimited number of highly
skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to raise the quota rests on the belief that
practically all of America's high-tech workers are already employed
and companies must turn to overseas workers to fill open positions.
</P>
<P>
   But groups representing computer workers like Harlor dispute
that belief. In August, John Miano, chairman of the American
Programmers Guild, testified before Congress that the often-quoted
studies ``proving'' the shortage of tech workers are false reports,
bankrolled by a greedy IT industry interested in exploiting cheap
foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
   There is some substance to their contentions. Some surveys
reporting talent shortages are funded by the high-tech industry.
For example, the Information Technology Association of America
released a survey in March saying that the IT industry would create
1.6 million jobs in the next year, and half would go unfilled. The
survey was sponsored by Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle and other tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that Senate
Republicans had been pressuring computer companies to donate
generously to an outside group supporting Michigan Sen. Spencer
Abraham and his bill to raise the yearly H-1B quota to 195,000.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Davis computer science Professor
Norman Matloff is perhaps the most vocal critic of raising the H-1B
cap. He argues that tech companies could not possibly be desperate
for new talent, because most accept a tiny fraction of their job
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Even large tech companies acknowledge that they are highly
selective in their hiring. ``We receive 20,000 resumes a month; we
hire a thousand,'' Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers said
in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, companies say the problem is that most applicants
don't have experience in the exact skills they need at the time.
Fine, say Matloff and other tech workers' advocates, then the
companies should hire smart workers and let them learn on the job.
Matloff claims companies are not willing to train workers on the
job. The companies are in too much of a hurry to make use of the
talent that's available to them, said Bill Payson, the head of
SeniorTechs, an employment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shortage of ready-made techies,'' he said. ``What
they really want is somebody who's been doing exactly what they're
looking for as recently as yesterday, available tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Payson insists the real reason the tech companies are using the
labor shortage argument is to save money by hiring foreign
nationals at lower salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the law governing the H-1B visa program requires
employers to pay their H-1B workers the going rate. That rule is
easy to get around, and some employers just ignore it, Matloff
said. The legislation now in the House would require an H-1B worker
to be paid at least $40,000 _ hardly a competitive wage in Silicon
Valley, where computer workers routinely double that.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley headhunter Linda Tuerk said that in her
experience, employers are saving a lot of money by hiring H-1B
workers, no matter what the rules say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are firing older, more-expensive workers _ people
making 80 grand _ and they can turn right around and hire two
people right off the plane for 45 grand each,'' Tuerk said.
</P>
<P>
   Payson has 12,000 reasons to believe that there's no huge talent
shortage in IT. That's the number of unemployed and under-employed,
experienced technology workers listed in the database of his
employment firm. Most are over 50, although Payson has been getting
more interest from professionals in their 40s who feel they are
already experiencing age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success rate is minimal. One out of 10 employers (who
clients visit) hire somebody,'' Payson said.
</P>
<P>
   To some older techies, what hurts most is the feeling that
Congress is changing the rules for their industry alone. According
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 70 percent of H-1B
visas go to computer industry workers, 53 percent of whom are
involved in creating software.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it seems inevitable that Congress will pass some
form of legislation from the bills being considered and that the IT
industry will be hosting a larger pool of foreign professionals in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   What is a 45-or-older programmer to do in the face of that
heightened competition?
</P>
<P>
   Matloff contends that any amount of retraining doesn't help
older workers, because employers just don't want them. But Payson,
whose SeniorTechs business has a partnership with online course
provider SmartForce, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older techies have tended not to keep up with their skills,''
Payson said. ``The old-timers are going to have to get a lot more
aggressive in retraining and looking for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   With a powerful lobby and support from both political parties,
high tech is holding all the cards now. But Payson believes a
political change is on its way because ``more and more voters are
over 50.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harlor, however, political change may come too late. A
former field service engineer, he updated his skills by getting a
degree in computer science, and last year he received a certificate
in software quality assurance. He has even tried to get
internships, just to get his foot in the door. Nothing has worked.
</P>
<P>
   When his census-taking job ends, he's not sure of his employment
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have been talking about retirement,'' he said.
``She said since I've been in forced retirement, why not go ahead
and just say it is retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But even at 56, Harlor is thinking of looking for a different
career altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wasn't thinking about retiring until I was in my
70s,'' he said.

 RAISE OFFER TO JANITORS IS HALF OF REQUEST  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 12 contractors that employ the unionized
janitors on the Peninsula and in the East Bay are willing to pay
for raises totaling $1.60 per hour during the next five years,
according to a union spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Announced in private negotiations on May 12, but made public
Thursday, the offer would come as a 40-cent raise in the first year
and 30-cent raises in each of the following four years.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors also proposed introducing a two-tier system that
would exclude from the wage increases new janitors who work in
buildings smaller than 200,000 square feet, union leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is less than half as much as the janitors had
proposed. The union will make a counteroffer in coming meetings,
said union analyst Isobel White.
</P>
<P>
   Most union janitors in the area represented by Service Employees
International Local 1877 now earn $8.04 an hour. The union and
contractors have been negotiating since March 16 for a new contract
that would take effect when the current contract expires May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The raises _ for about 5,000 area janitors _ would cost $61
million during the contract period, according to the contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though similar janitorial negotiations in San Diego and Los
Angeles recently resulted in strikes, the Greater San Francisco Bay
Area Maintenance Contractors remain optimistic in reaching a
peaceful, though costly, settlement with their employees,'' the
contractors said in a statement released by their negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the janitorial contractors did not return
phone calls yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The union had also proposed that employers take over workers'
payments for their family health benefit plan, which recently
increased to as much as $80 a month from about $30. White said the
union was disappointed that the contractors' proposal did not
address that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're giving us a wage increase that they know very well
will be eaten away by the increase in our health benefit costs,''
White said.

Nations has suspended food deliveries in the area. Yirgalem Abraha,
a 20-year-old Ethiopian woman who has lived for two years in one of
the camps for the displaced, says she did not receive food this
month and has thus begun to sell coffee and tea in front of her
hut. She is not sure how she will feed herself if the fighting goes

 RAISE OFFER TO JANITORS IS HALF OF REQUEST  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 12 contractors that employ the unionized
janitors on the Peninsula and in the East Bay are willing to pay
for raises totaling $1.60 per hour during the next five years,
according to a union spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Announced in private negotiations on May 12, but made public
Thursday, the offer would come as a 40-cent raise in the first year
and 30-cent raises in each of the following four years.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors also proposed introducing a two-tier system that
would exclude from the wage increases new janitors who work in
buildings smaller than 200,000 square feet, union leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is less than half as much as the janitors had
proposed. The union will make a counteroffer in coming meetings,
said union analyst Isobel White.
</P>
<P>
   Most union janitors in the area represented by Service Employees
International Local 1877 now earn $8.04 an hour. The union and
contractors have been negotiating since March 16 for a new contract
that would take effect when the current contract expires May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The raises _ for about 5,000 area janitors _ would cost $61
million during the contract period, according to the contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though similar janitorial negotiations in San Diego and Los
Angeles recently resulted in strikes, the Greater San Francisco Bay
Area Maintenance Contractors remain optimistic in reaching a
peaceful, though costly, settlement with their employees,'' the
contractors said in a statement released by their negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the janitorial contractors did not return
phone calls yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The union had also proposed that employers take over workers'
payments for their family health benefit plan, which recently
increased to as much as $80 a month from about $30. White said the
union was disappointed that the contractors' proposal did not
address that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're giving us a wage increase that they know very well
will be eaten away by the increase in our health benefit costs,''
White said.

HEALTH CARE COMPANY AGREES TO SETTLE FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas)   (SUBS 17th graf to correct reference to Olsten Kimberly) 
By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the nation's largest health
care company, has agreed in principle to pay $745 million in civil
penalties to resolve a portion of the government's inquiry into
whether its success was achieved in part by cheating federal health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, if ultimately approved, will be by far the
largest health care fraud settlement ever obtained by the Justice
Department, exceeding the next highest by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal announced Thursday does not bring an end to the
sprawling investigations into the health care company, some of
which have lasted more than seven years. Criminal and other civil
investigations into some of the company's business practices remain
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement addresses civil allegations that the company
fraudulently increased patient billings to the government from its
hospitals and home health care businesses, as well as charging for
unnecessary laboratory tests. The allegations that remain
unresolved have long been at the heart of the case: whether
Columbia hospitals fraudulently overstated their expenses to
increase reimbursement from federal health programs and engaged in
illegal financial relationships with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's deal included an unusual structure that will
put immense pressure on both Columbia and the government to resolve
the entire case before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the criminal cases against
Columbia must be settled by Dec. 31. If that does not happen _ or
if the government does not grant certain extensions for
negotiations _ Columbia can withdraw the settlement offer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the two sides do not resolve the criminal
case this year, the government stands to lose hundreds of millions
of dollars, while Columbia would return to square one in the
negotiating process _ or be on its way to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an elegantly crafted settlement to put the arm on
everybody to get the rest of the deal done,'' said Stephen Meagher,
a lawyer who represents some of the people who first brought
allegations of fraud at Columbia to the government's attention.
``It's a settlement time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a statement Thursday acknowledging
generally that a tentative agreement had been reached with Columbia
on certain issues. Officials declined to comment further, as did
Michael Chertoff, a lead lawyer in Columbia's defense efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Campbell, a senior Columbia executive, said that the
company had hoped to resolve the entire case but that both sides
had decided to announce the progress so far. ``Our goal had been to
get a total global settlement,'' he said. ``But we were at a point
in time on three areas where we felt we could get a settlement and
thought we should proceed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, the largest health care fraud settlement was for
$486 million, by Fresenius Medical Care AG, the nation's largest
provider of dialysis services. The settlement, which was announced
in January, involved allegations of fraud at National Medical Care,
a dialysis provider that was being investigated by the government
when it was bought by Fresenius in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The three areas covered by the tentative settlement with
Columbia all involve technical financial issues that the government
contends resulted in overpayments to Columbia by federal health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those areas involves a practice known as upcoding,
in which hospitals receive larger payments from Medicare by
inflating the seriousness of illnesses they treat. A 1997 computer
analysis by The New York Times of more than 30 million billing
records found that many Columbia hospitals billed Medicare for
high-paying treatments far more often than competing hospitals
serving similar populations. Federal authorities at the time called
such findings an indication of possible overbilling.
</P>
<P>
   The second portion of the settlement addressed allegations of
fraud in Columbia's laboratories. In this area, Columbia is facing
allegations that have been made against several other health care
companies. Over the last decade, these other companies have settled
charges that they improperly ``bundled'' additional and unnecessary
diagnostic analysis onto simple blood tests _ in the end billing
the government for the unneeded tests.
</P>
<P>
   The last area of the settlement, involving Columbia's home
health care business, is the most complex. Home care reimbursement
from the government is based on expenses reported to federal health
authorities in documents called cost reports. But the government
has contended that Columbia fraudulently added improper expenses
onto the home-care business to increase reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   This settlement, according to the company, would resolve
allegations that Columbia's home care business reported expenses
for marketing in its cost reports as being for community education
_ a shift that, through the federal formula, would result in higher
reimbursements to the home-care business.
</P>
<P>
   The home care settlement would also resolve allegations that a
series of 1994 transactions between Columbia and a home care
manager, then known as the Olsten Kimberly, had been improperly
structured to maximize management fees to Olsten _ which the
government would partly reimburse _ and minimize other expenses
that brought less, if any, reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the home care settlement would resolve allegations that
Columbia fraudulently billed for services to patients who did not
qualify for such care.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long expected that one portion of the
investigation that now remains unresolved could cost Columbia
hundreds of millions of dollars alone. That portion, involving
cost-reporting fraud by the company's hospitals, has already led to
criminal convictions of executives at one Columbia hospital in
Florida. Campbell of Columbia declined to discuss whether the
company had any projections for the ultimate cost of settling all
of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement served as a final denouement for Richard
L. Scott, the former chairman of Columbia who was once celebrated
as a visionary reformer of the hospital industry, but who was
ultimately forced to resign under pressure as allegations of
wrongdoing at his company mounted.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a decade, Scott had built a company he founded with
two small hospitals in El Paso, Texas, into the world's largest
health care company _ a $20 billion giant with about 350 hospitals,
550 home health care offices and scores of other medical businesses
in 38 states.
</P>
<P>
   The company held itself out as a model for the increasingly
cost-conscious world of health care, applying the competitive
practices of corporate America to an industry still dominated by
nonprofit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1997, Scott's dream was unraveling. In July of that year,
law enforcement agents raided Columbia offices and hospitals in
seven states, seizing documents related to business practices.
Scott played down the action, saying that investigations were
common in health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's board saw it differently. In a matter of
weeks, Scott was pushed to resigned. He was replaced by Dr. Thomas
F. Frist Jr., a co-founder of the Hospital Corporation of America,
the granddaddy of the profit-making hospital corporations, which
Columbia acquired in 1994.

DESPITE U.S., WORLD BANK APPROVES IRAN LOANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the objections of the United States, the World
Bank on Thursday approved its first loans to Iran in seven years:
$232 million for a sewage-treatment project in Tehran and for
improvements in health care.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote by the 24-member executive board of the bank, its
chairman, James D. Wolfensohn, said future loans would depend on
the progress of reforms in Iran. Wolfensohn said that the United
States had voted against the loans and that Canada and France had
abstained. The chairman said several board members who voted for
the loans had expressed concern ``that their support of these
projects not be construed as support for current events.'' That was
a reference to the closed-door trial in Iran of 13 Jewish men on
espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also opposed the loans because Iran is on the
State Department list of countries suspected of sponsoring
terrorism. Washington managed to postpone the vote two times and
had hoped to do so again while the trial is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, issued a statement on Wednesday anticipating the vote
and condemning it. ``I believe all Americans should be offended,''
Helms said. ``Do voting members of the World Bank believe that as a
kangaroo court in Iran continues its relentless persecution of 13
Iranian Jews we should continue business as usual?''
</P>
<P>
   World Bank officials said the loans would better the lives of
ordinary Iranians, including women and children in poor families,
while furthering the reform efforts of President Mohammad-Reza
Khatami. Moderate allies of Khatami fared well in recent
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been in a difficult position regarding
Iran, on the one hand holding fast to its anti-terrorism principles
and objecting to the closed trial while trying to improve relations
with the Iranian people and their government.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the United States has eased some economic
sanctions against Iran. In a major policy speech in March,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged that the United
States bore some responsibility for the hostility between the
countries. As for the Iranian people, she said, ``the United States
bears them no ill will.''

 BIKE MESSENGERS WHEEL AND DEAL FOR UNION VICTORY  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco bike messengers, who have long
complained of hard work, low pay and scant benefits, scored a rare
win this week as workers at one delivery company agreed to the
first union contract in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than deal with a unionized workforce of 38
messengers, that company, UltraEx, said Thursday that it will
respond by selling off its San Francisco operation to local
managers.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how these moves will affect efforts to unionize the
Bay Area's courier services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' said Howard Williams, an UltraEx messenger
and former president of the San Francisco Bike Messenger
Association. ``We hope it will advance things in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Other couriers watched closely as UltraEx bargained with union
representatives for nearly nine months in what both sides termed
``very tough'' negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Pecker, an International Longshore and Warehouse Union
agent who led the talks on behalf of messengers, said he is
confident that other couriers will now feel emboldened to seek
union representation.
</P>
<P>
   But Sal Grassia, chief executive officer of UltraEx, said owners
of other firms will similarly resist unionization. ``They're very
concerned about this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UltraEx workers voted 22 to 1 to ratify a union contract _ the
first time a San Francisco messenger company has done so since the
Teamsters briefly represented workers at a now-defunct service in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The contract takes effect June 1.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ILWU, UltraEx bike messengers will see
commissions for each delivery rise from about 38 percent of each
bill to 40.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foot messengers will see raises of between 80 cents and $1.50 an
hour, while drivers will be guaranteed 41 percent commissions. All
messengers will receive printouts of delivery bills so they can
verify their commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bike couriers will receive $7 a day to maintain their equipment,
and drivers will be reimbursed for parking, bridge tolls and
mileage.
</P>
<P>
   UltraEx also agreed to give messengers a floating holiday each
year and to include domestic partners in employee health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a first contract, that's a big milestone,'' said
Peter Olney, ILWU's director of organizing. ``We're already
actively organizing at other companies.''
</P>
<P>
   However, industry sources said it won't be easy to bring other
companies into the union fold. While San Francisco's bike
messengers have been most vocal about the need for representation,
they represent only about 15 percent of the courier business.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BIKERS19 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Vehicle drivers comprise the majority of messengers, and they
have been less eager to confront employers through collective
bargaining. That's because the drivers make more money than their
cycling counterparts due to the longer distances traveled and
larger delivery bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to prove to the rest of the industry that we can
be a viable, union-organized company,'' UltraEx's Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But Grassia, the company's CEO, described his employees' embrace
of the ILWU as an act of ``betrayal and disrespect,'' and said
UltraEx had already provided workers with ``one of the best
benefits packages in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The average messenger at UltraEx is making $14 an hour,'' he
said. ``That's a lot of money. We're not talking about skilled
labor here. We're not talking about computer wizards.''
</P>
<P>
   The average messenger, who must bring an array of skills to
traversing frequently hostile terrain in the shortest possible
time, might dispute that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Grassia said the only thing that UltraEx employees have
gotten for their trouble is ``monthly dues and another layer of
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while UltraEx will still operate in San Francisco,
its union-represented messengers will belong to a new company, to
be called Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ILWU officials said they are hopeful that an outfit called
Professional Messenger will be the next courier service to seek a
union contract and are looking as well at DMS Corp., where
messengers staged a weeklong strike for higher wages in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more strikes,'' the union's Olney predicted.
``The strike is once again our friend.''

 BATTLE AGAINST H-1B VISA INCREASE IS UNDERWHELMING  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the effort to lift the cap on H-1B
visas has been an emotionally charged issue for some computer
professionals, the political battle against the legislation has
been pitifully small, loosely organized and largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the supporters of the bills have waged an
aggressive campaign, with lobbyists representing all of the
nation's major tech companies and millions of dollars in political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disorganized,'' admitted Terry Oldberg, chair of
the Bay Area chapter of the Programmer's Guild, a group
representing software workers.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that tech workers have been outgunned by the
high-tech industry on this issue, said Claude Barfield, an
economist for a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank called
the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't belong to a union. There's no association of
workers or professional association (in Washington) that have taken
it up,'' Barfield said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tech professionals are represented by only a handful of
organizations, including the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, Programmer's Guild and American Engineering
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying efforts of the guild and association have been
hampered by their small size and limited funds. Both are
encouraging their members to e-mail and call their federal
legislators this week, but neither has planned any formal protests.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the IEEE, the largest organization of computer
professionals, put its weight behind opposing a raise in the H-1B
cap.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the group has concentrated its efforts in advocating
that the H-1B program be replaced by a program that would make it
easier for workers to get ``conditional green cards.'' However,
that effort failed to get much notice and is not supported by any
legislation in Congress, IEEE spokesman Paul Donnelly acknowledged
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Davis professor and anti-H-1B
crusader Norman Matloff said the mobilization efforts against
raising the H-1B visa cap have been hampered by ``ignorance and
apathy'' among computer professionals. ``The vast majority of them
are not even aware that there is legislation pending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, one of the most active groups against raising the H-1B
cap has been an anti-immigration organization, Washington D.C.'s
Federation for American Immigration Reform.
</P>
<P>
   That group has spent an estimated $500,000 to $700,000 on local
television commercials in the district of Sen. Spencer Abraham,
R-Mich., attacking his proposal to increase the yearly visa limit
from the current 115,000 to 195,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO has spoken out against raising the quota,
it has focused its efforts on attaching provisions to the
legislation that would protect U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   One professional organization that has made an effort to fight
the legislation is the Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon
Valley, a group representing African American professionals in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the coalition placed an ad in Roll Call, the
newspaper that chronicles congressional actions, criticizing the
plans to raise the quota and complaining that an amendment that
would encourage companies to try harder to recruit African American
candidates before seeking H-1B workers was not included.

N.Y. ASSEMBLY SPEAKER WINS SUPPORT IN BID TO KEEP HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The speaker of the state Assembly moved swiftly
to put down a revolt within his chamber Thursday, retaliating
against renegade lawmakers and enlisting the support of influential
union officials and party leaders to shore up his power base.
</P>
<P>
   The actions by the speaker, Sheldon Silver, D- Manhattan, came a
day after the second-most-powerful member of the Assembly, Michael
J. Bragman, announced that he would attempt to topple the speaker
in a vote next week. Silver immediately stripped Bragman of his
position as majority leader, cut his $34,500-a-year stipend and had
him locked out of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, a veteran assemblyman from the Syracuse area, is one of
the few Democratic leaders in the Assembly with enough broad-based
support among moderates, conservatives and a handful of liberals to
be seriously considered as a replacement for Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman on Thursday gave no indication that he intended to back
down, insisting that he had amassed enough support to unseat Silver
and, in the process, deprive New York City of the powerful
speaker's office for the first time in a quarter-century. Bragman
also released a strongly worded statement denouncing Silver's
leadership as self-serving, secretive and aloof.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman's maneuvering touched off turmoil within the chamber's
Democratic caucus, as lawmakers representing a broad range of
regional, ethnic and ideological interests jockeyed for the most
favorable position throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was difficult to say who would prevail, in
part because many lawmakers declined to speak openly about where
their loyalties were, for fear of ending up on the losing side when
the tally was finally called. That said, Silver had managed to pick
up the support of key members of the Assembly by day's end,
strongly improving his prospects for survival.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Silver wasted no time in trying to reassert his control over the
chamber's increasingly fractious Democratic majority. He stripped
two lawmakers who sided with Bragman of their leadership titles and
then cut their annual pay by $12,500 each. Silver's surrogates
warned that other members ran the risk of losing their committee
assignments and other valuable perks if they joined the coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the intrigue on Thursday took place within the
Capitol's stone walls. Silver spent much of Wednesday night and
Thursday on the phone reaching out to some of his core supporters _
most notably Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the politically
potent hospital workers' union, and Randi Weingarten, president of
the United Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday afternoon, Rivera offered his support
for Silver, crediting him with pushing several important measures
through the Legislature, including a plan to provide health care
coverage to hundreds of thousands of uninsured New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   He also sharply criticized Bragman and his supporters, saying
their actions hurt Democrats at a crucial moment. He said it was
important that party leaders present a united front in the campaign
to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are baffled by this,'' said Rivera, who is an influential
force within the Democratic Party. ``This smells of the crude
politics of insiders who are more interested in their political
careers than in the public good.''
</P>
<P>
   The toppling of a sitting speaker is a rare event in the
Legislature, and Bragman's threat left the Capitol in a state of
shock and confusion. The anxiety was even expressed by some
Republican leaders of the state Senate, who worried that such
dissension would eventually spread to their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The day was also filled with speculation over what prompted
Bragman to strike now. One theory had it that Silver had weakened
himself politically by attempting to block state Comptroller H.
Carl McCall's unofficial candidacy for governor in 2002 in favor of
Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has built strong support with Democrats across the state,
and many members of the Assembly were angered by Silver's actions.
But Thursday, McCall, along with other Democratic officials,
strenuously denied that gubernatorial politics had anything to do
with the turbulent events of the last 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   McCall also sought to dismiss rumors that he had a role in
trying to topple Silver, rumors that have been fueled by the chilly
relationship between the two men over the years. ``It is not useful
for me to be involved in this in any way,'' he said, adding that
the timing of the coup attempt was bad given the need for Democrats
to unite in the current political season.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely explanation for Bragman's action was the role
played by Thomas J. Manton, the Queens Democratic leader. Manton
has had a long-running feud with Silver, and he recently offered to
deliver the borough's 15 Assembly members to Bragman provided he
moved quickly to topple Silver, according to people involved in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Manton has accused Silver of encouraging Walter F. McCaffrey, a
New York City councilman, to wage a primary challenge against an
incumbent assemblyman, Joseph Crowley of Queens. Crowley is a close
ally of Manton.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Thursday night at the Queens County Democratic
Organization's annual dinner in Queens Village, Manton defended his
role in the coup attempt. ``Sometimes you have to fight the good
fight,'' he said to 400 guests. ``You can't let your members be
abused or not respected. When you are right, you fight. You don't
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bragman and Silver camps spent the day conducting head
counts. Many people expect that Silver will prevail in the end, but
they acknowledged that it was dangerous to dismiss completely
Bragman's chances, however dim.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Silver appeared to be consolidating his hold on the
Assembly by day's end, securing the support of some of the
chamber's most influential members, including Herman D. Farrell
Jr., the Democratic leader in Manhattan; Clarence Norman Jr., the
Democratic leader in Brooklyn; and Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic
leader in the Bronx. The support from these lawmakers strengthened
Silver's chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   A speaker is traditionally chosen by the majority party's
members in an election held behind closed doors at the start of a
newly elected Legislature's two-year term. When a candidate emerges
with a majority _ in this case, 50 of the 98 Democrats _ the full
Assembly is convened and the members of the majority party unite
behind that candidate in a formal vote.

EPA SAYS IT PRESSED 3M FOR ACTION ON SCOTCHGARD CHEMICAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Kan.)  By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that
it had pressed Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing to come up with a
solution after the company's own tests had shown that a chemical
compound used in Scotchgard and an array of household products
could pose a risk to human health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA account differs from that of 3M, which said on Monday
that it had voluntarily decided to stop making the chemical used in
Scotchgard and many other products by the end of the year because
the tests showed that the chemical compounds failed to decompose in
the environment. Officials of 3M say they have no evidence that the
chemicals pose a long-term threat to human health.
</P>
<P>
   While the EPA said it did not see an immediate safety risk for
consumers using products now on the market, agency officials said
they grew concerned about potential long-term health risks to
humans after a 3M study showed that the chemical, perfluorooctanyl
sulfonate, lingered for years in human blood and animal tissue and
that high doses were known to kill laboratory rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results raised a number of concerns,'' said Stephen
Johnson, who works in the office of prevention, pesticides and
toxic substances at the EPA. ``What it suggests to us is that there
are potentially long-term consequences. But we don't have evidence
it is unsafe now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of 3M, however, say they are absolutely confident that
their products are safe, and that there are no long-term
consequences to human health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a health issue now, and it won't be a health
issue,'' said Larry Zobel, the medical director at 3M., which is
based in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the question of whether this builds up in humans, it would
have to be a long time, like hundreds of thousands of years to be a
threat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have praised 3M's decision to stop production of
perfluorooctanyl and related chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is this stuff accumulates, and if it
accumulates in the ecosystem, you have to be worried about that
because it could be trouble,'' said John Doull, a retired professor
of clinical toxicology at the University of Kansas Medical Center
in Kansas City. ``No chemical is totally innocuous, and it seems
inconceivable that anything that accumulates would not eventually
become toxic.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Scotchgard products, the chemical is used as
stain repellant and protective coating on textiles, carpets and
leather, and in paper packing, snack-food bags, pet-food bags,
firefighting foam and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said its decision to press 3M rested on four concerns:
the compound is persistent in the environment; it appears in
wildlife and human tissue around the world; it appears in human
blood samples taken from around the world; and, based on the study
of laboratory rats, it has the potential to harm humans.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said it was first alerted to the study of laboratory
rats shortly after it was conducted in 1998. In that study, male
and female rats were given doses of the chemical and then mated.
When a pregnant rat continued to get regular doses of about 3.2
milligrams per kilogram of body weight, most of the offspring died
within four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that information, we finally talked to 3M and said
that raises a number of concerns. What are you going to do?'' said
Johnson at the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a difference of interpretation, however.
Officials of 3M said the doses given to the rats were extremely
high, but EPA officials said that few other chemicals would have as
severe an effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fairly toxic stuff in rats,'' one EPA official said.
``There's clear evidence it presents a problem in rats.''
</P>
<P>
   But 3M said it had not yet determined the cause of death in the
rats nor how humans or animals ingested the chemicals so that it
appeared in tissue or blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very interesting question,'' Zobel said. ``We can't
say how it gets into anybody's blood.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that uncertainty, and the persistence of the
compound in the environment, 3M said it would do away with the
chemistry by the end of the year. The company said it negotiated
with the EPA but its decision was voluntary and there was never a
discussion of a recall of the products.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA confirmed that the agency had not issued an ultimatum to
3M.
</P>
<P>
   3M, which is the only company known to make perfluorooctanyl,
has been searching for alternatives. But in recent weeks, after the
EPA asked 3M to come up with a solution, the company decided to
discontinue using the chemistry behind most of its Scotchgard
products, which account for about $300 million in sales, or less
than 2 percent of the company's $16 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Since the announcement on Monday, the company's shares have
gained $1.125, closing at $87.0625 Thursday. 3M, which also
produces Post-it notes and Scotch tape, will stop supplying the
chemical to other companies that use it for their products.

 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mother and son described by prosecutors as a
prolific and pitiless con artist team were convicted Thursday of
murdering a wealthy widow as part of an intricate scheme to steal
her Upper East Side town house.
</P>
<P>
   The convictions of the mother and son, Sante and Kenneth Kimes,
was a triumph for Manhattan prosecutors who brought a rare type of
murder case: one in which the body was never found, and one built
entirely on circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors said it was the
first case in New York, and one of only a handful in the nation, in
which murder convictions were won without a body, a witness, a
confession or any forensic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said that the pair's murder of the widow,
Irene Silverman, was just one of a number of crimes they had
committed: By the time the Kimeses arrived in New York in June
1998, they had left behind what investigators described as a huge
mosaic of fraud, theft, arson, identity theft and murder that
stretched from Hawaii to Las Vegas to the Bahamas. They now face a
murder trial in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews and a review of court records revealed a story of a
tyrannical mother and a malleable son caught in a love-hate
relationship, living a life of scams and aliases.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching Thursday's verdict, jurors called the evidence
against the Kimeses overwhelming and said their first vote for a
murder conviction was unanimous even though the body of the victim
has never been found. Silverman was last seen on July 5, 1998, and
the Kimeses were charged with murder in December 1998 in an
indictment that outlined a plot involving disguises, false
identities, tapped telephones, forged deeds, false addresses and
burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors said the most damning pieces of evidence presented by
prosecutors during the three-month trial were 14 notebooks with
detailed lists and notes written by Sante Kimes. Prosecutors
contended that the notes pointed to an elaborate scheme to murder
Silverman and steal her $7.7 million Upper East Side town house.
During the four days of deliberations, the jury said there was no
real dissension on the most serious charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes, 65, blinked, rocked forward slightly and then sat
motionless as the first of a total of 118 guilty verdicts for her
and her son were read aloud in a packed courtroom in the Manhattan
Criminal Courts Building Thursday afternoon. Kenneth Kimes, 25, who
struggled to contain his emotions throughout the trial, winced and
swallowed as the first guilty verdict, on a charge of murder, was
read.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury forewoman continued announcing guilty verdict after
guilty verdict for 20 minutes, Kenneth Kimes turned to his mother,
said ``Mom, it'll be OK,'' then frantically talked with his
lawyers. The Kimeses were found guilty of murder, robbery,
burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession,
forgery and eavesdropping. They both face 25 years to life in
prison on the most serious charge and will be sentenced by Justice
Rena K. Uviller of state Supreme Court on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes' compulsive note-taking, which she continued
throughout the trial, appeared to be her downfall. In the
notebooks, she repeatedly wrote reminders like ``get s.s. No.,''
``get keys,'' ``get signature'' and ``get checks.'' Her lists
included items like: ``when goes to sleep,'' ``blood type,'' ``what
kind of movies does she like?'' ``any exits in her apt.?'' ``is
there a burglar alarm in her apt.'' and ``help there on weekends?''
On another list, she wrote, ``get Lincoln,'' ``practice'' and
``park close,'' references to the Kimeses' plans for murdering
Silverman and disposing of her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept writing `get her Social Security number.' They had
in there, `need Social Security of Silverman','' said Michael
Alvarez, a juror who lives on the Upper East Side and is a
librarian. ``There was a lot of evidence, so for us, it wasn't that
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses' lawyers said they would appeal the verdict, but
their clients' now face trial in Los Angeles in the fatal shooting
of a longtime friend and former business partner of Sante Kimes'
late husband. If convicted in that case, Kenneth Kimes, who is
charged with being the gunman, could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the verdict, a visibly stunned Sante Kimes
called the 118 guilty verdicts a ``temporary setback.'' She
predicted that she would win her appeal and insisted that she and
her son had been framed by police. ``I want to cry out for help to
anyone in the country who believes in justice to help us, help
us,'' she said, as tears welled in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hardy, a defense lawyer in the Silverman case,
complained that a ruling by Uviller prevented Sante Kimes from
taking the witness stand in her own defense. He said that the
ruling would be the main basis for the defense's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made it impossible for her to testify and have the jury
see her testimony as having any integrity,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said the Silverman plot was the culmination of a
wide-ranging crime spree by the pair. In September 1996, the mother
and son fled Nassau, the Bahamas, before the Bahamian authorities
could question them in the disappearance of a banker.
</P>
<P>
   They left the West Coast in April 1998, after killing the
longtime former business partner of Sante Kimes' late husband and
dumping his body near the Los Angeles Airport, prosecutors there
said. In Baton Rouge, La., they bought a $80,000 motor home from a
dealer with a rubber check. The motor home was found abandoned in
Florida. By mid-June, the Kimeses were in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Manhattan, the Kimeses tracked down Silverman, a woman
the pair had heard about at an anti-aging conference in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   When they were arrested in midtown Manhattan shortly after
Silverman's disappearance on an unrelated warrant for passing a bad
$14,000 check in Utah, the Kimeses were carrying Silverman's keys,
passport, Social Security card and bank books. They also had what
prosecutors said was a forged deed selling Silverman's $7.7 million
mansion at 20 E. 65th St. to their off-shore corporation, for only
$395,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alvarez, a man who traveled with the Kimeses to New York,
testified that Kenneth Kimes announced, ``This would be a good
place to hide a body'' while they were driving through New Jersey,
and that the Kimeses wished each other ``good hunting'' when they
entered the city. But the most chilling evidence was the notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's home, which friends said was the center of her life,
now sits empty. Its lone resident is Silverman's longtime
caretaker, Mengistu Melesse, a soft-spoken man whom jurors called
one of their favorite witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman left all of her property, including her town house, to
the Kobe Foundation, a nonprofit charity she established to honor
the work of her mother, an embroiderer, and others in the field.
What will become of the mansion is up to the foundation's board,
according to lawyers administering Silverman's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, one of the jurors, said he was struck by the way
Silverman's employees said she treated them and how they spoke of
her.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hansen, a close friend of Silverman's who was with her on
the night before she disappeared, said she was overwhelmed by the
guilty verdict, but still haunted by the loss of a spirited woman
who rose from a working-class family to become a generous host and
benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's a bittersweet victory. Irene is gone,''
Hansen said in a halting voice. ``Just put a note in there about
how much we all love Irene. She was a remarkable woman.''

EUROPE SUITORS SAID TO HOLD TALKS ON DEAL FOR NABISCO
</HEADLINE>
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Cadbury Schweppes, the big British confectioner and
beverage company, and the French global foods giant Groupe Danone
have held talks about possibly making a combined bid for Nabisco
Holdings, executives close to the negotiations said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have been feeling each other out, according to one
of the executives, but no decision has been made to proceed with a
combined takeover proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that two of Europe's leading food companies are
talking to each other about collaborating to acquire Nabisco's food
business is the latest example of globalization in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It coincides with another big international food takeover
attempt, a $19 billion proposal to buy Bestfoods, the maker of
Hellman's mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter, made by Unilever,
the British-Dutch consumer products giant.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco, the maker of Ritz crackers, Oreos and Grey Poupon
mustard, has effectively put itself up for sale by running an
auction for control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cadbury Schweppes and Danone had made independent bids
during the auction's first round for parts of Nabisco, according to
the executives.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes and Danone are considering joining forces
because it would allow each company to acquire the parts of Nabisco
that strategically fit best.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes is most interested in Nabisco's confectionary
business, including LifeSavers and Breath Savers.
</P>
<P>
   Danone, the world's largest biscuit company but one that is
lacking any major brands in the United States, wants to acquire
Nabisco's cookie and cracker business to add to its biscuit
portfolio, which includes Lu and Britannia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the sum of the parts could improve their
chances,'' said Jaine I. Mehring, an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``But these deals are hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes and Danone would be competing with several
other interested suitors including Philip Morris, which owns Kraft,
and the financier Carl C. Icahn, who said last week that he would
be willing to pay about $22 a share or $6.5 billion for the Nabisco
Group, which owns 80.6 percent of Nabisco Holdings. Analysts have
said the company could be sold for more than twice that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Nabisco Group is the remnant of what was once RJR Nabisco
and retains certain liabilities from its tobacco days. The prospect
of continuing litigation has depressed its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Steven F. Goldstone, the company's chairman,
announced that he was breaking up RJR Nabisco, which was once the
object of a fierce takeover battle that symbolized Wall Street's
excesses in the 1980s. He sold the R.J. Reynolds' international
tobacco division for $8 billion to Japan Tobacco, spun off the
domestic tobacco business as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, and left
Nabisco shares in what was renamed the Nabisco Group.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Icahn, who has tried unsuccessfully to buy RJR
Nabisco four times, argued that the food business would still be
subject to tobacco-lawsuit liability and that it made more sense to
spin off the food business and leave the tobacco company as part of
the Nabisco Group.

BUSH'S ADMAN-IN-CHIEF SAYS DO NOT BE FOOLED BY NICE-GUY REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The words echo across the highly suspect
political road of good intentions. ``We're not going to run that
kind of race,'' insisted Stuart Stevens, one of Gov. George W.
Bush's advertising men. ``Tonally, we will run another kind of
race.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore campaign does get vicious, the Bush men say, it
won't be because the mud was slung first from Austin. ``They're
planning on running a mean, nasty, negative race,'' said Stevens'
colleague, Russell Schriefer.
</P>
<P>
   That view was repeated in the agency's headquarters here as if
it were a mantra: ``Gore has always run negative campaigns,'' said
Mark McKinnon, the Bush camp's adman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   To which Stevens added, ``They would take offense if you accused
them of running a positive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing do the members of Maverick Media, the
organization assembled for the express goal of cultivating Bush's
appeal on radio and television, operate out of a basement warren of
offices they call ``the bunker'': The first steady, 30-second
barrages of the general election have not even been set off yet,
and already the Bush message people are crying ``foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, it's reminiscent of the primary campaign, during
which the major candidates of both parties were accusing one
another of running low-down, dirty commercials, when, for the most
part, the spots were fairly tame.
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-emptive protests may also indicate a certain
jitteriness among the half-dozen principal members of the Maverick
team, some of whom are working on a national presidential media
campaign for the first time. There is inside the bunker the air of
a group of well-mannered folks who have stumbled into the toughest
neighborhood in town.
</P>
<P>
   In a cutthroat business, McKinnon is admired for his decency:
``He's known for running very fair campaigns,'' said John Weaver,
political director of the McCain campaign. But when the opposition
consists of the likes of Carter Eskew and Robert Shrum, veteran
media strategists for Vice President Al Gore who have
take-no-prisoners reputations, the question arises: Does Bush need
a team that plays by the Marquess of Queensberry's rules, or Mike
Tyson's? Can Maverick avoid the errors in Bill Bradley's political
advertising, which never adequately answered Gore's incessant
criticisms of Bradley's policies?
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, in fact, acknowledges he would much rather paint a
portrait than have to slash someone else's: ``It's much more
powerful and compelling to create a positive vision than it is to
tear somebody down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sensibility is reflected in many of the spots McKinnon
creates for Bush, warm-and-fuzzy images reminiscent of the upbeat
spots for Ronald Reagan. The McKinnon style is more documentary;
the innovation Maverick introduced in the primaries was the ``crash
ad,'' filmed, edited and on the air in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   And his spots feature lots of shimmering boilerplate: shots of
Bush wading into smiling crowds, posed in dazzling sunshine with
his wife, Laura, or offering his family-sampler takes on
heart-tugging issues. ``I believe every child can learn,'' he said
in one education spot.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon and company know they cannot run a general-election
campaign on happy talk; indeed, alongside the sunny spots, groups
and individuals allied with Bush ran some of the harshest
commercials of the primaries, including attack ads that portrayed
Sen. John McCain as an enemy of the environment and breast cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   And the question of tone is not their only challenge. Although
Bush is an immensely likable candidate, questions about his grasp
of foreign affairs and other issues could be magnified in
comparisons with Gore, and some political observers wonder if
Maverick will be able to fill in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the hard thing,'' said Paul Begala, a former adviser to
President Clinton who has known and liked McKinnon since their days
together at the University of Texas. ``Mark's greatest strength is
style, and Bush has a style that meshes well with Mark's. In small
settings Bush is very charming: the most charming politician to
come down the pike since Clinton. Mark does an excellent job of
capturing that. But at the end of the day there is no filter that
can be put on a camera to add gray matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of depth is clearly one of the candidate's most
vexing image problems. The governor's media advisers, though,
maintain that such doubts about Bush exist in a land where pundits
reside, but not the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the fall of last year to address substance,'' McKinnon
said. ``The rap on us that we don't have issues, or substance, was
effectively addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in a windowless conference room ringed with television
sets, the affable McKinnon would not be coaxed into a meditation on
any of Bush's perceived weaknesses. If it seemed a function of a
political advertising man's natural inclination to project only the
bright side, it also reflected what those who know him say is
McKinnon's genuine belief in Bush, a deep and abiding affection
characteristic of those in the governor's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston, for whom McKinnon made
commercials in all three of his successful mayoral campaigns, says
that there can be only one explanation for McKinnon's signing up:
``If he's supporting George Bush, it's because he thinks George
Bush would make a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are conventional routes to becoming commercial-maker to
this potential president, McKinnon did not take them. For one
thing, he climbed the wrong ladder: He was a longtime Democratic
media strategist before signing up with Bush, working on the
campaigns of, among others, former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas
and former Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McKinnon, a Colorado-born musician who in his younger
days was invited to Nashville, Tenn., to write songs for Kris
Kristofferson, had dropped out of politics entirely by the time he
fell into a long conversation with Bush at a dinner in Austin in
1997. The year before, McKinnon confessed in a most public way _ a
first person article for Texas Monthly _ that after 15 years of
politics, he was burned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I got tired of candidates' asking me what their firmly
held convictions should be,'' he wrote. ``Maybe I got tired of
accusing opponents of being right-wing extremists who wanted to cut
Social Security benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   At that Austin dinner, though, McKinnon's head was turned. Bush
seemed to him to evince an honest interest in education, an issue
dear to McKinnon; he was making a documentary about the
inspirational founder of a Houston charter school. ``I was amazed,
blown away, by how much attention he paid,'' McKinnon said of the
governor, and before long he had signed up to handle media in
Bush's 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon did not win friends among Texas Democrats for his
defection; he is unfazed. ``What does it say about me, my values?''
he asked. ``I think what attracted me to him is what is going to
attract a lot of independents and Democrats. I came to the
conclusion that in the end, good politics is about good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and rivals alike say personal attachment is a
characteristic of McKinnon; Lanier recalled that once McKinnon
moved into his home for a few weeks, ``to get a flavor so that his
ads would have a genuine-ness to them, so that I'd be comfortable
saying the words.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a reputation for not going for the jugular. ``I
can't recall any campaign where I've worked against him where he
even got close to crossing the line,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   That is high praise from a McCain aide, considering how
aggrieved his boss felt by some of the commercials Bush ran in
South Carolina. The Bush campaign had been expecting the most
intense media battering to come from the campaign of another
primary-election opponent, Steve Forbes, but it was McCain who
surprised Bush with the harder hitting commercials, including a New
Hampshire spot in which McCain said Bush's tax cuts would mostly
benefit the wealthy. Some of Bush's advisers believe their failure
to answer the commercial was a major factor in their sobering early
loss in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed to learn from their mistakes in South Carolina.
In one of the most effective media moves of the primary season,
Bush was able to turn McCain's clean-campaign vows against him. In
a spot shot at a fishing camp in South Carolina, a serious-looking
Bush responded to a now-famous McCain commercial in which the
senator accused the governor of twisting the truth, ``like
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disagree with me, fine,'' Bush intoned in his reply ad. ``But
do not challenge my integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a subtle and successful lesson in the art of the
double-negative commercial: suggest that an opponent was unworthy
because he said something mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we ran that ad, the numbers moved,'' said Matthew
Dowd, another member of the Maverick team. In fact, it worked so
well that it was used in states where McCain had not even run his
own advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark made the best ad of the primaries when Bush looked into
the camera and said, `He compared me to Clinton,''' said Begala,
now a commentator on CNBC's ``Equal Time.'' ``It gave Bush carte
blanche to turn his guns on McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Vast amounts of money will be spent on political commercials at
all levels this year _ $600 million, according to the Television
Bureau of Advertising _ and a lot of it by the Bush and Gore
campaigns. Commercials in Spanish will be more prevalent than ever
before: For instance, Maverick has its own unit headed by the San
Antonio-based team of Lionel Sosa and Luis Garcia to create spots
targeted for Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McKinnon does not think the 2000 election will be decided
inside the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe there are so many other facets in the campaign
that are so much more important,'' he said. ``The media, the free
press, is the wind that fills the sails. The advertising acts as a
rudder, to steer a little bit.''

HEARN HOPING FOR A JUMP-START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richie Hearn is hoping this month's Indianapolis 500 can
jump-start his racing career.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Pasadena (Calif.) High graduate raced in the
Indianapolis 500, he finished third, the top rookie in the field in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's back with a new team and trying to recapture
some of that magic from four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his podium finish, Hearn looked like a rising
star in Indy racing. Unfortunately, while Hearn shined at Indy, the
open-wheel racing world was scarred by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn finished well in a depleted field at Indy in 1996. Most of
the top drivers were essentially banned from competing as
Championship Auto Racing Teams _ the governing body of the FedEx
Series _ and Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George were
engaged in a bitter battle.
</P>
<P>
   George was looking to make a safer and slower racing circuit.
CART wanted to stay the course with faster, more powerful racing
machines. Out of this contrast in philosophies the Indy Racing
League was born, with the Indianapolis 500 as its crown jewel. And
CART drivers and owners were left to either follow George's new
rules or not compete at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   Many CART owners chose not to compete. Hearn's team owner, John
Della Penna, was one of the few CART owners who wanted to run at
Indy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hearn and Della Penna struggled through three
disappointing years on the CART FedEx Series. Before the 2000
season started, Della Penna released Hearn from his contract and
decided to sign Brazilian Norberto Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   Without a team and his future dim, Hearn was approached by Pagan
Racing Team owner Allan Pagan before an IRL race at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He offered Hearn a chance to race at Indy, something Hearn has
wanted to do since his first taste in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for anyone to want to race here,''
Hearn said. ``Every year I watched it on TV. I was very upset, and
I wanted to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Pagan offered Hearn a chance to return to Indianapolis,
Hearn jumped at it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Hearn given an opportunity to return to auto
racing, but he was driving for a team that finished second in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ward, who drives for A.J. Racing, finished second for Pagan
Racing in two events in 1999, at Indianapolis and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pagan Racing had a strong car for Indy last year, it
is struggling this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are not looking good out there,'' Hearn said of his
team's Dellara Aurora. ``We're the slowest car out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's practice session, Hearn was the 37th-fastest
car at 213.935 mph. Scott Sharp turned the fastest lap in 223.936
mph. The top 33 cars qualify for the May 28 race.
</P>
<P>
   And his team has been unable to make adjustments to get the car
up to speed. Still, Hearn plans to make the most of his time at
Indianapolis, as this might be a one-shot deal with Pagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not planning anything more than this race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HORNADAY'S TEAM FINED, PENALIZED: The crew chief and owner of
Ron Hornaday Jr.'s No.3 NASCAR Busch Grand National Division
Chevrolet were penalized and fined Monday for rules violations
during the Hardee's 250 at Richmond International Raceway on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief David Lackey was suspended until June 7 for using an
illegal fuel mixture in the car during qualifying. Team owner Ron
Alexander was fined $10,000 and penalized six points in the owner
standings.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST SERIES: The NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series heads
to Pikes Peak International Raceway in Colorado for Sunday's
Sunstate Equipment Company 100.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Woodside of Saugus, Calif., and Greg Pursley of Newhall,
Calif., have already posted victories this season on the Southwest
Series. Other area drivers, including Bob Lyon of Agua Dulce,
Calif., are hoping Pikes Peak will lead them to victory lane. This
is the first time the Southwest Series has competed at Pikes Peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we've always done pretty well when we've gone
some place new,'' Lyon said, a Southwest Series veteran with three
career wins. ``When the series went to Tucson Raceway for the first
time, we won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Series will accompany the NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series race Sunday at Pikes Peak.
</P>
<P>
   IRWINDALE SPEEDWAY: Walt Johnson of Sun Valley won the USAC
Three-Quarter Midget feature Saturday night at Irwindale (Calif.)
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, James Weston of Goleta won the NASCAR Late
Model feature, Jeff Green of Long Beach won the NASCAR Super Stock
feature and Kenny Smith of El Monte won the MSRA Pro-4 Modified
feature. &QL;

SOUTHERN BAPTIST PROPOSAL SAYS BIBLE ALLOWS ONLY MEN TO BE
PASTORS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: the Rev. Cathe Nixon is cq) 
 
By RICHARD VARA 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The Bible allows only men to be church pastors,
according to a proposal announced Thursday by a key leadership
committee of Southern Baptist churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``While both men and women are gifted for service in the church,
the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture,''
the proposed revision to the Southern Baptist Convention's Baptist
Faith and Message doctrinal statement says. It will be voted on
next month at the denomination's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that for the vast majority of Southern Baptists
this is a shift in belief,'' said the Rev. Richard Land, president
of the convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. ``The
Bible, in the New Testament, has specifically forbidden a woman
from assuming the office of a pastor of a local congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, the proposal would have the effect of strongly
discouraging Southern Baptist congregations from calling women as
pastors. But it could not legally prevent them from doing so,
because such congregations are self-governing.
</P>
<P>
   Land, who is based in Nashville, Tenn., emphasized that the
revision does not prohibit women from ministries such as teaching
in seminaries or even leading a convention agency. ``It does not
preclude women from being called to full-time ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   But a pastor is the spiritual head of a church.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on women pastors is consistent with positions the
conservative-controlled convention has articulated throughout the
past 20 years. But adding it to the doctrinal statement sparked
criticism from moderate leaders and women ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is among several recommended by a 15-member
committee appointed last year by the convention's conservative
leaders to review and update the denomination's basic statement of
faith. In addition to stands against abortion and euthanasia, the
recommendations call for Southern Baptists to ``oppose racism,
every form of greed, selfishness and vice, and all forms of sexual
immorality including adultery, homosexuality and pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Baptist ancestors of a mere generation ago could not have
imagined the need to address the issues of abortion, homosexuality,
euthanasia and all manner of deviant and pagan sexuality,'' said
the Rev. Adrian Rogers, a pastor from the Memphis, Tenn., area who
chaired the committee. ``We answer with a clear word of biblical
correction.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctrinal statement, last revised in 1963, will be voted on
at the denomination's annual meeting in June in Orlando, Fla. It is
not binding on the convention's 15.9 million members in 41,000
churches, which are autonomous and independently call pastors to
serve. But convention agency and seminary employees are bound to
support the statement if required by supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction is one of sadness in that I and several female and
male ministers feel differently on this issue,'' said the Rev.
Cathe Nixon, minister to children at Willow Meadows Baptist Church
in southwest Houston. ``I truly believe in God's grace and God's
call and I think that it extends to all, no matter race or
gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is an associate pastor at the 400-member church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, (the ban) is not new,'' Nixon said. ``It keeps
rearing its ugly head from time to time. I think scripturally that
God created male and female equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Few women serve as pastors in Southern Baptist churches,
although their numbers are growing in other Protestant
denominations. Of an estimated 1,000 women who have been ordained
in the Southern Baptist church, only 50 to 100 are believed to
serve as pastors. The others are associate pastors, educators or
ministers of music. Nixon estimates 10 other Southern Baptist women
are ministers in Houston but none are pastors.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The proposed revision) is evidence the Southern Baptist
Convention is controlled by white male fundamentalist pastors,''
said the Rev. Daniel Vestal, leader of the moderate Cooperative
Baptist Fellowship based in Atlanta. The fellowship is part of the
national Southern Baptist group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that statement is based on a bad interpretation of
Scripture. It is based on an insensitivity to the Holy Spirit and I
believe an unwillingness to see what God is doing in the world
today,'' said Vestal, a former Houston pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Also disagreeing with the proposal is the Rev. Cynthia Clawson
Courtney, co-pastor with her husband, the Rev. Reagan Courtney, of
Tarrytown Baptist Church in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all about power,'' Cynthia Courtney said. ``That whole
thing is a power struggle, about men who want to be in charge of
everything. If it hadn't been for women in the Baptist church, the
church would not be here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the statement banning women from
pastoring implicitly accepts women as being ordained for other
pastoral roles such as chaplains. The denomination, the largest
Protestant group in the United States, has been criticized for
hewing to traditional roles for women.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment to the doctrinal statement in 1998 called for a
wife to ``submit graciously'' to her husband's leadership.

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif _ John Shirreffs enjoys a slightly different
view of Fusaichi Pegasus than other trainers who have run horses
against the Kentucky Derby champion.
</P>
<P>
   He, alone, has the view from the front.
</P>
<P>
   A Shirreffs-trained colt named David Copperfield has been the
only horse to finish ahead of Fusaichi Pegasus, the odds-on
favorite to win the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore on Saturday and
move within a Belmont victory of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``A footnote to history,'' Shirreffs said with a bittersweet
smile Thursday morning outside his Hollywood Park barn.
</P>
<P>
   David Copperfield and Fusaichi Pegasus were making their racing
debuts when they went into the starting gate for a 6-furlong sprint
for 2-year-olds at Hollywood Park on Dec. 11. Each drew strong
support from handicappers, David Copperfield going off at 7-2 odds
because of his pedigree (Halo is his sire) and Shirreffs'
reputation for winning with a high percentage of first-time
starters, Fusaichi Pegasus at 3-1 because of his breeding (Mr.
Prospector) and his $4 million auction price.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, neither was the betting favorite, that honor going
to Bob Baffert-trained first-timer Tribunal (2-1), who'd recorded a
series of fast workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumor on the backstretch was that (Neil) Drysdale had a
monster,'' Shirreffs recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After Shirreffs entered David Copperfield in the $33,000 race,
he looked at the entry list, and there was the monster.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, ridden that day by Victor Espinoza, and David
Copperfield, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, both trailed pacesetter
Hoover Tower for one-quarter mile. Fusaichi Pegasus, at the rail
after breaking from post 1, moved up inside to challenge for the
lead on the turn and was in front turning into the stretch. David
Copperfield came to him on the outside and they kicked clear of the
other eight horses.
</P>
<P>
   The two were five lengths in front of the field as David
Copperfield outfought Fusaichi Pegasus to win by a neck. Tribunal
finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were head-and-head at the top of the lane,'' Shirreffs
said. ``David Copperfield, in that situation, is a very game
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs said he concentrated on watching his own horse during
the race and didn't form an impression of Drysdale's monster. But
he has had plenty of opportunities to size up Fusaichi Pegasus
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after that losing debut, Fusaichi Pegasus went off
as a 1-5 favorite and won by two lengths, beginning the five-race
winning streak that includes dominating victories in the Wood
Memorial and Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quite a horse,'' Shirreffs said. ``I always thought his
problem would be the big crowd at Churchill Downs. He handled that
so well, I think he's got a real good chance to maybe sweep it (the
Triple Crown). That puts him up with Secretariat and Citation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the distance will be a problem,'' he said of the
Preakness' 1 3/16 miles _ 110 yards shorter than the Derby _ and
the Belmont's 1 miles. ``I don't think the competition will be a
problem. I think it's a matter of the attrition and whether running
three times in five weeks will catch up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs said he knew Fusaichi Pegasus was special when he saw
the colt finish out strongly to beat The Deputy in the San Felipe
Stakes at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Now he roots for Fusaichi Pegasus _ not because that colt's
success is flattering to David Copperfield but because ``I like
Neil (Drysdale), and he's a California horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, David Copperfield, a brown colt built like a
linebacker, has not kept pace with the horse he defeated four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth in an allowance sprint at Santa Anita in January, he
bounced back to win a mile race at the same level in March, and
went into the California Derby at Golden Gate Fields on April 15
with a chance to earn a trip to the Kentucky Derby. But he pulled
Delahoussaye to the lead prematurely and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he won, we would have gone to Kentucky with him,''
Shirreffs said. ``But he didn't settle into the race.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shirreffs is shopping for an allowance race to use as a prep
for the $100,000 Cinema Handicap, to be held on the Hollywood Park
turf course June 10. David Copperfield is bred to run well on turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still expect big things out of David Copperfield,'' his
trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   June 10 is the day of the Belmont, the day Fusaichi Pegasus
could go for the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wonder what went wrong, why we're not at least
competing,'' said Shirreffs, who had several Derby prospects in
December. ``You always say, `Maybe if I'd done (ital)this(endital)
a little differently.' But I think the horse has to develop. Horses
develop at different times.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs and David Copperfield face uncertain futures. Marshall
Naify, the owner for whom Shirreffs has trained privately since
1994, died recently at age 80, and the 30 horses are expected to be
dispersed at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs, a soft-spoken 54-year-old, will have to seek new
clients. David Copperfield will probably have a new trainer. But
one thing they'll always have is the distinction of beating the
Derby winner. &QL;

WHICH LAKERS BENCH WILL SHOW UP VS. PORTLAND?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Have you heard? The really big problem with
the Lakers is they lack support.
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind from muted fans or a creaky floor, but the type
offered from their backups. The guys doing pine time, their
supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   It's been the big knock on the Lakers all season. Great Big
Three, nice lineup, weak bench.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder Shaquille O'Neal can stand at all, given that
supposed weak support. And it might be best to send those sympathy
cards now because the Lakers are about to open the Western
Conference Finals Saturday against the deepest team in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Trail Blazers have what is generally regarded as
the most talented and valuable bench in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all year, Portland has two teams,'' O'Neal
said.
</P>
<P>
   As if their first team wasn't scary enough, the Blazers come
back at you with Brian Grant, Detlef Schrempf, Stacy Augmon, Greg
Anthony _ guys who have all started for other teams _ and explosive
Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers counter with ... who were those guys again?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a new insult,'' said Lakers reserve Rick Fox. ``We've
heard it all year. We're the weak link on a 67-win team. You roll
with it and accept what the view of us is from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers bench is led by Robert Horry _ who's actually playing
more minutes in the playoffs than starters Ron Harper and A.C.
Green _ Brian Shaw, Derek Fisher and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   A nice enough bunch, but they lack the dramatics of their
Portland counterparts. The theory goes, if the Lakers and Blazers
starters play evenly, Portland's bench will be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this opposition's-bench-is-gonna-kill-'em routine was
the same refrain heard by previous playoff opponents Sacramento and
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them keep saying that,'' Shaw said. ``That kind of gives
us an advantage because when you expect so much from the bench and
they don't produce, you're missing something you counted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't expect much from our bench, so we do something
and it's a bonus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers' backups privately chafe at the little recognition
they receive, publicly they claim it has a definite upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's best kept that way,'' Fox said. ``I'd rather be
disrespected and prove people wrong, than respected to the point
we're not allowed to be the sneaking, conniving, menacing bench
that we are at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sneak up and bite teams in the butt because of their lack
of respect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps being overlooked when you play in the shadow of
superstars O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, but here's a surprising bit of
news: In the four times the two teams met in the regular season,
the Lakers' bench actually outscored the Blazers' vaunted bench in
every game.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the L.A. reserves outscored Portland's 101-67 in the
four games. Even discounting the 23 points Bryant scored when he
came off the bench in the second meeting, the Lakers' reserves were
more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Blazers tend to rely on their starters against the
Lakers more than most realize. In Portland's second and most
impressive victory over the Lakers at Staples Center, its reserves
scored just four points.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs thus far, too, numbers-wise the Lakers bench has
been holding its own against the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has gotten an average of 24.3 points, 13.8 rebounds and
4.8 assists from its bench in the playoffs. The Lakers' reserves
have averaged 26.3 points, 13.6 rebounds and 8.2 assists.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Lakers have been at their best in the playoffs _
home games against the Kings, Games 3 and 5 against the Suns _
their bench usually came up big.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers' supporting cast is not always consistent. One
game Horry, Fox, Shaw and Fisher are bombing away from outside, the
next they're almost invisible. Fox said when teams elect to swarm
at O'Neal or double Bryant, opportunities are created for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunities we take advantage of one game, won't be there
the next,'' he said. ``And that's when you see Shaq go for 45
points and Kobe get 38, because they're there sitting with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The road has been more troubling for the L.A. reserves, but
Lakers coach Phil Jackson normally elects to use his bench less
away from Staples. His starters have averaged 11 minutes more per
game on the road in the playoffs than at home. Using starters more
on the road or in the playoffs, though, doesn't figure to negate
Portland's bench depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because what they do is come at you in waves,'' Bryant
said. ``You have your starters out there for the majority of the
game, but when Portland goes to their bench, they bring in another
energy. It's kind of like a boost of energy, fresh energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to play a crucial part of the series
because you have to match their intensity, match their energy. Our
bench might get less minutes, but those lesser minutes are going to
be very critical to the series.'' &QL;

RAILWAY KILLER CONVICTED, ASKS FOR DEATH PENALTY 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After being convicted Thursday of capital murder in
the death of Dr. Claudia Benton, Angel Maturino Resendiz told the
judge he would rather be executed than spend the next 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've decided that injection is better than spending life in
jail, so I want to do that,'' he said, with the jury out of the
courtroom. ``I'm 41, plus 40 years is 81, and I might not make it
all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors convicted Maturino Resendiz of murdering Benton in her
West University Place home in the Houston area on Dec. 17, 1998.
Now they must decide whether to sentence him to death or life in
prison, which requires that he serve at least 40 years before the
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the verdict was announced, Maturino Resendiz
looked at his mother among the courtroom spectators. She patted her
chest twice and began breathing heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no emotion, Maturino Resendiz stood as jurors were
polled about their decision. His mother looked up and wept quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of other victims embraced. Benton's husband, George,
sitting in the front row, looked at Maturino Resendiz and nodded
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, who said he was an angel on a mission from
God to destroy evil people, has confessed to six slayings in Texas,
two in Illinois and one in Kentucky from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to Benton's
murder. To acquit him, jurors would have had to believe Maturino
Resendiz suffered from a mental disease that prevented him from
knowing his actions were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Before testimony began in the punishment phase of the trial,
Maturino Resendiz asked to speak with state District Judge Bill
Harmon, then told him he wanted the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon and Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr.
reminded Maturino Resendiz that presenting no case and not
cross-examining prosecution witnesses might actually earn him
jurors' sympathy and persuade them to sentence him to life.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz responded, ``I've got some plans for that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, including his defense team, knew what the comment meant.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the unusual hearing, defense attorney Allen
Tanner said to Maturino Resendiz, ``I'm still going to try to talk
you out of that. Is that OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz replied, ``I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon told Maturino Resendiz he could change his mind at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of Maturino Resendiz's remark about his ``plans,'' bailiffs
stood within two feet of him every time his attorneys stepped away
from their table or a weapon was produced for evidence. Another
bailiff guarded the exit nearest the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the punishment phase, prosecutor Devon Anderson told the
jurors they must now answer two questions: Is Maturino Resendiz a
continuing threat to society, and are there any mitigating
circumstances why he should not be put to death?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard the defendant's excuses,'' she said. ``But we're
going to tell you about the (nine victims) ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a career burglar who's developed a taste
for murder and rape.''
</P>
<P>
   John Benton, the victim's brother-in-law, tearfully recounted
the day his brother was told about the murder while visiting him in
Arizona with the couple's twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do. I just screamed. ... He was beside
himself,'' John Benton said, weeping openly. Several jurors cried
throughout his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother and nieces never returned to the home where
Dr. Benton died while struggling fiercely for her life. Maturino
Resendiz bludgeoned her with a statue, stabbed her in the back,
then raped her as she lay dying.
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in a friend's townhouse until the girls
finished the school year, then moved to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never lived in that house again,'' John Benton said. ``He
never returned to work (in the oil industry) ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say he's lost, but he is. He's got two girls.
He wakes them up in the morning. He makes them breakfast. He sends
them to school and waits for them to come home from school,
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Obeying their client's request, defense lawyers gave no opening
statement and cross-examined no witnesses. Tanner made only a few
technical objections for the record.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal is automatic, but Maturino Resendiz has told his
lawyers he does not want one.
</P>
<P>
   Facing an overwhelming amount of physical evidence, such as
fingerprints and DNA linking Maturino Resendiz to each scene,
Tanner has acknowledged his client is the killer.
</P>
<P>
   But he called on experts to testify that Maturino Resendiz is a
paranoid schizophrenic who suffered delusions he was ``half angel,
half man,'' was drawn to his victims by a sense of evil and was
forced to kill them because it was ``God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   The state countered with experts who said no matter how strange
Maturino Resendiz's religious beliefs, he knew right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz surrendered to Texas Ranger Drew Carter in
July at the Mexican border after an international manhunt. Before
that day, Maturino Resendiz had continued to kill, often taunting
police at each scene by leaving newspaper articles about himself in
plain view and placing a toy train at one.
</P>
<P>
   The state is expected to call about 20 more witnesses.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
FORT WORTH _ A self-described ``underachiever'' because of his
putting, Keith Clearwater could be a poster boy for the PGA Tour.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The poster would read: Don't let this happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater, twice a winner on the PGA Tour, including at the
1987 Colonial, disappeared from the golf world for so long, people
thought he was retired. Fame was fleeting, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   After dealing with an inclination to bulk up his body in the
early 1990s, the death of his father-in-law and that dreaded
flatstick in the past few years, Clearwater found himself back in
the limelight Thursday after a first-round 67 left him solidly
entrenched in the second-place logjam at the MasterCard Colonial on
a windy, threatening day.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable part about it is Clearwater remembered the way to
the limelight. It had been awhile since he had seen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has kind of been my unfortunate story,'' he said. ``In my
opinion, I've been a significant underachiever because of a poor
putter.''
</P>
<P>
   That fickle club has caused Clearwater much aggravation in his
career. Not to mention some embarrassment that he's living through
this year.
</P>
<P>
   He's a full-time resident of the Buy.com Tour, which is the
underling of the PGA Tour. It's not a pleasant place for somebody
who has $2.2 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very humbling experience,'' Clearwater, 40, said.
``It's a pride issue with us (guys who have had success at the PGA
Tour level). You're like, `Oh joy, I get to play here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact of the matter is that you better shut up and
perform. Or else you'll belong here (on the Buy.com). Until you do
something to change it, that's where you belong.''
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to change it this week. Clearwater would be leading
the tournament if not for an eagle-2 at the sixth hole by John
Cook, who carded a 4-under-par 66.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clearwater, Cook has seen better days. He called his 2000
season terrible and is just happy to have a chance to be in the
hunt at a tournament. But if Cook thinks it's tough struggling on
the PGA Tour, try surviving at the bottom-feeder level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put the top 30 guys (from the PGA Tour) onto the
Buy.com Tour, there'd be a bunch of guys missing cuts,'' Clearwater
said. ``Making cuts is not easy. You only have 55 players (plus
ties) making the cut. The depth isn't as good on the Buy.com Tour.
But there are a lot of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater showed his play still functions well at the PGA Tour
level. He hasn't made a cut since 1998, missing all seven times he
entered events last year and going 0-for-3 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he got to 3 under par with birdies at each of his
final three holes. He put a knock-down 6-iron inside 10 feet at the
par-3 16th, then hit a 9-iron on the 17th and sand wedge on No. 18,
both to 12 feet. That he made the putts was the surprising
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's allowing me to be competitive is that the putter has
been working,'' Clearwater said. ``And that hasn't been the case
for a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Clearwater's game hasn't been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm No. 1 in scoring on the Buy.com Tour and No. 1 in overall
statistics on the Buy.com Tour, so my game is good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't far off, although in this week's statistics, he
was No. 2 in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing great golf out there,'' he said. ``I was
second in Shreveport, and should have won by 20, quite honestly.
This is not a shock. I don't have any doubt that playing a full
year on the Buy.com Tour, I'll regain my (PGA Tour) card. And
that's the No. 1 goal. I also don't think it would be a stretch to
come here and play well for four days and have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, it took only one day for Clearwater to play well and
win at Colonial. That year, rain washed out the Saturday action and
there was a 36-hole finale set for Sunday. Clearwater shot 64-64
and won the tournament with a huge rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a momentum golf course,'' he said. ``It'll keep you
honest on some holes and others you can take advantage. Sometimes
the perfect play is hitting it 40 feet (and taking par).''
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater's history has taken some strange turns. He bought two
Gold's Gyms early in the '90s and got on a weightlifting kick that,
some say, destroyed his golf swing. Clearwater doesn't believe
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '92, when I was doing the most lifting, I had my best
year,'' he said. ``I was in the top 25 on the money list (22nd) and
if I had putted well, I'd have won eight times.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater's more recent past hasn't been as fun. He lost his
father-in-law, Jim Starley, to leukemia a year and a half ago. For
more than a year before that, he and his wife, Sue, cared for
Starley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically took myself away from golf,'' Clearwater said. ``I
really just decided this year that I still had a lot I wanted to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't elaborate, Clearwater said he had some ``silly''
goals and the words ``Ryder Cup'' slipped out of his mouth once. He
has a long way to go to qualify for the 2001 American team. But if
he continues to play like he did Thursday, anything's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get all the way back,'' he said. ``I'm not out
here just to make money. I truly feel my best 10 years are in front
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, they can't be much worse than the past few
have been, as long as the putter cooperates.

DEVILS LOSE ADVANTAGE AS FLYERS CROWD BRODEUR
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The home advantage the New Jersey Devils
took away from the Philadelphia Flyers in Philadelphia over the
weekend went back down the New Jersey Turnpike Thursday night as
the Flyers came up with a 4-2 victory to take a lead of 2-1 in
their Eastern Conference final series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had the territorial advantage for the most part
before a sellout crowd at Continental Arena, but they were stymied
by Brian Boucher, the Flyers' rookie goaltender, who had 27 saves,
including a number that were spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher was beaten only by Claude Lemieux and Scott Niedermayer,
who scored from the slot with a crowd in front of the Philadelphia
net with 4 minutes 1 second left in the game. The Flyers got the
goal back when Simon Gagne went around defenseman Brian Rafalski
with 1:49 remaining to close out the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Recchi, Keith Jones and Rick Tocchet also scored for the
Flyers against Martin Brodeur, who had 17 saves and failed to match
Boucher's performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils played without the injured center John Madden, their
top defensive forward, and were also hampered by turnovers as they
suffered their first loss in the last nine games at home.
</P>
<P>
   A turnover by Vladimir Malakhov led to the first goal by the
Flyers, just 2 minutes 57 seconds into the game. The Devils' lanky
Russian defenseman lost the puck to Recchi just outside the New
Jersey blue line, creating a 2-on-1 break with John LeClair, who
returned Recchi's pass for the goal from close range to the right
of Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Malakhov redeemed himself somewhat just under two minutes later
with a precision pass from out of his zone to Lemieux, who was
streaking through the neutral zone. Lemieux entered Philadelphia's
zone by splitting two defensemen and beat Boucher over the stick
from between the circles for his third goal of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers went to the net with authority later in the period,
and got a goal for their efforts. Jones barreled into Brodeur in
the crease and converted a rebound from a shot by Keith Primeau
that hit Brodeur on the chest and dropped in front.
</P>
<P>
   Following that score, with 5:46 left in the period, the Devils
had two good opportunities before intermission but Boucher denied
Petr Sykora from point-blank range by sprawling to his left and
Scott Gomez at his left doorstep when Gomez tried to jam the puck
past him.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher made a huge save during the first power play in the game
for the Flyers. Just 12 seconds after the first intermission,
Lemieux was caught high-sticking Recchi. Patrik Elias, one of the
penalty killers for the Devils, broke away alone shortly before the
penalty expired and tried to deke Boucher with a move from right to
left. Boucher found himself on his back to Elias' right. He
appeared to be at Elias' mercy, but he stretched out his right arm
and covered the puck with the back of it. Elias looked at the
scoreboard screen when a replay of the action came on and shook his
head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet extended the Flyers' lead to two goals with his third
goal in two games. It came 7:15 into the middle period, shortly
after the Flyers killed their first penalty in the game. Taking a
pass from Primeau down the right flank, Tocchet fired a shot from
the right circle that hit Brodeur inside his right leg before
hitting the net.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams played without key centers injured in Game 2. Madden
missed the game for the Devils because of a knee injury that will
keep him out indefinitely. His place was taken by Steve Brule, who
made his NH L debut.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said before the game that he selected Brule over Steve
Kelly as a replacement for Madden because Brule was good at
faceoffs. But Brule lost seven of the nine faceoffs he took in the
first two periods, including four of five in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, already playing without their superstar center Eric
Lindros, who is out with a concussion, were also without center
Daymond Langkow, who sustained a concussion when he was hit in open
ice by Scott Stevens Tuesday night 39 seconds after scoring what
turned out to be the winning goal in Philadelphia's 4-3 victory.

<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Fortunately for Keith Clearwater, he earns a living
by playing golf, not predicting its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after posting a 67 in Thursday's opening round of the
MasterCard Colonial, Clearwater dismissed himself as an
afterthought in the proceedings. Swirling winds, which reached 25
mph, were dying, and Clearwater envisioned bushels of birdies for
those who followed him down ``Hogan's Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone's going to shoot 6 under, and everything I'm saying is
going to be shuffled into the recycle bin,'' said Clearwater, the
1987 Colonial champ.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   It took a chip-in eagle by John Cook, playing in one of the
final three groups of the day, to bump Clearwater from a share of
the top spot on the Colonial leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Cook emerged from a blustery day at refurbished Colonial with a
66, almost six strokes below the average score (71.7) posted by the
110 starters in Thursday's opening round. Cook stands at 4-under
par, a stroke ahead of an eight-player group that includes
Clearwater, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson and David Toms.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is two strokes ahead of a five-player knot at 68 that
includes Irving resident Joel Edwards, Frank Nobilo and Rocco
Mediate. Cook is one of 25 players _ 10 morning starters, 15
afternoon starters _ who broke even-par 70 on a course that has
received a $3.5 million face-lift since the final putt dropped at
the 1999 Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover included 18 rebuilt greens and several repositioned
fairway bunkers. The result? Cook's 66 matched the highest score
posted by a first-round leader at Colonial since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who collected 15 pars, two birdies and an eagle, said he
was pleased to play a bogey-free round amid the swirling gusts. The
new greens, he said, were firm and created a guessing game on
approach shots when combined with intermittent winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to pull the right club out there,'' said Cook, who
began his round at 1:20 p.m., roughly an hour after Clearwater
finished. ``The afternoon (starters) didn't get the wind that the
morning guys did, but the wind really baked out the greens. When
you put this golf course with firm greens, low scores aren't going
to happen very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course has stood the test of time without making it so no
one can play it. It defies all of today's architectural standards.
It doesn't have to be 8,000 yards long, with forced carries over
bunkers, to make it difficult. I'm not that surprised by the
scores. You're not going to make many birdies around here. You have
to eliminate the `others.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In golf parlance, ``other'' is a score above bogey on a given
hole. Cook had none of those. That is why he got so much mileage
out of his chip-in for eagle at the sixth hole. Cook's 9-iron from
127 yards landed 12 feet short of the pin, rolled up to the pin and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this year's been going, I expected it to hit the pin
and bounce off the green,'' said Cook, who ranks 169th on the money
list ($46,231) and has not finished higher than 22nd at a PGA Tour
event this season. ``When it went in, I thought, `There we go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The shot allowed Cook to climb all the way to the top of a
leader board on a day when several headliners stumbled. Masters
champ Vijay Singh failed to post a single birdie in a round of 73.
That matched the score of Justin Leonard and Mark O'Meara, a pair
of former British Open champs, as well as Fort Worth native Hunter
Haas, the nation's top-ranked amateur. Fort Worth resident Mark
Brooks struggled home with a 75. Ben Crenshaw, a two-time Colonial
champ, ballooned to a 77.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask Len Mattiace, a member of the 3-under group, to
explain the soaring scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought scores would be lower,'' said Mattiace, whose round
included a 30-foot putt to save par and a 45-footer for birdie.
``When you played downwind shots, the ball would bounce and run.
When you played into the wind, the green would be receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trick, said Toms, was reading the new greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a tip from a local caddie who told me not to play as
much break as you might see,'' said Toms, who needed just 28 putts
during a round of 67. ``I thought the greens were perfect. But I
don't think they're breaking as much as they look like.''
</P>
<P>
   They broke enough Thursday to provide Clearwater, a member of
the Buy.com Tour, an extended stay on the Colonial leader board.
Barring rain, Cook said he expects no major changes in the final
three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a golf course where you have to make a bunch of
birdies to win,'' Cook said. ``They've got new greens. But par is
still a good score around here.'' nn
