<HEADLINE> Ghana to Benefit from More French Development Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has entered the list of
countries which benefit from all instruments under French
development assistance, Ghana News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The instruments, priority solidarity fund and social
development fund, were hitherto restricted to Francophone
countries.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Ghana, Didier Ferrand, announced the
decision Monday at the second meeting of the Ghana-France Joint
Commission for Co- operation in the Ghanaian capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which underscores the commitment of both countries
to find means of building a mutually beneficial partnership,
follows a visit of President Jerry Rawlings to France and that of
a delegation of the French Enterprises Association to Ghana in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The increased assistance under the scheme would complement
grants and loans of the French Development Assistance (AFD) and
the European Development Fund of which France is the main
contributor with a 24 percent share of resources.
</P>
<P>
The AFD committed loans totalling 52 million euros (49.74
million U.S. dollars) to five new projects in Ghana in 1999,
according to Ferrand.
</P>
<P>
He said emphasis was now being put on agriculture and support
to less developed regions as well as regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said France was encouraged by Ghana's commitments to
the donor community in areas of structural reforms and
macro-economic policies.
</P>
<P>
He said no matter how painful those structures were in the
short term, they were a condition for a sustainable growth and
prosperity in the medium and long term.
</P>
<P>
He noted that France would continue to look for values of
democracy, the rule of law and good governance.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Education Minister, Ekwow Spio-Garbrah, disclosed at
the meeting that Ghana had drawn up a long-term development plan
aimed at leading the country into the middle income bracket by
2020.
</P>
<P>
He called for improved understanding with the Francophone
countries in the west African sub-region and the removal of
"historical obstacles" to free trade and free movement of capital,
goods and people in order to create a regional market large enough
to attract foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
"France is strategically placed to play a significant role in
ECOWAS' integration efforts," he said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Says He Wants Shas in Government EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Tuesday that he wants to see Shas, the biggest partner in his
ruling coalition, to remain in the government.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark at a press conference broadcast live to the
nation Tuesday evening after four cabinet ministers of the ultra-
Orthodox Shas party submitted their resignations.
</P>
<P>
The resignations will take effect within 48 hours if no
agreement can be reached between Barak and Shas leadership over
Shas' demands for more school funds to the party, the legalization
of its radio stations and the party's more involvement in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The letters of resignation from the four ministers represent a
test of the nations's democratic value and acceptable norms of
operating the government," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
"The government will remain true to the acceptable norms of
governmental practice," stated Barak, indicating there could be no
more concessions to Shas demands.
</P>
<P>
Barak said senior officials from the ministries of finance and
education have worked tirelessly though days and nights to arrive
at an acceptable solution to the ongoing crisis, in an effort to
keep Shas on board and continue with the broad-based coalition.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the issues have been resolved and Shas
officials are aware of the offer placed before them and are
familiar with the details," added Barak.
</P>
<P>
He said that the hour was critical and the nation was at the
threshold of historic decisions that may not be abandoned,adding
that the well-being and future of the nation's school children,
including these Shas' schools,remain of paramount importance to the
current government.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said Israel was far from holding new elections and
that he still wanted to establish a widest possible government that
will move forward in Israel's interests.
</P>
<P>
Politicians and cabinet ministers of One Israel headed by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday urged Shas party not to make more
demands, but to take a more flexible attitude in solving the
coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat from One Israel said raising
more demands by Shas party will cause more difficulties for Barak
and the government to solve the current coalition problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several politicians of One Israel urged the Meretz
party headed by Education Minister Yossi Sarid to change their
attitude towards Shas. Sarid refused to allocate additional
educational funds to Shas and rejected Shas' demand to take the
responsibility of supervising Shas educational system from the
Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The next 48 hours will be crucial for Barak, who is likely to
use the time for more talks with Shas to try to meet its demands.
</P>
<P>
With 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament), Shas'
departure dwarfs the 68-52 parliament majority of Barak's coalition
to a miserable minority at the critical juncture of Middle East
peace-making.

<HEADLINE> Four Islamic Militants Given Jail Sentence in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court sentenced four
Islamic militants to five years in prison on Tuesday for their role
in the murder of five people, including two policemen, in 1992, the
state-owned Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The High Security Court of Asyut Governorate, 330 kilometers
south of Cairo, also fined the defendants 500 Egyptian pounds (145
U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The men were members of a cell of 11 people in the town of
Dairut in the governorate, belonging to al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or
Islamic Group, Egypt's most militant organization.
</P>
<P>
They were also accused of attempting to kill eight other
persons, including four policemen.
</P>
<P>
One of the cell's members has died since the 1992 killings in
Dairut and six others have fled.
</P>
<P>
Islamic radicals began an insurgency in 1992 in an attempt to
topple the secular government and establish a pure Islamic rule.
The violence has claimed around 1,200 people, including 58 tourists
in the November 1997 attack in the southern resort of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Tightened crackdown by the government following the 1997
massacre has quieted the insurrection.

<HEADLINE> COE Official Criticized for Addressing Denktash as "President" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Council of
Europe (COE) has drawn criticism from Cyprus' parliament for
addressing Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash as "president" and
other officials of the northern regime by their titles.
</P>
<P>
Andras Barsony, the Cyprus rapporteur at the Political Committee
of the Parliamentary Assembly of the COE, who is here on a working
visit to prepare a report on the island's situation, also offended
the parliament by spending Monday night in the north.
</P>
<P>
The President of House of Representatives of Cyprus, Spyros
Kyprianou, Tuesday refused to meet with him, saying it is totally
unacceptable for a COE official to do so, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said Barsony had been warned in writing after his
itinerary was made known, but he did not take it into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
He said Barsony's attitude "facilitates efforts by the illegal
regime to be recognized."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the Cyprus government also expressed its
displeasure with Barsony's remarks and actions, which many
political circles on the island consider to be an affront to the
legal government of the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the reference to the so-called officials
of the illegal Turkish Cypriot regime do not help in the slightest
the efforts to reach a settlement in Cyprus because they encourage
the Turkish side to divert from the spirit of U.N. decisions,"
government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
Fending off criticism, Barsony justified his address to Denktash
as "president" by saying the Turkish Cypriot politician is a party
leader and therefore entitled to being called "president".
</P>
<P>
Denktash, however, is no longer the leader of a party.
</P>
<P>
As for his overnight stay in the Turkish Cypriot area, he said
he needed to spend more time there to be better informed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Only Turkey has recognized the breakaway state in the Turkish
Cypriot area unilaterally declared in 1983.

<HEADLINE> French Parliament Adopts Law on Fighting International Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The draft law was presented by the Minister of Justice
Elisabeth Guigou and was passed in its first reading in March by a
mixed commission of the National Assembly and the Senate, the two
houses of the French Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The law transplants into the French law five engagements in a
convention signed by the European Union (EU) in terms of fighting
against corruption of foreign officials in international
commercial transactions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from EU countries, other members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have also signed the
convention.
</P>
<P>
Guigou said that the law will be a cornerstone for the fight
against economic and financial crimes and that France will regard
this fight as one of its priorities during its rotating EU
presidency in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
``Faced with a corruption which is becoming international,
France should promote, in coordination with its partners in OECD
and EU, a reaction of greater firmness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The law has a clause calling for punishment of up to 10 years
in prison for acts of paying kickbacks to foreign officials,
including public servants, judges and judicial officers.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Approves Creation of First Islamic Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Parliament late Tuesday
approved the establishment of the country's first Islamic cultural
center and mosque in the capital city of Athens.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was carried with 55 votes in favor and 40 against
in the parliament's summer session, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposal envisages the building of the complex in Paiania,
some 15 kilometers from the center of Athens, before the 2004
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
There is no exact number for the Muslims in Athens, but they
are thought to number in the tens of thousands, and most are
either immigrants or members of Greece's 120,000-strong Muslim
minority in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong protests from local residents, lawmakers and
some clergymen, the Greek government has insisted that a mosque
will be built in Athens for the first time since the end of
Ottoman Turkish rule.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said recently that
it was their intention that Muslims living in Greece would be able
to practice their religious duties at a site which unfortunately
did not exist now.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Sworn in for Fourth Term as Fed Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Alan Greenspan on Tuesday was
sworn in for his fourth four-year term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve, the U.S. central bank.
</P>
<P>
A private ceremony was held Tuesday in Greenspan's office, with
Roger Ferguson Jr., vice chairman of the Fed's Board of Governors,
administering the oath.
</P>
<P>
In February, Greenspan overwhelmingly won Senate confirmation
for a fourth term as Fed chairman, a job often called the second
most powerful in the country because of the central bank's control
over interest rates.
</P>
<P>
First appointed to the Fed job by Ronald Reagan in 1987,
Greenspan subsequently earned three more nominations, one from
George Bush in 1992 and two from Bill Clinton, first in 1996 and
again in January.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's supporters give him much credit for the remarkable
performance of the U.S. economy, which is now in its longest-ever
streak of uninterrupted growth.

All 200 residents were evacuated as a precaution against a
possibility of fire after the accident in the area. No injuries
were reported and residents were allowed to return home Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Cass County sheriff's dispatcher Steve
Harvey as saying that 106-car Norfolk Southern freight train was
traveling from Peru to Logansport when 19 cars went off the tracks
about 15 kilometers short of its destination.
</P>
<P>
Tank cars in the train were empty but had been carrying liquid
propylene, so some residue remained, said Norfolk Southern
spokeswoman Susan Bland.
</P>
<P>
"There was no actual spill, there's no contamination, there's
no danger to the public," she said.
</P>

Propylene forms a flammable gas when it evaporates, and Bland

<HEADLINE> Feature: Peace -- Voice From Kenya on Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- "Peace, we insist on; peace, we
pray for," hundreds of Kenyan girl scouts chanted and the strong
voice of peace echoed in the Kenya National Museum here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Let us watch our trees grow with us, away from war, blood and
tears," the lovely children sang at a gathering in celebration of
the 26th Africa Refugee Day, which was attended by Kenyan
government officials, foreign diplomats as well as officials from
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Their vivid performance moved the people in the museum hall and
made them reflect on existing refugee problems and their children
in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Our children will only watch their trees grow in an
environment of peace and stability," the UNHCR representative to
Kenya Daniel Tshitungi said.
</P>
<P>
"However, if peace is to decisively replace war and suffering
throughout this continent, it is going to require the shared
responsibility of all Africans, including leaders and individual
men and women," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"On Africa Refugee Day today, I call upon all persons of
goodwill to do all what it takes to put an end to the spiral of
violence and persecution that has sent over 5 million people away
from their homes in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 refugees now live in the four major refugee camps
in northern and northeastern Kenya, mainly from the war-ravaging
countries of Somalia and Sudan. The first wave of refugees arrived
in Kenya in 1991 when the war erupted in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 22 million refugees and internally displaced persons
in the world, 6.3 million are from Africa.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration of Africa Refugee Day began on June 20, 1974
to mark the coming into effect of the 1969 Organization of African
Unity Convention on Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's Africa Refugee Day is "Vision for the
Future: Africa Without Refugees".
</P>
<P>
"This day reminds us to live together in harmony because
science, technology, even money can not reduce conflict without
peace in our mind," one representative from the Kenyan National
Museum said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenyan Minister for Home Affairs, Heritage and Sports
Noah Ngala said that there is so much violence and violation of
human rights within the continent that people are left in despair.
</P>
<P>
"The situation looks hopeless when you consider what is
happening in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Sudan, Somalia and the remaining part of Horn of Africa where
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war for the last two years," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"I am not painting a pathetic and hopeless situation but I want
to show the magnitude of the problem. To solve these problems,
leaders should resolve to dialogue instead of the gun and the
matchette," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngala also reiterated his government's effort in supporting the
work by the UNHCR in Kenya, where peace has prevailed since the
country won independence in 1963.
</P>
<P>
"We have come up with Refugee Bill which will soon be presented
to Parliament and the bill is supposed to seal the loopholes,
which have hampered operations in the refugee administration," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations ended with tree-planting by girl scouts and
the minister in the sunshine, which Ngala said was to signify the
hope for the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos
Santos has not ruled out the possibility of pardoning the veteran
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, although the president still held
Savimbi responsible for the 25-year civil war, the official news
agency Angop said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dos santos, who is now visiting the central coast province of
Bengo, said that all the Savimbi followers, "perhaps Savimbi
himself" will be well received by the government if they lay down
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, Savimbi's war machinery has been
ruined and the Angolan government will continue to annihilate
their supporting bases.
</P>
<P>
Although the government troops won victory in the central
highland battlefield, the rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Savimbi scattered into
small groups and launched a lot of attacks all around the country.

<HEADLINE> Shas Urged not to Make more Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Politicians and cabinet ministers
of One Israel headed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday urged the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party not to make more demands, but take a more
flexible attitude in solving the coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat from One Israel said raising
more demands by Shas party will cause more difficulties for Barak
and the government who are trying to solve the current coalition
problem.
</P>
<P>
Four Shas cabinet ministers and two deputy ministers officially
submitted their resignations to Barak Tuesday afternoon. The
minister's resignations will take effect in 48 hours under relevant
Israeli law, while the deputy minister's resignations came into
effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
Shochat outlined the demands raised so far by Shas, which
include allocation of more funds for Shas' school system,
legalization of its radio stations and Shas' involvement of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have already reached agreements till Monday night
on almost all of the Shas' demands and no body can understand why
Shas ministers still submitted their resignations to the prime
minister, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several politicians of One Israel urged the Meretz
party headed by Education Minister Yossi Sarid to change their
attitude toward Shas.
</P>
<P>
The next 48 hours will be crucial for Barak and he is likely to
use the time for more talks with Shas to try to meet its demands.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement has been reached by the two sides within 48
hours, Barak has to accept the resignations of the Shas cabinet
ministers, which might destroy Barak's parliamentary majority at a
critical juncture in the Middle East peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Shas Council of Sages decided last Tuesday to allow its cabinet
ministers to submit their resignations to Barak "during the next
cabinet meeting," if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
Barak postponed the cabinet meeting slated on Sunday in order to
solve the crisis. During the period, cabinet ministers from One
Israel held several rounds of meetings with Shas, bot failed to
work out a final agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Shas' educational system was in deep financial debt due to poor
management in the past years and it has asked the Education
Ministry under Yossi Sarid to allocate more funds for the school
system, but its request was rejected by Sarid.
</P>
<P>
One Israel Cabinet ministers met with Shas leaders Monday night
and progress was reported in the talks as the two sides had agreed
on almost all issues raised by Shas.
</P>
<P>
But the talks became tougher as Shas' spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef had introduced a new clause in the Shas' document of
demands, namely preserving territory in the hand of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in the prime minister's court," said Shas' Eli
Suissa, the National Infrastructure Minister.
</P>
<P>
Shas has 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament) and
with Shas, Barak's coalition has governed the country with a 68-52
majority.

aiming at activating the private sector, according to a Syrian
source.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian cabinet minister, who asked not to be named, was quoted
by Tuesday's Al-Hayat newspaper as saying "there is no fresh policy
but a yen to achieve sustained development. Yet, there will be new
procedures to encourage the private sector but in the context of
the pioneering role played by the public sector."
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The Iranian government has taken financial procedures
to activate and boost non-oil exports which are on the wane, said
Iranian Minister of Commerce Mohammad Shariatmadari.
</P>
<P>
Exporters are not committed any more to offering banking
collateral and there will not be any ceiling for export funds, the
minister was quoted by Tuesday's Al-Hayat newspaper.
</P>
<P>
SANNA -- The Yemeni riyal registered a striking hike after a
border agreement was hammered out between Yemen and Saudi Arabia,
according to bankers.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the US dollar hit 155 riyals in Sanaa last
Sunday against 162 riyals last Wednesday, reported the Arab
economic Al-Alam Al-Youm newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the demand for the foreign currencies, particularly
the U.S. dollar, has been on the decrease at a rate of 40 percent
since the Saudi-Yemeni agreement was recently clinched.
</P>
<P>
TUNISIA -- The prices of locally-made and imported cigarettes
were raised by the National Tunisian Tobacco Company, the
monoplizer of cigarette production in Tunisia, by 3.5 percent on
average.
</P>
<P>
The fresh prices have been valid since last Monday, involving
roughly 70 kinds of cigarettes mainly including U.S. Marlboro and
French Jouloise.
</P>
<P>
The new prices range between 0.203 U.S. dollar and 2.188 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King, U.N. Chief Discuss Peace Keeping in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
and visiting U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan met on Tuesday over
the developments in the Middle East peace process, particularly the
peace keeping in Lebanon after Israel pulled out its troops.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah stressed the U.N. should serve as a
monitor to ensure Israel will pull out its last soldier after it
claimed a complete withdrawal from south Lebanon last month after
22 years of occupation, said sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Annan also discussed the latest developments in the
peace process between Israeli and Syria, Lebanon and the
Palestinians, as well as the U.N. role of promoting the peace talks
on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Jordan's Prime Minister Ali Abu
Ragheb who was sworn in on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
Khatib, Annan commended the active participation of the Jordanian
armed forces in U.N. peace keeping efforts in international hot
spots and called on other Arab countries to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N chief arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day
visit on the fourth leg of his regional tour, which has taken him
to Iran, Egypt, Lebanon and will also take him to Syria, Israel and
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Holds Talks with Slovak Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRATISLAVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, held
talks with Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a warm and friendly atmosphere, Li and Dzurinda exchanged
views on bilateral relations and other issues of common concern,
according to sources who attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Li said he visited Slovakia 15 years ago and the revisit has
aroused his intimate feelings.
</P>
<P>
Dzurinda said Slovakia attaches importance to expanding
relations with China and thanks China for taking the lead in
extending diplomatic recognition to Slovakia several years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have maintained good relations of
cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic ties, expressing
his belief that Li's current visit will surely promote such
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said at present economic cooperation and trade between the
two countries lag behind their good political relations. He
expressed the hope that Slovakia and China will further their
cooperation in electricity generating equipment.
</P>
<P>
In response, Li said there exists profound and traditional
friendship between the Chinese and Slovak peoples. China is
satisfied with the continuous growth of exchanges and cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said China respects the Slovak people's choice in
development road and gave prompt diplomatic recognition to
Slovakia after its independence. China respects and understands
Slovakia's policies of good-neighborliness and application for
entry into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to further expand Sino-Slovak relations on the
basis of the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual
benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, Li
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China sets great store by expanding
economic cooperation and trade with Slovakia, which have great
potential for development.
</P>
<P>
He said he will tell relevant Chinese government departments to
take into consideration the areas of cooperation suggested by the
Slovak side. He stressed the importance of expanding commodity
trade, adding that enterprises of the two countries can have
direct contacts and discuss business rather than through entrepot
trade.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Dzurinda, Li also briefed him on China's
relations with Russia and the United States, and China's views on
the situation of the Korean Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Court Told Libyan Desert Bomb Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A key witness told
the Scottish court on Dutch soil Tuesday that Libya had bought 20
electronic detonation timers to trigger bombs in desert tests.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Bollier, co-owner of the Geneva-based electronics
manufacturer MEBO AG, told the Lockerbie trial court that he
himself witnessed the tests in the Sabha Desert near Tripoli,
Libya
</P>
<P>
He said that he had sold electronic timers to members of the
Libyan military security service in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"Aircraft bombs were detonated," Bollier said in court through
the court's English-language translation of his testimony in
German.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have claimed that one of the timers sold by the
Swiss company MEBO AG set off the explosion that destroyed the Pan
Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988, killing 259 people on board
and 11 others on the ground when the New York-bound plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
The first five and the final 10 electronic timers were hand-
delivered by Bollier to Libya, with five others sent through the
Libyan embassy in the then German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Bollier identified one of the Libyan accused as a man he had
done business with on several occasions before the 1988 bombing
tragedy. He pointed the Libyan out in the courtroom just as his
MEBO AG co-owner Erwin Meyer did last Friday when testifying.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen al-Amin Khalifa Fahima
were accused of conspiracy to murder, murder and breach of
international aircraft safety law.
</P>
<P>
Both denied the charges brought against them.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial went underway on May 3 this year after
almost 12 years of investigation and preparation and is expected
to last up to a year before the two accused can be announced
either guilty or innocent.

<HEADLINE> China Underlines Independence and Impartiality of ICTY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China said Tuesday that the
independence and impartiality of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) are extremely important.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council meeting on the ICTY.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government believes that ICTY, as an organ of the
international criminal justice, its independence and impartiality
are extremely important, the Tribunal should not be affected by
international political factors and other factors, nor should it
become a political tool," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the independence and impartiality of the ICTY be
upheld can its authority be guaranteed," he said. "Only in this
way the work of the ICTY will be standing the test of history."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the ICTY has many areas that need to be
improved," he said. "This is also one of the problems faced by the
ICTY."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the ICTY will become a real independent and
impartial international justice organ," he said. "But at least it
is not one now because it is affected by the international
politics too much."
</P>
<P>
Some representatives, who spoke before Shen, gave some
examples to show how the ICTY is affected by the international
politics.
</P>
<P>
"I believe my criticism is constructive, and I hope the ICTY
will really work towards independence and impartiality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the 15-nation Council, Claude Jorda, president of the
ICTY, raised the proposal that ICTY lacks the trial capacity and
the Pool of Ad Litem Judges should be established.
</P>
<P>
In response, Shen said that the proposal "is a very
interesting idea."
</P>
<P>
However, Jorda's proposal to amend the ICTY status is
associated with many important legal, technical and financial
problems, the Security Council can not make a decision on this
issue in a hurry.

<HEADLINE> EU to Support Russian Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The
European Union on Tuesday expressed its support for Russia's new
president and his efforts to reform and modernize his country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc said after its two-day summit by heads of
state and government that the European Union offers its support to
the efforts being made by President Vladimir Putin and the new
Russian government to modernize and reform their country.
</P>
<P>
"A strong and healthy partnership must be maintained between
the union and Russia," said a written statement issued after the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the partnership has to be based on
common values like respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
The union said that democratic institutions, rule of law, a
market-oriented economy with an effective regulatory framework and
tax structures as well as accession to the World Trade
Organization are the best means of building and sustaining the
investor confidence necessary for the successful development of
the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
"The union stands ready to assist Russia in meeting these
aspirations, objectives and commitments," said the EU leaders.
</P>
<P>
The union stopped short of condemning Russia for its role in
Chechnya as the union often did in the past. It was prepared to
decide on financial aids to Russia when the European council and
commission meet in July.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Launch Report on Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan will launch a landmark report entitled "Better World for All
" on the first day of the United Nations General Assembly Special
Session on Social Development, U.N. said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented collaborative report is co-authored by the
United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
</P>
<P>
The report finds that by 2015, world poverty could be
significantly decreased if developing and industrialized countries
implement their commitments to attack the root causes of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The report focuses on specific interrelated development goals,
set during world conferences in the 1990s, which could improve the
lives of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly of the United Nations decided in 1995 to
hold a special session in the year 2000 in Geneva for a review and
appraisal of the implementation of the outcome of the World Summit
for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the special session, to be held from June 26-
30, will be to reaffirm the Copenhagen Declaration and Program of
Action, to identify progress made and constraints encountered and
to recommend concrete actions and initiatives to further efforts
towards full and effective implementation of the agreements
reached at the Summit.

<HEADLINE> European Education Conference Closes in Bucharest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from 35 European countries and relevant institutions,
including 22 education ministers, participated in the two-day
debates, with "Social Cohesion and Quality -- A Challenge for
Education" as the major topic. The conference is co-sponsored by
the education ministries of Romania and Portugal with the support
of the EU's executive body, the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Marga said that "school should be at the center of the
community, irrespective of the level of development of a society."
He added that in a society based on knowledge and innovation
education should focus on social problems, while raising its
quality should be a constant concern. "Only the people with a
solid basic education and who are learning permanently, during
their entire life can face the challenges of modern societies,"
Marga said.
</P>
<P>
One of the decisions taken by the conference was that school
should support the economy with trained personnel, the Romanian
Education Minister said. Education units, therefore, should train
students for those fields required by the country's economy, he
pointed out. High technologies, particularly the Internet, should
be introduced in schools on a massive scale, without, however,
impairing the professors' role, Marga underscored. "School should
be the place where information is conveyed to students in such
manner that, after graduation, they be able to find a job," Marga
said.
</P>
<P>
The Conference of European Ministers of Education was launched
as a forum to talk about the most important education issues in
the region with an aim to enhance cooperation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Influx of Zimbabweans Seeking Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African Department
of Home Affairs has denied media reports about an influx of
Zimbabweans seeking refugees before Zimbabwe's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Only 26 Zimbabweans had applied for asylum in South Africa
since 1994, spokeswoman Manase Makwela was quoted on Tuesday by
the South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The department repatriates on average 180,000 illegal
immigrants a year and of these, 42,000 are from Zimbabwe," Makwela
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore not abnormal to have Zimbabweans returned home
if they are found crossing the South African borders illegally,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Makwela said that because Africa Refugee Day was being
commemorated on Tuesday, there had been an added interest from
asylum seekers on the withdrawal of work and study authorization
for them.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the new regulations, no asylum seeker is allowed to
work or study in South Africa until their application is
finalized.
</P>
<P>
The department is required to decide on the application within
180 days of the completed asylum application being filed with a
refugee reception office.
</P>
<P>
If the department fails to adjudicate a case within 180 days ,
the applicant will be permitted to apply for work or study
authorization.
</P>
<P>
Makwela said many people came to South Africa not because they
had suffered persecution in their country, but because they were
driven by social and economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa acknowledges that economic migrants are not less
deserving of protection than refugees are, but such protection is
provided under a different regime.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow the refugee regime to be misused by economic
migrants and criminal syndicates," she said.
</P>
<P>
Makwela said since 1994 the department had received 60,000
applications for asylum from 109 different countries.
</P>
<P>
"This figure is relatively small by international and regional
standards, but adjudicating applications from such an array of
states is a daunting challenge," Makwela said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Receives $81M Grant From Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia on Tuesday signed an
agreement with Britain which will provide 81 million U.S. dollars
to help privatize a subsidiary of the state-owned Zambian
Consolidated Copper Mining (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Katele Kalumba, Zambia's
minister of Finance and Economic Development, said that had
Britain not provided the money, Zambian taxpayers would have to
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba hailed Britain's commitment, saying the grant was
designed to support the economic restructuring process of the
country after finishing the privatization of ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government would now move quickly to restore
balance among different sectors that have suffered due to the
delayed sale of ZCCM' s assets.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, British High Commissioner to Zambia
Thomas Young hailed the privatization of ZCCM, saying the
government took the right direction in privatizing the mines.
</P>
<P>
Young said he believed the grant would allow the government to
focus on poverty reduction and pledged to continue to help Zambia,
especially this year, when the issue of the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) comes up.
</P>
<P>
Young also noted that other assistance from Britain would
continue to be made available in the fields of education and
health, especially those related to HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation rate
rose to 5.1 percent last month, up from 4.5 percent in April,
Statistics South Africa (SSA) announced in Pretoria on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The main contributors were annual increases in transport
because of a 26.3 percent rise in the petrol prices over the year,
food, medical care and health expenses and household operation,"
head of the SSA Mark Orkin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
These factors were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage
interest rates, which dropped from 19 to 14.5 percent in the last
12 months.
</P>
<P>
Orkin said the core inflation rate in metropolitan areas fell
from 8.6 percent in April to 8.2 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation excludes interest rates on mortgage bonds,
overdrafts, assessment rates, fresh and frozen meat, fish, fresh
and frozen vegetables, fresh and frozen fruit and nuts.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index, excluding the interest rate on
mortgage bonds, decreased from 8.6 percent to 8.5 percent last
month in metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
Orkin said food prices rose at annual rate of 8.8 percent last
month, up from 8.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
"This was mainly due to annual increases in the price of
vegetables, meat and grain products which contributed more than 70
percent to the 8.8 percent increase," Orkin said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges African Nations to Curb Worsening Refugee Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary
general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Tuesday
expressed grave concern over worsening refugee problems in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"As we commemorate the 31st anniversary of the OAU Convention
governing the specific aspects of the refugees problem in Africa,
the population of refugees and displaced persons on the continent
continue to raise to an alarming proportions," Salim said in a
statement to mark Africa Refugee Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Convention on Refugees came into force on June 20,
1974.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, since the early 1960, when there were
some 950,000 refugees in Africa, the figure has quadrupled to a
staggering 4 million people driven from their countries.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to millions more displaced inside their own
 countries, the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
To curb the deterioration of refugee problems, Salim urged
African countries to end scourge of conflicts, to pay more
attention to the issues of human rights and eradication of poverty
and to speed up democratization process.
</P>
<P>
"Without the commitment and political will by our member states
to tackle these issues, the problem of refugees and displaced
persons will not be resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim also appealed to the international community to provide
additional resources to the refugees and displaced people in
Africa and to avoid applying double standards when mobilizing
assistance to refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
"The donor community reacted swiftly in helping refugees and
displaced persons in Kosovo and East Timor while seeming to forget
about African refugees," Salim complained.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Flood Victims at Risk of Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- About 70,000 victims of the
February floods in the southern Mozambican province of Gaza are in
danger of running short of food because of difficult access roads,
 the World Food Programme (WFP) said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said that this figure amounts to almost half of the
about 150, 000 current beneficiaries of emergency aid in Gaza,
Tuesday's issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias" reported.
</P>
<P>
The WFP explained that the problem now is not the availability
of food, but access, largely because of restrictions imposed on
the Chissano-Chibuto road, that was reopened to traffic early this
month.
</P>
<P>
No trucks with trailers are allowed on that road which is still
under repair, and vehicles can only use it if they travel in
convoys and at fixed times of the day.
</P>
<P>
The director of the National Disasters Management Institute
(INGC), Silvano Langa, said that his institution has been
negotiating with the National Roads Administration (ANE) to allow
INGC vehicles on the road outside of the fixed times, but no
consensus has yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
Langa said that the people still in need are those from
isolated areas in the northern regions of the province, including
the districts of Massangem, Chicualacuala and Chibuto.
</P>
<P>
He said that if no solution is found to the Chissano-Chibuto
road, his institution will have to consider other alternatives,
including resorting, yet again, to the extremely expensive use of
airlifts.
</P>
<P>
Another alternative considered was to avoid the
Chissano-Chibuto road by ferrying the goods via Zimbabwe from the
port city of Beira by rail.
</P>
<P>
This would entail using the Beira Corridor to take the goods
into Zimbabwe, and then the Limpopo railway line to bring them
into northern Gaza. The Limpopo line was severely damaged by the
floods in southern Gaza, but is intact in the north of the
province.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that many flood victims in southern and central
provinces will still need free food aid until September.

JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has asked commercial banks to assist in financing the
redistribution of South African farm land, Minister of Land
Affairs Thoko Didiza said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament's portfolio committee on land and
agricultural affairs, the minister said her department and
representatives from the Banking Council will meet shortly to
discuss plans for banks to assist in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The banks are willing to participate in the redistribution of
land," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Didiza, the ministry has first approached the
banks in April, and the two parties have been in close
consultation since then.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture department planners have estimated that government
land reform plans will cost the country about 5.5 billion rand
(about 808 million U.S. dollars) over the next 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking later in the National Council of Provinces, she
acknowledged the current pace of land redistribution is not
acceptable, but stressed this is a complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, she said, it is not a matter only for
government, but the responsibility of all sectors of the
community.
</P>
<P>
Didiza said government does not own sufficient land to cover
its redistribution targets and will have to purchase farmland on
the market, as well as induce farmers to sell their land.
</P>
<P>
The government will also welcome donations of farm land from
white farmers, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Land Minister Dirk du Toit, 30 percent of
state land in South Africa will be redistributed to black peasants
over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Between five and seven percent of state-owned land was
currently available for redistribution, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Visits Turkey on Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Alvaro De Soto, U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan's special envoy for Cyprus, said here Tuesday
that he hoped the two sides in Cyprus would attend the third round
of proximity talks to be held in Geneva on July 5.
</P>
<P>
De Soto said this after a 45-minute meeting with Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem, adding that Annan also wanted the two sides to
join the talks in Geneva, Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Five days ago, the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution
extending the presence of U.N. peacekeepers in Cyprus, slammed by
Turkey for ignoring the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the
north of the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's angry response stemmed from the resolution's referral
to the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot government as the
legitimate power on the divided island and its failure to mention
the Turkish Cypriot entity, recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a Mediterranean island, has been divided since 1974 when
Turkey occupied its northern third in response to a coup in Nicosia
seeking to unite the island with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Backed by Turkey, the north proclaimed by itself the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash is still undecided on
whether or not to attend the U.N.-brokered talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash is pushing for a confederation of two separate states
while his Greek Cypriot counterpart Glafcos Clerides and the
international community favor a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation in
the island.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that De Soto's visit aims to ask Ankara to
persuade its protege Denktash to attend the scheduled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had been wrangling over a paragraph on the need
for Turkish Cypriot consent to the peacekeepers' operations in
northern Cyprus, which the Greek Cypriot government criticized as
amounting to recognition of the northern regime.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers was sent to Cyprus in March 1964 after
inter-communal riots. The resolution, adopted unanimously by the
security council, extended the mandate of the force until December
15.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots warned that if the U.N. insists on not "
rectifying the mistake" it has made, they will "have the right to
close the passage gates for the U.N. peacekeepers, because we have
no accord with the U.N. on the operations in our territory."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Commends Jordan's Role in Peace Keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 20 (xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday commended the active participation of Jordanian
armed forces in U.N. peace keeping efforts in international hot
spots and called on other countries to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib,
Annan praised in particular the role of Jordanian peace keepers in
Sierra Leone, without which he said the U.N. would have been unable
to launch its peace keeping mission in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan has dispatched 1,850 soldiers, the largest
contingent from a single country, to take part in the U.N. peace
keeping in Sierra Leone. The kingdom has also sent its servicemen
to Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on other countries to follow the example of Jordan
to participate in international peace keeping efforts in trouble
spots like Ethiopia and Eritrea, which reached a cease fire on
Sunday after a fierce border conflict.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Khatib said his country will continue to play an
active role in U.N. peace keepings when they were discussing the
situation in Lebanon after Israel pulled out its troops last month
after 22 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day visit.
Jordan is the fourth leg of his regional tour which has taken him
to Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, and will take him to Syria, Israel and
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to hold talks with Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein and Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb over developments of
the Arab-Israeli peace process in the region and on U.N. peace
makings worldwide.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Gap Narrows Slightly in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit, after
setting records every month this year, finally posted a small
decline to 30.4 billion U.S. dollars in April as imports fell for
the first time in 15 months, the Commerce Department report
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
April's trade deficit was 0.4 percent lower than the record-
high trade imbalance of 30.6 billion dollars in March, reflecting
in large part a drop in crude oil prices after nine consecutive
monthly increases.
</P>
<P>
Total imports of goods and services fell 0.2 percent to 117.1
billion dollars in April, the first decline in imports since
December 1998. Energy imports dropped 7.1 percent to 9.02 billion
dollars in April as crude oil prices, after rising for nine
straight months, fell to 24.42 dollars per barrel from 26.38
dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
The exports were off a tiny 0.03 percent to 86.7 billion
dollars with the weakness confined to services, which includes
such things as airline tickets and copyright payments. Exports of
goods were up slightly to a record 62.6 billion dollars,
reflecting a big jump in airline sales and strong increases in
American exports of telecommunications equipment and computer
accessories.
</P>
<P>
Even with April's improvement, the deficit for the first four
months of this year is running at an annual rate of 350 billion
dollars, far surpassing last year's record deficit of 265 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a second report, the government said the broadest measure of
trade, the current account, climbed to a record of 102.3 billion
dollars in the first three months of this year, up 6.3 percent
from a 96.2-billion-dollar deficit in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The current account includes not only trade in goods and
services, which are contained in the monthly figures the
government releases, but also investment flows and foreign aid
payments.
</P>
<P>
For April, the deficit with Japan hit an all-time high of 7.3
billion dollars, up 7.4 percent from March. Imports from Japan had
hit an all-time high in March and were down only slightly in April.
</P>
<P>
The gap with Canada jumped to 3.91 billion dollars in April,
the second-highest on record, compared to 3.52 billion dollars in
the previous month. The deficit with western Europe narrowed to 4.
65 billion dollars from 5.86 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Austria Agrees to EU Savings Tax With Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Austria,
the last holdout to cave in to the European Union savings tax
package, set aside conditions before agreeing Tuesday to the
package that still needs at least 10 more years to take full
effect.
</P>
<P>
Austria, like Luxembourg that prospers on the banking sector,
cannot accept a move to drop banking secrecy for non-residents for
constitutional reasons and, like Luxembourg, may operate the
withholding tax during the transition period envisaged for between
2003 and 2009.
</P>
<P>
Austria was the last among the EU 15 to agree to the EU savings
tax package under heated and repeated discussion for the past two
years after the European Union worked 10 years to produce a draft
package to be placed on the discussion table.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc was desperate to fight tax evasions in the
form of cross-border savings that have been enjoying the benefit
of tax-free treatment for non-residents in EU countries other than
their own.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border savings have resulted in tax revenue losses in
billions of United States dollars a year to the EU as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the EU member states worked out a
draft proposal that requires member states to either levy tax on
cross-border savings or exchange information on non-resident
accountholders to enable their home countries to collect tax.
</P>
<P>
Austria, already at the center of a dispute over whether to
lift the political sanctions after it incorporated the extreme-
right Freedom Party into the governing coalition, strongly opposed
to the savings tax package until late Tuesday right after the two-
day EU summit was scheduled to conclude without reaching an accord.
</P>
<P>
A compromise was struck in the hour after the originally
scheduled end of the summit. The compromise containing eight
clauses made the savings tax package appear still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg, for one, insists that third countries and
territories like the United States, Switzerland and Liechtenstein
have to work out their equivalents or same measures before it can
implement the savings tax package.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Britain expected that the rate of
the withholding tax will be at least between 20 and 25 percent of
the savings interests.
</P>
<P>
The issue of savings tax package, originally a side show of the
two-day summit, stole the limelight from the very beginning in
that Austria, that has been under political sanctions imposed
against it by its 14 EU partners, held out against the package
until after the scheduled ending time of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Though Portugal, Austria and the European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, all denied that a deal was
struck to coax Austria to step back in unison with the other EU
member states, commission president Romano Prodi said that his
institution would stand out to play the role of mediator in what
has so far been termed "bilateral rows".
</P>
<P>
"When one part of the union is in difficulty, the other part of
the union also suffers," said the commission president, "I hope
that there will be no referendum on the relations between Austria
and the EU."
</P>
<P>
The Austrian public has been considering a referendum in the
coming autumn on the country's relationship with the union after
they were politically sanctioned on February 4 when Joerg Haider's
Freedom Party was incorporated into the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
Prodi promised on Tuesday to work out a solution to the
sanctions issue in the "very near future". That could mean an end
of sanctions of sort within the next 10 days before Portugal's
rotating EU presidency expires on June 30.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Trade Surplus Down in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's international trade
surplus dropped by about 29 percent to 3.2 billion Canadian
dollars (about 2.18 billion U.S. dollars) in April compared with
the previous month, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports dropped 3 percent from March to 32.8 billion
Canadian dollars (about 22.4 billion U.S. dollars) in April, while
imports fell 0.3 percent to 29.6 billion Canadian dollars (about
20.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A 4.6-percent decline in Canada's auto production was
attributed to the slashed trade surplus in the month, said the
official statistics bureau.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Form Commission on Transdnestria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
has ordered the establishment of a state commission to speed up
the process of settling the Transdnestria issue with Moldova,
reported the Russian newspaper Kommersant on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Chisinau, capital of Moldova, at the
weekend, Putin announced this plan and appointed former Russian
Premier Yevgeny Primakov as head of the commission, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Putin urged to speed up the work on a comprehensive treaty
between Russia and Moldova on the withdrawal of Russian troops
from the Transdnestrian region.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia will proceed with this issue on the basis of the
Moldovan constitution and the decisions of international
organizations, including the Organization of Security and
Cooperation for Europe.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia supports Moldova's efforts to become a self-
sufficient state with territorial integrity, "this goal cannot be
achieved unless the interests of the entire population of the
republic, including that of Transdnestria, are taken into account,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is ready to participate in establishing conditions
under which everybody will feel safe in Moldova," he added.
</P>
<P>
Transdnestria is an industrial region along the left bank of
the Dnestr River in Moldova densely populated by Russian-speaking
residents. It began to seek independence in 1990 and later
declared itself an independent state.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum granting Transdnestria broad autonomy within the
Moldova border was signed in Moscow in 1997, but Transdnestrian
leaders insist they wanted full statehood.

<HEADLINE> Austria Finally Agrees to Savings Tax Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FEIRA, Portugal, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Feira European Union (
EU) summit salvaged on Tuesday its 12-year effort to pass a
savings tax package by making modifications to accommodate Austria.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said that after 12
years of discussion, there is finally a rule to follow in the
combat against tax evasions in the form of cross-border tax-free
bank savings.
</P>
<P>
"All the delegates (to the summit) were cooperative and
constructive," said the prime minister whose country is holding
the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Portugal is coming toward the end of its tenure and France is
taking over on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The two-day EU summit almost concluded without reaching any
agreement on the tax package and how the Austrians have changed
their minds after holding out for five rounds of prolonged talks
spanning two full days was still left unexplained.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border tax package requires EU member states to first
concentrate on concrete national measures before the end of this
year while third countries like the United States, Switzerland,
Liechtenstein will have to be involved between 2001 and 2002 to
work out their equivalents of the EU tax package to make it fully
feasible.
</P>
<P>
Finally, beginning in 2003 the transition toward full
implementation of the tax package will take the next seven years
when the exchange of information on the bank accounts held by non-
residents facilitates the final taxation on cross-border savings.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border savings have been enjoying tax-free benefit in EU
countries other than home countries yet have resulted in tax
revenue losses in billions of U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The discussion on a tax package has lasted two full years and
made changes after changes due to the opposition by Britain,
Luxembourg and Austria.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Focuses on E-volution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) - Donald Tsang, financial secretary
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said Tuesday that
Hong Kong has a clear focus of how to make the most of the e-
volution by excelling in information technology, multi-media
applications, Internet content and services and in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Pacific
Telecommunications Council mid-year meeting, Tsang told regional
leaders in the telecommunications sector that three small letters -
- www -- has changed people's lives. In order to take advantage of
the potential of the World Wide Web, people should work on three
other www applications: "Wiring, Warding and Welding."
</P>
<P>
"In the Internet Age, we must be extensively wired; we must
ward against the risks which could damage our business environment;
and we must weld together international partners to explore the
enormous opportunities in the world of ones and zeros," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"This is the challenge that we face as a government. This is
the challenge that all of you face as leaders in the Internet Age,
and we will be watching with great interest your deliberations,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
As in the case of Hong Kong, Tsang said, the strategy was
articulated in November 1998 in the policy paper "Digital 21."
</P>
<P>
"Digital 21" contains three essential elements designed to make
Hong Kong an international IT hub.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong now has one of the most competitive
telecommunications markets in the world. Our broadband network,
entirely private-sector driven, covers all commercial buildings
and more than 80 percent of households," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with its first-class business environment, well-
regulated financial markets and banking sector, Hong Kong is the
best place to do business in Asia. The establishment of the Growth
Enterprise Market and the listing of Nasdaq stocks on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange will also help consolidate Hong Kong's IT
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Telecommunications Council is an international, non-
profit, non-governmental organization founded in 1980 in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
Council members include researchers and policy-makers from
academic, community and governmental institutions. It is the first
time for Hong Kong to play host to its mid-year conference. The
theme of the current conference is "The Internet Age: Asia Pacific
into the 21st Century."

<HEADLINE> Drug Problem Serious in Turkey, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish police report indicates
that the drug problem has been serious in the country, with the
number of drugs users on the rise in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Nine people lost their lives in the year due to drugs overdoses,
according to the report released by Security General Headquarters'
Smuggling and Organized Crime Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,209 suspects, involved in 2,857 drug smuggling
cases handled by the security forces, were taken into custody, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
During the year-round operations, police seized 5,458 kilograms
of harshish, 2,249 kilograms of heroin, 288 kilograms of base
morphine, 234 kilograms o opium, 13 kilograms of cocaine and 26,296
kilograms of acidic anhydride, a chemical used in heroin
production.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared as part of a study of the struggle against
drug smuggling and organized crime, further notes that narcotics is
an integral part of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Terror organizations and organized crime gangs thrive on the
revenues from drug trafficking, it says, adding that the money from
drugs is subsequently laundered by sub-organizations sponsored by
these illegal gangs.
</P>
<P>
It accuses the outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers Party of
its "active role" in smuggling drugs, particularly between the
Middle East and Europe via Turkey, "in order to buy weapons and
seek support for their terrorist activities."

<HEADLINE> Interview: Thailand Views World Trade as Engine of Growth by Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand believes that
international trade promotes economic growth and it thus always
adopts positive attitudes toward the rights and obligations of its
World Trade Organization (WTO) membership, Supachai Panitchpakdi,
Thai deputy prime minister and commerce minister, said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"International trade is an engine of growth. The more a country
trades the more it will develop. Therefore, Thailand relies very
much on international trade. We see the benefit free and fair
trade will eventually contribute to our economy," Supachai, also
the WTO director-general-designate, said in a written interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Thailand developed itself into one of the four tiger economies
in East Asia by adopting an export-oriented economic policy and is
now one of the world's largest rice and rubber exporters. Exports
also played an important role in pulling the country out of the
severe economic crisis which hit almost three years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, exports topped the
list of sources of Thailand's impressive growth in the first
quarter of this year with a 25.2-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO is the only international organization dealing with
global rules of trade between nations. The agreements negotiated
and ratified by members lay legal the ground-rules for
international trade, which guarantee member countries,
particularly the small ones, their important trade rights,"
Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO rules, trade friction between WTO members
will be channeled into the WTO dispute settlement process where
focus is on interpreting agreements and commitments and on how to
ensure that countries' policies conform with them.
</P>
<P>
With this mechanism, he said, Thailand, as a small country, is
protected from arbitrary trade restrictions imposed by major
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also benefits from the WTO special provisions for
developing and least developed countries, such as a longer
timeframe for implementing agreements and commitments, said
Supachai, who will succeed the current WTO Director-General Mike
Moore in September 2002.
</P>
<P>
The transparency and predictability aspects of the WTO also
enable Thailand to observe and monitor trade practices of its
trading partners to ensure that they are in conformity with WTO
provisions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Thailand benefits greatly from the available
technical assistance which normally comes in the form of seminars
and training by the WTO staff, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, it is "certainly a high cost" to get
WTO membership since every country has to complete the necessary
reforms in compliance with the WTO requirements while maintaining
policy consistency.
</P>
<P>
Although the Thai government has long been practicing an "
outward-looking" policy and it turned out to be not so difficult
for Thailand to adapt its policies and measures to comply with the
WTO rules and regulations, the country had certainly experienced
some hardships, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the WTO in 1995, the Thai government
has had to amend its outdated laws and regulations and draft new
ones to meet WTO requirements as well as remove some existing
trade barriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
While dealing with the political pressure from the domestic
constituency to retain prohibited trade barriers, he said, the
government has also had to face demand from trade partners to
comply with WTO agreements.
</P>
<P>
As a contracting party to the original General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and a participant of the Uruguay Round
negotiations in which the WTO was established, Thailand did not
need to go through the WTO's accession process. However the
country had long been preparing itself to the challenges brought
about by its entry into the WTO, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
As early as the beginning of the Uruguay Round negotiations, he
said, Thailand recognized the principle of the WTO and the need to
liberalize its market both for agriculture and industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The government tried to educate the farming and manufacturing
sectors on the positive impact of entering the WTO as well as
Thailand's commitments to the Uruguay Round results and provide
better marketing and distribution channels to improve access to
the domestic and foreign markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tripartite committees involving producers, processors and
related government officials have also been set up to evaluate,
prepare and implement the WTO commitments, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Supachai also reiterated Thailand's full
support for China's accession to the WTO and expressed the wish
that the two countries would cooperate on issues discussed in the
WTO.

<HEADLINE> Gas Exploration Companies to Invest in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exploration companies
have agreed to invest 450 million U.S. dollars for the development
of newly discovered gas fields in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This was stated on Tuesday by Pakistan's Minister for Petroleum
and Natural Resources Usman Aminuddin, who however failed to name
the companies.
</P>
<P>
"All major companies in the sector have signed commitments
worth 450 million dollar investment in the country," he said while
briefing reporters upon his return from a tour of France to attend
the World Gas Conference.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the fact that gas will be the major source of fuel in
future, the current Pakistani government has been emphasizing
wider use of the relatively clean energy.
</P>
<P>
Presently 40 percent of the total fuel consumption in Pakistan
is imported diesel and the government is striving to convert all
the diesel-fed machinery to gas,Aminuddin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this will help save a huge amount in foreign
exchange. At present Pakistan spends 2.5 billion dollars annually
on the import of petroleum products.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises in Communal Clash in North Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Monday's fresh
communal clash in North Maluku, Indonesia, rose to 152 and the
number of people wounded to 160, according to the Antara News
Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The clash between Muslims and Christians broke out in the
village of Duma in the subdistrict of Galela in the northern part
of Halmahera island, scene of some of the bloodiest clashes
between rival Christian and Muslim villagers in recent months. The
clash lasted for about one hour. Some 292 homes of villagers in
Duma, including a house of prayer, were burned during the incident.
</P>
<P>
All the victims were killed or wounded by self-made bombs,
arrows or self-made guns. It was reported that most of the dead
were Christians.
</P>
<P>
The fighting stopped after security forces consisting of troops
belonging to a Brawijaya battalion and the Marine Corps drove away
the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
In North Maluku, communal clashes started to happen less than a
year ago whereas in South Maluku they began more than two years
back. The number of people killed and wounded in the Muslim-
Christian confrontation in both provinces now runs into thousands.
</P>
<P>
Monday's clash was one of the worst incidents in nearly two
years of religious and ethnic violence that has plagued Indonesia.

<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh may have 20,000 HIV-
infected cases, World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in
Bangladesh W. Hardjotanojo said here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>

behavior, sexual transmitted diseases, blood transfusion and
prevalence of HIV infection cases in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at "Meet the Press," the WHO
representative expressed his apprehension that "Bangladesh is
sitting on a time bomb.If ignored, what the situation would be

According to official statistics, the number of HIV-infected
cases in the country is 100, 10 of which have been identified as

</P>
<P>
When referring to other infectious diseases, Hardjotanojo
praised Bangladesh for its efforts and tremendous progress in the
eradication of polio and case management of diarrhea and malaria.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that at the end of 2000, there would be no fresh cases
of polio transmitted by wild polio virus. The success of
Bangladesh in this respect has drawn attention worldwide, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Opposes Taiwan Independence, Separation: Xinhua Commentator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Some party members from the Taiwan
Democratic Progress Party (DPP) have recently proposed abolishing
the party program advocating ``independence" for Taiwan at its
ninth plenary session scheduled for mid-July, which reflects the
voice of people of insight within the Party.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Congress of the DPP passed a resolution on October 13,
1991, which added in the party program the words "establish the
Republic of Taiwan and a new constitution based on independent
sovereignty and put to a referendum by all Taiwan residents".
</P>
<P>
That was the "Taiwan Independence Article" contained in the
Party program of the DPP, a flagrant act aimed at splitting China.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State
Council pointed out on October 14, 1991 that the "Taiwan
Independence Article" was only a farce played by the few stubborn
separatists within the DPP, and did not represent the will of all
the DPP members.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has all along been a part of China. The Chinese
government and people will firmly adhere to the "One China"
principle, and will absolutely not tolerate the separation or ``
independence" of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The "One China" principle is the basis and prerequisite for
peaceful reunification, which is China's staunch stance on the
Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the Ninth Plenary Session of DPP will obey the
will of the majority and abolish the Party program of "Taiwan
Independence" will be a test of whether the DPP is sincere in its
protestations that it wishes to improve the relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong scientists have built
robot maids that can clean the floor and keep working round the
clock, according to a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The robots were unveiled at City University of Hong Kong on
Monday, costing 50,000 HK dollars (about 6,400 U.S. dollars), the
newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
English newspaper South China Morning Post quoted professors
from the university as saying that these robots would be expected
to see service in hospitals and property management companies,
rather than homes, though they can even clean the floors under
beds.
</P>
<P>
Among other robots shown off, one is capable of screwing and
unscrewing a bottle lid and picking up and putting down an item.
It could be developed into an automatic office assistant to
perform tasks such as photocopying or making and serving tea, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Developing Nations Call for Equitable World Trade System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Group-15 developing countries on
Tuesday called for a more equitable multilateral trade system,
closer cooperation with industrialized nations and inter-G-15
cooperation to prevent developing countries from being marginalized
in globalization.
</P>
<P>
The international community should join efforts to form a fairer
world economic order, and the multilateral trade system should
function in a more open, equitable and objective way, said a final
communique issued at the end of the two-day 10th G-15 summit here.
</P>
<P>
The communique stressed the need to take into consideration the
different level of economic development between the developing
countries and industrialized nations as a main dimension in any
multilateral trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It expressed concerns of the G-15 members over the pattern of
international economic relations. The growth rate in the developing
world slowed down from 6 percent to 2 percent in 1998, lower than
that of developed countries for the first time in 10 years, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 nations demanded in the communique that special
attention be paid to the problems facing developing countries
concerning the application of their obligations within the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The G-15 is seeking dialog and cooperation with the Group-8
industrialized countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia -- in a bid to reduce the
danger of marginalization under the globalization trend, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 regrets a decrease in development aid from donor
countries and hopes the industrialized states apply a United
Nations recommendation that they set aside 0.7 percent of the gross
domestic product for such aid, it added.
</P>
<P>
It also called for promotion of economic and trade cooperation
among the G-15 member states and strengthening of South-South
cooperation through signing accords aimed at boosting trade and
investments.
</P>
<P>
Nations of the G-15 account for one third of the world's
population and produce 2 trillion U.S. dollars in goods. Their
combined exports last year stood at 361.4 billion dollars and
imports at 357.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, founded in 1989, currently groups 17 countries, namely
Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya,
Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka,
Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Shas Ministers Quit, Leaving Barak Minority in Parliament EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's biggest coalition
partner, the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, quit Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government on Tuesday, ruining Barak's parliamentary
majority at a critical juncture in the Middle East peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Four Shas cabinet ministers officially submitted their letters
of resignation to Barak Tuesday afternoon and the resignations will
take effect in 48 hours under relevant Israeli law.
</P>
<P>
The next 48 hours will be crucial for Barak, who is likely to
use the time for more talks with Shas to try to solve the party's
demands, this time, for not giving back land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is to be reached by the two sides within 48
hours, Barak will have to accept the resignations.
</P>
<P>
Shas' governing Council of Torah Sages decided last Tuesday to
order its cabinet ministers to submit their resignations to Barak "
during the next cabinet meeting," if their demands for more funds
for its ailing school system and the legalization of its radio
stations were not met.
</P>
<P>
Barak postponed the cabinet meeting slated for Sunday in order
solve the crisis. During this period, cabinet ministers from One
Israel led by Barak held several rounds of meetings with Shas, bot
could not solve the dispute between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Shas' education system was in deep financial debt due to poor
management and corruption in the past years and it has asked the
Education Ministry under Yossi Sarid to allocate more funds, which
Sarid refused.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers of One Israel met with Shas leaders Monday
night and progress was reported in the talks as the two sides have
agreed on almost all issues raised by Shas.
</P>
<P>
But the talks became tougher as Shas' spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef had introduced a new clause in the Shas document of
demands, namely preserving territory in the land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are to thrash out a permanent peace
deal by September, which would be preceded by transfer of more West
Bank territories to Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in the prime minister's court," said Shas' Eli
Suissa, the outgoing national infrastructure minister.
</P>
<P>
Shas has 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament) and
with Shas' departure, Barak coalition's 68-52 majority is dwarfed
to a minority.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of tons of grains
have outflowed from Tanzania to famine-hit Kenya since the latter
waived import duty on maize, Tanzanian newspapers reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that despite Tanzania's ban on grain exports,
lorries from northernTanzania were lined at designated entry
points ready to ferry maize to Kenya, which was severely affected
by food shortage due to prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
William Kusila, minister for Agriculture and Co-operatives,
told the Parliament last Friday that Tanzania needed 600,000 tons
of maize while there were only 82,000 tons of grain in the
Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) stock.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were nine regions in the country which have
been severely affected by food shortage and between March and May,
SGR had released about 10,000 tons of maize to these regions.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mining Contribution To National Output Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining contribution to
national output declined from 4 percent in 1994 to about 3.3
percent in 1999, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed, in its economic highlights, the
decline to decreasing international mineral prices and rising
production costs.
</P>
<P>
The bank said, "Over the past year, production costs in the
mining sector have risen by over 50 percent, affecting viability
particularly for small scale miners."
</P>
<P>
Income from mineral exports, which accounts for 25 percent of
the country's foreign currency earnings, declined from 514 million
U.S. dollars in 1996 to 447 million U.S. dollars in 1999, the bank
said.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Faces Severe Crisis of Desertization: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is facing a spiraling
crisis of desertization as 41.3 percent of its territory has
become deserts, Mongolian News Agency Tuesday quoted a government
survey as showing.
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades, Mongolia lost 3,800 square kilometers
of grassland and now 30 percent of its grassland faces
desertization, according to the survey conducted by the Nature and
Environment Ministry and the country's national anti-desertization
committee.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the number of plant species growing in
desert and semi-desert areas dropped from 33 to 18. Meanwhile,
wind erosion, which is the main cause of desertization in the
world's largest landlocked country, threatens 500,000 hectares of
farmland.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey were released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government adopted a plan of action in 1996 and established
the national anti-desertization committee to fight desertization.

<P>
The Washington Post:

The cave contained Buddhist scriptures, documents, embroidery,
and paintings on paper and silk totaling 50,000 pieces. The
discovery offers valuable materials for the study of the history,
geography, religion, economy, politics, cultural relics,
nationalities, literature, arts and science and technology of
China and Central Asia, said a Chinese archeologist.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of the documents found in the cave were
Buddhist scriptures, with the majority quoting from the Great
Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom. The oldest sutra kept in the
cave was the Parable Sutra, written in 359 B.C.
</P>
<P>
The cave also housed many sutras which failed to be included in
the Tripitaka, monastery documents and accounts, major books
written by monks and other records of great value for studying the
daily life of Buddhists at Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Buddhist scriptures, the cave contained many
documents pertaining to Taoism, one of the chief religions in old
China. They include the Book of the Way and the Book of Great
Peace.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable are three documents related to Manichaeism, a
religion influenced by both Gnosticism and Christianity. It
originated in Persia in 230 AD, and spread throughout Asia and the
Roman Empire. The 19th century scholars had to base their studies
of Manichaeism on the materials gleaned mostly from Christian
sources as the Manichaeism declined rapidly in the 15th century.
Fresh materials came from Turpan in Xinjiang at the beginning of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Also found were classical works belonging to seven sects of
Nestorianism, a branch of Christianity which spread to China in
635. They serve as important historical materials for research
into cultural exchanges between China and the West.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of documents at Dunhuang fall into the category
of science and technology, including maths and astronomy. Six
hundred volumes of medical books cover acupuncture, herbal
medicine and prescriptions.

<HEADLINE> Fast-Food Outlets Ideal for Study in Steaming Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Gu Shou and Chen Xilu, high-school
students, sit by a window in a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)
restaurant in downtown Beijing. They read textbooks while sipping
Coke comfortably and catching glimpses of outside passers-by
walking in the burning sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Gu and Chen, second-year students at the Middle School
Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, come to the air-
conditioned KFC fast-food outlet almost every day to prepare for
exams to be held this week. On the other side, four students from
Beijing Union University, were busy reviewing materials to prepare
for the final exams later this month.
</P>
<P>
More than half of his classmates find comfortable places to
study after class in KFC, McDonald's or A&AMP;W, said Gu.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xueshan, a waiter at a KFC outlet, said that it is time
for exam preparations, but the maximum temperature is around 38
degrees Centigrade, so every day he can see seven or eight
students come to study in his KFC, which is able to hold about 100
customers at one time.
</P>
<P>
They usually order Coca-Cola, and begin to read in a corner,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the cool and pleasant environment of fast-
food outlets attracts the students most. The fast-food outlets
are widely scattered in the city, can easily be found, and always
welcome students, even though they don't purchase much.
</P>
<P>
However, the fast-food outlets are, after all, restaurants. The
music and savory chicken distract the students' attention somewhat.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xilu, sitting with Gu and reviewing her physics lessons,
said that she would rather study in a library.
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the city people really have difficulty finding places
in public libraries to study. Zhang Xiaoping, head of the library
service under the Ministry of Culture, said that Beijing now has
about 24 public libraries, offering nearly 10,000 seats, which
means only one seat for 1,000 people on average, considering that
Beijing has a population of over 10 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most libraries do not allow students to study
there. So, the air-conditioned fast-food outlets have become the
second-best choice for the students.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Hu Jintao called
for innovative but down-to-earth work for the development of urban
communities during a three-day visit to this north China port city.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by local officials, Hu inspected the development
process of Tianjin's communities from June 18 to June 20.
</P>
<P>
The social and economic development in urban areas requires the
government to step up the development of communities, which will
help deepen reform, boost economic growth, improve the people's
living standards, safeguard social stability and consolidate the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The basic social structure in urban areas is undergoing
fundamental changes at present, making the development of
communities crucial to the future of urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Hu also urged communities to recruit and train more qualified
young officials and improve their work to provide better services
for the general public.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chen Zhaonan (spelled in
Hanyupinyin), a legislator of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), has proposed for the second time that the DPP repeal
the section of its program concerning "Taiwan Independence",
according to sources in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, submitted by Chen and seven other DPP members to
the party's secretariat, has won support from several DPP members,
with 21 signing it.
</P>
<P>
The first item in the DPP's party program, which advocates an
independent republic of Taiwan, has lost is foundation, and should
be repealed in the interests of the people of Taiwan, Chen argued.
</P>
<P>
Some factions in the DPP oppose the proposal in an attempt to
keep it as a bargaining counter in cross-straits negotiation,
while the supporters of the proposal regard the item as out-dated
and call for its abolition in the face of the current situation.

<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of
the Central Military Commission, met today with Daniel Christman,
superintendent of the United States Military Academy, also known
as West Point.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the military academy has extended a warm welcome to
Chinese military delegations in the past, and made a contribution
to the development of military-to-military relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a major task to educate new talented military
personnel who can handle and use high-tech arms. He expressed the
hope that military schools in the two countries will increase
exchanges and promote further growth of relations between the two
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said 1.2 billion Chinese people are committed to solving
the Taiwan issue and realizing China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adheres to the policy of peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems, he said, adding that
China will never rule out abandoning the use of force.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the United States will honor the three China-U.S.
joint communiques and its relevant commitments, and do more things
which will be conducive to China's peaceful reunification," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Christman said he had visited three Chinese military academies
and was deeply impressed by the high quality of Chinese servicemen.
He added that West Point is fully prepared to increase exchanges
with its Chinese counterparts.

teachers to work in Africa.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Education announced today that it will

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Group-15 countries ended their
10th summit in Cairo on Tuesday with a decision to admit Columbia
and Iran into the 17-member developing nations' club.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day gathering, G-15 leaders discussed ways of
promoting inter-group economic and trade cooperation and seeking
dialog with industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
They also tackled the economic globalization and the existing
multilateral trade system. The leaders called for joint efforts to
offset the negative effects of the trend on the developing world,
while playing down opportunities offered by economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The summit adopted a collective stance which called on the
developed countries to change their trade policies discriminating
against developing nations.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the developed countries to increase assistance to
developing countries so as to help them achieve development in the
fields of economy, trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided to convey a message to the Group-8
industrialized countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia -- calling for dialog on
ways to better benefit the economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
It also called for steps to strengthen the cooperation among the
G-15 member states and that between G-15 members and other
developing nations in expanding production and exports, enhancing
economic competitiveness and small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, founded in 1989, currently groups Algeria, Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Jamaica, Malaysia,
Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Its member states account for a third of the world's population

<HEADLINE> No Date Set for Clinton-Barak-Arafat Summit: Israeli FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy clarified Tuesday that no date has been set for a three-way
summit between the U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk
Tuesday morning, Levy said there is still a lot of work to be done
before a summit could be held between U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Army Radio reported that Clinton had convinced
Arafat during their Washington meeting last Thursday to hold such a
summit to break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Indyk reportedly denied the report, saying that some
basic conditions may have to be met before the summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky also denied there are any
agreements on the proposed three-way summit, aiming at resolving
outstanding disputes between Israel and the Palestinians and
wrapping up a framework peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are signs that Israel is eager to see such a
summit take place as soon as possible to move forward the stagnant
talks, which deal with the thorniest issues between the two sides,
such as the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements, border, security and water.
</P>
<P>
Some officials had promoted a Camp David-style summit for
accelerating the negotiating pace to ensure the signing of a
framework agreement and a final accord by September.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the U.S., Egypt and Israel met in Camp David in 1978
and hammered out the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, the first
between an Arab country and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Barak's top aide and security adviser Danny Yatom told foreign
journalists in Jerusalem Monday night that the negotiation had
reached a point sufficiently ripe to merit a three-way summit.
</P>
<P>
He hoped such a summit would be held for several days in
Washington in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak himself also changed his early opposition to the summit.
He told his inner-circle security cabinet on Sunday that convening
a three-way summit as soon as possible to close the gaps between
him and Arafat is more important now than before.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister even cited a date for the meeting -- July 5,
right after the U.S. Independence Day on July 4.
</P>
<P>
But Levy usually adopted a more pessimistic attitude than other
officials toward the idea, claiming that such a summit would not be
effective at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are also against holding a three-way summit at
present. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said Tuesday that
there are still deep conflicts between the sides, and that Arafat
is waiting for more progress in negotiations before convening such
a summit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will arrive in the
Middle East either by the weekend or next week, and U.S. Middle
East special envoy Dennis Ross is also expected to be here on
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Determining whether to hold a three-way summit is said to be
high on the agenda of the two American diplomats.

<HEADLINE> URGENT 4 Ministers From Shas Quit Barak's Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Four ministers from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's biggest coalition partner, the ultra-orthodox
Shas party, submitted their resignation on Tuesday, undermining
Barak's parliamentary majority, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the four, submitted to Barak's office, will
take effect in 48 hours which will be the last chance for Barak to
try to end the dispute with Shas mainly over the funding of Shas'
ailing school system.
</P>
<P>
Shas holds 17 pivotal seats in Israel's 120-member Knesset
(Parliament). And Barak is in dire need of Shas' 17 votes for any
peace agreements with the Palestinians, as Shas' resignation will
reduce his control in the Knesset from 68 majority to 51 minority.

<HEADLINE> Manila Maintains No-Ransom Policy in Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reiterated Tuesday its policy of rejecting any demands for ransom
in exchange for the release of the 21 hostages, 19 of them
foreigners, now being held by the Abu Sayyaf in southern Sulu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno told
reporters that the government "is not interested in discussing
ransom and our policy is that we are not going to pay ransom in
this particular matter."
</P>
<P>
Puno also clarified a newspaper report that Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora has allegedly confirmed the existence of a 1
million-U.S. dollar demand for each of the 21 hostages by the Abu
Sayyaf, saying Zamora has been misquoted or quoted out of context.
</P>
<P>
He said the executive secretary had prefaced his remarks about
the ransom demand with the words "there are reports."
</P>
<P>
"Remember we were talking here of figures that have been
floating all over the place but were not the subject of any formal
demand by any credible Abu Sayyaf leader," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora himself, in a radio interview on Tuesday, denied having
made that confirmation, Puno pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Puno, Secretary Robert Aventajado, chief
government negotiator on the hostage case, has also told him that
there has been no formal demand for ransom money by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, including three Germans, two French, two Finns,
two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos,
were kidnapped from a Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and then
taken to Sulu Province.

MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military confirmed
Tuesday that two female public school teachers were kidnapped at
Barangay (village) Paraiso, Calawit town in the southern province
of Zamboanga del Sur Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hilario Atendido, spokesman of the Southern Command of the
Philippine Armed Forces,said in a statement that the two teachers,
both single, were abducted at about 1:30 p.m. on Monday from
Paraiso Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
The two teachers were the only ones at the school premises at
that time, said Atendido.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers were not identified, but reports said the men
fired shots in the air as they dragged the teachers away from the
school.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports showed the kidnappers could be members of the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front operating in the
hinterlands of the province.
</P>
<P>
Atendido said government soldiers based in the municipality
have been dispatched to track down the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The latest abduction happened while government is still trying
to negotiate the release of two other female teachers who were
kidnapped by the extremist Abu Sayyaf along with 57 others in
Basilan Province on March 20.

<HEADLINE> Manila Overruns Another MILF Camp in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
overran Tuesday another camp of the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front(MILF) in South Cotabato province of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Sam Deles, spokesman of the 601st Brigade of the Philippine
Army,said Camp Jabal Hod fell to the military Tuesday morning
after an offensive was launched Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The camp is the 24th camp of the MILF to have fallen under
government control since April when fighting between MILF
guerrillas and government troops erupted in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The battles in Mindanao claimed hundreds of lives and forced
about 500,000 civilians to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
As the clashes between the two sides dragged on, the MILF
central committee announced Monday the postponement of their talks
with the government.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, said
they decided to defer the scheduled talks on June 28 because of
the continued military offensives and the warrants of arrest
issued by the court against their top leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Eid Kabalu, the MILF spokesman, said they asked the
government peace panel to reset the peace talks for July 29.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada set June 30 as the
deadline for the MILF to accept autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government said it is willing to extend the
deadline for a peace agreement with the MILF as long as the
negotiations progress.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for more than two
decades for an independent state in Mindanao, a request which has
been repeatedly rejected by the Philippine government.

<HEADLINE> Top U.N. Official Urges Africans to Protect Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Africans must live up to the
spirit of humanity and justice that they have so generously
demonstrated by taking in millions of displaced people in the
past, a visiting U.N. top official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said,
"If peace is to decisively replace war and suffering throughout
this continent, it is going to require the shared responsibility
of all Africans."
</P>
<P>
Conflicts will not be resolved unless all countries and their
citizens take a collective responsibility for achieving peace,
she said.
</P>
<P>
In some regions of Africa, controlling natural resources such
as oil, diamonds and wood appears to be a more pressing concern
for governments and rebel groups alike, than the welfare of the
people living in embattled areas, Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
"The continent's escalating refugee problems need our attention
today more than ever", said Ogata, adding that since the early
1960s, when there were some 950,000 refugees in Africa, the figure
has quadrupled to a staggering 4 million driven from their
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility is not the sole prerogative of heads of state
or politicians. Intolerance is born in the minds of people at the
individual level, it pushes them to be hostile towards others
because of their ethnicity, religion or political views," she
said.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this alarming trend, UNHCR has launched a public
awareness campaign across Africa called "Roll Back Xenophobia",
targeting individuals but also governments and non-governmental
agencies, according to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
"UNHCR will continue to protect and assist the refugees and
displaced people of Africa, and we will never stop working towards
alleviating their suffering and finding lasting solutions for
them," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata called upon all persons of goodwill to put an end to the
spiral of violence and war, saying that only then may Africa find
enduring peace and at last focus on improving the living
conditions of its people.
</P>
<P>
"And only then will every woman, man and child across this
great continent have a lasting home, and a promising future," she
stressed.

<HEADLINE> "Two Child" Law Does Not Mean Change of Birth Control Policy in China: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Officials and experts say the
promulgation of new laws by 27 local governments to allow some
people to have a second child does not mean any big changes have
been made to the country's birth control policy.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a micro adjustment to meet local specific
conditions," says Song Jie, with the Population Expert Committee
of the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to the new laws approved by provinces and autonomous
regions, the right for parents who are both single children to
have a second baby is protected.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, China has adopted the one-child policy to
curb its population explosion. The policy has turned China into a
low birth rate country and churned out many young single children.
</P>
<P>
The policy does not prohibit a husband and wife who are both
single children from bearing a second baby. However, this is the
first time governments have turned to the law to protect the right.
</P>
<P>
Song says that local governments approved the laws because they
want to tackle the aging population problem and maintain a
population balance.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of people aged over 70 in the total population
has increased rapidly to 10 percent in the 20-year course of the
one-child policy, which has put pressure on society.
</P>
<P>
Song says the promulgation of the local laws goes in line with
the normal population growth, and noted that there will not be an
abrupt increase in the Chinese population in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
A survey in Heilongjiang province shows that 69.9 percent of 1,
0200 respondents aged between 20 and 30 are reluctant to have a
second child.
</P>
<P>
Li Ling, a company clerk in Harbin, noted that having another
baby "will cost a lot of money and make me and my husband tired."
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenming, deputy director of the China Population
Information Research Institute, says that by 2005 some 20 million
marriages will take place in China annually, and only 10 percent
of the couples will be single children.
</P>
<P>
He said that if each couple has two children, the added
population will be no more than two million every year, which
would have little affect on the nation's population control target.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government published a report last month saying
that it will bring the population to under 1.4 billion by 2010 and
the current birth control policy should be stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces have increased subsidies for families with one
child.

<HEADLINE> China Promulgates Procedures Governing Philately Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China publicized procedures today
governing the operation of the domestic philately market, in an
effort to step up the administration of philatelic activities and
protect the order of the philately market.
</P>
<P>
The procedures, jointly published by the China State Postal
Bureau (CSPB) and the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, regulate both trading activities in the philately market
and the selling of stamps and postal items by postal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to Tan Xiaowei, deputy director of the CSPB, China
has four million members of philatelic associations at various
levels, and every year more than 10 million sets of commemorative
and special stamps are ordered from post offices.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly all of the country's major cities have set up
philately markets, forming a considerable trade in market numbers,
people involved and transaction volume.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, many problems have emerged in these markets
over the past few years, including the selling of stamps at prices
under their face value, trading postal items without official
ratification, fabricating stamps and cheating stamp collectors
through postal ordering.
</P>
<P>
"These illegal activities have severely damaged the government'
s image and disturbed market order," he said, adding that the
promulgation of the procedures will effectively correct these
activities and protect the national interest and stamp collectors'
rights.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Encouraged for Afforestation Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China will soon issue a regulation
to encourage foreign businesspeople to invest in afforestation,
according to sources from the State Forestry Administration (SFA).
</P>
<P>
The regulation will clearly set out the procedures for
application and tax fees for foreign investors on afforestation.
Foreign businesspeople can also apply for low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
A SFA official said that the legal rights of foreign-funded
afforestation enterprises will be protected, which means that no
units or individuals can infringe upon land rights, ownership of
woods and other legal rights of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation departments should take active measures to draw
in foreign funds, as well as funds from Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan for afforestation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businesspeople began to invest in afforestation years
ago. South China's Guangdong Province has utilized 154 million US
dollars of foreign funds for afforestation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK to Do More for Environmental Improvement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, HKSAR Chief Executive, said in his opening
remarks to the International Association for Impact Assessment
Conference 2000 that the government "will need to do more, and a
lot more, to improve the quality of the living environment."
</P>
<P>
"Over the past decade, continuing economic and population growth
in China and in neighboring Guangdong have placed great pressures
on the environment." the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
"Air pollution, sewage treatment and solid waste management are
major problems that face all communities," he said, noting that "
the challenge is even more difficult in tiny Hong Kong, with a
population of close to 7 million in an area of about 1,100 square
kilometers."
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that it is not enough to simply address
environmental problems as they arise, and that the government "
must ensure that we pre-empt environmental problems by considering
them up-front, hand-in-hand with policy making and infrastructure
development at the initial planning stages."
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, a major step for Hong Kong came in 1998 with
the implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment
Ordinance. Since then, more than 170 billion HK dollars (22
billion U.S. dollars) worth of projects have gone through rigorous
assessment mechanisms to ensure that environmental and ecological
impacts are fully considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
A further step is that from next year, all major government
policies and strategic proposals will be subject to sustainability
impact assessments, which will ensure that decision-makers address
a wide range of consequences before proposals are finalized and
implemented, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
On top of these two important long-term measures, a host of
supporting initiatives were announced in the past two years to
improve the environment in Hong Kong, Tung said.

<P>
Tung said that his annual Policy Address last year was
essentially a "green speech" which has set out the objectives of
how the government intends to go about tackling the pollution
problems.
</P>
<P>
More recently, the government announced further measures
including strengthening enforcement action and the introduction of
ultra low sulfur diesel oil, among other things, that will help
Hong Kong greatly improve the air quality.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that sustainable, environmentally friendly
development goes hand-in-hand with economic growth," Tung said. "
Our aim is to make Hong Kong a model for environmental improvement
and a greening agent for this region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lily Yam, Hong Kong's secretary for the environment and food,
stressed the important role environmental impact assessment (EIA)
has played in maintaining Hong Kong's environment standard, and
promised to do more to this end.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has more than 15 years' experience in using EIA on
major development projects, and so far has completed over 500 EIAs,
Yam said.
</P>
<P>
Conducting an EIA became a requirement for government projects
in 1986 and then, legislation was introduced in 1996, enacted in
the following year, and came into full operation in April 1998,
according to Yam.
</P>
<P>
The EIA Ordinance requires all designated projects to go
through an environmental impact assessment before works can
proceed. The list of such designated projects runs into almost 100
categories, including roads and railways, airport and port
facilities, reclamation, dredging and dumping, energy and water
supply, waste disposal and sewage treatment, she said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a number of successful examples how EIA has helped
reduce damage to the environment, Yam said that the environmental
impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment have
become important planning and decision-making tools for all of
Hong Kong's large-scale developments.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Hong Kong has accumulated
considerable experience and expertise in impact assessment in many
areas, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
A regional network, EIA Gateway, has been developed through the
joint effort of the IAIA, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the
South China Institute of Environmental Science and our
Environmental Protection Department to provide a bridge to, and an
important link amongst, professionals in the Chinese mainland,
Hong Kong and other parts of the world, she said.

<HEADLINE> New Model of Business Incubation Program Launched in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A new model of business
incubation program was launched Tuesday to facilitate Hong Kong's
transformation from labor-intensive to higher value-added
technology-intensive industry.
</P>
<P>
The new program helps create more advanced engineering
opportunities in Hong Kong and at the same time stimulating
capital investment in Hong Kong's high-tech industry, Peter Y. Lo,
chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Industrial Technology
Center Corporation, said at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the new model, incubatees can have choices of equity
distribution. Inside each of the options, every company can
receive a credit allowance of up to 240,000 HK dollars ( 30,770 U.
S. dollars) from the center during the three-year program,
according to Lo.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the start-ups can enjoy the professional
value-added services in management, marketing, general business
services and investment matching, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lo, there were more than 200 equities on the new
model, and 12 of the applications were being processed.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1993, the center served as a statutory body with
a mission to facilitate the promotion of technological innovation
and application of new technologies in Hong Kong's industry.

<HEADLINE> HK Positioned to Build into Regional Wine Center: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is well-positioned to
develop into a wine trading and distribution center of Asia,
taking up 47 percent of the regional market in 2006.
</P>
<P>
This news came from a recent consultancy report jointly
commissioned by the Trade and Industry Bureau and the Trade
Development Council.
</P>
<P>
To explore the prospects and opportunities of Hong Kong's
development as a regional center, the council will organize a
seminar on June 30 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
According to Johnny Wan, the council's deputy senior manager
for product promotion, the Asian wine market is forecast to grow
further, and with its strategically central location and sound
infrastructure, Hong Kong has the potential to emerge as the
regional wine center.
</P>
<P>
Asia is one of the few developing wine markets remaining in the
world. With the region's economic recovery under way and
opportunities arising from China's impending entry to the WTO, the
market is expected to grow, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
"Capitalizing on Hong Kong's strengths and facilitation efforts
of the government, Hong Kong's share of the wine market in Asia is
forecast to grow from 27 percent in 1999 to 47 percent in 2006,"
Wan stressed.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on Hong Kong as a regional wine trading and
distribution center will feature presentations on findings of the
consultancy report, as well as sessions conducted by senior
government officials and major industry players.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Parties Welcome to Visit Mainland: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Different parties and people of
all the circles in Taiwan are welcome to exchange views with the
Chinese mainland on issues regarding the cross-straits relations
and peaceful reunification, said Chen Yunlin, director of the
Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Some Taiwan media recently reported that a number of parties
and groups in Taiwan have hoped to visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chen quoted President Jiang Zemin's eight proposals in 1995 as
saying that Taiwan parties hope to push forward the development of
cross-straits ties in a rational, far-sighted and constructive
manner.
</P>
<P>
For years, the mainland has made wide-ranged contacts with
different parties, groups and individuals from Taiwan, under the
one-China principle. Chen reiterated that the one-China principle
is the base and premise for peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Under the one-China principle, "we welcome different parties
and people from Taiwan to exchange views with us on the cross-
straits ties and peaceful reunification and to further eliminate
misunderstanding and promoting mutual understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
Except those who have stubbornly adhered to "Taiwan
independence", the mainland is willing to work along with the
parties, groups and individuals from Taiwan, uphold the common
desire of opposing "Taiwan independence", pursuing peace and
promoting reunification, and actively boost economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope to realize direct exchanges of mail,
trade and transport across the Taiwan Straits at an early date,
push forward cross-straits talks and negotiations based on the one-
China principle, and realize the reunification of the country.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Website Launched in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A website dedicated to diabetes-
related information was launched here today.
</P>
<P>
Logging onto www.tang-an.com.cn or www.diabetes-china.com,
Internet surfers can get the latest information about diabetes
prevention, therapies and medical research. They can also enjoy
online purchase of certain medicines and health-promotion products.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Tang-An Nutrition and Healthcare Products Co. Ltd,
which launched the website, expected the Internet-based service to
eventually reach more than three million potential diabetes
sufferers in China.
</P>
<P>
Causing more than 170 billion yuan (about 20 billion U.S.
dollars) in medical expenditure each year, the disease has become
the third most serious chronic disease in the country, following
cardio- and cerebral-vascular illnesses and cancer.
</P>
<P>
"It has become an urgent task for us to let more people know
disease prevention," said Shao Ruitai, an official in charge of
disease control at the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Tang-An has devoted itself to the control of diabetes since it
was founded in 1997, said Dr. Cheng Nanzheng, president and CEO of
Tang-An.
</P>
<P>
"We have held more than 800 lectures for a total of 500,000

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Accept Delay in Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have accepted a two-
week postponement in the implementation of a promised further
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Voice of Palestine radio
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (also known as Abu Ala),
head of the Palestinian team to the so-called back-channel talks
with Israel, told the radio that the Palestinians have agreed to
the delay in the Israeli pull-out, initially scheduled to be
carried out by June 23.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator on interim affairs, Saeb Erekat,
told the radio that the United States had echoed the Israeli
request for such a delay. The scheduled Israeli withdrawal was a
main issue in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton last week in Washington, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat noted that what the Palestinians want is an assurance
from the U.S. that the Israeli third withdrawal from the West Bank,
outlined in the Oslo accords signed by the two sides in 1993, would
be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Israel had threatened that if the Palestinian side rejects its
demand for the postponement and insists on the withdrawal being
carried out on time, it will stick to a previous government
decision that the third withdrawal will cover only 1 percent of the
West Bank territories. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining
West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third
redeployment. Israel so far has handed over full or partial control
of about 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear how many of the West Bank territories would
be included in the third withdrawal, despite press reports that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is ready to hand over 90 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians in a final peace agreement.

Tuesday urged the Asia-Pacific regional airlines to be cautious in

Colonel Basheer, Pakistan military attache at the High

the media reports about an impending visit of Sri Lankan Army
Commander General Srilal Weerasooriya to Pakistan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times newspaper said that the commander was to leave

newspapers requesting more information."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Tries to Attract Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has undertaken
measures to attract a lion's share of the foreign direct
investment (FDI) pumped into African economies, Tuesday's local
newspapers quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Director of the Tanzanian Investment Center
Samuel Sitta said that the government has, among others, decided
to turn the center into a "one-stop" facility for investors to
speed up the business operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The response from investors has been generally good and we
expect things to continue turning out for the better," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expected that Tanzania's sluggish economic growth would
finally start gathering momentum in the 2000/2001 financial year
as investors increasingly become confident of the country's
macro-economic stability and vast business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"As infrastructure rehabilitation and the macro-economic policy
continue to facilitate investment, we expect businessmen who have
already invested in the country to be our ambassadors and tell
their friends to come and set up business in Tanzania," Sitta
added.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics, the investment center has
approved some 1,460 projects attracting billions of U.S. dollars
investment.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for doing business in Tanzania were considerably
widened after the introduction of the National Investment
Promotion Policy of 1996, experts have said.

According to a report on the humanitarian situation in Angola
between May 29 and June 4, issued here on Monday by the UN
delegation, a joint mission of the UN and the non-governmental
organizations have reviewed their strategies for food aid
deliveries in Angola with the aim to improve registry and
attendance to beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The note said that between May 30 and June 1, the joint mission
visited the areas suggested for the resettlement of refugees and
concluded that the health centers in those areas were either not
properly equipped or did not exist, and the access to water and to
sanitation systems was limited.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) has said earlier this month that
the international assistance to Angola could face an awkward
situation in the coming months as many pledges made by foreign
donors had not been met.
</P>
<P>
According to Maria Flynn, representative of WFP in Angola, the
decline in the international assistance will force the WFP to
begin reducing its food programs in the southern African country
where the needs for the humanitarian aid are swelling.
</P>
<P>
Flynn said the WFP had received only 46.5 percent of the
211,000 tons of pledged food aid, while the number of the
war-displaced Angolans counting on the WFP aid had increased to
1.5 million from 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
There are some 3.7 million displaced persons living around
Angola which has a total population of 11 million.

<HEADLINE> EU Summit Fails to Pass Tax Reform Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The
European Union summit failed to pass its tax reform proposal as
Austria's 14 partners could not persuade it to accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Austria, already in the limelight of the two-day summit held at
this small town 40 kilometers south of the Portuguese northern
city of Porto, stood alone in the discussion about proposed
measures to fight against evasions of savings interest income.
</P>
<P>
The failure was expected to further sour the relations between
Austria and its 14 EU partners, especially Portugal, who have
imposed political sanctions after Austria incorporated the extreme-
right Freedom Party into the governing coalition in February.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit was expected to endorse a reform on how to tax
cross-border savings or to inform EU member states of cross-border
account-holders' savings to enable the tax to be levied in the
home country.
</P>
<P>
The EU finance ministers used two days to persuade Luxembourg
and Britain to agree to the proposal but five rounds of prolonged
talks in the same two days failed to produce the same outcome with
the Austrians who argued that it was against both its banking
secrecy tradition and constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
Though no one put a direct link between the lifting of the
political sanctions with the refusal to accept the taxing proposal,
the four-month-long sanctions must have had something to do with
the failure that Portugal had never thought of when it announced
on behalf of the other EU member states the political sanctions at
the end of January.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders at the start of the Feira summit ruled out an
early lifting of the sanctions though Portugal said that it would
try to work out something as a compromise before its rotating
presidency ends on June 30 and France takes over on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel appealed to the
EU leaders to consider lifting the sanctions before the end of the
six-month Portuguese presidency. But the wind that got out of the
EU leaders discussion pointed to a possible lifting date as far as
next January when Sweden steps in to serve its turn at the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The failure to solve the Austrian issue could influence the
future decision-making process of the 15-nation bloc that is still
relying on unanimity to pass any EU-wide policies.
</P>
<P>
The next testing issue will be the enlargement when all have to
agree whether or not to accept 12 eastern and southern European
countries and when they should join the EU club.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, however, has been discussing about an
overhaul on its voting mechanism. The weighted majority has been
pinpointed as a possible substitute for the current unanimity
voting system that has been criticized as hindering the progress
of the union.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Meretz Ministers to Quit if Necessary to Save Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from Israel's dovish
Meretz party has offered to resign if necessary for keeping the
rebellious Shas party in the ruling coalition, Meretz party
officials confirmed Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Yail Kessler, media adviser of Meretz leader and Education
Minister Yossi Sarid, told Xinhua that three ministers from Meretz
had informed Prime Minister Ehud Barak that they will vacate their
posts and not stand in the way for Barak to reach an agreement with
the ultra-orthodox religious Shas party which holds 17 pivotal
seats in Israel's 120-member Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Barak is in dire need of Shas' 17 votes for any peace agreements
with the Palestinians, as Shas' resignation will reduce his control
in the Knesset from 68 majority to 51 minority.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Barak also wanted the support of Shas' hawkish
constituency in any future referenda for peace accords with the
Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason why Meretz, who ardently supports the peace
process, offered to resign from the government for the sake of
larger interests than its own pride, Kessler claimed.
</P>
<P>
Kessler noted that Meretz did not want to tie Barak's hands in
the coalition negotiations with Shas, who had been threatening to
quit the coalition since last week.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that if the final agreement with Shas is
acceptable to Meretz, the ministers' resignation may not be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
But in case that the agreement is not acceptable, the three will
resign but the 10-legislator secular party will remain in the
coalition anyway to ensure the support the prime minister needs on
the peace process with the Palestinians and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers, Sarid, Industry and Trade minister Ran
Cohen, and Agriculture Minister Haim Oron, made the final decision,
a last-ditch move to save Barak's coalition, after meeting with
Barak late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Shas had threatened to resign from the coalition because of its
unmet demands for financing its religious educational network,
legalizing its pirate radio stations and having a say in the Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The party accused Meretz, its archrival in the coalition who
controls the education ministry, of deliberately withholding the
funding transfer for its debt-ridden school system and hindering
its recovery. Shas officials had asked Barak to deprive Sarid of
financial control over the school network.
</P>
<P>
But the Meretz leader said he was just trying to keep law and
order and enforce financial regulations to end corruption that have
plagued Shas schools in the past.
</P>
<P>
During the intensive talks between Barak's One Israel bloc and
Shas in the past few days, Barak had tried to exhaust all options
to satisfy Shas' needs.
</P>
<P>
However, it seemed that Shas is growing its demand list and the
party leader, Eli Yishai, issued an ultimatum-style warning on
Tuesday that the Shas ministers' letters of resignation are ready.
</P>
<P>
Yishai said they will submit their resignations from the
government Tuesday afternoon as planned if an agreement has not
been hammered out by that time, regardless of whether a cabinet
meeting is convened.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak postponed the weekly cabinet meeting, which was
set to take place last Sunday, to Tuesday or further later in the
week to leave more time for negotiations with Shas.
</P>
<P>
But Yishai said that the law does not require a cabinet meeting
for the ministers to resign.
</P>
<P>
Once the letters are submitted, the resignation will take effect
in 48 hours, which will be the final chance for Barak to save his
11-month-old coalition.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Upgrade Diplomatic Mission in Iraq: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is considering upgrading the
status of its diplomatic representation in Iraq from the level of
charge d'affaires to that of ambassador, Turkish Daily News quoted
diplomatic sources as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu's
recent visit to Baghdad, the two countries have stepped up efforts
to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The sanction-stricken Iraq has been seeking to break its
diplomatic isolation and economic plight, while Turkey is eying for
Baghdad's cooperation in ridding itself of the Kurdish separatist
movement.
</P>
<P>
Despite its remarkable success in suppressing the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which had waged a 15-year armed
struggle for self-rule in Kurdish-populated southeastern Turkey,
Ankara has been uneasy that the Kurdish independence movement in
northern Iraq, bordering southern Turkey, might spill over.
</P>
<P>
The common concerns over an independent Kurdish state in
northern Iraq prompted the two countries to lay aside their
differences over other issues.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has stated on numerous occasions that it would not
permit the emergence of an independent Kurdish state in the region,
has insisted that Baghdad reinforce its administration over its
Kurdish-populated north.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Logoglu urged the Baghdad regime to adopt an
all-embracing policy for its citizens in northern Iraq and realize
reconciliation with the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which has been isolated and subject to crippling United
Nations sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, told Logoglu
that it wants Turkey to appoint an ambassador in Baghdad to further
boost bilateral relations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighboring countries had been soured
after the Gulf War, in which Turkey was part of the United States-
led coalition that forced Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Turkey downgraded its diplomatic mission in Iraq to the
level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops had repeatedly crossed the border into northern
Iraq in pursuit of the Kurdish separatists sheltering there after
fleeing Turkey. Baghdad condemned that Turkey, under the pretext of
chasing elements of the PKK, has invaded Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad also accused Ankara of ignoring its humanitarian needs,
saying Turkey could have eased sanctions on Iraq long ago by
exporting food and medicine in exchange for oil imports, as does
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has allowed Iraq since December 1996 to sell limited
amount of oil under U.N. supervision to buy humanitarian goods such
as food and medicine, within the framework of the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was Turkey's top crude oil supplier and the third-largest
trading partner before the 1991 Gulf War. Ankara has since
purchased most of its crude from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been outraged at Turkey for helping U.S and British
planes to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq by allowing
these warplanes to use its Incirlik air base.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also said that Turkey, the upstream country of the
Euphrates and Tigris rivers, was threatening the flow of the rivers
by building dams in violation of the rights of downstream
countries, including Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Over 110 Killed in Communal Clash in N. Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Fresh communal clash broke out in
North Maluku, Indonesia, on Monday, claiming at least 114 people
and 81 others.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency Tuesday, the clash broke
out in the village of Duma in the sub-district of Galela in the
northern part of Halmahera island, scene of some of the bloodiest
clashes between rival Christian and Muslim villagers in recent
months. The clash lasted for about one hour. Some 292 homes of
villagers in Duma, including a house of prayer, were burnt during
the incident.
</P>
<P>
All the victims were killed or wounded by self-made bombs,
arrows or self-made guns. It was reported that most of the dead
were Christians.
</P>
<P>
The fighting stopped after security forces consisting of troops
belonging to a Brawijaya battalion and the Marine Corps drove away
the warring parties. But the situation in Halmahera remained tense.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest outbreak in an 18-month religious feud on the
Maluku islands, in which more than 2,500 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
It was also one of the worst incidents in nearly two years of
religious and ethnic violence that has plagued Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Increases by 20.3 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
expanded by 20.3 percent year-on-year to reach 38.5 billion
Singapore dollars (about 22.4 billion U.S. dollars) in May thanks
to strong global demand for certain electronic products, according
to the monthly bulletin of the Singapore's Trade Development Board
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose by 11.3 percent to hit 9.4
billion Singapore dollars (about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the
month and the growth came mainly from the strong demand for
integrated circuits (ICs), telecommunication equipment and non-
electronics.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil re-exports continued to grow, increasing by a robust 26.
6 percent year-on-year in May and Non-oil imports increased by 18.
1 percent over a year ago with the total volume amounting for 16.3
billion Singapore dollars (about 9.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The exports of electronics posted a growth of 4.5 percent in
the month supported by continued strong global demand for
electronics products such as ICs as well as telecommunication
equipment, and the domestic exports of non-electronic products
expanded strongly by 24.9 percent in May, reflecting a robust
growth in exports of disc media products as well as healthy demand
from the region for petrochemicals.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Be Tried in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said here Tuesday that dossiers of former
president Soeharto in corruption cases will be submitted to the
court in late July.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a hearing with the House of Representatives (DPR)
Commission II on legal affairs, Darusman said, "Dossiers of
Soeharto in corruption cases will be filed to the court in late
July this year at the latest."
</P>
<P>
Based on the country's law, the trial could be started a week
after the dossier was lodged to the court.
</P>
<P>
Darusman also said that within this week the Attorney General
Office will also invite Hong Kong-based Time magazine to come to
Jakarta "to give detail information on Soeharto's fortune. We hope
that Time magazine will meet this request."
</P>
<P>
But, Darusman admitted that his side has not yet had exact data
about Soeharto's fortune. "We have no exact data on Soeharto's
wealth, either official data or unofficial data."
</P>
<P>
"But, we have been trying to get such data and collecting
information on Soeharto's fortune, including Soeharto's accounts
which are suspected to have been deposited in Switzerland's banks,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been facing corruption charges in his 32 years
rule of the country. He was declared as suspect early this year
and was put under house arrest by the Attorney General Office last
month.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling Coalition Likely to Gain Stable Majority: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling three-way coalition
led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is likely to gain a
stable majority of 254 seats in Sunday's House of Representatives
general election, newspaper polls indicated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun said the LDP alone could win more than 254
seats and as many as 270 of the 480 seats up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's two coalition partners, the New Komeito party and the
New Conservative Party, could lose substantially in Sunday's
balloting, but the coalition would still win about 300 seats, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by Mainichi Shimbun projected 263 seats,
plus 11 or minus 12 seats, for the LDP, and more than 300 for the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun and the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said their
surveys showed the LDP alone may be able to secure a simple
majority of 241 seats.
</P>
<P>
While predicting a bright future for the coalition, the four
major dailies also pointed out that the outcome of the election is
still uncertain as there is a high percentage of undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
Japan's lower house will be trimmed by 20 seats in the election,
scheduled for June 25. Of the 480 being contested, 300 seats will
be from single-seat constituencies and 180 will be proportional-
representation seats.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori told reporters earlier in
the day that it was too early to say whether the election results
will be good or bad for the LDP and its coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
But Mori said voter response to the election campaign is "very
good," and that public interest in the election is high.
</P>
<P>
"There are big crowds at campaign speeches everywhere. It is
the first time for me to experience an election campaign with such
a good voter response," Mori said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said he expects the
ruling coalition will do well if the trend in the polls remains as
it is.
</P>
<P>
"But there are five days to the election, so we will continue
with our fight without relaxing our guard," the top government
spokesman told a press conference.

<HEADLINE> French, Canadian Firms Merge Into World No. 2 Communications Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The French multi-service company
Vivendi and its affiliate entertainment group Canal-Plus will
merge with the Canadian communications and spirits group Seagram
to create the world's second largest communications group, Vivendi
Universal, said the three companies in a communique Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The merger is realized through a takeover bid for shares, in
which Vivendi exchanges one share of Seagram with 0.7 share of its
own.
</P>
<P>
One share of Canal-Plus, which is a cable television channel
featuring sports and films, is worth two shares of Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
But the shares of Canal-Plus cannot be converted into those of
the new group because of a French law on audio-visual which bans
any private company from owning more than 49 percent of the shares
of a television channel.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi Universal will be the world's number two group of
communications after the U.S. AOL-Time-Warner and before CBS-
Viacom, News Corp. of Rupert Murdoch and the German Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
The president and executive officer of Vivendi, Jean-Marie
Messier, will be the president of Vivendi Universal, while the
president and executive officer of Seagram, Edgar Bronfman Jr,
will be its vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi Universal will have an estimated value of 57.5 billion
euros (54.6 billion U.S. dollars) and will be based in Paris, New
York and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The merger was agreed upon by the councilors of administration
of the three companies who met in Paris Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi Universal will from now on have two fields of
activities -- one of communication and one of public service like
running water, rubbish management and cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
The share-holders of Vivendi will have 59 percent of the shares
of Vivendi Universal, while those of Seagram 29 percent and Canal-
Plus 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bronfman family, who created Seagram in 1930 first with
wine and spirits business and then with film and music, will be
the number one share-owner with 8 percent of the shares of the
newly merged group.

<HEADLINE> Annan Assures Lebanon of Seriously Handling Alleged Border Violations of Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan promised Tuesday to the leader of former Lebanese resistance
Hezbollah that the United Nations will seriously deal with alleged
border violations of Israel, Lebanon's People's Sound radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Annan held talks with Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan
Nasrallah Tuesday morning before he left Beirut for Amman, Jordan.
He also stressed that the peacekeeping U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) will be committed to settle such violations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council on Sunday announced to verify that Israel
had ended its 22-year occupation in south Lebanon, despite Lebanese
complaint that about 16 Lebanese areas along the border are still
under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
announced that if such border violations are not solved soundly, it
will choose "resistance as the best way". The Shiite Muslim group
spearheaded a guerrilla war in the past two decades against the
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan said UNIFIL should cooperate with the Lebanese government
and non-government organizations in offering aid to south Lebanon.
He said an international meeting will be held soon to call for
support of development and reconstruction in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Nasrallah, Annan also touched upon the problem
of Lebanese detainees in Israeli prisons, which he promised to
address to the Israeli side during his visit there several days
later.
</P>
<P>
At the airport, Annan told the press that UNIFIL will endeavor
to re-establish authority for the Lebanese government and that its
mission will conclude after that end is attained.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Monday afternoon that the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon will be reinforced by 1,000 troops in July and be
redeployed in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon issued a stark warning on Monday that no authorization
would be given to UNIFIL to deploy to the border unless a full
Israeli withdrawal was confirmed by the Lebanese border
verification team.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Governor Undergoes Corruption Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Governor Sabirin of the Indonesia'
s Central Bank (Bank Indonesia) has been undergone investigation
on Tuesday for corruption charges at the Attorney General Office.
</P>
<P>
The process of the investigation started at 09:30 a.m. (local
time) and it is still going on, officials of the Attorney General
Office told reporters Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said that the
governor may be arrested, if new evidences were found.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that the governor of Bank Indonesia will be
arrested. But it depends on the result of today's investigation,"
Darusman noted.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin was allegedly involved in the country's Bank Bali
scandal. He was named as suspect early this month in the scandal
for allegedly violating the central bank's prudential principle in
its policy to reimburse interbank loans guaranteed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The scandal revolves around 904 billion rupiah (129 million U.S.
dollars) of Bank Indonesia's reimbursement in defaulted loans to
others banks.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has urged the governor to resign
from his post as central bank governor, but the latter rejected
the request.
</P>
<P>
Darusman also said that there is no time table to arrest the
governor.
</P>
<P>
"But if we need an intensive investigation into him (the
governor), he could be arrested. And if he hampers the
investigation process, he could also be arrested," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sabirin's lawyer Mohammad Assegaf said, "There is no
reason at the moment to arrest our client. He is very, very
cooperative with prosecutors. And based on the principle of law
there is also no reason to arrest the governor."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Protect Historical Monuments as Tourism Attractions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will continue to
preserve and protect historical monuments in the country as
tourism products to woo foreign and local tourists, National
Museums and Antiquities Department Director-General Kamarul Bahrin
Buyong said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drastic increase in allocation to preserve historical
heritage clearly reflected the importance of these products to the
government, he said at the Mulu World Heritage Conference in Mulu,
Sarawak, East Malaysia, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000), 50.5 million
ringgit (13.28 million U.S. dollars) was allocated for the purpose,
against 41.1 million ringgit (10.81 million dollars) made under
the Sixth Malaysia Plan (1991-1995) and 1.5 million ringgit (0.39
million dollars) allocated in the Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-1990),
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
A long term plan has been mapped out to promote Malaysia's
historical heritage for tourism purpose, Kamarul Bahrin said,
adding the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism, Malaysian
Tourism Promotion Board and the state governments would pump up
more efforts to plan, develop, promote and mark historical
heritage for the target groups.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Sell 8 State Firms Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of State for
Investment and Promotion of State Owned Enterprises Rozy Munir
said here Tuesday that in line with the on-going privatization
program, the government will sell as many as eight state firms
next year.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the income from share sales of the state owned
companies could be worth 6.7 trillion rupiah (0.957 billion U.S.
dollars) in the year 2001 or 0.5 percent of the country's GDP,"
Munir said in a hearing with the House of Representatives (DPR)
Commission IX on state budget, finance and banking.
</P>
<P>
"And we also hope that both domestic and foreign investors will
take part in this privatization process and will buy shares
offered by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will sell our shares (in state owned companies) through
initial public offering or by seeking strategic partner," he said,
adding that the preparation is underway.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Deputy to the minister I Nyoman Tjager said that the
government will continue with its privatization program despite
the present sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government expected to raise some 6.5
trillion rupiah (764 million U.S. dollars) from the privatization
of 10 state firms during the April-December  period 2000.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Depreciates Rupee to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Central Bank on
Tuesday announced that it will depreciate the country's currency
rupee by allowing a wider rupee-dollar trading band to boost the
flagging exports.
</P>
<P>
"The spread between its buying and selling rates for the U.S.
dollar will be widened to five percent (from the earlier two
percent)," the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said it would intervene in the market if the five
percent trading band was breached.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the bank's announcement, the rupee fell to 78 to a
dollar and then recovered to 76.6 before slipping again to 78.25
at 12:45 p.m. (0645 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The rupee closed at 75.12 rupees to a dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We consider this to be a desirable band which will help
stabilize economic activity. Exporters will gain. We expect the
balance of payments to improve by around 150 million U.S. dollars,
" said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the Central Bank will continue to monitor the domestic
and international markets and change the rates when necessary.
</P>
<P>
However, it will stop its current practice of announcing a
daily buying and selling rate for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the latest adjustment was required to
preserve economic stability due to higher energy and defense
imports and to correct loss of export competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Exporters, while welcoming the depreciation, said the move was
stimulated largely by the pressure on external assets.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's gross official reserves as on May 26, 2000 stood at
1.386 billion dollars, down 15 percent from 1.639 billion dollars
at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Its trade deficit in the first four months of 2000 was 746.5
million dollars against 410.1 million dollars in the same period
last year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Establish Export Processing Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
decided to set up Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and directed the
National Development Corporation (NDC) to suggest suitable areas
and look for investors to develop them, local newspapers reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A special committee, involving various ministries, has been
formed to propose an amendment of the law which established the
NDC so that the corporation could manage the establishment of the
EPZ," Deputy Minister for Industry and Commerce Shamim Khan was
quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
She told the National Assembly in the central town of Dodoma
that after identifying the zones, the NDC would be obliged to look
for investors to develop the areas so that they would be
accessible and have electricity, water and means of communication.
</P>
<P>
According to Khan, the government has decided that the
Friendship Textile Company in Dar es Salaam, a Sino-Tanzanian
joint venture, should operate under the EPZ program.

<P>
The government would assist the farmers of coffee, tea and
other crops to know the prices of their crops in the world market
as well as local prices, she said.
</P>
<P>
"If the farmers know prices in the world market they can use
this knowledge to check whether what they are being paid locally
corresponds with world market prices," she added.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will hold the 12th
Consultative Group (CG) meeting on July 16 to help Zambia search
for a way forward in fighting against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted World Bank resident
representative Lawrence Clarke as saying on Monday that the
meeting will review the progress made in this year's budget with
donors in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"The process of tackling the ideas experienced at the
consultative group meeting will form a basis for any solutions
that will help tackle the monster of poverty which is eating
Zambians," Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
He said if the meeting comes up with basic and fundamental
decisions, that will form a base for economic landscape in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to host the CG meeting will give Zambians an
opportunity to meet diplomatic service, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the World Bank's hope that the decision to be
made will culminate into action.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Paris Club and multilateral donors would decide

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Horticultural Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's horticultural and
floriculture exports have seen a sharp increase in the past 12
years, from 330,000 U.S. dollars in 1987 to 24 million dollars in
1999, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The export increase came mostly from large-scale farmers due to
the high level of investment and expertise required, said
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister Suresh Desai here on
Monday at the launch of the first small holder export vegetables
project linking small holder producers with commercial
agri-business in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's agricultural sector has the potential for increased
production and productivity which could contribute to economic
growth, Desai said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Zambia is better endowed with
abundant natural resources in terms of land, water and good
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
However, the performance of the agricultural sector has for
many years been dismal, he noted, citing past policies of
increased state intervention and control in various areas as the
main obstacles.

<HEADLINE> Drought Slows Kenya's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth slowed
further in March as a prolonged drought and erratic power supply
began to take its toll, the Central Bank of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
The monthly Economic reviews issued here Monday by the bank
said that the country's economy expanded by 1.2 percent in the
year to March, down from 1.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the slow growth mainly to the drought which
hurt agricultural output and power supply and to weak investor
confidence and crumbling infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged drought has left millions of Kenyans threatened with
famine and slashed Kenya's hydroelectric power generating
capacity, and intensified power rationing began late last month,
with industrial users facing only 32 hours of electricity a week.
</P>
<P>
The bank said agricultural and manufacturing sectors recorded
growth of just 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively, in the
12 months to March.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi once again
appealed international community for emergency food aid to 3
million Kenyans facing famine due to prolonged drought.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Zambian Villagers Flee Under Attack of Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Elephants crossing into Zambia from
Zimbabwe have forced hundreds of villagers to flee from the Gwembe
Valley in Zambia' s Western Province, the Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) chief warden Isaac Longwe was
quoted as saying here on Monday that the situation was worrying
and getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
According to Longwe, his authority had since sent one hunter
and two supporting wildlife scouts to the area.
</P>
<P>
The entire valley from Sivonga to Livinstone in Southern
Province had also been invaded by elephants which were causing
extensive damage to fields and property, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that elephants are terrorizing villagers in the
valley. We are aware of the situation and the authority is doing
everything possible to bring the situation under control," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the influx to continue, saying the animals were
running away from rampant poaching and the on-going cropping
exercise in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that six people were attacked by elephants in
the area last week, leaving one dead and another with a broken
hand and leg while the others escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, seven people were killed last year by
wild animals, a situation villagers described as life threatening.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China has
closed down 2,721 enterprises that cause heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, a major energy and chemical industrial base in China,

cement factories that are hazardous to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Discharge of pollution has affected most water sources in the
province, posing threats to people's health.

<P>
China started to control environmental pollution on a large
scale in 1996. But a number of small enterprises in Shanxi are
continuing to pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
Inspection groups sent by the provincial people's government
will go to various areas in the province to bring those
lawbreakers to justice.

<HEADLINE> China Builds More Ecological Demonstration Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to turn the
Lixia River valley in Jiangsu Province into an ecological
demonstration zone.
</P>
<P>
The valley, covering an area of 14,500 sq km, is to meet the
economic, social, and environmental requirements of the country's
sustainable development strategy by 2005.
</P>
<P>
China, worrying about its worsening environment, plans to build
ecological demonstration zones in 140 of its 2,000 counties and
prefectures in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
An official with China's State Environmental Protection
Administration said the move is part of the country's endeavor to
achieve a fast economic growth while maintaining a healthy
environment.
</P>
<P>
China began to construct ecological demonstration zones in 1995.
By the end of last year, 33 counties and prefectures across the
country had ecological demonstration zones.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the environmental requirements
contain 19 specific development targets, including the forest
coverage rate, the consumption rate of environment-friendly energy,
and reduction in consumption of farm chemicals and chemical
fertilizers, as well as the quality of air.

<HEADLINE> Drought Hits Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A drought in Qinghai Province in
northwest China has affected 1.21 million people and 400,000
domestic animals, local officials said today.
</P>
<P>
So far, the drought has affected 330,000 hectares of farmland,
threatening the growth of grain crops and edible oil crops, which
may result in 200 million yuan (about 24 million US dollars) of
economic losses, said officials with the Provincial Civil Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
About nine million hectares of pasture land have been affected
by the drought, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since March, precipitation in the province in the northeast
part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has been up to 80 percent less
than last year's, while temperatures has been two to three Celsius
degrees higher.
</P>
<P>
The province was also hit by a drought last year.
</P>
<P>
Protracted drought has led to windy weather, floating dust and
sandstorms. In some places, the tents of herdsmen have been blown
away and houses of dozens of farmers were buried under sand.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- There is a possibility of shortage of drinking water in
Israel by the end of autumn, former Israeli water commissioner Dan
Zaslavsky told the Jerusalem Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zaslavsky said that the general public is not aware of the
seriousness of the severely depleted state of Lake Kinneret, the
major freshwater reservoir, and the country's underground
reservoirs, which he maintained is nothing short of catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
The concern is apparently what prompted the sudden visit to
Turkey by a top-level Israeli delegation to assess the feasibility
and cost of importing fresh water next year from there.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The establishment of a Palestinian state with Israeli
agreement and the continuation of the talks on the permanent
settlement are at the center of proposals for a temporary
arrangement with the Palestinians that have been submitted to
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were formulated by Israel Defense Force (IDF)
General Staff and by the Peace Directorate in the prime minister's
office.
</P>
<P>
In such an interim pact, which will have a duration of a year
and a half or two years, Israel will recognize a Palestinian state
and will conduct negotiations with it on demarcating the final
borders. Meanwhile, the Palestinians will receive another slice of
the West Bank as part of the IDF's third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Tens of thousands of Jewish settlers from across the West
Bank and Gaza Strip converged on Jerusalem Monday, demonstrating
against further territorial concessions, which they fear will give
the Palestinians control of 90 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the slogans "Barak is losing the country" and "Brothers,
do not abandon us," the protest was sponsored by the Council of
Jewish Settlements in Judea, Samaria and Gaza (Israelis' term for
the West Bank and Gaza).
</P>
<P>
The council started with a demonstration in the Wohl Rose Garden
opposite the Knesset (parliament), followed by a prayer vigil in
Zion Square, and culminated with a protest opposite Barak's
residence.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A 46-year old father of three was beaten to death by a 28-
year-old suspect Monday in a public parking lot near Tel Aviv after
the two quarreled over the right of way at a junction.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office issued a statement expressing
outrage over this latest event in a series of acts of lethal
violence and announcing that Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami will hold meetings with law enforcement officials.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Leading international credit rating agency Standard &AMP;
Poor (S&AMP;P) predicted that Turkey's consumer price inflation would
reach 50 percent this year, compared to the government projection
of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In its most recent report dated June 2000, the agency said
Turkey's real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 4 percent,
which may fall much short of the government's 5.5-percent
expectation for 2000.
</P>
<P>
S&AMP;P foresaw a 7.3-percent unemployment rate for 2000.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has set August 28 as a deadline for three
consortia to place bids for consultancy services pertaining to the
Istanbul railway and tube crossing scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Bosphorus Tube Crossing and Commuter Rail Project, or
Marmaray, is scheduled to be in operation in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, which will
provide 870 million U.S. dollars to finance the project, has also
approved three bidders.
</P>
<P>
The Marmaray project is 76.3 kilometers long in its entirety
with the submerged tube designed to be 1.8 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's leading textile producer Sahinler Holding
plans to expand in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Sahinler Chairman Kemal Sahin said the company is trying to
expand sales in France, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain and
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Sahin said 15 percent of the company's total exports went to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Dubai Customs has launched "E-Mirsal," the first e-
government e-commerce solution to go live.
</P>
<P>
E-Mirsal service allows agent shippers, transport companies and
other organizations in the cargo business to process their customs
clearing documents through the Internet 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Obeid Saqr Busit, chairman of the United Arab Emirates
Customs Council, said that E-Mirsal, which is the e-commerce
version of the Dubai Customs developed Mirsal Cargo Community
system, can process up to 8,000 transactions per day for Dubai's
land, air and sea customs offices.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Address Unemployment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reassured
the public Tuesday that a two-pronged mechanism is in place to
address the country's unemployment, which hit a nine-year high of
13.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma of the Department of Labor and
Employment said this two-pronged mechanism involves maintaining
industrial peace and retraining displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said in a radio interview that aside from this two-
pronged mechanism, the government also expects the agriculture
sector to bounce back in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The projected higher farm yields are expected to translate to
more jobs in the coming months, Laguesma noted.
</P>
<P>
"The industry and manufacturing sectors continue to implement a
program that will preserve jobs through industrial peace,"
Laguesma said.
</P>
<P>
This, he pointed out, entails encouraging organized labor and
management to settle any difference amicably instead of resorting
to confrontational tactics.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma sid the second component involves the training and
retraining of displaced workers, as well as providing livelihood
assistance to them.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office (NSO) reported Monday that the
country's unemployment rate has soared to 13.9 percent in April,
from 9.3 percent in January. This was also higher than the 11.8
percent unemployment rate registered in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said this was due mainly to the "steep fall"
experienced by the agriculture sector, where l.5 million
agricultural workers lost their jobs. This is one third of the
estimated 4.5 million Filipinos who the NSO survey said are
presently jobless.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Push for Resolution on New Financial Order </HEADLINE>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia wants to push for a
resolution on the establishment a new international financial
architecture (IFA) at the 27th Islamic Conference of Foreign
Ministers (ICFM) here next week, calling for a reform of the world

financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the OIC (Organization of Islamic Conference) can
be used as a channel to get the endorsement from member countries,
which collectively are a formidable force in global finance,"
Bernama news agency Tuesday quoted Foreign Ministry Deputy
Secretary-General Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak as saying in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has maintained that the global financial system should
be reformed, failing which developing economies would continue to
be at the mercy of unscrupulous currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fuzi said the ICFM would also discuss matters pertaining
to the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly the launching
of a new round of trade talks in 2003.
</P>
<P>
He said the discussion on the IFA should involve both the
developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The four-day ICFM is scheduled to be opened by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad on June 27.

<HEADLINE> Australia Donates Emergency Aid to Solomons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia Tuesday donated 1
million Australian dollars (600,000 U.S. dollars) in emergency
humanitarian aid to the Solomon Islands but warned that the
warring sides must show a commitment to peace before further help
was offered.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said in a
statement that 250,000 Australian dollars (150,000 U.S. dollars)
would supply basic medicines at the urgent request of the Solomons
Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 750,000 Australian dollars (450,000 U.S. dollars)
would be spent by the International Committee of the Red Cross on
maintaining medical supplies, protection for detainees and
delivering shelter and food to displaced people on both side of
the ethnic conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer welcomed the continuation of the truce in and around
rebel Malaitan Eagle Force-held capital Honiara.
</P>
<P>
He said his special envoy Pater Baxter and the Australian High
Commission were working intensively with various Solomon Islands
parties to help consolidate the truce and allow the early return
of effective government authority.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is ready to provide substantial support to make a
peace settlement work," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"I must emphasize that the significant support we are able to
offer for that purpose is entirely contingent on a demonstrated
commitment on all sides to reject the path of violence and pursue
a genuine and urgent peace process under constitutional rule," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The extent to which the various Solomon Islands parties carry
forward efforts to re-establish constitutional authority and
reactivate peace negotiations will affect directly our readiness
and capacity to assist," Downer added.

astonishingly more cancer cases detected over the past year, the
Bulgarian Monitor newspaper reported Monday.

According to the report, one out of 31 people in the vicinity
has developed cancer, and one sixth of the total 5,035 cancer
patients have died, while the number of cancer and pulmonary
diseases patients is still increasing. "No one would believe it is
not related to the war and to the weapons manufactured from
depleted uranium, though cancer could be caused by many reasons,"

<P>
NINGBO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A company based in the port city of
Ningbo in east China's Zhejiang Province claimed that it has
mastered the technology for producing large-screen plasma monitors.
</P>
<P>
Plasma monitors are used for TV manufacturing and for military
purposes. The manufacturing technology is monopolized by Japan and
few other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tianming Electronics Co. Ltd., a township enterprise in
Ningbo City, Zhejiang, developed the technology after inviting a
renowned plasma monitor scientist Dr. Sun Boyan and his colleagues.
Tianming Electronics built a laboratory three years for them
costing 16 million yuan (about 1.93 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company has applied for a patent, while the city of Ningbo

TIANJIN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Xuexi, a 69-year-old retiree
in north China's Tianjin Municipality, lived in a tiny 60 sq. m
two-bedroom apartment for about three decades.
</P>
<P>
Like Zhu, another 1.1 million Tianjiners have moved out of
their old houses that had no central heating or bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
The city government has pulled down 8.36 million sq.m. old
houses for building new dwelling areas in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that living space per capita in the city has
risen from 9.6 sq.m in 1993 to 13 sq.m.
</P>
<P>
Building houses in downtown areas has meant that large
industrial plants have had to relocate elsewhere, reducing
pollution in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Building houses has changed the face of the city. Statistics
show that in the last six years, 10 new bridges have been built
and 29 roads have been widened. Greenery per capita has also
increased from 2.6 sq.m to 4.87 sq.m.

<HEADLINE> Drought Hits Millions of Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 3.2 million people in east
China's Shandong Province are plagued by water shortage due to a
protracted drought.
</P>
<P>
Water conservancy officials said more than 5,000 villages are
threatened by shortages of water. A number of farmers are forced
to trek a long distance to fetch water.
</P>
<P>
In some places, people have queued up to get water.
</P>
<P>
The province has been hit by drought for the last 22 months.
Since September 1998, precipitation was merely 620 millimeters,
the fewest since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was
founded.
</P>
<P>
The level of groundwater keeps dropping and water in reservoirs
stand at around three billion cubic meters, 30 percent less than
the average amount of previous years. Many reservoirs have even
run dry, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments forecast that the province will not
have much rain as high temperatures will continue.
</P>
<P>
Drought is also striking northeast China's Liaoning, affecting
one million hectares of farmland, or a quarter of the province's
total. So far, 30,000 hectares of crops have died.
</P>
<P>
"If it does not rain heavily in the near future, I fear 360,000
people and more than 200,000 head of domestic animals will not
have enough drinking water," said Zhong Gang, director of the
Provincial Water Conservancy Department.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has launched an emergency campaign against the drought,
motivating people to irrigate their farms. Some 72 million yuan (
about 8.7 million U.S. dollars) has been allocated for this
purpose.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Rising sea levels are
threatening to make thousands of people homeless in the small
Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu, a Wellington-based Newspaper, the
Evening Post, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Global warming has been blamed on the rising seas, which have
caused extreme high tides to sweep over parts of the nine atolls
that make up the Pacific Island state, 4,000 km north of New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Tuvalu's Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana said the rising
levels will make some of the atolls inhabitable, and he believes
around one third of his people would need to move to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Ionatana said he has asked the New Zealand government to
consider a proposal to resettle around 3,000 of his country's
population in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter will be discussed further next month at the
annual talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said here Tuesday that
she expects to hold government-to-government talks with Tuvalu at
some point, and the issue will be addressed during those talks.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt Tuvalu is suffering from severe overpopulation, and
that can only be made worse by rising tides," she said.
</P>
<P>
Tuvalu has a population of about 10,000, according to earlier
reports.
</P>
<P>
At a U.N. conference on climate change in March, the World
Wildlife Fund called on western governments, which contribute the
most to the build-up of global warming gases such as carbon
dioxide, to accept they must compensate those suffering from its
effects.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Increase Overseas Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is to boost its
overseas aid by 6.5 percent during the coming year, Associate
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Matt Robson said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the New Zealand government, Robson
said this year's allocation of 226.5 million NZ dollars (107
million U.S. dollars) for overseas aid represents 0.27 percent of
the country's GNP and a 14-million-NZ-dollar (6.65 million U.S.
dollars)increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Our program remains strongly focused on the South Pacific,
where New Zealand has its closest ties and a track record of
effective aid delivery. Most of our effort will go into education
and training,health and good governance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM: Fiji Unstable Without Ethnic Indians in Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Fiji would have no chance of
political stability if it dealt ethnic-Indian Fijians out of
political power, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis in Fiji appeared a step closer to resolution
when coup leader George Speight agreed with the military on who
should be the next president.
</P>
<P>
Speight had also said he would accept ethnic Indians in a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Downer told reporters that ethnic Indian participation was not
negotiable in any lasting agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is quite a simple one and if Indian Fijians are
going to be left out of the participation in government, then you
won't have any stability in Fiji," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer remained unconvinced about whether progress had been
made in the armed standoff that began on May 19.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations had to be seen in the context of the
political struggle between the ruling military and Fijian chiefs
who support the coup.
</P>
<P>
Downer also repeated his threat of further sanctions after
Speight's 31 hostages were released from parliament house.
</P>
<P>
Speight claimed on Monday that he and the military had agreed
that former vice president Ratu Josefa Iloilo, an indigenous
Fijian, should be the next president.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Says Philippine Economy Remains Solid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
reassured the international community Tuesday that the country's
economy remains on solid ground as shown by the country's high
export growth, low inflation and other positive indicators.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that he and his cabinet continue to
strive to enhance the country's stature as one of the most
investment-attractive sites in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"My cabinet members spend much time and effort on the
improvement of the country's economic performance," he said,
adding that the pro-business stand stems from the government's
thrust of enticing new investments to generate more opportunities
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the Philippines' economic
indicators remain stable despite the recent hostilities in
Mindanao, with growth still expected between four and five percent
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we expect the growth of the gross domestic product
to be at four to five percent, with the industry sector leading
the way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that exports continue to perform strongly,
growing by 19 percent at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also said the country's international reserves now
stand at as high as 15 billion U.S. dollars, while inflation
remains among the lowest in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president allayed concerns by potential investors
about the recent conflict in Mindanao, saying the government
remains committed to pursuing just and lasting peace in the South,
side by side with development efforts for the island.
</P>
<P>
But this peace he stressed, must be an enduring one, and would
demand the sincere support of all Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Opposition MPs End Year Long Abstention from House  by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The lawmakers belonging to
mainstream opposition -- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),
Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami, joined the current parliament
session on Tuesday, thus ending their about one year continuous
abstention from attending the House.
</P>
<P>
According to opposition sources, the members of parliament (MPs)
of the opposition alliance returned to the parliament not for a
brief period to protect their membership but for long stay to
discuss different political and socio-economic issues on the floor
of the House.
</P>
<P>
The BNP lawmakers led by opposition Chief Whip Khandakar Delwar
Hossain, staged a walkout from the House on July 5, 1999 over
certain issues. Since then the BNP lawmakers along with other like-
minded legislators continued to abstain from attending the House.
</P>
<P>
As per the constitution if any member of parliament refrained
from attending the House for 90 consecutive days, his or her
membership would automatically be vacated.
</P>
<P>
The opposition MPs have decided to return to parliament
following a "positive high level meeting" of the top leaders of
the BNP-led alliance on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Parliament Prof. A Q M
Badruddoza Chowdhury said later: "We are going to join the
parliament to protect the constitution and foil government's
blueprint to cling to power by eliminating the opposition."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Monday reportedly welcomed the
opposition's move to return to the parliament. "It's good for
democracy," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Speaker Humayun Rasheed Choudhury on Monday abruptly
adjourned the sitting of the House soon after the supplementary
budget was passed though the opposition MPs were preparing to join
the session.
</P>
<P>
The sitting was adjourned just 15 minuets before BNP
Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia arrived at the House at 11 a.m. (
local time).
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Opposition Khaleda Zia later said that the
government does not want the opposition to return to the
parliament. She said that "we wanted to return to the parliament
on Monday but the government shut the doors on us hurriedly ending
the session."

<HEADLINE> Top Water-Control Official Warns Yangtze River Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Large precipitation on the upper
reaches of China's longest river, the Yangtze, and its major
tributaries indicates the possibility of floods this summer,
warned a senior official from the Yangtze Flood Control Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li Antian, deputy commander with the committee, urged anti-
flood officials in provinces along the river to be well prepared
for flood control.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Yangtze Water Resources Committee (YWRC) said
that China has invested some one billion yuan (120 million US
dolllars) in reinforcing Yangtze River embankments since last year.
</P>
<P>
China began last year to carry out an ambitious dyke-
enforcement project along the river. The project expects to
improve the anti-flood capacity of Yangtze embankments. The
project will take four to five years and cost 15 billion yuan (1.8
billion US dollars) in central government funding.
</P>
<P>
Earthwork on some 5 million cu m was accomplished with a filter-
proof wall covering 1.6 million sq m installed to protect some
dangerous sections of the main embankment.
</P>
<P>
The filter-proof reinforcement measures used to consolidate the
dykes is the largest of its kind since the founding of the People'
s Republic in 1949, according to Xiong Tie, a YWRC official. He
said that another 1.6 sq m filter-proof wall will be built this
year.

<HEADLINE> China Releases More Large Yellow Croakers into Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to release 1.1
million large yellow croakers into the East China Sea this year to
help increase their numbers.
</P>
<P>
The fry will be sent to the Zhoushan Fishing Ground, China's
largest fishing ground, off Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The large yellow croaker has long been popular in Chinese as a
delicacy. In the 1970s, there were 200,000 to 300,000 tons of them
harvested each year, 90 percent of them from the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing in the 1980s, however, sharply brought down their
numbers and nearly drove them to the point of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Specialists began to do research on breeding methods in the
late 1980s in Xiangshan Bay, a fish breeding center in Zhejiang,
and have since bred millions of fish fry.
</P>
<P>
Though the croakers have a cosy home in the bay, experts warned
that long-term artificial breeding will cause degeneration of the
species, saying that the best way to maintain their vigor is to
release them in their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998 a total of 450,000 artificially bred croakers have
been sent to the East China Sea.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Prices Continue to Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's sugar prices continued to
rise this month, according to the "Market Daily".
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that the sugar prices reached 3,100 yuan (
about 380 U.S. dollars) per ton, up 1,250 yuan from the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the price hike to the restructuring of the
sugar industry and the monopoly of a few sugar producers.
</P>
<P>
In south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a major
sugar distribution center, large sugar groups control some one
million tons of sugar or two thirds of the region's total.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the total sugar output will not likely
exceed 7 million tons this year, leaving a 1.5-million-ton gap
between supply and demand. Sugar prices are therefore likely to
continue to rise in the latter half of the year.

<HEADLINE> British Firm to Invest $100m in China's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Leading British insurance group
CGU and CDC Capital Partners, a leading equity investor in
emerging markets, have recently announced the formation of a joint
venture for investment in China's private sector.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture company, CGU-CDC China Partners, is to invest
100 million U.S. dollars with the aim of taking equity stakes in
the private sector in China, according to sources from CGU's
Beijing representative office.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses in newly-rising industries, especially in
the information industry, would be the priority of investment, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
CGU is now known as CGNU in the United Kingdom after its merger
with Norwich Union. The leading insurance group in Europe now has
worldwide premium income of 41.6 billion U.S. dollars and assets
under management of 320 billion U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company has been engaged in investment activities in China,
most notably through the launch, two years ago, of its China Index
Fund which invests in China's B shares.
</P>
<P>
CDC Capital Partners is one of the leading private equity
investors in emerging markets. It was granted approval by the UK
government to invest in China in September 1998. In July 1999,
both the UK and Chinese governments gave their formal support to
its decision to commence operation in China.

<HEADLINE> Experts to Discuss Latest Results of Dunhuang Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG (Gansu), June 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 experts and
scholars from home and abroad will gather here next month to
discuss the latest findings in Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
To mark the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the Dunhuang
cave containing thousands of centuries-old documents and relics,
the Dunhuang Academy and the Chinese Dunhuang-Turpan Society will
hold an international symposium on Dunhuang Studies from July 29
to August 3 at the Mogao Grottoes here.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Library Cave was accidentally found by a Taoist
priest when he was clearing sand from the No. 16 grotto on June 22,
1900. The cave, sealed for 850 years, holds more than 50,000
relics dating between the 4th century and 11th century.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will cover a wide range of subjects, such as the
modern-day function of the cave, the losses and categorization of
the relics, the achievements of Dunhuang Studies and the
comparative studies of the cave, sources from the academy said.
</P>
<P>
Noted scholars and experts from Hong Kong, Japan, Britain,
Russia as well as China will participate in the symposium, which
has already received over 150 theses.
</P>
<P>
Historic documents record that the first cave in the Mogao
Grottoes was formed in 366 A.D. Despite erosion and man-made
destruction, the 492 existing caves are well preserved, with
frescoes covering an area of 45,000 square meters, more than 2,000
colored sculptured figures and five wooden eaves overhanging the
caves.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the Mogao Grottoes are the most
complete repository of Buddhist art in the world. The United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
listed it on the World Heritage List in 1987.

<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A number of special vocational
schools have been established in some parts of the country over
the past few years to help poor and disabled children acquire
basic education and working skills.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of children have benefited from the Hope Primary
Vocational School project, initiated and funded by the China
Working Committee for Caring for the Next Generation.
</P>
<P>
The schools are located mainly in the country's old
revolutionary bases and border regions, such as Jinzhai County,
Anhui Province, and Ih Ju League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Since it opened in 1996, the Hope Primary Vocational School in
Ih Ju League in northern China has received 202 children who
dropped out of school because of their families' poor economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from basic secondary school courses, the school offers
such subjects as animal husbandry, vegetable and fruit growing,
food processing and computer science.
</P>
<P>
Of the school's 93 graduates last year, 18 have gone on to
senior middle school for further studies and 75 chose to work.
</P>
<P>
In Jinzhai County, a poor county in the east China province of
Anhui, most of the school drop-outs have been girls.
</P>
<P>
Teachers at the Hope Primary Vocation School there were devoted
to getting the girls back to school. They visited over 400 girls'
families and arranged to meet their special needs.

So far, more than 200 girl students have completed their
primary middle school courses in the school. They also learned
vocational skills such as hair-dressing and sewing.
</P>
<P>
The committee, while putting emphasis on helping the poor to
get basic schooling, have also taken steps to promote the rights
and interests of disabled children.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the committee has helped set up schools specially
designed for mentally handicapped children in the Dongcheng and
Xuanwu districts of the Chinese capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Primary Vocational Schools are highly regarded by many
people.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a recent symposium on the project held that the
Hope Primary Vocational School model has been proved effective in
helping children in difficulties to get basic education.
</P>
<P>
The project has also helped the country to effectively carry
out the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the participants
said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Peiqiu, executive director of the China Working Committee
for Caring for the Next Generation, said that the committee was
planning to further promote the project in the country's vast west
regions.

<HEADLINE> Israel Favors Interim Pact With Palestinians: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The founding of a Palestinian
state with Israeli agreement and the continuation of talks between
the two sides on permanent settlement topped the Israeli proposals
for a temporary arrangement with the Palestinians, a local
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were submitted to Prime Minister Ehud Barak by the
General Staff of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and by the Peace
Directorate in the Prime Minister's Office, Ha'aretz reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A similar but less detailed proposal on the so-called temporary
arrangement with the Palestinians, or interim pact, was also
formulated by the National Security Council, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a political source as saying that the main
points of the IDF proposals include that Israel will recognize a
Palestinian state and will conduct negotiations with it on
demarcating the final borders.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will have a duration of a year and a half or two
years and will not be defined as an "interim settlement", but
rather a transitional arrangement designed to define relations in
the phase leading from Palestinian autonomy to statehood, said the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Israel will continue to supervise the external border crossings
to Jordan and Egypt and the Palestinian airport in Gaza to prevent
anyone who enters the Palestinian territories from crossing into
Israel without inspection, the proposals said.
</P>
<P>
The proposals went on to say that the existing economic,
security and regional cooperation arrangements, as were set in the
interim agreements, will remain valid and the Palestinians will
receive another slice of the West Bank as part of the IDF's third
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The source said that during the security cabinet meeting on
Sunday, Barak told the ministers that he prefers first to exhaust
the possibility of attaining a comprehensive framework agreement,
which will refer to all the issues still outstanding with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Barak did not rule out the proposals for a temporary or
partial agreement.
</P>
<P>
The temporary arrangement may in the last analysis be called a "
framework agreement" and serve as the first stage of the permanent
settlement with the Palestinians, the source added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Productivity Rated Among Asia's Best: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's productivity and
quality (P&AMP;Q) level is rated among the best in Asia and even
beyond, according to a senior official of the National
Productivity Corporation (NPC) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, productivity levels in Malaysia grew at
an average of 5.0 percent annually and such a level compares
favorably with the developed nations and better than many
countries in Asia, NPC director-general Ismail Adam said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC, formerly known as the National Productivity Center,
believes that there is still room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
The information technology era has changed the way business is
run and how products are produced and with the rate of technology
changing rapidly, Malaysian companies may require a 180-degree
change in the way their businesses are being managed and products
produced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The key concern is to upgrade our workforce as soon as
possible. The learning curve may be steeper than before. Over the
years we have shown that we can gradually assimilate and adapt to
new situations but now we have to learn faster," Bernama news
agency quoted Ismail as saying in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the usage of information technology (IT) in
productivity remains low at just 20 percent as the focus is aimed
at modernizing the supporting functions of organizations like
personnel management and the accounting process, he said, adding "
What we want to see is the use of IT in the production process,
designing process and delivery system which include not only
physical ordering but financial transactions."
</P>
<P>
The NPC, under the ministry of international trade and industry,
was established in 1962 to spearhead the promotion and
dissemination of P&AMP;Q-related materials and issues, and is also
responsible for creating an information and reference center for
productivity indices, management systems and case studies in
Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Blamed for Cancer Rise in Bulgaria Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia has
caused more than a pollution headache in Bulgaria's northwestern
border areas, with astonishingly more cancer cases detected over
the past year, the Bulgarian Monitor newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, one out of 31 people in the vicinity
has developed cancer, and one sixth of the total 5,035 cancer
patients have died, while the number of cancer and pulmonary
diseases patients is still increasing.
</P>
<P>
"No one would believe it is not related to the war and to the
weapons manufactured from depleted uranium, though cancer could be
caused by many reasons," the report quoted a local medical
official as saying, stressing that the situation will not improve
in years.
</P>
<P>
"The war has caused more and more illnesses among people
because uranium and other radioactive substances have a bad effect
on the environment," said an official with the local government.
</P>
<P>
Half the residents in Gorno Cerobene town have died of
nephritis after drinking the contaminated water and eating foods
grown in the polluted lands, the town's mayor disclosed in the
report.
</P>
<P>
Other reports reaching here say the Timok River in the
country's northwestern border was also polluted, making the water
not potable.
</P>
<P>
NATO dropped depleted uranium bombs last year during its 78-day
air raid on Yugoslavia and destroyed the environment in both the
Balkan country and its neighbors.

"We worked so hard," said the 21-year-old superstar. "It was a
hard fought game. We finally got a championship and it feels
great."
</P>
<P>
It was really close, dog-fighting and thrilling game, which
delighted and satisfied the tens of thousands of the Lakers fans
inside and outside the Staple Center. The Lakers came within one
point four times in the second half before finally taking a lead
with 9:02 left in the fourth quarter. The Pacers tied the game at
103 with just over five minutes to go, and themselves pulled
within a point with a minute and a half to go but never took back
the lead.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers was really best-shooting team in the NBA -- it seems
everyone of the team is marksman inside and outside, which forced
the Lakers, the best NBA team of the season, was very busy and
hard to defend them.
</P>
<P>
Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 29 points, Reggie Miller got 25,
Dale Davis had 20 points and a game-high 14 rebounds and Austin
Croshere tallied 16 points for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
"It's always sweet," said Jackson, who has seven championships
as a coach after winning six with Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
"This is for L.A., the Staples Center. What a way to start the
millennium!"
</P>
<P>
Purple and gold confetti streamed down from the rafters as
owner Jerry Buss addressed the fans and commissioner David Stern
presented O'Neal with his trophy.
</P>
<P>
It was the 12th title in franchise history for the Lakers, the
seventh since they moved to Los Angeles in 1960. Magic Johnson,
Kareem-Abdul Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain had earned the Lakers'
previous titles, and this starstruck city had been eagerly
awaiting the next one -- especially since the 7-foot-1, 330-pound
unstoppable force O'Neal and Jordan-like young superstar Bryant
are in rising mood.
</P>
<P>
Some NBA experts believe Monday night's win is not only the
2000 NBA championship for the Lakers, but also the establishment
of the Lakers Dynasty in the next decade which will witnesses a
couple of NBA championships for the dominant, superstar-staffed
and young Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Hotels Urged to Move out of Zhangjiajie Scenic Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 20 (Xinhua) --Hotels and local residents will be
moved out of the world famous scenic resort of Zhangjiajie in
central China's Hunan Province within five years, under the advice
of the United Nations World Heritage Center.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to reduce mounting pollution at Zhangjiajie
which was listed as UNESCO site in 1992. It will cost some 300
million yuan (36 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition to the relocation of 9,000 local residents,
numerous hotels and restaurants will be demolished.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zhangjiajie earned one billion yuan (120 million U.S.
dollars) in tourism. Some 2.8 million tourists visited Zhangjiajie
including 151,000 overseas visitors.
</P>
<P>
However, bustling tourism has produced serious pollution. At
the Jinbianxi scenic spot, which is dubbed as "the most beautiful
canyon", a number of restaurants emerging in recent years
discharge 1,500 tons of sewage daily.
</P>
<P>
A relocation headquarters has open in Jinbianxi to carry out
the clean-out project.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Language "Holy Bible" Discovered in Dunhuang Grottoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, (Gansu), June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
have discovered excerpts from the Christian Bible written in an
ancient Syrian language in the northern zone of the Mogao Grottoes
of Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The excerpts from the New Testament were hand-copied onto a
piece of white linen paper 30.8 cm long and 19.8 cm wide.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Beijing University said that the discovery is of
great significance in studying the development of Christianity in
the central Asia and the Dunhuang area in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
A number of other documents written in ancient Basba and Uyghur
languages were also found. All of the documents, including the
Syriac Bible, date back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists found 248 grottoes in the northern zone,
containing wooden movable type of the Uyghur, ancient documents,
porcelain products, ox horn products, Persian silver coins and
iron coins of the Western Xia (1038-1227).
</P>
<P>
Based on the discovery of movable-type of the Uyghur, Duan
Jinzhang, a researcher from the Dunhuang Research Academy, said
that the Mogao Grottoes might have had printing equipment used to
print a lot of sutras and documents.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang, carved out of rocks, stretch
for 1,600 meters along the eastern side of Mingsha Hill, 25 km
southeast of the town of Dunhuang in the northwest desert corridor
of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 caves formed over the course of a thousand years are
still intact, featuring frescoes covering an area of 50,000 square
meters, more than 2,000 colored sculptured figures, and five
wooden eaves hanging over the caves.

<HEADLINE> Food Gap in Bangladesh Reduced to Zero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's food-gap came down to
zero in 1999-2000 for the first time, the Daily Star reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest production has been projected at 24.3 million metric
tons (MT) against a net annual requirement of 21.35 million MT of
foodgrain. Deducting the 10-12 percent usual crop loss, the net
food production is exactly around the level of requirement.
</P>
<P>
Never before in the 30-year history of Bangladesh had the
domestic production been at par with the domestic requirements.
Each year Bangladesh used to cover up its food deficit by
accepting an average volume of 0.5 to one million MT food from
donors and by importing.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts attributed the zero food-gap to expansion
of modern varieties, technologies, research advancement and good
government policies.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that rapid expansion of irrigated rice is
one of the main factors behind the phenomenal growth in
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The country's sixth five-plan sets out to attain food self-
sufficiency by growing 25 million MT food by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> Thai GDP Grows 5.2% in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) expanded 5.2% in the first quarter of 2000 from the same
period of last year, the National Economic and Social Development
Board (NESDB) announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The growth is attributed to the surge in exports, which offset
declines in financial services and agriculture, the NESDB said in
a report.
</P>
<P>
"Exports rose 30 percent from a year ago in the first quarter,
powering the GDP growth. Continued export growth will keep
Thailand's economy expanding this year, and the government has
raised its full-year growth forecast to 5 percent from 4.4 percent,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, bank lending and investment are yet
to recover from the recession of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's financial services industry and agriculture sector
contracted 4.3 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, in the first
quarter from a year ago, the economic planning agency noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's doubtful whether Thailand can sustain its growth if the
government doesn't address the problems of non-performing loans (
NPLs), slow debt restructuring and slumping agricultural prices,"
it stressed.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Demands US$21 Mln of Ransom: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A top Philippine government
official has confirmed that Abu Sayyaf gunmen holding 21 mostly
foreign hostages in Sulu province are demanding one million U.S.
dollars for each captive, Philippine Daily Inquirer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said Monday the ransom demand had indeed been made.
</P>
<P>
"You may have heard that they are asking for one million
dollars per hostage. It is true that that is what they are asking,
" Zamora said. The 21-million-dollar demand was first reported
more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that although the government and the hostage takers
had focused on Abu Sayyaf's political demands, including a
separate Islamic state, they would eventually have to haggle over
a ransom.
</P>
<P>
Still, he reiterated the government's no-ransom policy, as, he
said, the ongoing negotiations between the kidnappers and a
government team led by presidential adviser Robert Aventajao could
last up to six months.
</P>
<P>
However, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno continued to deny there
was any talk of ransom.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no specific ransom demands made by any party
purporting to speak for the Abu Sayyaf and there is certainly no
demand on the table," Puno said Monday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two of the five known Abu Sayyaf leaders in Sulu
also said the group's bottom line was not money but the "quest for
self-determination."
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, including three Germans, two French, two Finns,
two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos,
were kidnapped from a Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and then
taken to the southern Philippine province of Sulu.

<HEADLINE> China to Replant More Trees: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to replant 90 million
hectares of forests by 2050 despite adverse landscapes and
climates, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, in a period of considerable length, the No.1 goal
of China's forestry development will focus on fostering and
protecting forest resources," the paper quoted Wang Zhibao,
director of the State Forestry Administration as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reforestation will increase China's forested territory form
16 percent to 26 percent of its total, and help overcome erosion
and other environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
The administration has set incremental goals for the 90 million
hectares by 2050: 19 percent forest coverage by 2010 and 24
percent by 2030, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, officials with the administration also conceded that
these goals are hard to reach, especially in the more arid western
areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang also stressed that China should intensify continuous
reforestation and pay more attention to the varieties of trees,
instead of emphasizing timber production through over-logging.

BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting rules on
Internet copyrights to fill the current legal vacuum and prevent
piracy of literary works, China Daily reported today.

Wang Haopeng, director of the National Copyright Administration
's copyright department, said that the administration is trying
its best to come up with rules governing on-line publication as

</P>
<P>
The rules would set up a legal framework for copyright-disputes
solving by giving a clearer definition of websites' publishing
rights. The audio/video sector will also be covered, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
But an amendment to the copyright law may take a while in
coming."A temporary regulation would help a lot," Wang was quoted

<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian police have
confiscated more than one million counterfeit U.S. dollars,
reported the Mongolian News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
These counterfeit U.S. dollar bills, which were found in the
Mongolian northernmost province of Darkhan-Uul bordering Russia,
are all in denominations of 100-dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
The bills were made using modern printing technology and it is
difficult for the average person to distinguish them from real
bills, the agency said, adding that the counterfeit U.S. dollar
bills may have come from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian markets have been shaken by counterfeit U.S.
dollar bills in recent days. On June 9, the Mongolian police
confiscated 9,500 counterfeit U.S. dollars from a currency market
in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Island of Snakes Doubled Growth of Snake Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Snake Island in northeast China's
Liaoning Province has reported a doubled number of pallas pit
vipers over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
More than 18,000 such snakes are now living on the island near
the port city of Dalian, said Zhang Jiucheng, an official in
charge of the National Nature Reserve of Snake Island and Mount
Laotieshan.
</P>
<P>
The number of the snakes has been increasing by three percent
annually during recent years.
</P>
<P>
The 0.73-square-kilometer Snake Island is home to the pallas
pit viper. The spring and autumn seasons will be feast festivals
to snakes as some two million migratory birds stop on the island.
</P>
<P>
The snakes will take sleeps both in Summer and Winter.
</P>
<P>
The number of pallas pit vipers on the island has once declined
due to a fire broken out before 1980s and fishermen's hunting.
Besides, Chinese researchers have found out that the sewer rats
could be a big threat to pallas pit vipers in winter.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve administration therefore has launched an
anti-sewer rats campaign to protect the snakes.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested that the Island not develop tourism to avoid
human interference of the snakes' peaceful life.

<HEADLINE> Manila Willing to Extend Deadline for Agreement With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
willing to extend a June 30 deadline for a peace agreement with
the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as long as the
negotiations progress, local newspaper The Philippine Star said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Joseph Estrada set June 30 as the deadline
for the MILF to accept autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Philippine Press Secretary Ricardo Puno as
saying Monday that the president set the date purely to set a
reference point, a time frame.
</P>
<P>
"But we all know as long as the negotiations are proceeding,
then of course there will be some extension depending on what the
situations would be like," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is asking the government to extend the deadline. On
June 28, the rebels are scheduled to return to the negotiating
table, but they said the military operations in Mindanao have
hampered consultations among their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, for his part, said the
lapse of the deadline on June 30 does not mean that the Armed
Forces of the Philippines would launch a renewed all-out offensive
against the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"What we are saying is the peace will come one way or the other,
" Zamora said. "But the MILF must think about this deadline
because they have agreed earlier through their peace panel working
with our own peace panel on a certain date."
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
Muslim state in Mindanao for more than two decades. MILF rebels
and government troops were locked into fierce battles recently,
resulting in heavy losses on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Americans Concern About Link Between Health, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Three in four Americans
believe they have lived in a community where some health problems
were caused by environmentally related problems with air, water or
food, U.S. public health organization Health-Track reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A survey of more than 1,500 Americans in April shows that most
respondents deem that environmental factors play a major or minor
role in causing diseases such as asthma, birth defects, childhood
cancers such as leukemia, and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted when chronic diseases like asthma and
some major birth defects were on the rise in the United States,
Health-Track said. Chronic disease is the number one killer in the
country, accounting for three of every four deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
About 100 million Americans, more than one-third of the U.S.
population, suffer from some form of chronic disease. The annual
cost of chronic disease is estimated at 325 billion U.S. dollars,
the health organization said.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of 10 Americans surveyed support the establishment of
a national environmental health monitoring system to track chronic
diseases and their links to environmental hazards. By gathering
data on where chronic diseases strike and in what number, the
Health-Track said, it is possible to identify patterns of health
problems, pinpoint potential environmental impacts and enable
additional prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
The public health organization said that the nationwide system
should monitor and track chronic diseases community by community,
identify potential environmental factors and measure exposure to
these dangers. It should also provide an early warning system to
alert the public about the potential for disease and give public
health researchers information that could lead to better
prevention and treatment approaches.

<HEADLINE> Canada Applauds Eritrean-Ethiopian Cease-Fire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government welcomed
the signing of a cease-fire agreement Sunday between two Horn of
Africa nations Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement
Monday that Canadians "are encouraged that both parties have
signed the peace proposal, and applaud the considerable efforts
undertaken by the OAU to achieve this result.
</P>
<P>
"The cease-fire will facilitate Canada's efforts to provide
humanitarian assistance to civilians displaced by the conflict and
to those suffering from the effects of the region's three-year
drought," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government also expressed hopes "that recent
developments will foster an environment conducive to a lasting
peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
In their agreement made in Algiers under the auspices of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), the two neighboring African
countries pledged to halt the border war that has killed tens of
thousands of people and left more than a million civilians
displaced.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 crows have
descended on Ertai Town, Zhangbei County, in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Staff of the local forestry bureau said that it is a mystery
why so many of the birds have gathered in the nearby woods. They
said that efforts made for plant and animal protection in recent
years may have increased the numbers of insects, while an ongoing
drought in north China may have driven the crows to seek food
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Since early spring, most parts of north China and some parts of
south China have been suffering from a severe drought due to
little rainfall and high temperatures. By June 2, the acreage of
drought-stricken farmland exceeded 11 million ha.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers said that the area used to see few crows, but
over 1,000 appeared there last year.

<HEADLINE> Longwan China's Largest Artificial Leather Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Longwan District in the city
of Wenzhou, in east China's Fujian Province, has become the
largest artificial leather production base in the country.
</P>
<P>
The district has more than 40 artificial leather enterprises,
mostly privately owned. They turn out goods worth more than 500
million yuan (about 60 million U.S. dollars) annually, accounting
for 40 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The artificial leather products come in a large number of
varieties, and are famous for their shining colors and soft
texture. They can often replace genuine leather as outside
materials. They also earned an annual income of 45 million U.S.
dollars from leather exports.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, businessmen in the district, finding that
artificial leather products sell well in the international market,
have introduced overseas investment to expand their production
scale.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, chemical plants for artificial leather
production have also emerged in the district.
</P>
<P>
Artificial leather enterprises have introduced more than 50
items of state-of-the-art equipment and production lines from
Shanghai, Taiwan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Investment in each of the production lines surpassed 18 million
yuan, while each has an annual production volume of more than 50
million yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
Longwan's artificial leather products are exported to Southeast
Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and North America.

<HEADLINE> Popov Wins 100m Freestyle at Nationals, No World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's world and Olympic champion
Alexander Popov won the 100 meters freestyle at the national
swimming championship here on Monday but missed the world record.
</P>
<P>
Popov was six hundredths of a second short of breaking his own
world record of 48.21 seconds in Sunday's semi-final, which
brought about a strong suggestion that he might go even faster in
the final 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
But Popov clocked a winning time of 48.59, well outside the
mark he set at the 1994 world championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
He still beat the nearest competitor, Denis Pimankov, by almost
two seconds.
</P>
<P>
Popov, 29, seemed he was not disappointed, saying that he had
done what he had planned - breaking the record in the 50m.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the multiple world and Olympic champion clocked 21.
64 seconds to break American Tom Jager's 10-year-old world record
of 21.81 in the 50 meters freestyle.
</P>
<P>
The lanky Russian said he would try in September in the Sydney
to become the first male swimmer to win at three consecutive
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Popov is now training for the European long-course
championships which begin later this month in Helsinki.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis
were announced on Monday to top the men's and women's singles
seeds for the Wimbledon tennis championship starting next week.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, six times winner of the Wimbledon title, retained his
top ranking in front of Andre Agassi whom he beat in the 1999
final.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the number two seed, currently tops the ATP Tour
rankings ahead of Sweden's Magnus Norman and Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Australian Lleyton Hewitt, who as an unseeded player lost in
straight sets to Boris Becker in the third round at last year's
Wimbledon, is seeded seventh at this year's championships.
</P>
<P>
Norman is seeded three with Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten fourth,
the same as his ATP Tour ranking.
</P>
<P>
In women's seedings, Switzerland's Hingis was named again
number one followed by Lindsay Davenport, the same order as their
WTA Tour rankings and their seedings at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion at Wimbledon Davenport crashed out of the
French Open in the first round earlier this month and returned to
the United States for treatment on the back injury which hampered
her performance.
</P>
<P>
Mary Pierce, the French Open champion, is third followed by
1994 champion Conchita Martinez, whom she beat in the final at
Roland Garros. Venus Williams is fifth and Monica Seles, who has
won every Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon, is sixth in line
with the WTA rankings. Williams's sister Serena is seeded eight
at Wimbledon after Nathalie Tauziat of France.

<HEADLINE> Ruins of Qijia Culture Discovered in Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a site of Qijia Culture in northwest China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Qijia Culture flourished in the transition period from the
Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age, some 3,500 to 4,000 years ago,
according to the Qinghai Provincial Archaeological Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The ruins are located in Lajia Village, Minhe County, on the
upper reaches of the Yellow River, believed to be the first of its
kind ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
The site includes two half-pit houses. In one house,
archaeologists found 14 human skeletons, including adults and
children, men and women. One of them, a woman, is holding a baby.
</P>
<P>
In this house, there is a round kitchen range with a diameter
of 80 cm, on top of which was the skeleton of a man whose arms and
legs were bent. The other 13 skeletons stood in a circle along the
walls of the house.
</P>
<P>
Two skeletons of women holding babies were discovered in the
other house.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that these people died in a sudden event, or
that their deaths had some ritual meaning.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Invent Anti-Intruder Carpet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have developed
an "intelligent" carpet that secretly photographs people who step
on it, and if a person is an intruder, it secretly alerts the
police.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Harbin Engineering University (HEU), in this
capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, invented the
carpet as a security device.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yuan Libo, who headed the research, is the head of
the Optical Fiber Sensor Institute under HEU. He explained that
when someone steps on the carpet, it will send an optical fiber
signal to a checking instrument, which will confirm whether the
person is a trespasser or not by ordering a hidden camera to take
a picture of the person. If the photographic image does not match
one in an image database an alarm system is triggered.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a carpet is too common an article to cause an
intruder to be careful of stepping on it.

<HEADLINE> Administration Warns Against Forest Land Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The fifth national survey on
forest resources reveals that some 2.16 million hectares of forest
land are abused or overtaken for other purposes each year.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Forestry conducted the survey last
year in 200-plus counties and uncovered 1,124 cases involving land
abuse in projects. These cases accounted for 73.6 percent of all
projects surveyed.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some 500,000 cases involving illegal felling,
land reclaiming through destroying forest and illegal
transportation and timber trading occur annually nationwide and
the number has kept increasing.
</P>
<P>
Officials warn that in some parts of China, local officials,
turn a blind eye to these illegal activities or even collude with
offenders for local or personal gains, at the cost of the country'
s natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The administration calls for strict law enforcement and
supervision to ensure that forests and land are protected.

<HEADLINE> Swedes Kicked out with 1-2 defeat by Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Alessandro Del Piero, who played
as starter, fired the winner two minutes from the end to help
Italy to a 2-1 win over Sweden on Monday in Eindhoven, the
Netherlandsas qualify for the quarterfinals of Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Italy, which had been already assured of its top spot in Group
B before the game, finished with three wins in a row.
</P>
<P>
The result ousted Sweden which had needed a win to stay alive.
Turkey beat Belgium 2-0 with four. Belgium had three and Sweden
one.
</P>
<P>
"It's no comfort when what you wanted was to win the game,"
Larsson said. "We created a lot of chances, we should have scored
a few more."
</P>
<P>
His performance drew praise from Italy defender Gianluca
Pessotto. "We all saw when he broke his leg and it was shocking,"
said Pesotto. "He's an excellent striker, he created a lot of
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Italy's reserves gave their country a third straight Euro 2000
victory but failed to put a smile on the face of coach Dino Zoff.
</P>
<P>
"I was more satisfied after our other two matches," said Zoff.
"We started a bit slowly. Early on, we didn't show the necessary
determination for a match at this level."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we scored two goals was the most positive thing
about the performance but on the negative side we suffered too
much in some circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Zoff therefore rested virtually his entire first team. Captain
Paolo Maldini, goalkeeper Francesco Toldo and midfielder Gianluca
Pessotto were the only survivors from the side which beat Turkey
in their opening match.
</P>
<P>
Zoff did not feel Italy would start as favourites in their
quarterfinal match, which will be against either England,Germany
of Romania.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know who our opponents will but whoever it is we won
't start as favourites," he said. "From this point on all the
teams left in the competition will be strong and so we'll have a
50 percent chance."
</P>
<P>
After withstanding some early pressure, Italy went ahead in
the 39th minute in the simplest way. A swerving corner kick from
Del Piero found Luigi Di Biagio unmarked in the penalty area and
the shaven headed midfielder nodded the ball past Magnus Hedman.
</P>
<P>
Striker Henrik Larsson finally gave the Swedish fans something
to cheer for in the 77th minute when he gathered the ball
following a defensive error by Di Biagio and dribbled it past
Francesco Toldo to make it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
But Del Piero struck a sweet, late winner, beating keeper
Magnus Hedman from 20 meters.
</P>
<P>
"It was up to us to prove what ability we did have and
naturally we are disappointed," Swedish coach Lars Lagerback said.
"I think that step by step we have improved in this tournament
over the three matches but we didn't reach the levels we wanted to
reach."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Moves to Quarterfinals after Upseting Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey downed co-host Belgium 2-
0 in the Group B on Monday to qualify for the quarterfinals,
producing the biggest upset of Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
The win was Turkey's first in the championship finals and sent
Belgium, who won the opening game with 2-1 against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In the other Group B game, Italy beat Sweden 2-1 in Eindhoven,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Italy topped Group B with nine points ahead of Turkey with
four. Belgium had three and Sweden one.
</P>
<P>
The Red Devils had enough with a scoreless draw, but they
immediately went looking for a goal. They didn't realize they
would outrun themselves in a hothouse where temperatures reached
into the high 20s C (low 80sF).
</P>
<P>
"We started better and didn't deserve to lose," Belgian coach
Robert Waseige said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkey's goals came from Hakan Sukur in the 45th and 70th
minute. Belgium's goalkeeper Filip de Wilde made his second bad
mistake of the tournament to give Turkey its first goal in the
dying seconds of injury time at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
His misery was made complete when he was sent off in the 84th
minute for a bad foul outside the penalty area on Arif Erdem.
</P>
<P>
Belgium will rue missing a hatful of chances and Turkey has
its goalkeeper Rustu Recber to thank for pulling off two glorious
point-blank saves to keep his side ahead.
</P>
<P>
Belgium came out and attacked the Turks, and Emile Mpenza went
close to opening the scoring twice in the first three minutes,
with shots that went just wide.
</P>
<P>
The striker did get the ball in the net after 24 minutes, but
was ruled offside as he put in the rebound from a Nilis shot.
</P>
<P>
The home side made most of the early running, creating a
series of chances which they failed to convert.
</P>
<P>
But as they went forward, they left themselves exposed at the
back and it was only lax finishing which prevented the Turks
taking the lead earlier.
</P>
<P>
Belgium came back at the Turks as the second half got under
way but as they pushed forward, Tayfur Havutcu sprung the Belgian
offside trap, played it to Suat Kaya, who found Sukur unmarked to
slot the ball home.
</P>
<P>
Belgium threw on a series of attackers to try to break down
the Turkish defence, but the Turks grew increasingly assured as
time went on.
</P>
<P>
Play was held up shortly before halftime when referee Kim
Milton Nielsen had to leave the field with a groin strain. He was
replaced by fourth official Guenter Benko.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a host nation did not make it past the
first round. On the stroke of half-time, Hakan Sukur finally
showed why he is Turkey's star.
</P>
<P>
"Now we want to get to the semifinal and, perhaps, the final,"
Hakan Sukur said.
</P>
<P>
"With his height and his timing, he did us in," said Waseige
of the 1.91-meter Galatasaray striker.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will play Portugal in Amsterdam on Saturday with a
semifinal place at stake.

<HEADLINE> Bashar Elected Secretary General of Ruling Baath Party EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Syria's ruling Baath Party elected
Bashar al-Assad as its secretary general Tuesday, the last step for
Bashar to succeed his late father, President Hafez al-Assad, who
died 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party nominated Bashar for president. He had been
promoted to the rank of general and declared commander of Syria's
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The nomination will be presented to parliament for endorsement
on June 25. A referendum will follow to confirm the 35-year-old eye
doctor as president, completing the transition of power in Syria.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the party's congress also elected a 21-member new
Regional Command, or the Baath party's politburo, of which 12 were
new faces. In the 90-member central committee of the Baath Party
elected Tuesday, 62 were new.
</P>
<P>
Born in September 1965, Bashar, the second son of the late
president, studied medicine at Damascus University and graduated in
1988.
</P>
<P>
Since there was no possibility for Bashar to assume official
position after his graduation, he chose to study medicine at
Damascus Military Ophthalmology Hospital, then continued his study
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
After his elder brother Basil was killed in a car accident in
1994, Bashar returned home from Britain to take part in political
affairs. He joined the Hems Military College and ascended in the
military hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 Bashar became commander of a tank battalion. In 1997 he
became lieutenant and in 1999 was promoted to the rank of colonel
while he was chairing the Syrian Scientific Society for
Information. He was charged with several responsibilities including
the Lebanon file and anti-corruption combat.
</P>
<P>
On the day of Assad's death, Syrian parliament amended the
constitution to lower the age for presidential candidate as the
first step to prepare Bashar's ascendency to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, the Baath party leadership agreed unanimously to

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal With Palestinians to be Struck This Year: Israeli Knesset Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Jiang Yaping  Liu Shun
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- There will be a "historical
agreement" between Israel and the Palestinians by the year-end,
Speaker of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) Avraham Burg told
Xinhua on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At least a framework accord about the permanent status of
Palestine will be reached by the two sides within this year, Burg
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians were supposed to reach a framework
agreement first in February and then in May. But they missed both
of the self-imposed deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The on-and-off peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators have made no significant progress so far.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has said he will declare an
independent state either in September or in November regardless of
the outcome of the talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"With the principles already there, Israel will be the first
country to recognize the Palestinian state" when it is declared
under the peace agreement, said the 45-year-old speaker, the
youngest ever in the country.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that if the Palestinian side declares an
independent state without a peace agreement with Israel, the
Palestinians "will lose the most strategic achievement they can
have out of the declaration and this is the Israeli support" of the
new state.
</P>
<P>
Burg accepted that not all thorny issues will be solved this
year, but these problems are not surmountable, adding the
principles are there to guarantee a settlement through future
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Through the final-status talks, Israel and the Palestinians are
trying to tackle issues such as the status of Jerusalem, the return
of refugees, the border and the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Although the talks prove painstaking, "we all understand that
peace is the key for the future, for prosperity. And without peace
we are doomed to live in an awful military zone in the Middle East,
which we do not want," said Burg, a strong supporter of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt there will be a peace. We want it," the speaker
added.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the future ties between Israel and the emerging
Palestinian state, he voiced the hope that the ties will be on an
equal basis between state and state instead of between a state and
an organization.
</P>
<P>
He also wishes to see the greatest possible cooperation between
the two sides in the economic field in order to create a situation
that economic standards of the individual Palestinians will be
dramatically be improved.
</P>
<P>
By then, "the Palestinians would say peace is good because we
gained from it," he said.
</P>
<P>
On peace with Syria, Burg said they will have to wait and see
what will happen in the country as the long-time President Hafez
Al-Assad died just 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there is no hope of resuming talks with the
Syrians because the new Syrian leader, Al-Bashar Assad, will put
priority on domestic issues to consolidate his position, Burg said.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Israel and Syria, which resumed last December,
broke down early this year.
</P>
<P>
But Burg said the Israelis "are always ready to deal with the
Syrians and resume talks with the new leader of Syria. We hope
Bashar will be more flexible than his father in future
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"If Syria is more open to the outside world, we are more than
happy to go hand in hand with Syria toward a better future," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Stresses U.N. Role in Mideast Peace Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Tuesday called on the United Nations to step up its peace
efforts in the Middle East peace process, particularly in the peace
keeping in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Abdullah stressed the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon marks a
positive step in the peace process, and the U.N. should serve as a
monitor until Israel pulls out its soldiers from all Lebanese
territories and help the Lebanese government to restore its power
in the south.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Annan also discussed on a broader scale the latest
developments in the peace tracks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon
and the Palestinians, and the U.N. role of promoting the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The king said the peace process is still confronted with many
difficulties and the U.N. should help create more peace
opportunities, and urge all parties concerned to work for a just,
durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Jordan's Prime Minister Ali Abu
Ragheb who was sworn in on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
Khatib, Annan commended the active participation of the Jordanian
armed forces in U.N. peace keeping efforts in international hot
spots in Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Khatib stressed Jordan supports the stand of
Lebanon that Israel should pull out from all of its territories.
</P>
<P>
The U.N chief arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day
visit on the fourth leg of his regional tour, which has taken him
to Iran, Egypt, Lebanon and will take him to Syria, Israel and
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commander Denies U.S. Forces Reduction in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the U.S. Central
Command Anthony Zinni Tuesday denied reports that the U.S. will
reduce its armed forces stationed in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Zinni made the denial while speaking at a press conference held
before departure following a three-day visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
There are still some factors threatening the security of the
region, such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
the inextricable regional territorial disputes and terrorism, said
the U.S. commander.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Zinni exchanged views with senior UAE military
officers on a number of issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Zinni also discussed with UAE military officials issues
concerning an initiative by the U.S. to build an early-warning
system in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, according
to earlier newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
Zinni was making farewell calls to GCC states at the end of his
current tenure.

<HEADLINE> Father, U.S. Government Urge Court to Allow Elian to Return to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez's
father and the U.S. Government urged a federal court Tuesday to
reject an appeal by the Cuban boy's Miami relatives and allow him
to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In a four-page filing made with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, Attorneys for the boy's father Juan Miguel
Gonzalez asked the court to immediately dissolve an injunction
keeping him and his son in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Now we urge the court to see through Lazaro's charade, stop
the excruciating delays, and allow this family to go home,"
attorneys for Juan Miguel wrote.
</P>
<P>
They said a three-judge appeals panel's ruling earlier this
month that only the father could speak for 6-year-old Elian was "
indisputably a reasonable choice."
</P>
<P>
Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lead attorney, Gregory Craig, argued
that the Miami relatives' prolonged fight to keep the boy in the
United States was a "powerful reason" for the appeals court to
reject their appeal immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The driving force behind Lazaro Gonzalez (Elian's Uncle)'s
petition for rehearing is to prolong Elian Gonzalez's stay in this
country as long as possible," the filing said. "Every day, of
course, is another day of interference with Juan Miguel's ability
to raise his child as he sees fit."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Justice Department agreed in a separate filing
Tuesday, saying the court should deny the request by the Miami
relatives and allow the 6-year-old boy to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, a three-judge panel of the 12-member court ruled in
favor of Elian's father and denied a political asylum hearing for
Elian as requested by Elian's relatives.
</P>
<P>
But Elian's relatives appealed to the full 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals last Thursday, calling for a reversal of a
decision that would allow the 6-year-old boy to return to Cuba
with his father.
</P>
<P>
The court gave the father and the U.S. government until Tuesday
to respond. Seven of the 12 judges would have to agree to hear the
case for it to come before the full court.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a migrant boat disaster last November in
which his mother and 10 others died, has been in the United States
after he was picked up by a fisherman off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives cared for him until he was seized from
his relatives' home on April 22 in a government raid and reunited
in Washington with his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez wants to take his son back
to Cuba, but his relatives have been trying to prevent Elian from
being sent back to Cuba with the help of many anti-Cuba people in
Miami, Florida.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, U.S. to Sign Maritime Antidrug Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua and the United States
will soon sign a maritime antidrug accord to strengthen the fight
against narcotic trafficking in this Central American country,
said American Ambassador Eliver Garza Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that both countries' lawyers are working on
the final draft.
</P>
<P>
The document has to be approved by the National Assembly (
parliament) of Nicaragua. This is a way to better relations
between both armies and see what can be done to give Nicaragua's
army help, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua and the United States began two years ago
negotiations concerning the maritime antidrug accord, but it has
faced opposition from several political sectors, seeking help from
the country's Carta Magna.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's constitution forbids the establishment of foreign
military bases on national territory although it authorizes the
transit or stationing of foreign aircraft and military personnel
on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General of Nicaragua's Army Major General Roberto
Calderon Meza said that the armies of Nicaragua and the United
States will carry out joint plans to fight drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
Calderon said that the U.S. army will give training to national
forces for the development of a more efficient fight against
narcotic trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In Central America, Costa Rica put into force last November a
maritime antidrug accord signed with the United States in 1998,
while the armies of Honduras and the United States began joint
maritime patrolling last September.

<HEADLINE> France, Belgium to Hold Nuclear Security Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- France and Belgium will jointly hold
Friday a nuclear security exercise at the nuclear reaction center
of Chooz on the French-Belgian border in the Ardennes, reported
Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted sources at the French Interior Ministry as saying
Tuesday that the exercise is aimed at testing the mechanism of
alert and the organization of an emergency rescue plan established
by the Electricity of France state power company, which is the
owner of the nuclear center, in the case of a nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
Within the perimeter of protection of the Chooz nuclear center
live 26,000 people on the French side of the border and other 8,
000 on the Belgian side.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will also test the coordination between the two
countries in a trans-frontier rescue operation and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
A simulation evacuation of two patients contaminated by radio-
active materials will be made by doctors from two hospitals on
both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
New technologies in the communications infrastructure on the
site of the nuclear center will also be put to the test.

<HEADLINE> WFP Concerned About Effect of Fighting on Civilians in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) Tuesday expressed grave concern that fighting
in parts of northern and eastern Sierra Leone is causing the
displacement of civilians in large numbers and disrupting food aid
and other humanitarian assistance deliveries.
</P>
<P>
Due to insecurity, WFP was forced on Thursday to delay food
distribution to more than 16,000 displaced in Lungi. The aid
agency had also called back a food convoy destined to more than 14,
000 displaced people in Port Loko.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six weeks, WFP and its partners have registered
more than 85,000 displaced people in and around Freetown, Lungi
and Port Loko and Mile 91. Most of the displaced fled their homes
in the northern towns of Lunsar, Makeni and Magburaka due to
recent fighting in these areas.
</P>
<P>
"Displaced people are arriving in poor shape and had to leave
behind all their belongings," said Patrick Buckley, WFP
representative in Sierra Leone. "Many are scattered on the axis
Freetown-Mile 91 and are living in dire conditions in schools or
disused buildings."
</P>
<P>
WFP is also deeply concerned about the plight of thousands of
displaced people stranded in areas, not held by the Government.
Their situation can rapidly deteriorate due to the lack of food
hardly available in isolated rural regions from May to September
during the seasonal heavy rains, a period known in Sierra Leone as
the "hunger season."
</P>
<P>
For the last 10 years, fighting in Sierra Leone has severely
disrupted farming and cur off large parts of the country from
commercial food. Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans have lost
all their property and income-generating activities and are now
only relying on relief supplies provided by aid agencies, such as
WFP.
</P>
<P>
WFP provided food last month to more than 200,000 people in
Sierra Leone, mostly war-affected farmers, children, pregnant and
lactating women and disabled and elderly people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate to Vote on China Trade Bill in July: Senate Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate is expected to
vote on a bill granting permanent normal trade relations status to
China in July, Senate majority Leader Trent Lott said at a news
briefing here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We do expect before we go out for the August recess period to
take up the marriage penalty tax elimination,... and the China
trade bill," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
The majority leader said the Senate would take up the bill once
lawmakers had completed work on a number of spending bills that
would fund the federal government.
</P>
<P>
"We have to get the bulk of these appropriations bills done
before we can go to the China trade bill. So hopefully we can get
to that in July," he said in response to a question about the bill
on PNTR with China.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the bill granting PNTR status to China on
May 24.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said President Bill Clinton is expected to meet
with senators later Tuesday at the White House to press for
passage of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is considered to be part of the White House effort
to persuade Lott to schedule a final vote on the bill.
</P>
<P>
"Every day of delay damages fundamental interests of the United
States, both economic and strategic," U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after a Senate hearing.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Kazakhstan Push on to Boost Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a joint statement
here Tuesday to expand mutually beneficial cooperation between
their countries.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents "attach special importance to giving greater
scope to mutually beneficial cooperation in the trade-economic,
investment, scientific and technical fields in bilateral and multi-
lateral formats," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The sides expressed satisfaction with positive tendencies that
have begun to show in the implementation of the treaty between the
two states on economic cooperation in 1998-2007 and the program
attached to it.
</P>
<P>
The presidents agreed that the main tasks of bilateral economic
cooperation are to establish a common economic space, to expedite
the process of creating a free trade area, to enhance cooperation
between border regions and to create favorable climate for
attracting foreign and national capital.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need to combat extremism and strengthen the
role of the United Nations, as well as the importance of
preserving the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
The ABM treaty regime should be strictly observed to maintain
strategic stability and international security, noted the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Russia and Kazakhstan will actively promote the
development of cooperation in the framework of the Shanghai Five,
which involves Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan and plays an increasingly important role in maintaining
security and stability in the region, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents urged the strengthening of U.N. and other
international organizations' roles in settling the conflict in
Afghanistan, and confirmed the determination to intensify the CIS
collective struggle against the threats posed by international
terrorism and religious and political extremism.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the Caspian states to reach a compromise on
the sea's status. They proposed an agreement to "divide the sea
floor into national sectors for exercising sovereign rights to
develop sub-surface resources, while the sea itself could be
reserved for common use to ensure free shipping, agreed fishing
norms and environmental protection," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev arrived here Sunday evening for a three-day official
visit. Monday, he met Putin and they inked a memorandum on jointly
using the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
the issue to hold a three-way summit between the U.S., Israel and
the Palestinian authority will not be decided until after
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visits the Middle East next
week.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Albright will
try to figure out next week whether more work needs to be done
first before convening a summit between U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to finalize a final peace pact.
</P>
<P>
Boucher made the remarks in response to a statement by Danny
Yatom, chief policy adviser to Barak, Monday that "the situation
is ripe for a summit" and that one should be held in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The president (Clinton), two or three days ago, said that at
this juncture we would say that a basis does not exist," Boucher
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The president's made quite clear that we're prepared
to go forward with a summit at the appropriate time, and (when) we
think the necessary basis exists."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Economics and Planning Minister Nabil Shaath has
reportedly said that the Palestinians do not want a summit unless
it is properly prepared, meaning that an accord is all but
finalized.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Antitrust Case Sent to U.S. Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The trial judge sent the
landmark Microsoft antitrust case directly to the Supreme Court
Tuesday, seeking to bypass a federal appellate court in the drawn-
out legal battle.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also delayed the
part of his June 7 order aimed at imposing restrictions on
Microsoft business practices found to have been anticompetitive.
That order had automatically stayed the breakup of the company
into two parts, pending all appeals.
</P>
<P>
The nation's highest court is nearing the end of its term, and
it was not clear whether the Supreme Court would get into the case
this term.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department had urged Jackson to skip the appellate
court and turn the case over to the Supreme Court because of the
high-profile nature of the case and the crucial role technology
plays in the U.S. new economy.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Jackson ruled two weeks ago that Microsoft must be
broken into two parts, the company and the Justice Department had
filed a host of competing legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft pushed to have the case heard in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, which had ruled for the
software maker in a past related case. The government steadfastly
resisted that move.
</P>
<P>
The appellate court had said Monday that in the event Jackson
chose to send the case to the Supreme Court, it would step aside
and suspend further action until the high court decides whether it
will take on the case under a fast-track process.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department applauded Jackson's decision and added
that his stay of the penalties he imposed made it all the more
important for the Supreme Court to hear the appeal directly and
quickly, rather than have the appeal go first to the Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft focused instead on Jackson's decision to postpone
implementing restraints against certain aspects of its business
practices.
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very pleased that the District Court rejected
the government's arguments and stayed the entire judgment," said
Mark Murray, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the facts and the law are on our side
regardless of which court reviews this case," added he.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Wish for Slovak President's Early Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRATISLAVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress,
Tuesday expressed, on behalf of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
in his own name, sincere regards to Slovak President Rudolf
Schuster and their wishes for the president's early recovery from
illness.
</P>
<P>
Li is on an official goodwill visit to Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
At the knowledge of Schuster's illness, Li and his wife Zhu Lin
Monday asked Chinese Ambassador to Slovakia Yuan Guisen to go to
hospital to present Schuster with a basket of flowers on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Li and Slovak National Council
Chairman Jozef Migas Tuesday, Migas expressed the Slovak side's
regret to Li for President Schuster's being unable to meet Li
because of illness. He said the president was looking forward to
the arrival of the distinguished Chinese guests and was scheduled
to hold talks with Li Tuesday, but he was hospitalized to receive
an emergency operation early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said the president and his family thanked Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Li for their regards. The Slovak president warmly
welcomes Li and his wife Zhu Lin to visit Slovakia and is very
delighted to see the growth of friendship and cooperation between
the two countries, Migas added.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak president believes bilateral cooperation in various
areas will continue to grow, Migas said.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed the president's wish for the success of Li's
visit and for the happiness of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Li asked Migas to tell President Schuster that China and
Slovakia share common interests in many fields, and satisfactory
development has been achieved in friendly cooperation between the
two countries in various fields. Li said he hopes his current
visit will promote the growth of bilateral relations. The Chinese
side speaks highly of President Schuster's contribution to
expanding Sino-Slovak relations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Group Finds Abusive Child Labor in U.S. Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of child
farmworkers are laboring under dangerous and grueling conditions
in the Untied States, Human Rights Watch charged in a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The human rights group claimed that child farmworkers often
work twelve-and fourteen-hour days, and risk pesticide poisoning,
heat illness, injuries and life-long disabilities. The vast
majority of child farmworkers are Latino.
</P>
<P>
The laws governing minors working in agriculture are much less
stringent than those for other sectors of the economy, Human
Rights Watch said, allowing children to work at younger ages, for
longer hours, and under more hazardous conditions than children in
other jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Farm work is the most dangerous work open to children in this
country," said Lois Whitman, Executive Director of the Children's
Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. "U.S. laws should be
changed to protect the health, safety, and education of all
children."
</P>
<P>
According to the human rights organization, the 1938 federal
law governing this type labor specifically exempts farmworkers
youth from the minimum age and maximum hour requirements
protecting other children. At the State level, 18 states have no
minimum age for farmwork, while in some other states the minimum
age is as low as nine or ten.

<HEADLINE> France Tops WHO's Ranking of World's Health Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- France provides the best overall
health care in the world followed by Italy, Spain, Oman, Austria
and Japan, according to the World Health Report to be published
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first ever WHO analysis of the world's health
systems using five performance indicators to measure health
systems in 191 member states.
</P>
<P>
WHO's assessment system was based on five indicators: overall
level of population health; health inequalities (or disparities)
within the population; overall level of health system
responsiveness (a combination of patient satisfaction and how well
the system acts); distribution of responsiveness within the
population (how well people of varying economic status find that
they are served by the health system); and the distribution of the
health system's financial burden within the population (who pays
the costs).
</P>
<P>
"The main message from this report is that the health and well-
being of people around the world depend critically on the
performance of the health systems that serve them," said WHO
Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
"Yet there is wide variation in performance, even among
countries with similar levels of income and health expenditure. It
is essential for decision- makers to understand the underlying
reasons so that system performance, and hence the health of
populations, can be improved," she added.
</P>
<P>
The report finds that the U.S. health system spends a higher
portion of its gross domestic product than any other country but
ranks 37 out of 191 countries according to its performance. The
United Kingdom, which spends just six percent of GDP on health
services, ranks 18th.
</P>
<P>
Several small countries -- San Marino, Andorra, Malta and
Singapore -- are rated close behind second-placed Italy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the lowest placed countries are in sub-Saharan Africa
where life expectancies are low. HIV and AIDS are major causes of
ill-health. Because of the AIDS epidemic, healthy life expectancy
for babies born in 2000 in many of these nations has dropped to 40
years or less.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Report, the main failings of many
health systems are:
</P>
<P>
-- Many health ministries focus on the public sector and often
disregard the frequently much larger private sector health care;
</P>
<P>
-- In many countries, some if not most physicians work
simultaneously for the public sector and in private practice. This
means the public sector ends up subsidizing unofficial private
practice;
</P>
<P>
--Many governments fail to prevent a "black market" in health,
where widespread corruption, bribery, "moonlighting" and other
illegal practices flourish. The black markets, which themselves
are caused by malfunctioning health systems, and low income of
health workers, further undermine those systems;
</P>
<P>
-- Many health ministries fail to enforce regulations that they
themselves have created or are supposed to implement in the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
One key recommendation from the report is for countries to
extend health insurance to as large a percentage of the population
as possible. WHO said that it is better to make "pre-payments" on
health care as much as possible, whether in the form of insurance,
taxes or social security.

<HEADLINE> 3,500 Italians Killed by Air Pollution Each Year, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution is choking Italian
cities to the point that respiratory illnesses are becoming of
epidemic proportions claiming some 3,500 lives of people over 30,
around ten a day, a report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, Air Pollution in Italian Cities: Its Impact on
Health, was prepared by the National Agency for the Environment (
Anpa) and the Environment and Health Center of the World Health
Organization and focused on the cities of Turin, Genoa, Milan,
Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples and Palermo where a total of 8.5
million people live.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that air pollution caused more than 29,000
asthma attacks and 31,000 cases of acute bronchitis a year in
Italy among people under 15.
</P>
<P>
"This study," observed Roberto Bertollini, director of the WHO
center, "shows that thousands of people who live in these cities
get sick and die from pollution. What we have shown is only the
tip of the iceberg."
</P>
<P>
"The study only focused on part of the problem: PM10 (particles
with a diameter less the 10 microns). Each year this dust is
responsible for 1,887 hospitalizations for respiratory reasons and
2,710 for cardiovascular problems," said Bertollini.
</P>
<P>
Aside from PM10, the study showed the most dangerous cause of
air pollution came from ozone levels and those of nitrogen dioxide.
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest sources of PM10 in cities was from the use
of diesel fuels in traffic, the cause of 90 percent of PM10 in
Palermo and between 50-70 percent in Turin, Milan, Bologna and
Rome, and another cause was the use of heating fuels.
</P>
<P>
Rome was the city with the highest number of PM10-related
deaths but it is also Italy's largest city. Turin, on the other
hand, had the highest percentage of PM10-related deaths, 5.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
In a related report, the Anpa said that Rome, Venice, Florence,
Prato and Genoa suffered the most from ozone levels, while Naples
had alarming levels of nitrogen dioxide.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Department Sets Date for Next Missile Defense Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's technology chief, acknowledged
that the Pentagon's scientists and engineers are pushing the
envelope of technological know-how in trying to shoot down long-
range ballistic missiles in space -- a goal the United States has
pursued, off and on, for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly a high-risk overall program," Gansler said,
referring to the possibility of setbacks. "And it's not a high
probability of being able to precisely get everything to work on
this flight" in July.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has said it wanted to score two missile
intercepts before continuing toward deployment. The first such
test last October was successful, although there was a problem
with finding the approaching warhead. A second such test failed
early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon left open the possibility that Defense Secretary
William Cohen could recommend proceeding with deployment of the
controversial system by 2005 even if the July test is a failure.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a failure in July would preclude Cohen
recommending to President Bill Clinton that he keep to the
schedule for deploying a limited missile defense by 2005, Gansler
said, "It depends what type of failure it was." At any rate, he
added, it will be a decision for Clinton based on factors beyond
the technical aspects.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to decide this year whether to break ground
next spring to start building a powerful radar station in Alaska
State in the first phase of an NMD shield to be operational by
2005.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD
system runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) - The United States Tuesday
announced 28 million U.S. dollar assistance to African refugees to
mark "Africa Refugee Day."
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a statement that the aid will be
given to support programs run by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) in east, southern, and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This is a time to reflect on hardships faced by those whose
lives are forever changed by war or injustice and to recognize and
express gratitude to those countries who open their borders to
Africans seeking refuge," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, almost all African countries house
refugees and the major hosts include Tanzania, Sudan, Ethiopia,
Kenya and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The new offer announced by the department brings U.S. funding
for African refugee assistance to 133 million dollars in fiscal
2000.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Launches Public Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's government will invest
up to year 2002 around 1.66 billion U.S. dollars to fight violence
as part of the National Plan of Public Security, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced Tuesday at the initiative's
official launching.
</P>
<P>
Among the 124 measures, produced by the Ministry of Justice,
the Cabinet of Institutional Security and the General Secretariat
of the Presidency, stands out the suspension of arms register for
six months, coming into force immediately.
</P>
<P>
Practically, this prevents arms' sales which have been debated
at Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Another of the plan's mainstays consists, in the National Fund
of Public Security, of 125 million dollars to be applied to states
and police for fighting violence.
</P>
<P>
Also in the plan is the fight against drugs, and border control,
creating a national system of criminal information, merging
states' police with the Federal and logistical support of the
army.
</P>
<P>
The plan's announcement took place one week after a bus
kidnapping in Rio de Janeiro, broadcast on national television's
network, in which a hostage died following very criticized police
behavior.

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Seizes 191 Kilograms Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Finance Police operating in
the lower Adriatic port city of Bari Tuesday seized 191 kilograms
of uncut cocaine with a street value of nearly 60 billion lire (
about 29.6 million U.S. dollars) shipped to Italy by the Colombian
Cali' cartel.
</P>
<P>
Police reported that the cocaine was transported in cavities
carved into rough blocks of granite, which were then sealed with
plaster and painted to restore the original appearance of the
granite.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, they said, could not be detected by a visual
inspection of the granite or by sniffer dogs.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of an operation which included the lengthy
surveillance of suspects and sites, it was learned that the Cali'
cartel shipped the cocaine via a stone-working company named
Italagreco, in Sante Fe de Bogota, to another marble-working
company in Andria, near Bari.
</P>
<P>
The blocks were taken off a freighter and hauled by truck to
the Comar marble-working operation in Andria, owned by Giuseppe
Cicco, with Cicco's sister, Filomena, in charge of transport.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was then removed from the granite blocks and packed
into steel-reinforced concrete piers for storage.
</P>
<P>
In their search of a villa owned by Filomena Cicco, police came
across lire valued at nearly 600,000 dollars, Dutch guilders and
German marks.
</P>
<P>
Cicco was said to have the job only of storing the cocaine, the
sale of which was in the hands of two Colombian Cali' cartel
emissaries identified as Leonardo Esquivel and Silvio Gomez
Herrera.
</P>
<P>
Thus, said police, the drugs remained the property of the
cartel until sale in smaller quantities and there was no direct
relationship between buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
The lot of cocaine seized Tuesday had been ordered by a man
identified as Gennaro Bonifacio, 32, from Naples but with
residence near Milan, indicating that the drugs were all bound for
markets in the Lombardy region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Launches Reforms for Efficient Public Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa launched on Tuesday a 12-year program aimed at boosting
efficiency of civil service.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Public Service Reform Program
2000/2011 (PSRP) demanded not only changes of structures, systems
and work environment, but also changes in culture, attitudes and
behavior of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the private sector will be involved in the
delivery of public services in areas such as clearing, engineering
services, buildings maintenance, gardening as well as
consultation, training and auditing.
</P>
<P>
The program also adopted new management principles which
require a cultural and attitudinal change for civil servants to
develop effective leadership and governance.
</P>
<P>
"The government has striven to make public servants responsive
to public needs and aspirations, and more important to be
transparent and accountable, " he told a gathering of senior
officials and diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
The president said that as one of the achievements, most public
service appointments and promotions were made on the basis of
merit while many vacant posts were advertized, and went to the
qualified Tanzanians through a transparent and competitive
process.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that salary levels for public servants
were still low in comparison with their actual needs under
existing difficult economic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"But this should not be allowed to distract us from the equally
 important side of the coin of public service, that is duty, the
need to serve the people," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the task of the government to transform the
public service into a partner and facilitator of the private
sector and actively solicit their views, ideas, experience and
knowledge in policy formulation.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng's Visit Marks New Era of Slovak-China Ties: Slovak Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRATISLAVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng'
s current visit to Slovakia shows Slovakia-China relations have
entered a new era, Slovak National Council Chairman Jozef Migas
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of
the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), who is here on an
official goodwill visit, Migas said that as a big country in Asia
and in the world as well, China has great influence and has played
a big role which cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
He said expanding relations with China is a consensus of the
Slovak government, the National Council and the masses of the
people.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply impressed by China's achievements in
national development he saw during his China visit last October.
</P>
<P>
Migas said there are no conflicts between Slovakia and China,
and instead there is a foundation for the two countries' extensive
cooperation. Slovakia highly appreciates China's advocation that
countries, big or small, should be equal, he said, adding
expanding relations with China is one of the focuses of Slovakia's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Migas stresses that Slovakia sticks to the "one China" position
and will do so in the future. He expressed his hope for increased
friendship between the parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Li Peng to convey President Rudolf Schuster's
invitation for Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said there exists a traditional friendship between the
Chinese and Slovak peoples and this friendship has been maintained
and grown after the independence of Slovakia. China respects the
domestic and foreign policies Slovakia has formulated according to
its own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said China's NPC and Slovakia's National Council have good
relations of cooperation. He said he hopes more Slovak National
Council members will visit China so as to increase mutual

Republic of Korea (DPRK), said the Kremlin staff.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad that our two countries are developing constructive
inter-state relations on a permanent basis. President Kim Dae Jung
invited me again to visit South Korea (in Monday's telephone
conversation), and I am sure to undertake the trip," Putin told
Kim Yong Joung, chairman of South Korea's Constitutional Court, at
their meeting in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed that Russia and South Korea have developed a
good and stable relationship. He convoyed a greeting message to
Kim Dae Jung and expressed his support to the recent inter-Korea
summit in the DPRK capital of Pyongyang, Sergei Prikhodko, deputy
chief of the Kremlin staff, told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president also expressed readiness "to develop the
bilateral ties in different spheres, particularly in the fields of
culture and economy," said Prikhodko.

Monday, Putin and Kim Dae Jung held a telephone conversation on
the Korea problem and bilateral ties, according to the Kremlin
press service.

to form an environment that would guarantee the implementation of
the North-South accords."
</P>
<P>
The two sides "emphasized their wishes to mark the 10th
anniversary of diplomatic relations on September 30 with a major
advancement in the constructive partnership between the two

prospects, but the Dow Jones industrial average fell.

At the close of session, the Nasdaq composite was up 23.53 at 4,
013.36. It is the first time that the composite returned to 4,000
mark after a big selloff in April, which pulled the index down 37

But the index is still down 1.4 percent this year and remains
20.5 percent off the record closing high of 5,048.62 set march 10.

wavering for much of the session. Investors focused on the big
tech companies showing prospects of good earnings, lifting the

Intel rose in the second consecutive session after stock
strategists predicted a slowing economy and a near end to the
monetary tightening cycle, together with optimistic comments from
analysts about corporate earning Monday. Yahoo! and PMC-Sierra, a
semiconductor component maker, were also higher.
</P>
<P>
But the Dow index fell 122.68 at 10,435.16 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 10.05 at 1,475.95.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was dragged lower by Honeywell International. The
company continued to fall after it warned that its second quarter
earnings will miss analysts' predictions because of higher
interest rates and higher raw materials prices.
</P>
<P>
General Motors and Seagram also added to the Dow's losses.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.09 at 649.26. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 6.57 at 940.84 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 2.92 at 525.69.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,630 down, 1,285 up and 495
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.01 billion shares from 916.14

<HEADLINE> Cancer Kills Women in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Five of every 100 women die
from some kind of cancer in Mexico, said specialist Guadalupe
Cervantes, of Oncology Department of State Hospital, "20th of
November."
</P>
<P>
Cervical cancer occupies first place in frequency among the
country's women, followed by breast and ovary, in this order, said
Cervantes in statements made known Tuesday by the press.
</P>
<P>
Of the total of cancer cases in both sexes registered in Mexico,
65 percent correspond to women and 35 to men, she added.
</P>
<P>
The specialist said the majority of ovary cancer cases are due
to environmental factors, inheritance and the country's improved
medical register.
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said that 67 percent of total cancer cases in women
were detected in late stages, as they went to the doctor when they
felt a malaise and the disorder was at the advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
The specialist said a timely diagnosis is the best way to fight
ovary cancer among high-risk women, including those who haven't
had children or have hereditary records of the sickness and breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Ovary cancer is the third cause of death in women in Mexico and
the fourth in the United States, she added.
