<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Not To Change Budget Assumptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A basic change will affect the elements of the budget itself,
Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo told legislators at the
parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Sudibyo said that all assumptions that have been made by the
government in arranging draft of the state budget for the fiscal
year 2000 were conservative.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the change of basic assumptions without strong
reasons should be avoided," the minister said, responding proposal
of some major factions in the House of Representatives (DPR) to
change basic assumptions in the draft of the country's 2000 state
budget.
</P>
<P>
On January 20, the government proposed to the DPR a draft of
the state budget under which the budget deficit was envisaged to
reach 45.373 trillion rupiah (6.5 billion U.S.dollars) or 5
percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
While, several macroeconomic indicators, used as basic
assumptions in drafting the year 2000 state budget are economic
growth of 3.8 percent, inflation rate 4.8 percent, rupiah exchange
rate rp 7.000 per U.S. dollars and crude oil price in
international market 18 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
But major factions in DPR said last Thursday that such
assumptions are too optimistic and the government has to change it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major factions in the DPR also urged the government
to pay more attention on national security affairs so that foreign
investors would not hesitate to enter Indonesia and invest their
capital.
</P>
<P>
Sudibyo pledged that the government will create security and
political stability to ensure that the basic assumptions of the
year 2000 state budget could be reached.
</P>
<P>
"The government will also create macroeconomic stability,
accelerate national banking restructuring program, and accelerate
private sectors' corporate debt restructuring program," Sudibyo
added.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls on Members to Strength VAT Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The executive body of the
European Union (EU), on Monday called on its members to tighten
the screws on value added tax (VAT) fraud and strengthen
cooperation between themselves in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states have not yet established their VAT
control regimes after the abolition of tax controls at borders six
years ago, said a report of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The member states are not devoting enough resources to VAT
control, nor are they introducing modern control methods.
</P>
<P>
Coordination among member states is not sufficient either, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, said the report, national exchequers and the EU
budget are losing VAT revenue and legitimate trade is penalized.
</P>
<P>
In order to enhance inter-governmental coordination, the
commission said it will come forward with a proposal to improve
the existing EU legislation on administrative cooperation and
mutual assistance by eliminating remaining barriers to the
exchange of information.
</P>
<P>
EU commissioner for taxation and internal market, Frits
Bolkestein, said the report highlights a worrying lack of
effective VAT control or cooperation among the member states.
</P>
<P>
"The result is distortions within the internal market and loss
of revenue for both national exchequers and the Community budget.
Member states have to take these problems more seriously than they
have until now and implement the Commission's recommendations
urgently," Bolkestein said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Condemns Israeli Air Raids Against Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Tuesday strongly
condemned Israel's air strikes against Lebanon's infrastructure,
which inflicted extensive property losses and civilian injuries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli aggression "constitutes an explicit violation of the
security and sovereignty of Lebanon and a clear breach of (United
Nations) Security Council resolutions," said Kuwaiti First Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah
in remarks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Kuwait firmly supports Lebanon and its
people in facing this "barbaric aggression," and backs any measures
that Beirut may take to safeguard its security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The repeated Israeli offensive against Lebanese installations,
he said, would disrupt the Middle East peace process and undermine
efforts aimed at bringing about peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official called on the international community to
shoulder the responsibility of exerting pressure on Israel to force
it to stop these attacks.
</P>
<P>
The strikes, which began late Monday night and continued through
early Tuesday, were mounted in retaliation for recent killing of
five Israeli soldiers and a senior commander of the pro-Israel
South Lebanon Army in south Lebanon, Israel said.
</P>
<P>
About 38 Lebanese civilians, including women and children, were
injured in the campaign. Power supplies in large parts of Lebanon,
including the capital city of Beirut, were knocked off as several
power stations were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah (Party of God) which is
spearheading a guerrilla war in the Israeli-occupied southern
Lebanon to out the Israeli occupation troops, has vowed to revenge
the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the Israeli raids, an Israeli soldier was killed in
southern Lebanon in guerrilla rocket attack, which raised to six
the number of soldiers Israel lost in the area since the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
An SLA militiaman was wounded in a separate attack in southern
Lebanon on Tuesday and later died of the wounds in an Israeli
hospital.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cigarette Wholesalers Sue Tobacco Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. cigarette wholesalers
and distributors sued the major tobacco companies on Tuesday,
claiming they illegally fixed prices at high levels in the United
States and many other nations.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C.,
represented the latest legal attack on the tobacco industry, which
already faces a spate of lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in
damages.
</P>
<P>
The proposed class-action suit alleged the tobacco companies "
have participated in a long-running and systematic series of
agreements" to fix, raise or stabilize cigarette prices above
competitive levels.
</P>
<P>
The 34-page civil suit said the alleged scheme dated back to at
least 1988, and was carried out through secret meetings, limiting
knowledge of price-fixing to high-level executives at each firm.
</P>
<P>
In addition to U.S. price fixing, the suit alleged that the
companies fixed prices and allocated markets in foreign nations,
including Argentina, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants were Philip Morris Cos Inc.; R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Holdings Inc.; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a unit of
British American Tobacco Plc; Lorillard Tobacco Co., a unit of
Loews Corp.; and Liggett Group, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd.
</P>
<P>
U.S. tobacco companies in 1998 settled lawsuits filed by 46
states for 206 billion U.S. dollars. Some of those lawsuits
included antitrust allegations, but the settlement did not prevent
lawsuits brought by private companies.

UNITED NATIONS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday informed the Security Council that Hans Blix
's appointment as Executive Chairman of the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) would
take effect on March 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, Annan, who is now on a
trip to Asia, said he expected to be able to consult with the
Council members on the issues relating to UNMOVIC later this month.
</P>
<P>
Marie Okabe, the associate spokesman for the Secretary-General,
said this noon that in Stockholm, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for
Disarmament Affairs Jayantha Dhanapala met Blix for an exchange of
views on a wide range of issues, including the composition of the
College of Commissioners for UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
Okabe said the United Nations has not received any
communication from Iraq about whether Blix can work there.
</P>
<P>
The associate spokesman said the Chairman's first tasks would
be to form the College of Commissioners, produce a programme of
work and draft proposals for consideration by the Secretary-
General and the Security Council, and only after that would the
question of permission to work in Iraq arise.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations adopted a resolution last December which
created UNMOVIC to replace now defunct the United Nations Special
Commission(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
There has been no arms inspection in Iraq since the U.S.-led
military strikes against Iraq in December 1998. Iraq has barred
UNSCOM from returning.

LUSAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has made ready the

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Committed to Burundi Peace Process: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki said Tuesday that his country is committed to the
peace process in the war- torn Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the pledge when discussing with his Burundian
counterpart Pierre Buyoya in Cape Town about the conflict in
Burundi and its effect on the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the South African
president's office, Buyoya and Mbeki agreed that durable peace
could not be achieved " if all Burundi groupings, inside and
outside the country, do not participate or commit themselves to a
peaceful resolution of the Burundi conflict."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two sides also agreed that the security
and peace of Burundi was closely linked to that of the Great Lakes
region in general and the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement
signed in JUly and August last year by all parties directly
involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya thanked Mbeki for making it possible for former South
African President Nelson Mandela to take part in the mediation
process in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's involvement would give added impetus to peace
negotiations, said the Burundian president.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya also expressed hope that the international community
would contribute to the socio-economic development of Burundi to
alleviate the poverty and hardships caused by the war and
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been embroiled in a civil war since 1993 in which
about 200, 000 people have died and another 1.1 million have been
displaced.
</P>
<P>
The country has been divided since gaining independence from
Belgium in 1962, with minority Tutsis dominating the government,
military and economy in a nation where the vast majority of its
6.5 million people are Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Each ethnic group has been the victim of large-scale massacres
at the hands of the other: the Hutu in 1972 and the Tutsi in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, ethnic and political tensions flared into civil
war when the country's first democratically elected president
Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, chief mediator in the Burundian peace process, met
Buyoya in Cape Town Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela described his talks with Buyoya as "very encouraging"
and added that he would soon meet rebel leader Jean Bosco
Ndayikengurukiye.
</P>
<P>
Ndayikengurukiye, head of the Forces for the Defense of
Democracy, boycotted multi-party negotiations in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha in January.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Advance Towards Govt.-Controled Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese rebels have made
massive advances into the government-held northwestern areas of
Opala right up to Bomandja in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), the Allied Forces in Kinshasa said Tuesday
</P>
<P>
"Their most recent moves towards our supply routes and
positions" in the areas west of Kisangani "are very threatening
indeed," Allied Forces Commander Major General Amoth Chingombe
said in a statement released in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"We will very soon use all the force available to us," said the
 commander of the Allied Forces which came from Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia to support the DRC government to fight with the rebels
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the DRC remained calm but very unstable in
some areas, particularly in the northwestern region where rebels
and their allies have been sighted moving from their previous
positions to gain more ground from territories controlled by the
government, the Allied Forces statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Forces Headquarters has warned that "rebels and
their allies should reconsider their actions and move back to
their original positions, otherwise the Allied Forces will be
forced to counter-attack since this is a serious violation of the
Lusaka Peace Accord".
</P>
<P>
It said that continued violations of the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement pose a threat to the already fragile peace accord.
</P>
<P>
All the parties directly involved in the conflict in the third
largest African countries signed on the agreement in the Zambian
capital Lusaka in July and August last year. However, it has not
been effectively implemented.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Rejects Criticism Over Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Tuesday rejected the criticism over Israel's fresh air
strikes on civilian targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Israel can not accept any unilateral violations of agreement
and the air strikes are a clear signal Israel wants to send to the
Lebanese government, Hezbollah, or even Syria that Israel will
retaliate when it has been threatened," Barak told reporters at the
northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
Barak flew to the town Tuesday afternoon to inspect the
situation there after the latest attacks by the Israel Air Force on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The strikes, which began late Monday night and continued through
early Tuesday, were mounted in retaliation for recent killing of
five Israeli soldiers and a senior commander of the pro-Israel
South Lebanon Army in south Lebanon, Israel said.
</P>
<P>
About 15 Lebanese civilians, including women and children, were
injured in the campaign. Power supplies in large parts of Lebanon,
including the capital city of Beirut, were knocked off as several
power stations were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has vowed to revenge the Israeli
attacks. Hours after the Israeli raids, an Israeli soldier was
killed in southern Lebanon in guerrilla rocket attack, raising to
six the number of soldiers Israel lost in the area since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
All residents in northern Israel have been ordered to stay
inside bomb shelters or security rooms for possible guerrilla
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The fresh Israeli raid on Lebanese civilian targets, including
power stations and other infrastructure, contravened international
law, said an Israeli human rights group here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It also violates an understanding Israel reached with Hezbollah
in April 1996 after a massive Israeli air raid on Lebanon which
killed over 200 civilians, the Israeli Information Center for Human
Rights in the Occupied Territories (B'TSELEM) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The United States-brokered understanding forbids attacks on
civilians or from civilian areas on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
But several Israeli cabinet ministers on Tuesday defended the
latest attacks.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the air raids have
been stopped for now, but will resume if Hezbollah continues
attacks against Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla
war against Israeli occupation of southern lebanon, where Israel
set up a "security zone" in 1985 with a proclaimed aim of
protecting its north.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who opposed air raids in
Lebanon during the Monday cabinet meeting, said Tuesday that the
overnight strikes served as sign to Hezbollah that it can not
continue military actions against Israeli soldiers and other
targets inside Israel without response from the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Israel's air strikes on Lebanese civilian targets have drawn
criticism from other countries. France and Italy reportedly said
Tuesday that such air strikes were unacceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which was informed by Israel before the air
strikes, issued a statement early Tuesday calling for restraint.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned by the escalation of violence in
southern Lebanon. We call on all parties to exercise maximum
restraint and to calm this dangerous situation," a U.S. State
Department statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) suspended Tuesday a
high-level meeting with Israel to protest against the Israeli air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Agriculture Minister Haim Oron said Tuesday that he was
scheduled to hold a meeting with his Palestinian counterpart Hikmet
Zeid to discuss cooperation between the two sides, but the PNA has
suspended the meeting under the instruction of PNA President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has said the time is not proper for holding
such a meeting, Oron added.
</P>
<P>
Israel warned that it will continue to act whenever needed
against Hezbollah and those who stand behind it.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President: Israel Responsible for Failure of April Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Following the latest Israeli air
raid across his country, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on Tuesday
held Israel responsible for the deterioration of situation in the
region and the failure of the Israel-Lebanon 1996 truce pact.
</P>
<P>
During an emergent cabinet meeting here, Lahoud said Lebanon was
committed to the understanding and Israel should stop its attempts
to create new status quo apart from the accord. He pointed out that
the latest Israeli air strikes would not change "the field
equations" in favour of Israel.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Lebanese Minister of
Information Anwar Al-Khalil quoted Lahoud as saying that Israel
tended to postpone the peace talks with Lebanon and Syria to bring
more pressures on the two Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched air raid on three power stations in Lebanon on
Monday night and early Tuesday, leaving 38 civilians injured and
plunged the major parts of the country in darkness.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president termed the Israeli actions as "barbaric
aggression on civilian institutions."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's remarks came shortly after the statement of Israeli
Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon that Israel was no
longer committed to the security arrangements under the April
Accord, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached the accord after the Israeli "Grapes of
Wrath" military operation that led to the deaths of 175 Lebanese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, Israel and Lebanon as well as militant
groups, especially the Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah (Party
of God), should not attack civilians or launch military operations
from highly-populated areas on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Bosnia-Herzegovina to Establish Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Bosnia-Herzegovina
have signed a protocol for the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two countries, the Cyprus News Agency
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed at the New York-based United Nations
headquarters by permanent representatives of the two countries at
the U.N., Ambassadors Sotos Zackheos and Mohamet Sacirbey.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say when the protocol was signed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the signing, Zackheos said this would be the
beginning of the development of relations between the two countries
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, he said, face common challenges, particularly
the maintenance of their sovereignty, territorial integrity and
unity.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that both countries support solution of
international issues on the basis of international law, the
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and the protection of
human rights without discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Zackheos expressed support on international community efforts to
reconstruct the former Yugoslavian republic.
</P>
<P>
Sacirbey underlined that a stronger relationship between the two
countries is being established after the signing of this protocol.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries seek a future based on tolerance and
peaceful coexistence rather than division.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says U.S.-British Jets Attack Residential Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Tuesday attacked residential areas in northern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that on Tuesday morning nine formations of U.
S and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace made 18 armed
sorties over northern Iraq's Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombarded some residential areas in the
region, including a civilian's garden, said the spokesman, adding
that the bombardment led to destruction of civilian property.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate report on civilian casualties now.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States and Britain launched four-night air
raids against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made 18,
465 sorties over the two no-fly zones in Iraq and have regularly
targeted civilian and military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the so called aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by the Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these zones, arguing they were
unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain without explicit
authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Israeli Air Raids on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Tuesday strongly
condemned the latest Israeli air raid on Lebanese civilian targets
which it said "have poisoned" the atmosphere for the Middle East
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib said in a statement
that the Israeli bombardments on Lebanese civilian targets violated
the spirit of the peace process and further escalated the tensions
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan stood against any attacks on civilians targets
and economic institutions in Lebanon, and Jordan believed the
Israeli-Lebanese conflict could only be solved through peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Khatib reiterated that the Israeli-Lebanese conflicts must be
ended in accordance with international laws and the 425 resolution
by the United Nations, which called for Israeli troop withdrawal
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanese media reports, 38 Lebanese civilians were
injured during Israeli air raid from Monday night to early Tuesday
across Lebanon, including the capital city of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments came in retaliation of the stepped-up attacks
on Israeli targets by Lebanese guerrillas, particularly the
Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli solders and a commander of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army have been killed since the start of this year by
guerrillas who have been fighting to end the Israeli occupation in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During a brief visit to Amman on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak had vowed to repulse any attacks launched by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
He said his country would not tolerate these attacks in order to
keep alive its fragile peace process with Syria, a major power
broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he briefed Jordan on the developments and
obstacles facing Israel's peace talks with Syria and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators sharply differed on maps of
areas of 6.1 percent of the West Bank targeted for a third-phase
withdrawal of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria were postponed indefinitely
last month after Syria demanded a written commitment from Israel
over handing back in full the Golan Heights, which Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> France, Italy Condemn Israeli Attacks Against Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of France
and Italy, Hubert Vedrine and Lamberio Dini, both visiting Saudi
Arabia, on Tuesday condemned Israel's fresh air raids against
Lebanese civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's spokeswoman Anne Gazezu-Secret, speaking on behalf of
Vedrine, said France regretted the Israeli attacks which targeted
vital facilities of daily civilian needs in various regions in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She said France considered the offensive a threat to the
security of the Middle East region as well as to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Italian foreign minister said at a press
conference in Riyadh after a joint Saudi-Italian committee meeting
that Rome condemns all kinds of violent acts in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel carried out air raids on Monday night through early
Tuesday against a number of Lebanon's civilian installations in
retaliation for the stepped-up guerrilla attacks in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
About 38 Lebanese civilians, including women and children, were
injured in the campaign. Power supplies in large parts of Lebanon,
including the capital city of Beirut, were knocked off as several
power stations were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Dini, who arrived in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, held a series of
meetings with senior Saudi officials, which dealt mainly with
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister, who arrived in Riyadh late Monday,
discussed on Tuesday with his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud al-
Faisal about the Middle East peace process and the security
situation in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed deep concern over the Israeli aggression in
Lebanon and urged Israel to adhere to the signed peace accords with
its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine is scheduled to meet Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz before concluding his two-day
visit to the Gulf kingdom, according to Kuwait News Agency.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Briefs U.N. Chief on Israeli Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said his country has sent a message to Secretary General of
the United Nations, Kofi Annan, on the latest Israeli air raid
against civilian institutions in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon urged Annan to exert efforts to deter Israel from
launching more attacks on Lebanon, he said, adding that the message
asked Annan to brief the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, namely Britain, France, Russia, the United States
and China, on the message.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president held Israel responsible for the
deterioration of situation in the region and the failure of the
Israel-Lebanon 1996 truce pact.
</P>
<P>
Hoss noted that the Lebanese resistance did not surpass the
April Accord, 1996, under which Israel, Lebanon and militant
groups, especially the Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah (Party
of God), should not attack civilians or launch military operations
from highly-populated areas on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the party that tore up the accord when it conducted
air strikes against civilian targets in the depth of Lebanon, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has submitted a protest to the committee on cease fire
observation, set up under the April Accord, in southern Lebanon.
The committee, comprising representatives from the United States,
France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, is in charge of overseeing any
violation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
The committee will, according to Hoss, hold a meeting to discuss
the protest.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said that any people has the right to resistance when it
falls under occupation, thus the Lebanese resistance is legitimate
and will continue.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon urges the international community, especially the major
powers, to condemn the Israeli air attacks that went against the
peace process and belied Israel's claims about readiness to pull
out from southern Lebanon by next July, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The strikes, which began late Monday night and continued through
early Tuesday, were mounted in retaliation for the recent killings
of five Israeli soldiers and a senior commander of the pro-Israel
South Lebanon Army in south Lebanon, Israel said.
</P>
<P>
About 38 Lebanese civilians, including women and children, were
injured in the campaign. Power supplies in large parts of Lebanon,
including the capital city of Beirut, were knocked off as several
power stations were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has vowed to revenge the Israeli attacks. Hours after
the Israeli raids, an Israeli soldier was killed in southern
Lebanon in guerrilla rocket attack, which raised to six the number
of soldiers Israel lost in the area since the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
An SLA militiaman was wounded in a separate attack Tuesday and
later died in an Israeli hospital.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Rises 2.9 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work,
surged at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the
strongest showing since the last three months of 1992, the Labor
Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter gain, better than many analysts predicted,
matched the upwardly revised rate of growth in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
For all 1999, productivity rose 2.9 percent, the largest
increase of growth since a 4.1 percent gain in 1992. In 1998,
productivity increased 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other economists
believe good showings on productivity growth have helped to keep
inflation low.
</P>
<P>
But if productivity falters, pressures for higher wages can
result in a a sharp runup in product prices.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, growth in unit labor costs, a key barometer of
underlying inflation pressures, slowed. Those costs rose 1.8
percent last year, compared with 2.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, unit labor costs fell at a 1 percent
rate, after declining 0.3 percent in the previous quarter. The 1
percent decline was the biggest drop in unit labor costs since 1.4
percent in the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The "core" rate of inflation, which excludes volatile energy
and food prices, picked up just 1.9 percent last year, the best
performance since 1969.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Yahoo Suffers Attack from Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yahoo spokeswoman Diane Hunt said Tuesday her company was the
victim of hackers flooding its equipment with repeated electronic
requests. The vandals did not gain access inside its computers,
Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said technicians determined that a flood of
data requests coming from different computers on the Internet had
overwhelmed its routers, which help direct traffic for the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
Technicians ultimately were able to identify the type of data
and filter it out, which restored service, she said.
</P>
<P>
The technique, called a denial of service attack, is similar to
pranksters repeatedly dialing a company's telephone number to
block all other incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
Monday's failure drew renewed attention to the risks facing the
fledgling world of electronic commerce, where hackers can shut
down even the largest online stores.
</P>
<P>
However, the attack didn't affect Yahoo's stock. It traded near
where it had opened at nearly 353 U.S. dollars a share. Yahoo's
market capitalization -- the value of all its outstanding shares --
is about 93 billion dollars.

and international forces must make efforts for the reconstruction
of the country's democratic institutions, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Test Failure Caused by Coolant Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
said a coolant leak that rendered a missile interceptor
essentially blind at the last moment is being blamed for last
month's failed test of its experimental missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post quoted Pentagon officials as saying Tuesday
that aside from the leak, almost everything else went right during
the January 18 test, the second such a test of the U.S. National
Missile Defense (NMD) system, including first-time use of
satellites and ground-based tracking radar to guide the
interceptor.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said last month that for all but the last six
seconds of the interceptor's approximately eight-minute flight
from a U.S. Army range in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific the
indications were that the interceptor would hit its target.
</P>
<P>
The interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S. Army missile
range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Island, about 20 minutes
after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California at 6:19 p.m. local time on January 18 and headed
over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The mock warhead was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the
United States, and a successful intercept would have provided a
dramatic boost to the Pentagon's effort to show missile defense
can work.
</P>
<P>
The first major test of the missile interceptor -- known as a "
kill vehicle," or by its Pentagon nickname, "smart rock" -- was
last October 2.
</P>
<P>
The next test of the anti-missile system has been delayed until
the second half of May because of last month's failed intercept,
the Pentagon officials told the Washington Post.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday deplored the Israeli air attacks against
civilian targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan, who
is now on a trip to Asia, said he was deeply concerned at the
escalation of the hostilities which resulted in the loss of life
during the recent days.
</P>
<P>
 Annan noted the adverse implications of the hostilities for
the Middle East on which rest the hopes of so many and which
should be given every chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
 He called on all parties to exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
 According to reports reaching here, Israeli warplanes struck
three Lebanon power stations Tuesday, expanding the war to
civilian targets after Hizbollas killed five Israeli soldiers in
the past two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Legal Battle Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A last-ditch legal battle over
the fate of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is continuing
Tuesday in the British High Court.
</P>
<P>
Three senior High Court judges are continuing their listening
to legal arguments, with a decision expected later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and six human rights groups are fighting Home Secretary
Jack Straw's decision that he is "minded" to let Pinochet return
home to Chile because a medical report finds the retired general
medically unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that the British government has unfairly prevented
them from seeing the medical report.
</P>
<P>
The report could allow the retired general to escape
extradition to Spain on charges alleging human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
An earlier High Court bid to see the report was dismissed last
week, but the plaintiffs quickly appealed for a judicial review by
three senior High Court judges.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer representing Belgium said Straw had not revealed what
medical tests were carried out on the 84-year-old general or their
results.
</P>
<P>
Belgium argues that it is entitled to see the report because it
has requested Pinochet's extradition on behalf of citizens who say
their relatives were jailed or killed in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Spain, France, and Switzerland have made similar requests, but
only Belgium is involved in the legal challenge to see Pinochet's
medical records.
</P>
<P>
The home secretary has refused all requests, citing Pinochet's
right to patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested during a visit to Britain in October 1998
while recuperating from back surgery in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
He has spent the past 16 months fighting extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
If Belgium's action fails, Pinochet could be given the green
light to leave the country within a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
A Chilean jet is on standby at an airport near London, waiting
to take the general home if he is released.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Registered as Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov was registered Tuesday as a candidate in the
upcoming presidential elections scheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, the first to register in the race, complained of
unequal conditions in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Some candidates have free access to the media from morning
until night, while others cannot even publish an appeal," the
Interfax news agency quoted Zyuganov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election was moved up to March following the
abrupt resignation of former President Boris Yeltsin on December
31, six months before the expiration of his term in office.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was designated as acting
president following Yeltsin's step-down, is expected to be
officially registered as a presidential candidate later this week,
Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin is by far the most popular politician and his chance of
winning the race into the Kremlin became even more secured after
the announcement by former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov that he
would not run.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, leader of the Fatherland-All Russia bloc, had been
considered a strong opponent against Putin, but Fatherland-All
Russia performed poorly in last December's parliamentary elections,
finishing a disappointing third.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party won most of the votes in the elections for
the State Duma lower house of parliament, but many observers doubt
that Zyuganov could beat Putin in the presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
However, Zyuganov appeared optimistic Tuesday, saying that he
might win the race in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The Communist leader said he would start his election campaign
right away and appeal to the voters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We shall publish our program shortly. It was formulated back
in June 1999, and adjusted during the recent parliamentary
elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the previous presidential election in 1996, Zyuganov
garnered 32.13 percent of the votes in the first round. He lost to
Yeltsin in the second round, but won 40.3 percent of the ballots.

<P>
GENEVA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The ruling General Council of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) has agreed by consensus on the
chairpersons for WTO bodies, it was announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Kare Bryn of Norway will succeed Ali Mchumo as the

</P>
<P>
Chairpersons for eight other WTO bodies were also elected at
Tuesday's meeting of the General Council.
</P>
<P>
However, WTO members at the meeting failed to agree on issues
such as trade facilities for the least developed countries and the
extension of transitional periods for the developing countries to
fully implement trade agreements reached at the Uruguay Round,
trade sources said.
</P>
<P>
They will continue their consultations over those issues later.
The next scheduled meeting of the General Council is on May 3 in

<HEADLINE> FM: New Military Doctrine Meant to Ensure National Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Tuesday that the country's new military doctrine
is meant to guarantee its national interests and security and not
meant to be threatening to any other country.
</P>
<P>
"It reflects today's international realities," Ivanov said,
referring to the new doctrine that puts more emphasis on its
nuclear deterrence. The Russian Security Council approved a draft
of the doctrine last week.
</P>
<P>
"Russia does not threaten anybody," but it simply has to take
into account the developments in and around Yugoslavia, NATO's
adoption of a new military doctrine, the enlargement of that
alliance from 16 to 19 countries and "several other threats that
have cropped up in the new situation," the Interfax news agency
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces
General Staff who is a key drafter of the document, said last
month that the new doctrine "clearly and distinctly" viewed
nuclear armaments as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has the right to use nuclear armaments exclusively in
case of an aggression against itself and its allies and only when
it is impossible to prevent by conventional means the liquidation
of Russia as a subject of international relations, a sovereign
entity in these relations," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"Only in that case Russia will have to use nuclear armaments,"
Manilov said. "Russia will never use nuclear armaments if there is
no aggression against it."
</P>
<P>
Russia's current military doctrine, which was approved on
November 2, 1993, "did not announce a possibility of using nuclear
armaments so distinctly and firmly," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it just outlined conditions under which nuclear arms
shall not be used, he said, adding that those conditions remain
valid under the new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not use nuclear arms against signatory states to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of July 1, 1968 that does not
have nuclear armaments, with the exception of two circumstances:
</P>
<P>
-- An armed attack at Russia, its territory, Armed Forces and
other troops or its allies by a country, which has a union
agreement with a nuclear power;
</P>
<P>
-- Joint moves of such a country and a nuclear power to invade
or to make an armed attack at Russia, its territory, Armed Forces
and other troops or its allies or to support such actions.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Dispatch Warship to Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Black Sea Fleet's
reconnaissance ship "Kildin" will sail from Sevastopol on February
16 and head for the Mediterranean, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to be prompted by the presence in the
Persian Gulf of 45 NATO vessels, including up to 20 U.S. warships,
Interfax said, citing Russian military sources.
</P>
<P>
By sending a ship to the area, Russia wants to collect
essential information for its navy command and headquarters about
NATO ships in the Gulf, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The first reports on the dispatch of a Russian reconnaissance
vessel to the Mediterranean came after the U.S. Navy's detention
of the Russian tanker Volgoneft-147 in the Gulf on suspicion that
it carried Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Large reconnaissance ships of the Kildin type were built in the
former Soviet Union in 1967-1972. Their water displacement is 1,
500 tons with a self-sufficiency of 30 days, a crew of 85 people,
and special instruments on board, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> New Refugee Camp in Tanzania Hosts 32,000 Burundians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A newly established
refugee camp in Tanzania's western Kigoma Region has received over
32,000 Burundian refugees by early February, media here reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Karago camp, with a capacity to accommodate 40,000
refugees, would shelter more arrivals, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Senior External Relations
Officer for Tanzania Vincent Kwesi Parker told the Guardian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official said the camp could accommodate more than
its capacity, depending on the availability of basic services.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanzanian government sources, the Karago camp,
which was allocated to UNHCR by the government late last year,
would be developed in three phases to cope with the new influx of
Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
 Latest statistics from UNHCR say about 10,000 Burundian
refugees arrived in Tanzania's western Kigoma Region between 20
January and 2 February.
</P>
<P>
During a recent tour of some Burundian refugee camps in
western Tanzania, UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata singled out the newly
opened Karago camp, saying it was well organized to receive the
new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are nearly 400,000 UNHCR-assisted refugees
in Tanzania who come from Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma said on Tuesday that his government will continue to
strongly support the Angolan government troops to destroy the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels
despite escalating raids made by the rebel movement along
Namibia's border with Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to Namibia state television, Nujoma also warned that
Namibian citizens might be conscripted to defend civilians living
on the northeastern border, where Angolan rebels have been
launching deadly raids into Namibia,
</P>
<P>
"Every citizen must be ready to be called on to go to Kavango
and Caprivi to defend our citizens there," Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
"We are behind the Angolan government, we will give every
support to crush the UNITA bandits in order to restore peace in
Angola."
</P>
<P>
Last December Namibia gave the Angolan army logistical support
in its fight against UNITA, such as allowing the Angolan troops to
be deployed inside Namibia and aircraft and vehicles to be
refuelled.
</P>
<P>
However, the presence of the Namibian army, special police units
and the Angolan army on the border have failed to stop repeated
raids by UNITA rebels into Namibia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, UNITA fighters raided the Angolan border town of
Santa Clara, killing at least 28 people and looting homes and
shops.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Concerned About Instability Along Namibia-Angola Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Mosiuoa Lekota Tuesday said in Cape Town that the
instability along the neighboring Namibia-Angola border "was too
close to our doorstep for comfort."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing, he said the South African
government is extremely concerned about the recent developments
along the border of the two countries and would make a serious
effort to "persuade our neighbors and friends that we should
settle to some agreed patterns of resolving this problem."
</P>
<P>
According to Lekota, his deputy Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge would
travel to Namibia on Tuesday afternoon to be briefed by
authorities there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma said that Namibia's involvement in Angola's civil war
has made the Southern African Development Community more urgent to
find a political solution.
</P>
<P>
She repeated South Africa's view that there could never be a
military solution in Angola and hoped that Zambia would not be
sucked into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said that tension was running high along the
Namibia- Angola border, with 29 people reportedly massacred by the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, Namibian President Sam Nujoma pledged on Monday night
that his government would continue to assist the Angolan
government, saying that " every Namibian citizen must be ready to

<HEADLINE> Angola Promises to End Civil War As Soon As Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Kundi
Paihama has promised that the government troops will end up the
civil conflict as soon as possible, so that his country can
steadily march toward a just and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted here on Tuesday by the official news
agency Angop as saying that a complete military victory of the
government troops will benefit not only the Angolan economic
development, but also the peace and stability in the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
Paihama made the statement after a meeting with the visiting
Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa, who is in Angola attending
the Angola/ Zambia 16th meeting of the joint standing defense and
security commission, saying that the military effort by the Armed
Forces of Angola (FAA) will bring about benefits for the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Paihama, the angolan defense and security forces
have instructions towards the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries, particularly those sharing the border,
to join actions impeding the expansion of the Savimbists actions
across the angolan territory.
</P>
<P>
Paihama also appealed to the Angolan and Zambian peoples to
treasure their fraternity and neighborhood, as well as improve the
bilateral relations and solidarity in the future.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed the need for concrete actions to
further clear the tension and misunderstanding arising at times
between the two countries (Angola and Zambia).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Paihama recognized Zambian government
assistance in accommodating the Angolan refugees in its territory.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been accused by the Angolan government of providing
the Angolan rebels with logistic bases and access to military
supplies during the over-25-year civil conflicts in Angola.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan Officer Arrested in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A former Rwandan army
officer was arrested last Saturday in London by the British
government with a warrant of arrest by the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), official sources said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued by ICTR based in Tanzanian's
north town Arusha, Lieutenant Colonel Tharcisse Muvunyi, a former
Rwandan senior army officer at the time of the genocide in 1994,
is charged with five counts of genocide and crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
Muvunyi is alleged to have exercised authority and control over
all the military operations in Butare Prefecture in southern
Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
He is also said to have made public speeches to incite the
population to perpetrate massacres and provide weapons to a group
of extremist Hutu militia who tried to wipe out the minority Tutsi
population.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that an individual indicted by the ICTR
was apprehended in the Britain.
</P>
<P>
Muvunyi's arrest follows closely the arrest of Augustin
Ndindiliyimana, former Chief of Staff of the Rwandan Gendarmerie
Nationale, in Belgium on 29 January this year.
</P>
<P>
About half million people, most of them minority Tutsis, were
killed in the Hutu-sponsored genocide that began after former
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down on
April 6, 1994.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains have cut
Mozambique's main north-south highway in three places and
interrupted transport between the capital city of Maputo and
Beira, main city in central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Two small rivers, the Pembe and the Muari, in Chibabava
district, in the central province of Sofala, burst their banks
flooding the main road.
</P>
<P>
The third cut is further south, at Vulanjane, in Inhambane
province, where the heavy rains have made it impossible for
vehicles to use a stretch of the road.
</P>
<P>
Bus passengers who wish to continue their journey must leave a
vehicle on one side, walk or wade across to the other side, and
take another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
These areas have usually been regarded as semi-arid - but this
is the second year in a row when the north-south road has been cut
at Vulanjane and in Chibabava.
</P>
<P>
The cuts have occurred in the same places as in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain continued in parts of southern Mozambique on
Sunday and Monday, raising fears of renewed flooding on the main
river valleys in Maputo and Gaza province.

Blantyre, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A recommendation made last
December by chiefs and journalists to bar political parties from
contesting local government polls in Malawi scheduled for
September this year has been rejected, according to a report by
Malawi News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Constitutionally, the move cannot work and it would involve a
lot of complications to make changes in the constitution on how
the local elections should be held," Malawi's local government
minister Uladi Mussa was quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the people to contest in the local elections need
support and in this country they can only get the necessary
support from political parties and nowhere else."
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the campaign process toward the elections can
turn into chaos unless political parties are involved.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that there is need for political will in
carrying out duties in a local government setting and if political
parties should be excluded, things will not work as required.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Holds Talks With Israeli Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday held talks with members of the
Israeli Knesset (parliament) in the West Bank city of Ramallah on
how to move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
"We came here to express our support for the peace process and
we are worried about the halting of the peace talks between the two
parties," Knesset member Sallah Tarif told the Voice of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
All the members of the delegation are from One Israel headed by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and strongly support the peace process,
Tarif said, adding that the members will convey to Barak about
Arafat's positions concerning the peace track.
</P>
<P>
The delegation exchanged views with Arafat on Israel's troop
withdrawal from the West Bank, the final-status talks, and other
sensitive issues concerning the peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation believes that there is still a chance for Barak
to negotiate with Arafat and settle certain issues hindering the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal, Israel has to transfer
another 6.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians on January
20, but the transfer has been postponed due to the differences on
which areas to be handed over.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak met Thursday at the Erez Checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip for the first time in the new year, but
failed to bridge any gaps on all issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
Apparently angered by Barak's proposal to delay nine months for
reaching a framework agreement on the final status and another nine
months for a final peace treaty, Arafat refused to hold a joint
press conference with Barak after their talks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, no talks have been held between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday condemned the
recent Israeli air strikes on civilian areas and industrial and
infrastructural installations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
the Israeli attacks is "in total contradiction with its peace
overtures," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes struck three power stations in Beirut, Baalbek
and the northern city of Tripoli in Lebanon early Tuesday, injuring
18 civilians and plunging much of the country into darkness,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that its strikes targeted the strongholds of
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas in retaliation for the guerrillas'
killing of five Israeli soldiers in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the Israel raids, another Israeli soldier was killed
in southern Lebanon in guerrilla revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman denounced the "expansionist policies" of
Israel and termed Israel as "the major factor of the tension and
instability in the region."
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of ignoring the rights of the Palestinian and
Lebanese nations, maintaining occupation of the Muslim territories
particularly the Arab East Jerusalem, denying the homeless
Palestinian refugees the right to return to their homeland and
continuing attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Having reiterated Iran's support for the Lebanese resistance
against Israel, he called for serious reaction of the Islamic
countries and the international community to the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not recognize Israel and is opposed to the Middle East
peace process between Arabs and Israelis. It calls for armed
struggles against Israeli occupation of Arab and Islamic lands.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
anti-Israel guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops from
south Lebanon, where Israel set up a buffer zone in 1985 to protect
its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Environment Agency Welcomes Weekend Car Ban in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program
and U.N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) Tuesday welcomed
the banning of private cars in the city centre of Rome and in
over 150 towns and cities across Italy.
</P>
<P>
In Rome the car ban will last for 10 hours on Sundays, during
which time public transport and entry into museums and
archaeological sites will be free. Other cities are all set to
make their own rules. The ban is a pilot project by the city
authorities in Italy to reduce the amount of air pollution from
cars.
</P>
<P>
"The health of the people in our cities depends on balancing
the demand for private vehicles with other means of public
transport," said Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the UNEP and
acting director of the Habitat.
</P>
<P>
"Innovative solutions are needed to reduce the pollution from
car emissions and to minimize the congestion caused by cars,"
said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
According to research by the World Health Organization (WHO),
the emissions from car exhausts are responsible an estimated
21,000 deaths a year in Austria, France and Switzerland. In
addition, car fumes caused 300, 000 extra cases of bronchitis in
children and 15,000 extra hospital admissions for heart disease
in these countries per year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nairobi-based UNEP's Global Environment
Outlook, motor vehicles emit well over 900 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide each year.
</P>
<P>
These emissions account for more than 15 percent of global
fossil fuel carbon dioxide releases and represent a major
contribution to global warming.

It landed twice in Central Asia, where at least 10 passengers

good start in the second half, with Michal Kolomaznik and Pravel
Verbir netting in respectively in the 49th and 54th minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans continued their attacks and finally got a penalty
in the 79th minute, with which forward Miguel Angel Zepeda put the
score at 2-1.

In the match for third place on Sunday, Japan, who gave a good
account of themselves at their first-ever World Cup finals in
France in 1998 and with the next finals being hosted by themselves
and South Korea in 2002, were challenged by Hong Kong League XI,
ending the full time at 0-0.
</P>
<P>
The hosts, who were beaten in the semi-final by the Czechs
after penalty, were unlucky again from the spot kicks, missing two
out of seven while the Japanese managed six.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in Guerrilla Retaliation in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed
Tuesday in guerrilla rocket attack in southern Lebanon, raising the
deaths of Israeli soldiers in the area to six this year, Lebanese
security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was killed at a military position near the Israeli
border hours after Israel launched massive air strikes across
Lebanon in retaliation for stepped-up guerrilla attacks, mostly
carried out by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, on
Israeli troops in the occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
About 15 civilians were injured in the Israeli raids on the
Lebanese capital of Beirut and other cities, as well as guerrilla
positions. Power was cut off across large parts of Lebanon as power
stations were destroyed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli soldiers and a commander of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army have been killed in guerrilla attacks in southern
Lebanon since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The latest flare-up in southern Lebanon coincided with a new
impasse in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last
December after a 45-month break. A scheduled round of talks was
postponed last month following a dispute over the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has called on Damascus, regarded as the main power broker
in Lebanon, to restrain Hezbollah activities in south Lebanon in
order to create an environment for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved up a self-styled security zone in southern Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-
border guerrilla attacks. Since then, Lebanese guerrillas
spearheaded by Hezbollah have been fighting to oust Israeli
occupation troops and their allied South Lebanon Army from the
area.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Opposition Ends Parliament Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's opposition camp agreed
Tuesday to end a two-week-long boycott of the Diet (parliament)
after House of Representatives Speaker Soichiro Ito arbitrated a
dispute between the ruling and opposition parties over a
contentious law for reducing lower house seats.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with senior officials of the ruling and opposition
parties, Ito presented an arbitration plan, saying that further
continuation of the Diet impasse may "end in losing the trust of
the people".
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, the Liberal Democratic Party, Liberal
Party (LP) and Komeito party, and the main opposition Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ) accepted the plan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and Social Democratic Party
(SDP) rejected the plan, saying it did not clarify the ruling
bloc's responsibility as the cause of the Diet deadlock. But the
two parties said their lawmakers would attend Diet sessions.
</P>
<P>
The three opposition parties have been boycotting the Diet
since January 27 to protest against what they called the ruling
bloc's bulldozing of a bill to cut lower house seats.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which would trim 20 of the 200 proportional
representation seats in the 500-member lower house, was enacted
last Wednesday after the House of Councilors passed it in the
absence of opposition members.
</P>
<P>
The bill to cut lower house seats faced strong resistance from
the opposition parties because the reduction, they believe, would
benefit the ruling bloc which enjoys stronger support in
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Under the old electoral act, of the 500 seats in the lower
house, 300 were chosen by the constituency-based first-past-the-
post system, and the other 200 were distributed to parties under
the proportional representation system.
</P>
<P>
In his proposal, Ito urged the parties to hold debate on
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's policy speech, since the
opposition parties missed the speech as well as question-and-
answer sessions held last week.
</P>
<P>
The ruling and opposition camps agreed later in the day to hold
a lower house plenary session Wednesday when heads of the
opposition parties will ask Obuchi questions about his speech.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Current Account Surplus to Be 16 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
surplus for this year is expected to be 16 billion U.S. dollars,
the country's Institute for International Finance predicted
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The think tank's forecast is far higher than the 12 billion
dollars predicted by the South Korean government last month.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea registered a current account surplus of
25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The institute said its forecast for this year is based on
rising imports and appreciation of the national currency won.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the institute said private capital would post a
slight net outflow in 2000 due to the repayment burden on short-
term foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
In the latest report, it revised the outlook in favor of net
inflow of about 11 billion U.S. dollars because of an increase in
direct and indirect investment, expansion of short-term trade
credit and early repayment of foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> One More Hostage Released From Hijacked Afghan Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- One more hostage was released
Tuesday from the hijacked Afghan airliner parked in Stansted
airport near London, British police confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged man was seen leaving the Boeing 727 with hands
up in the air as police pointed guns at him, the Reuters news
agency said. He was then escorted away by police.
</P>
<P>
Police said the man had complained of being ill but gave no
further details.
</P>
<P>
The man was dressed in typical Afghan garb, wrapped in brown
blankets, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
He was the ninth hostage being released by the hijackers since
the aircraft arrived in Britain early Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plane owned by Afghanistan's national carrier Ariana was
hijacked during a domestic flight Sunday. It has been parked at
Stansted airport north of London after stopovers in Uzbekistan,
Kazakhstan and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
British negotiators are still in contact with the hijackers,
whose identity and demands have not been made public.

<HEADLINE> Chinese New Year: More than Shopping and Dining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- While China's department stores,
restaurants, and street fairs are crammed full of merrymakers
during this week-long holiday to celebrate the traditional Lunar
New Year, quite a number of people are choosing a more cultural
route and visiting libraries and museums.
</P>
<P>
The National Library of China decided to stay open last year at
Spring Festival, when it logged more than 30,000 visitors. This
year, added to its usual service, the library has opened to
children accompanied by their parents. Primary school students
normally are not permitted into the library without adult
supervision.
</P>
<P>
In western China's Gansu Province, the provincial library's
reading room has been occupied since the eve of the Lunar New Year.
"Readers just keep coming this year," said a librarian.
</P>
<P>
Museums are another alternative for the long holiday. An
elderly woman surnamed Ji, who lives on the outskirts of Beijing,
took her four grandchildren to the Museum of Natural History
downtown early this morning. "I'm so happy the museum is open,"
she said. "It's good for kids to see what's here and find time for
relaxation in their winter vacation."
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Chinese History has hit a record with over 1,000
visitors a day since Sunday, which is twice the usual number. An
exhibition highlighting the culture of the mythical dragon has
been a favorite with most of the visitors in this Year of the
Dragon, believed by Chinese to be the luckiest year in the Chinese
12-year zodiac cycle. And the museum has handed out 3,000 silver
rings carved with dragon shapes to each of the museum's holiday
patrons.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum, the largest in China and known to westerners
as the Forbidden City, welcomed more than 8,000 sightseers on the
first day of the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that two-thirds of the museums in the
Chinese capital have remained open during the festive season.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ministers Defend Air Strikes in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua)-- Several Israeli cabinet
ministers on Tuesday defended Israel's air strikes against the
civilian targets in Lebanon, saying the strikes served as a warning
to Hezbollah and the Lebanese government to stop military
escalation in south lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-ami said the air raids on
targets in Lebanon have been stopped now, but Israel will stage
more strikes against the Lebanese targets if Hezbollah continues
attacks against the Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a Lebanese military group
fighting against the Israel's occupation of south lebanon, where
Israel set up a security zone in 1985 with a self-proclaimed
purpose of protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Israel Air Force conducted several air raids on Lebanese
civilian targets such as power stations early Tuesday, plunging
parts of Beirut and several other Lebanese cities into darkness.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to these air strikes, Hezbollah issued a statement
in Lebanon Tuesday, threatening to retaliate against Israeli
targets in the north.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who opposed air raids in
Lebanon during the Monday cabinet meeting, said Tuesday that the
overnight strikes are a signal to Hezbollah that it can not
continue military actions against Israeli soldiers without response
from the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism Amnon Lipkin-Shahak urged once again the
residents in northern Israel to remain inside the bomb shelters or
security rooms until the situation changes for better.
</P>
<P>
Israel's air strikes on Lebanese civilian targets have drawn
criticism from other countries. France and Italy reportedly said
Tuesday that such air strikes are unacceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which was informed by Israel before the air
strikes, issued a statement calling for restraint.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned by the escalation of violence in
southern Lebanon. We call on all parties to exercise maximum
restraint and to calm this dangerous situation," a U.S. State
Department's statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) suspended Tuesday a
high-level meeting with Israel to protest against Israel's air
strikes on civilian targets in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Agriculture Minister Haim Oron said Tuesday that he was
scheduled to hold a meeting with his Palestinian counterpart Hikmat
Zeid to discuss cooperation between the two sides, but the PNA has
suspended the meeting under the instruction of PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has said that the time is not proper for
holding such a meeting due to Israel's air raids against the
civilian targets in south Lebanon, Oron added.
</P>
<P>
Oron expressed his regret for the suspension of the meeting, and
urged the Palestinian side to reconsider the matter, hoping the two
sides to hold this meeting very soon.
</P>
<P>
The strikes, which began later Monday night and continued early
Tuesday, were mounted in retaliation for Lebanese guerrillas'
recent killing of five Israeli soldiers and a deputy commander of
the pro-Israel South Lebanon Army in south Lebanon, Israel said.
</P>
<P>
All schools in northern Israel remain closed on Tuesday while
residents are ordered to stay in shelters or security rooms in
preparation for possible Hezbollah attacks.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's air raids in Lebanon expanded again the war to
civilian targets and Israel said it had informed the United States
about the air strikes before sending its warplanes into action.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that a power station in the town of Baalbek in the
Bekkaa Valley of eastern Lebanon was hit by the air strike, while
Jamhour power station on the eastern edge of the Lebanese capital
was also a target of the air raids.
</P>
<P>
A third power station in the far north of Lebanon at Deir Nbouh
was also struck.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on Lebanese infrastructure violated a 1996
agreement reached by both sides to avoid civilian targets and
marked a fresh escalation in the expanding conflict in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Israel warned that it will continue to act whenever needed
against the Hezbollah organization and those who stand behind it.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Defense Ministry statement said Prime Minister Ehud
Barak ordered the attacks to counter Hezbollah operations which are
neither prevented by the Lebanese government nor reined in by
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said he thinks Syria could do more to restrain
Hezbollah and Damascus is bringing about the opposite of the
situation needed to sustain a peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The present situation can not continue and Israel has to make
it clear that those who hurt Israel will themselves be hurt,"
Israel Radio quoted Barak as saying.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Human Rights Group Criticizes Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The air strikes launched by
Israel early Tuesday on civilian targets in Lebanon have
contravened the international law, said an Israeli human rights
group here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The strikes on Lebanese civilian targets, including power
stations and other infrastructure, also violated a 1996 agreement
signed by the two sides to avoid civilian targets in conflicts, the
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories (B'TSELEM) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The parties to the conflict shall distinguish between the
civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and
military objectives, and accordingly shall direct their operations
only against the military objectives, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
This is the international law as reflected in Protocol 1 to the
Geneva Conventions of 1949 that Israel violates, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government can not order the military to fire any
kind of weapon at civilian targets in Lebanon under the
international law, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But several Israeli cabinet ministers on Tuesday defended
Israel's air strikes against the civilian targets in Lebanon,
saying the strikes were meant as a message to Hezbollah and to the
Lebanese government to stop the escalation in south lebanon.

<HEADLINE> India Downplays Pakistan's Offer for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, February 8 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday downplayed an
offer by Pakistan's Chief Executive Pervez Musharraf to meet Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, asserting that there was no change
in New Delhi's stand for a resumption of dialogue with Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
India has maintained that Pakistan has to create the right
atmosphere including a cessation of "cross-border terrorism" and a
stoppage of "hostile propaganda" against India for holding any
meaningful dialogue with it.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing new in what he (Musharraf) said," an Indian
Foreign Office spokesman told the media here when asked about
Musharraf's offer for talks made Monday night in his interview
with Doordarshan, India's government-run television.
</P>
<P>
"On all the points raised in the interview, we have said what
we have to say from time to time," the spokesman said, adding: "
There is no change in our position."
</P>
<P>
The cool response appeared to indicate that Vajpayee was in no
hurry to meet Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee asked Islamabad last Sunday to declare that it would
not use nuclear weapons as a first option just as New Delhi did
after its nuclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said his country wanted peaceful relations with
Pakistan but was well prepared to "meet any eventuality" if
Pakistan exercised the option of nuclear weapons against it.

<HEADLINE> HK Unit Trust Sales Surge in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust
industry registered gross inflows of 839.52 million U.S. dollars
in December, the highest monthly gross inflows recorded in 1999,
the chairman of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA)
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with November's gross inflows, December's figure was
up by 19.61 percent, and the industry was also back to net inflows
in December, after recording net outflows of 77.77 million U.S.
dollars in November, the only month which saw net outflows in 1999,
HKIFA Chairman Paul Chow Man Yiu said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on unit trust sales of 1999, Chow said the unit
trust industry registered gross and net inflows of 6,844 million U.
S. dollars and 1,463.23 million U.S. dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"This compares favorably with 1998, which only managed to
record gross sales of 3,654.90 million U.S. dollars and net
inflows of 134.24 million U.S. dollars," Chow said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sales of individual sectors, Chow said Asian equity
sectors generally attracted robust inflows with gross inflows by
six major Asian sectors representing 45.98 percent of the industry
's total.
</P>
<P>
As for the reasons behind the improved sales in Asian funds,
Chow said: "With the gradual recovery of the Asian economies,
investor sentiment towards Asia has much improved since the second
quarter of 1999."
</P>
<P>
According to Chow, among the different Asian sectors, Hong Kong
equity funds was the only sector that saw net outflows in 1999,
and the international sector also saw a major improvement in sales
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"This probably was spurred by a generally more positive global
economic outlook, the continuous merger and acquisition activities,
as well as the contribution of the technology and
telecommunications sectors," Chow added.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA has a total of 50 fund management companies as full
or overseas members. It has about 40 associates, including
trustees and other professionals that are involved in the creation
and administration of funds.

<HEADLINE> HK Foreign Currency Assets Drop in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) said Tuesday that the official foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong amounted to a total of 94.3 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of January 2000.
</P>
<P>
Including unsettled forward contracts, the foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong at the end of January 2000 stood at 94.2
billion U.S. dollars, a fall of two billion U.S. dollars compared
with last December's figure, said a spokesman for the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman attributed the drop in Hong Kong's settled
foreign currency assets in January to a reduction in currency
notes outstanding and the sales of foreign currencies for Hong
Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign currency reserves ranking, Hong Kong is the
world's fourth largest holder of foreign currency reserves after
Japan, China's mainland, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign currency assets of 94.3 billion U.S. dollars
represent over six times the currency in circulation or about 38
percent of Hong Kong dollars M3, one of the highest ratios in the
world, according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Top Lebanese, Syrian Officials Consult on Israeli Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss phoned Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh on Tuesday to
brief him on the outcomes of the air raids launched earlier in the
day by Israel on three power stations across Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During their consultations, Shareh expressed his country's
solidarity with Lebanon in the face of the Israeli hostilities,
Voice of Lebanon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S Ambassador in Beirut David Saturfield said his
country is "very worried" about the confrontation between Israel
and Lebanon, saying the United States will make all efforts to
defuse tension and create a peace-encouraging environment.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the Lebanese Cabinet will hold an unusual
meeting to discuss the damages caused by the Israeli airstrikes on
the civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said Hoss has ordered an urgent message to UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan on the details of the Israeli raids.
He also asked the South Lebanon-based international ceasefire
observers to meet on the Lebanese complaint against the Israeli
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Power Suleiman Traboulsi told reporters on
Tuesday that the damages in the three power stations are many times
severe than those caused by the Israeli strikes last June.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack, which came in retaliation for Hezbollah
militia's killing of five Israeli soldiers, caused power black-out
in many parts across Lebanon including the heart of Beirut, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel carved out a security zone in south Lebanon with
the claim of protecting its north from attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas. The guerrillas spearheaded by Hezbollah have ever since
been fighting to drive the Israeli troops out of the area.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered a conditional pullout from the region but the
Lebanese wants the U.N. Resolution 242 on non-conditional Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon to be put into force.

ALGIERS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- About 80 militants were killed
in a recent massive combing operation by the Algerian People's
National Army in the southern state of Glizan.
</P>
<P>
The local daily al-Sha'ab quoted informed sources as saying
that of those killed was the extremist leader of al-Gharb area in
the state, which lies about 300 kilometers south of the capital
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old female leader was preparing to assassin an army
officer, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
During the same operation, which was meant to clear the region
of
criminal and radical elements, 30 active gunmen, some of them being
non-Algerians, were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Many lawbreakers have surrendered to the Algerian authorities
under the Law of Harmony adopted by moderate President Abdel-Aziz
Bouteflika, but there are still large numbers acting across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The clandestine armed groups of the Islamic Salvation Front
have been launching terrorist attacks against police and civilians
in protest against a ban imposed on the fundamental group in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua)-- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Tuesday suspended a high-level meeting with Israel to protest
against Israel's air strikes on civilian targets in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Agriculture Minister Haim Oron said Tuesday he was
scheduled to hold a meeting with his Palestinian counterpart Hikmat
Zeid to discuss cooperation between the two sides, but the PNA has
suspended the meeting under the instruction of PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has said the time is not proper for holding
such a meeting due to Israel's air raids against the civilian
targets in south Lebanon, Oron added.
</P>
<P>
Oron expressed his regret for the suspension of the meeting, and
urged the Palestinian side to reconsider the matter, hoping the two
sides to hold this meeting very soon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli air force mounted at least two waves of attacks on power
stations and Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, plunging parts of
Beirut and several other Lebanese cities into darkness Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The strikes were mounted in retaliation for Lebanese guerrillas'
recent killing of five Israeli soldiers and a deputy commander of
the pro-Israel South Lebanon Army in south Lebanon, Israel said.
</P>
<P>
All schools in northern Israel remain closed on Tuesday while
residents have been ordered to stay in shelters or security rooms
in preparation for possible Hezbollah attacks.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's air raids in Lebanon expanded again the war to
civilian targets and Israel said it had informed the United States
about the air strikes before sending its warplanes into action.
</P>
<P>
Israel said a power station in the town of Baalbek in the Bekkaa
Valley of eastern Lebanon was hit by the air strike, while Jamhour
power station on the eastern edge of the Lebanese capital was also
a target of the air raids.
</P>
<P>
A third power station in the far north of Lebanon at Deir Nbouh
was also struck.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on Lebanese infrastructure violated a 1996 agreement
by both sides to avoid civilian targets and marked a fresh
escalation in the expanding conflict in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Israel warned that it will continue to act whenever needed
against the Hezbollah organization and those who stand behind it.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Defense Ministry statement said Prime Minister Ehud
Barak ordered the attacks to counter Hezbollah operations which are
neither prevented by the Lebanese government nor reined in by
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said he thinks Syria can do more to restrain Hezbollah
and Damascus is bringing about the opposite of the situation needed
to sustain a peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The present situation can not continue and Israel has to make
it clear that those who hurt Israel will themselves be hurt,"
Israel Radio quoted Barak as saying.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition MPs Stage Token Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition MPs (
members of parliament) staged their 9-hour token hunger strike in
the capital on Tuesday protesting the enactment of the Public
Safety Bill and demanding the resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the opposition and Chairperson of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Begum Khaleda Zia arrived at Paltan Maidan
in the morning to lead the token hunger strike, which was also
joined by Jatiya Party (JP) Chief H M Ershad.
</P>
<P>
Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity Front),
which are allied with BNP and JP, staged a sit-in demonstration in
the same place along with the hunger strikers.
</P>
<P>
A large number of alliance activists and sympathizers as well
as leaders of a number of smaller parties visited the venue
expressing their solidarity with the opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Public Safety Bill, passed by parliament on January 30 in
the absence of the opposition MPs, is awaiting the assent of the
country's president.
</P>
<P>
The BNP Parliamentary Party Monday held an informal meeting
here reviewing the latest political situation in the country. This
was the first meeting of the BNP Parliamentary Party since last
June when the party decided to boycott sessions of parliament to
protest what it called the partisan way of running the House by
the ruling Awami League.
</P>
<P>
The opposition MPs condemned the recent passage of the Public
Safety Bill and urged President Shahabuddin Ahmed not to assent to
the bill which they said was enacted to suppress the opposition
movement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Monday's meeting, Khaleda Zia reportedly asked her
party MPs to prepare for the next general elections by gearing up
the current "oust-government" campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
met on Monday to reviewed public views on the Public Safety Bill
and decided to go for a massive campaign to build up public
opinion in favor of the tough new law meant for curbing serious
crimes.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Lambasts Deadlock in Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
president Nelson Mandela on Monday lambasted great powers like
United States, France and Russia, blaming their rivalries for the
stalemate in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This peace initiative in the Middle East has been there for
the last 25 years and no progress has been made really, because
the western powers have engaged in competition with one another,"
Mandela told a press conference here marking the 10th anniversary
of his release from apartheid prisons.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has used his status as a peacemaker to launch his own
three- point plan for the region last year.
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old former president said he had approached
President Bill Clinton, saying "this is the initiative about which
you should be busy".
</P>
<P>
"I then phoned United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques
Chirac, Egyptian President Mubarak and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
I urged them to work together in order to bring about peace in the
Middle East. But they did not do so."
</P>
<P>
"So it's a setback, because when you have these rivalries there
can be no progress," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela's three-point plan, Israel would withdraw
from Arab land it has occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War, Arab
states would recognize Israel's sovereignty, and an international
commission would be set up to resolve questions such as the status
of Jerusalem and the future of Jewish settlers on the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Warns Against Rise of Fascism in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The rise of fascism in
Europe was a serious matter which could not be ignored, South
African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Austria was a glaring example, other countries
including Britain and Norway had also experienced an increase in
fascism, she told a media briefing in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Racism in Africa has brought catastrophe to individual
countries and millions of citizens, but fascism in Europe has
brought world war."
</P>
<P>
The rise of fascism in countries like Austria, Norway and
Britain meant that "we haven't really learnt much from the Second
World War", Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
She echoed President Thabo Mbeki's view that the decision on
bilateral ties between South Africa and Austria had to be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil last Friday swore in a
controversial coalition government formed by the conservative
People's Party and the far- right Freedom Party, which has been
met with worldwide international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said last week that South Africa was closely monitoring
the situation in Austria.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Sees Increasing Inflow of Foreign Stock Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign stock investment funds in
South Korea registered an estimated net inflow of 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars in January, the fourth month of growth in a row, the Bank
of Korea said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are still working out exact figures, but about 5.5 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign stock investment funds are estimated to
have flowed into the country in January," a bank spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the outflow of foreign equity investment funds
in January is estimated at around four billion dollars, resulting
in a net inflow of 1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the net inflow to improved foreign
investor confidence in the domestic stock market after the
successful settlement of the Daewoo Group's foreign debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a fast economic recovery, foreign stock funds in
South Korea reported net inflows until last May. But financial
instability stemming from the Daewoo Group crisis caused foreign
investors to take more money out of the country from last June.
</P>
<P>
As the Daewoo crisis started showing signs of abating, foreign
stock investment funds switched to a net inflow of 570 million
dollars in October, 2.58 billion in November and 1.46 billion in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
A characteristic of the recent net inflow is the huge amount of
mid- to- long-term funds flowing into the country, whereas short-
term, speculative funds are exiting the domestic bourse.
</P>
<P>
Mid- to long-term investments from U.S. mutual funds accounted
for almost half of the net inflow recorded last month while the
portion of funds from British, Hong Kong and Malaysian hedge funds
was declining, said the bank.

<P>
ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian cyclist Ivan Gotti was
guilty of doping offences, said the Italian Olympic Committee (
CONI) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gotti, two-times winner of the Giro d'Italia, may face the fate
of being expelled from the national team, according to Giacomo
Aiello, head of the CONI's doping commission.
</P>
<P>
Aiello said he has found evidence of "use of substances
belonging to prohibited categories and blood doping".
</P>
<P>
Besides, CONI said Aiello had also referred cyclists Alessandro
Bertolini, Gianluca Bortolami, Gianni Faresin and Giorgio Furlan
to the Italian Cycling Federation for blood doping.
</P>
<P>
Gotti last year won his second Giro d'Italia in three years
after the elimination of Italian hero Marco Pantani for failing a

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- In a gleeful and harmonious
atmosphere, Macao residents spent the first several days of the
Year of Dragon which began on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Macao, which returned to the motherland on December 20 last
year, seemed more bustling during the Spring Festival period.
Crowds of local residents and tourists formed long queues at the
Barrier Gate leading to Zhuhai City and to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first three days of the Chinese
Lunar New Year, 340,000 persons passed through the Barrier Gate.
Officials at the checking station said that the large flow of
passengers would maintain till the middle of the month.
</P>
<P>
Streams of people could also be seen at the Macao side of the
Hong Kong-Macao Ferry Terminal over the past few days. The
shipping company had to increase more than 20 voyages on February
7. At the busiest time, vessels would leave every five minutes,
twice of the normal days.
</P>
<P>
Although many people in Macao chose to spend the Spring
Festival at their hometowns outside Macao, streams of tourists
filled up the consumer market in Macao. People in the tourism
sector said that improving public security has rebuilt tourists'
confidence in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In fact, almost all rooms in the hotels of Macao were occupied
and the prices were doubled or even higher. Restaurants saw
booming business all day, and sometimes people had to wait for
vacant seats.

<P>
One sales manager of a restaurant said that the number of
diners went up about 30 percent in the first three days of the
Year of Dragon. He attributed the boom to the fact that Macao
became more well-known around the world in the course of its
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the traditional scenic spots in Macao, the hall
which had witnessed Macao's power transfer ceremony attracted
hordes of local residents and tourists. As there were too many
visitors, they had to enter the hall group by group.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the visitors could hardly tear themselves away
from the valuable gifts sent by provincial governments in the
mainland areas of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
On February 6, the Japanese government removed its tourism
warning to Macao. Officials with the Macao SAR government and
people in the tourism sector hailed the decision, believing that
the favorable signal would attract more tourists overseas. After
Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, Japan has been a major
source of tourists to Macao.
</P>
<P>
As public security deteriorated before Macao's return, some
countries used to list Macao as a dangerous place for tourists and
advised their citizens not to head for Macao. Japan was the first
country to lift such a warning.
</P>
<P>
According to Fernando Chui Sai On, secretary for social and
cultural affairs of the Macao SAR government, the SAR government
is working on a series of activities entitled "Welcome to Macao"
which will make every tourist feel at home in Macao.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has offered East
Timor assistance in human resource development and its expertise
in gas and petroleum production as well as in training efficient
civil servants, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad

"We are willing to provide East Timor with whatever assistance
within our means and capabilities. I think now we have to work the
details out," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao expressed East Timor's willingness to emulate Malaysia's
development formula, Syed Hamid said, adding Mahathir told the
East Timorese delegation that Malaysia's success was due to the
continuity of the government, political stability and racial
harmony which contributed to economic growth.

to explore investment opportunities in East Timor and that Gusmao
invited Malaysian investors to venture there.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Late Military Dictator Accused of Looting $4.3 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LAGOS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has accused the late military dictator General Sani
Abacha and his family of looting 4.3 billion U.S. dollars from
Nigeria's treasury, the Guardian newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who started a four-day official visit to France on
Sunday, said in Paris that he was determined to recover all stolen
state fund.
</P>
<P>
The Abacha family directly siphoned 2.3 billion dollars from
the national treasury while about one billion dollars went into
contracts which were either non-existing or inappropriately
awarded to members of the family and their friends, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Swiss government froze about 700 million dollar
accounts in the names of Abacha or his associates in some Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this development, the president said that
additional inquiries were being made in every nook and cranny of
the world to recover the country's money stashed abroad.

<HEADLINE> Newly Discovered Ruins in Northeast China Challenge Archeologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Newly discovered ruins in
Heilongjiang Province are challenging previous assumptions that
there was no organized cultivation of China's far northeastern
regions.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery may change the way we look at the early
civilization in the northeast region," said Yang Lin, an
archeologist from the China History Museum.
</P>
<P>
The newly found ruins, located in a river basin some 200 km
from the Sino-Russian border, include an ancient city covering an
area of 1.2 million sq m with some 370 residential sites and more
than 100 castles and garrisons. Researchers believe the relics
date back 1,700 to 2,200 years.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongjie, deputy director of Heilongjiang Provincial
Archaeological Research Institute, said that a castle site in the
ancient city has watchtowers, moats and crenellations.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the number of residential sites
suggests that at least tens of thousands people lived in the area.
</P>
<P>
"We have not found satisfactory explanation why such a
developed agricultural society ever appeared here," said Xu
Yongjie. Yang believes that people who inhabited the region were
born there, but further research is needed before it is known
whether these people had contact with Kokuli and Xianbei cultures.
</P>
<P>
"We will use DNA analysis if any remains of the dead are found,
" said Xu.
</P>
<P>
The plain is now one of six key commercial grain bases in China.

transfer control of the Belbasi Seismic Monitoring Station to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
When the station, located near Ankara, is upgraded in a few
weeks, Turkey will triple its capabilities to more closely monitor
all seismic activities, including nuclear blasts, over a wide area
of the Caucasus, the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the operation of the station will be handed
over to Bogazici University Kandilli Earthquake Center and the
Earthquake Research Institute in Turkey while the Turkish Armed
Forces (TSK) will also be involved in the operation of the station.
</P>
<P>
The Belbasi station was operated by the United States during the
Cold War era to monitor nuclear blasts throughout the Eurasia
region.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, three U.S. experts will inform Turkish
technicians how to operate the upgraded station.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the United States issued a protocol last November
concerning the transfer of the Belbasi station following the
Turkish Parliament's ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The upgrading of the station will massively enhance its
abilities to detect and monitor all kinds of seismic activities,
including nuclear blasts, while the monitoring range encompasses
the Caucasus,the northern area of the Black Sea region and Ukraine,
as well as Turkey's eastern neighbor Iran, Pakistan, the Arabian
Peninsula, Libya and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Vienna-based U.N. Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
Organization (CTBTO) officials will hold talks over the coming
months to discuss the details of placing the station, one of the 20
main stations monitoring worldwide seismic activities, under a
treaty for the establishment of an international seismic monitoring
network to be set up in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
CTBTO also plans to establish 130 secondary stations in various
countries under the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Australia Welcomes New WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government and
the country's farmers Tuesday welcomed the World Trade
Organization's (WTO) decision to restart negotiations on
agriculture and services following the disappointing Seattle
summit.
</P>
<P>
The WTO general council's mandating of new negotiations
demonstrated consensus and will to continue with the trade
liberalization agenda, Trade Minister Mark Vaile said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll now be able to move the agriculture and services
negotiations forward to the benefit of Australia's agriculture and
services exporters," Vaile said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive in itself and will also help in creating
favorable conditions for renewed efforts to launch a new trade
round," he added.
</P>
<P>
The National Farmers Federal (NFF) described the new
negotiations next month as a relief to farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's farmers will be encouraged that no-one tried to
wreck the start of negotiations," NFF president Ian Donges said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said the renewed talks should not stop Australia

Vaile also said he had already begun discussions with the U.S.
and the European Union trade representatives about getting a new
round off the ground.
</P>

Australia," he said.

<HEADLINE> E.Timor to Propose Rotational Leadership by ASEAN Members in UNTAET </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting East Timorese
independence leader Xanana Gusmao has indicated he will propose a
rotational leadership of the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) among ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak, Gusmao
said here he would raise this with the U.N. to give all ASEAN
member nations, including Malaysia, an opportunity to be in
command of UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N. is receptive to the proposal, Malaysia may stand a
chance of being in command of UNTAET when its turn comes," Najib
told reporters after meeting Gusmao who arrived here Monday night
for a three-day visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises 10 members -- Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Najib said Gusmao conveyed to him that he (Gusmao) believed
Malaysia is capable of a bigger role in East Timor, and that he
commended Malaysian military officers for their professionalism
when serving with Interfet (International Force for East Timor).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia sent a 50-strong complement to serve with Interfet
tasked with maintaining order following the referendum on last
August 30 which saw East Timorese overwhelmingly opting for
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Austria-led Interfet was taken over from February 1 by
UNTAET under the command of Filipino Major General Jaime do los
Santos as announced by the U.N. last December.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia sent 20 more officers as military observers with
UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
Najib said Malaysia had not made any decision yet on assigning
extra troops for UNTAET and was awaiting formal request relating
to the matter from East Timor and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry was considering Gusmao's request for
Malaysian medical and engineers corps servicemen to help rebuild
schools and bridges in East Timor and treat East Timorese.

CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Australians are continuing to
shift to capital cities with Brisbane, Perth and Darwin leading
the metropolitan population boom, the Australian Bureau of

</P>
<P>
Each of the three cities increased in population by 1.8 percent

</P>
<P>
While Sydney and Melbourne were not growing as fast, Australia'

</P>
<P>
The ABS counted 60,000 more Sydneysiders for the year and 50,
000 additional Melbournians.
</P>
<P>
Hobart was the only capital city and Tasmania the only state to
record a population decline.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 64 percent of Australians lived in a capital city -
up one percent since 1994, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Population growth also occurred in a number of regional centers
last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
But mining areas in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and
Western Australia experienced some of the largest population
declines, the ABS said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Welcomes Kenya's Governance Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Tuesday welcomed recent steps that the Kenyan government has
taken to improve its governance.
</P>
<P>
"On the fiscal front, despite a complicated situation caused by
lower than projected revenue, government finances have been
managed in a manner consistent with stability in the financial
markets," said a statement issued by the country representative
office in Nairobi after an IMF staff team visited the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
However, continued efforts are needed in both revenue and
expenditure, together with close monitoring by the Kenyan
authorities, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team left Kenya Monday after a two-week visit. The
discussions between the team and the Kenyan government focused on
an economic program that could be supported by the IMF under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, the successor to the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.
</P>
<P>
"It was encouraging to note the expressed determination of the
Kenyan authorities to face continued challenges," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, all recognized that much remains to be
done," it added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205 million U.S. dollar loan under the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility in July 1997 in protest
against poor governance and corruption in Kenya, which has
triggered an economic decline since then.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Health Reforms Need $58 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's health reforms will
cost the government more than 4.2 billion shillings (58 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The People daily Tuesday quoted Medical Services Minister
Amukowa Anangwe as saying that the reforms are aimed at enhancing
the health status of Kenyans by making health services affordable,
accessible and cost effective.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in the capital Nairobi over the
weekend when the Citibank donated 1.38 million shillings (190,000
dollars) for the purchase of surgical instruments.
</P>
<P>
"These reforms are a monumental challenge which will require
the full participation of all stakeholders in order to make the
reforms a success and the government will also require a lot of
funds," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the country will need about 4.2 billion
shillings between 2000 and 2004 in a bid to realize the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Anangwe noted that his ministry is going to pursue the reforms
 vigorously, adding that several changes in drug and medical
supplies management are in the offing.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Information Appliance Market to Explode -- Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide marketplace
for information appliance is rapidly taking off as new products,
technologies and vendors are announced one after another.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Monday by U.S. market research
firm International Data Corporation (IDC), as an ever-broader
group of vendors attempt to address the "post-PC era", the world
market for information appliances will exceed 89 million units, or
17.8 billion U.S. dollars, in 2004, up from a market of 11 million
units and 2.4 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The IDC defines information appliances as an emerging category
of digital consumer electronics that provide low-cost, easy-to-use,
consumer-focused access to the features and benefits of the
Internet. IDC's information appliance taxonomy includes shipments
from Internet gaming consoles, NetTVs, Internet smart handheld
devices, Web terminals, email terminals and screenphones. As these
and other new devices arrive in the next few years, the IDC
forecasts that U.S. unit shipments of consumer information
appliances will outnumber those of consumer PCs by 2002.
</P>
<P>
"Current on-line users want access to services in more
locations and situations, while many other consumers desire
Internet access without the inherent complexities of PCs," IDC's
report said. "It is clear the PC will not be the only enabling
device as both groups find information appliances a solution that
can improve their lifestyle and work style."
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, the devices that lead the market are ones
that take advantage of existing infrastructures and usage patterns.
Devices such as NetTV set-top boxes as well as Internet gaming
consoles will benefit from consumers' familiarity with the
television. Internet connectivity is also making inroads into the
increasingly popular smart handheld device market.

<HEADLINE> UPS Supplies E-Commerce Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Parcel Service (
UPS) said Monday that it has launched a subsidiary to research and
develop new businesses in the package delivery industry, according
to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
Armed with its ubiquitous fleet of brown delivery vans, the
company said it has formed UPS e-Ventures to tackle an
increasingly important need in e-commerce for services such as
order fulfillment, supply management, distribution and returns.
</P>
<P>
The UPS had not offered services to such small companies and
start-ups in the past such as warehousing and order fulfillment.
UPS officials said the cash-rich company would end up being an
equity player in the field as well.
</P>
<P>
"We will make equity investment for a number of reasons other
than just to make money," said Mark Rhoney, president of e-
Ventures. "We'll look at (equity) in areas where it is warranted
in order to facilitate execution of one of our ideas."
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based company has been under pressure to expand its
on-line operations as competitors such as Federal Express and
SubmitOrder.com have offered services ranging from on-line
warehouse management to electronic orders.
</P>
<P>
While a tiny pool of Web companies -- like Amazon.com and
Webvan -- are creating a network of warehouses, and many others
have avoided the complicated job of processing an order from
packaging to delivery.
</P>
<P>
The first project the UPS is incubating is UPS e-Logistics,
which plans to provide small to mid-sized businesses with complete
logistical services, from warehousing and orders to customer
service.
</P>
<P>
"UPS recognizes the power the Internet has to impact business-
to-business and business-to-consumer commerce," Mark Rhoney, UPS e-
Ventures' president, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said UPS' 92 years of experience in operational
execution and delivery logistics, as well as its massive fleet of
trucks and network of warehouses, give it a strong advantage over
some rivals.
</P>
<P>
The UPS, which reported 1999 annual revenues of 27.1 billion U.
S. dollars, said it has also spent 11 billion dollars on
technology in the last decade to shore up its infrastructure. The
company already provides Nike.com and others with supply-chain
management and logistics.

<HEADLINE> France Deplores Israeli Raid on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- France deplored on Tuesday the
overnight air raid by Israeli warplanes on civil infrastructures
in Lebanon which destroyed several electricity centers and injured
many people.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted the spokeswoman of French Foreign
Ministry Anne Gazeau-Secret as saying that the Israeli raid was a
"grave violation of the arrangement made in April 1996 which has
the precise purpose of protecting civil population."
</P>
<P>
"We deplore the bombings last night, conducted against the
public services which are indispensable for the daily life of the
population in several regions in Lebanon, and which have injured
many people," she said in a communique issued in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, where the French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine was
paying a visit.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that France has called for the holding as
soon as possible of a meeting of the monitoring group of the 1996
arrangement, which was made after the "Grapes of Wrath" operation
against Lebanon by Israel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the arrangement, both Israel and Hezbollah
guerrillas should avoid targeting civilians in their military
action.
</P>
<P>
The group, co-chaired by France and the United States and is
joined by Israel, Syria and Lebanon, is responsible for
supervising the observance of the arrangement but does not have
binding power over either side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
France also urges Israel and the Hezbollah guerrillas in
Lebanon not to make any more reprisals or action of escalation
which would threaten the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
In an action of reprisal against recent attacks by Hezbollahs,
Israeli warplanes struck three centers of electricity distribution
in Jahmour near Beirut, in Baalbek in east Lebanon and in Tripoli
in the north, depriving the local population of power in full
winter.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Humanitarian Aid To Chechnya Stopped In Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Georgia's director of Vale custom gate, Zurab Zurabasvili, said
the consignment of aid, which consists of medical supplies, was
being distributed to the Chechen refugees by illegal means and
added that there was no custom record for it.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Moscow used to accuse Turkey and Georgia of
aiding militants from breakaway Chechnya, a charge that Georgia
denied.
</P>
<P>
During the summit of Commonwealth Independent States (CIS) in
Moscow on January 25, leaders from 12 CIS countries, including
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, decided to strengthen
cooperation in the struggle against international terrorism and
separatism. They also pledged to speed up the integration process
of CIS.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, who served as Soviet foreign minister under
Mikhail Gorbachev, has tried to forge closer ties with the West
while Russia does not want to see the West extend its influence in
the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Tbilisi, Shevardnadze praised on
Monday Russian peacekeepers for playing a positive role in
Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia, a move sharply in
contrast to his previous criticism of Russia on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian leader said confrontation with Russia doesn't suit
either country's interests.

<HEADLINE> Direct Meeting Possible in Third Round of Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides has said that once the proximity talks on Cyprus move
ahead and there is necessary common ground, direct negotiations
between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides will take
place.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said in Geneva on Monday that he does not rule out a
face to face meeting between Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during the third round of U.N.
-sponsored proximity talks later this year.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the objective of the first two rounds of talks
is not to bridge the positions of the two sides but rather to give
the U.N. a better insight into the views outlined by the sides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The second round of proximity talks, which started on January 31

to pave the way for a final solution to Cyprus issue, will draw to
a close Tuesday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks are expected to start in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said it is not clear whether the U.N. will bring to
the table written ideas.
</P>
<P>
De Soto, U.N. Secretry-General's Special Adviser, is likely to
present orally some thoughts during the third round to see whether
these can be discussed by the two sides, Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the positions the Turkish Cypriot side presents
to the third round of talks will tell whether there has been a
change in the Turkish stance on Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> hke020841 --Int'l Negotiators Should Hear More from People: IPU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- International negotiators
should hear more from people when making decisions by working
together with national parliaments, making up of people-elected
representatives, Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Secretary-General
Anders Johnsson said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Johnsson made the remark on the eve of the a parliamentary
meeting to be held on February 10 and 11, paralleling to the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD X) scheduled from February 12 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Johnsson told reporters at a press conference that UNCTAD X is
taking place at a time when "trade and development issues are at a
crucial juncture."
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations during the World Trade Organization's talks
in Seattle last year showed that globalization and trade
liberalization need to be "people-centered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"people want their concerns for securing a job, enjoying social
security and providing food and education for their families and
their children to be taken into account," he added.
</P>
<P>
National parliaments, consisting of people elected legislators,
should be involved in the decision-making process in international
organizations, such as WTO, the International Monetary Fund, World
Bank, and other U.N. bodies, including UNCTAD, Johnsson said.
</P>
<P>
Involving into the international negotiations is necessary for
parliaments because issues discussed in national parliaments are
often issues addressed in international debates and discussions.
</P>
<P>
"If they (national parliaments) don't involve, by the time they
make decisions, it will be too late," Johnsson said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, working with parliaments is also in the
interest of international organizations because their decisions
must reach the people in the end, he said.
</P>
<P>
By working more closely with parliaments, the intermediate
between international organizations and people, consensus will be
more easily be forged, Johnsson noted.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, establish in 1889, has 139 affiliated national
parliaments and five associated parliamentary assemblies.
</P>
<P>
It provides a parliamentary dimension to the United Nations by
encouraging direct participation and involvement by national
parliaments and their members in U.N. activities.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 members of over 50 parliaments are expected to
attend this upcoming meeting, which will adopt a declaration and
present it to UNCTAD X.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Improved Outlook for South Africa's Economy Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Finance
Department said Tuesday it is "delighted" that the improving
economic and political conditions in South Africa are recognized
by an international rating agency.
</P>
<P>
The department was reacting to the announcement on Monday by
Moody's Investors Service that it has upgraded its rating outlook
for South Africa's economic prospects from stable to positive.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that Moody's improved
outlook reflects the prospects for a strong economic recovery over
the next several years, which is envisaged to strengthen South
Africa's virtuous fiscal performance and the country's debt
repayment capacity.
</P>
<P>
The agency predicted that the growth upturn will not have
significant negative consequences for the external trade accounts
or the balance of payments, which would allow the substantial
improvement in the country's liquidity position to continue.
</P>
<P>
It pointed to the rapid growth in manufacturing exports and
vigorous expansion in the non-agricultural economy as evidence of
the fruits of the industrial restructuring as well as of the trade
and financial market liberalization that have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
It praised the South African government for its preparedness to
mold policies for education and labour with a view to maximizing
skill development and employment growth.
</P>
<P>
The agency indicated that it would welcome further progress in
the areas of labour market liberalization and privatization of
state owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed concerns about the prevalence of HIV
infection and crime. On balance, however, the agency remains
positive about the pro- active political and economic management
that is likely to accelerate the pace of growth and diminish the
country's social inequalities.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department said that Moody's concerns are noted and
are being addressed by the government on an ongoing basis.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) released Hamas
leader Abdul Aziz Rantisi Monday, 21 months after it jailed him for
speaking out against peacemaking with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Another Hamas leader, Ismail Abu Shanab, said the current
deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations might have motivated
the PNA to release Rantisi.
</P>
<P>
But a senior PNA security officer said Rantisi was released
because his sentence was up and it had nothing to do with the halt
in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The lives of the three Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers
killed last week at the Galgalit base in South Lebanon could have
been saved if the IDF had bought systems to minimize the damage
from Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas' missiles.
</P>
<P>
Military officials who contacted Knesset members and journalists
in recent days say the IDF refrained from acquiring the systems,
developed and produced in Israel, in order to save NIS 2 million
(about 500,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Austrian far-right Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider said
Monday that he hopes a row with Israel over his party's entry into
government will soon blow over "and we can be good friends in the
future."
</P>
<P>
Israel has recalled Ambassador to Vienna Natan Meron in protest.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky has officially moved
to put Haider on a list of persons barred from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak broadly hinted Monday night
that retaliation against Hezbollah would not be long in coming, and
that the strike would be painful.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the security cabinet endorsed Barak's
proposal for an operation in Lebanon in answer to the escalation in
Hezbollah attacks over the past ten days.

TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has warned Iraq that it
would make reprisals in the wake of Saturday's mortar attacks on
Iranian government buildings by the Iraq-based military opposition
Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), Iranian newspapers reported on
Tuesday.

"If Iraq does not prevent the infiltration of counter-

riposte strongly," Commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC) Yahya Rahim Safavi warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Iranian government would prevent
further MKO attacks through political means.
</P>
<P>
"We first let the politicians try to solve the problem with
Iraq, but then we (the armed forces) will give Iraq an appropriate
reply over its cooperation with the terrorists," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander said his forces have "the task and duty of
defending Iran's frontiers and ensuring security in border zones."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday summoned Iraqi Charge
D'affaires to Tehran Abd al-Satar al-Ravi, voicing Tehran's strong
protest to Baghdad over the MKO attacks which killed one people and
injured five others.
</P>
<P>
In a protest note, Iran accused the Iraqi government of
breaching international norms and the U.N. Charters by hosting the
MKO members in its territory and allowing them to launch military
attacks on Iran.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the Iraqi government bears the consequences
of these actions and Tehran reserves the right to take actions to
preserves its legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
The MKO members fired seven mortars into the area close to the
Iranian government buildings, including the office of the supreme
leader, the presidential office and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reports said three of the mortars exploded near the office of
Hashemi Rafsanjani, former president and current chairman of the
powerful advisory State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
The attacks angered Tehran as the country's rival political
factions were busy at white-hot struggles ahead of the sensitive
parliamentary elections slated on February 18, which is believed to
create a new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO has claimed responsibility for the
explosions. MKO was an active political and military group
fighting against the former Shah regime, but was announced illegal
in 1981 following sharp differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the MKO launched a series of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country. In retaliation,
Iranian air forces also launched several cross-border raids on the
MKO bases near Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Pull down Medicine Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Health has implemented measures to stop questionable procurement
practices that jack up the costs of medicines sold to government
outlets, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez said in a radio interview
that the measures, initially implemented at the health department'
s central office in Manila, are showing positive signs.
</P>
<P>
"We are conducting operations to stop these practices. These
are now in place in our central office. We are now checking our
peripheral units and regional offices to see if these practices
are still being done," Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the government's campaign to pull
down medicines costs will bear fruit soon, since the
pharmaceutical industry is cooperating in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
"The pharmaceutical industry is coordinating with us not only
in lowering prices of medicines but in improving their quality. We
'll have some movements soon," Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
He said the department is now monitoring the prices of
medicines sold in government hospitals and making sure these low-
priced medicines are always available.
</P>
<P>
He also said the department has separated its bidding procedure
from the purchasing process, with the central office determining
the prices of medicines.
</P>
<P>
The prices, he said, are arrived at after discussions with
suppliers and after getting recommendations from independent
committees.
</P>
<P>
He said the department's central office monitors the purchase
of medicines, and has asked other government offices to submit to
it the list of medicines they want to procure.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said many of the irregularities involve practices
that waste government resources, with the health department ending
up with inferior quality goods.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gvt to Form Special Team to Handle Regional Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to prevent unrest and
separatist movements in some provinces, the Indonesian government
will establish a special team to handle conflicts, a senior
official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The team is aimed to handle some conspicuous problems which
are taking place especially in Aceh, Riau, Maluku, East Kalimantan
and Irian Jaya provinces," Minister of Home Affairs Surjadi
Soedirja told the House of Representatives (DPR) commission II on
national political affairs.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with the establishment of the team,
which will involve any parties including the Indonesian Military (
TNI), the country will be successful in avoiding disintegration
threat.
</P>
<P>
The team will also strive for reconciliation among the opposing
camps, especially those involved in horizontal conflicts," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy will be pursued in cooperation with
public figures, religious and traditional leaders, youths and
experts.
</P>
<P>
After East Timor voted in favor of independence in August last
year, Indonesia has been facing with threats of separatism from
some provinces such as Aceh, Riau and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
But, President Abdurrahman Wahid has insisted that the central
government would not tolerate any separatist movements in the
country and pledged to take tough measures against them.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also pointed out that the unitary state of Indonesia
should remain intact.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soedirja also urged all parties to halt any polemics
on the possibility for establishing a federation state of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time to halt separatist movements and any polemics
on the federation state (of Indonesia), " the minister said,
adding that the central government will accelerate the
implementation of the regional autonomy act under which the
regions could get more authorities to decide their development
policies.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Arrives For State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wahid, accompanied by his wife Sinta Nuriyah and daughter, was
given a ceremonial welcome soon after his arrival by his Indian
counterpart Kocheril Raman Narayanan, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said last week
that India attached great importance to this visit in the context
of recent changes in Indonesia including a peaceful democratic
election, the first in over 30 years, in the country.
</P>
<P>
The visit would provide an opportunity to renew and revitalize
the long-standing historical relations between India and Indonesia,
the fourth largest country in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, the fourth Indonesian president to visit the South Asian
country, told reporters following the welcome ceremony that he
looked forward to his talks with Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Indian media said that Wahid, who is on a 16-day foreign tour,
was keen in getting to know more about the way India had handled
the macro-management of its economy while, in turn, India could
exploit this visit to add substance to its "look East" policy.
</P>
<P>
Though trade between the two countries increased from about 280
million U.S. dollars in 1991 to 1.4 billion dollars in 1996, the
potential to increase it manifold is yet to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president is accompanied by a delegation of 65
to 70 businessmen and an interactive business session has been
arranged by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after coming to power last October as Indonesian first
democratically elected president in decades, Wahid reportedly said
that he would concentrate on three countries in Asia -- China,
Japan and India.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were
confirmed dead and dozens reportedly missing following heavy rains
over the past two days in South Africa's Northern Province and
Mpumalanga, police said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Northern Province police spokeswoman Captain Ronel Otto said at
least 13 people had died as a result of downpours in the far north
since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among them, nine people were reported to have drowned while
crossing rivers or streams near Thohoyandou, seemingly after under
estimating the strength of the current, Otto said.
</P>
<P>
Two elderly women, a man and a child died and five people were
seriously injured in separate incidents when their mud houses
collapsed because of the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday morning, the rain had stopped but the Pietersburg
area was heavily overcast, Otto said.
</P>
<P>
In Mpumalanga, the bodies of two people including a
seven-year-old girl and a women, 74, were recovered and at least
seven were reportedly missing and feared drowned since Monday
night, Captain Harry Shabangu said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Prisons Become Overcrowded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Prisons in Tanzania are
getting overcrowded due to the increasing number of inmates and
the slow pace at which the police and the judiciary deal with
cases, the Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of prisons countrywide cannot match with the
increasing number of inmates, the Principal Commissioner of
Prisons Onel Malisa told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to Malisa, the number of inmates in Tanzanian prisons
has increased to about 40,000 to 45,000 from 9,000 in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
He explained that 50 percent of those in prison are detainees
mainly from several big towns. They cannot be transferred
elsewhere because they have to remain at places where their cases
are being conducted, though some prisons in the country have more
rooms.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian government sources said recently crimes in urban
cities have been escalating over the years, with armed robbery,
illegal possession of firearms and drug-trafficking the most
commonly reported crimes.
</P>
<P>
Officials attribute this upward trend in crime to the influx of
rural youth to cities. Some of them are involved in various crimes
for lack of employment.

<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The festival mood in the
Chinese capital appears more nostalgic, while Shanghainese are
attempting to add some color to the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, many Beijingers have traditionally gravitated
to temple fairs. The old tradition is still preserved. At the
Earth Temple, people dress in Qing Dynasty clothes and solemnly
offer sacrifices to gods. There are thousands of curious onlookers.
At the White Cloud Temple, visitors can ride donkeys and touch a
stone monkey.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 350,000 people visited temple
fairs in different parts of Beijing between February 4 and 7.
</P>
<P>
Beijing artists, professional or amateur, have composed new
year couplets to usher in the year of the dragon. Some 10,000 new
year couplets have been written and sent to farmers on the
outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey in Beijing, most Beijingers have chosen
to prepare their own new year's eve dinner, which traditionally in
the north consists of making dumpling. Others prefer to eat in
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
E--mail greeting cards have also become wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, in contrast, has attracted 15,000 tourists across the
country, who crowd the city's neon-lit streets during the festive
season.
</P>

As the city recorded the fastest GDP rate among all Chinese
cities last year, Shanghainese proudly embrace the year of the

DALIAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Liu Jun goes to work as she has
always done over the past seven years. The only difference is that
she is now the assistant to the general manager of her company.
</P>
<P>
Liu, in her mid-30s, used to be an ordinary staff member of the
Dalian Daxian Group Company located in the port city of Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province. The Company ranks 27th among
China's Top 100 Electronics Enterprises.

Liu said that being employed by a big SOE (State-owned
enterprise) means more experiences and opportunities for her.
</P>
<P>
Liu and 13 other people have successfully been recruited in
Dalian as vice general managers or assistants to general managers
in charge of financial affairs, foreign trade or technology
management. They will be employed on a probationary period for one
year. Salaries will be based on their working capabilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Chengmin, the deputy mayor of Dalian, this is
the first time that a Chinese city has allowed a large number of
large SOEs to recruit and employ managers through examination and

<HEADLINE> Power Stations Destroyed in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua)--Lebanese power stations were
destroyed in the air raids launched early Tuesday by Israel in
retaliation for Hezbollah guerrillas' recent attacks that killed
five Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 15 civilians were wounded in the air raids.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also bombarded a base of the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of Lebanon, including the country's capital of
Beirut, the town of Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa Valley and the
cities of Sidon and Tyre in the south, were plunged into darkness
most of the night.
</P>
<P>
However, power was restored to some areas by morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Electricity Minister Suleiman Traboulsi has imposed a
regime of strict rationing, citing damage to the power grid was
heavy.
</P>
<P>
The air raids came after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
Security Cabinet ordered a "harsh military" response to the
escalation of activities by Hezbollah against Israeli soldiers in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to
protects its northern towns from being attacked by guerrillas. But
the guerrillas have been fighting to drive the Israeli troops out
of Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Schools in Northern Israel Remain Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua)-- All schools in northern Israel
remain closed on Tuesday while residents are ordered to stay in
shelters and security rooms in case Hezbollah guerrillas launch
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military issued the order to all the residents in
the north before and after Israeli Air Force's strikes against
Lebanese targets earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes struck a Hezbollah stronghold and three power
stations across Lebanon early Tuesday in retaliation for
Hezbollah's killing of five Israeli soldiers in the past two weeks
inside the Israeli-controlled security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's air raids in Lebanon expanded again the war to
civilian targets and Israel said Tuesday it had informed the United
States about the air strikes before sending its warplanes into
action.
</P>
<P>
Israel said a power station in the town of Baalbek in the Bekkaa
Valley of eastern Lebanon was hit in the air strikes, while Jamhour
power station on the eastern edge of the Lebanese capital was also
the target of the air raids.
</P>
<P>
A third power station in the far north of Lebanon at Deir Nbouh
was also struck.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on Lebanese infrastructure violated a 1996 agreement
by both sides to avoid civilian targets and marked a fresh
escalation in the expanding conflict in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Israel warned that it will continue to act whenever needed
against the Hezbollah group and those who stand behind it.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon said power was knocked out in many areas,
including the heart of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Defense Ministry statement said Prime Minister Ehud
Barak ordered the attacks to counter Hezbollah operations which
were neither prevented by the Lebanese government nor reined in by
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said he thinks Syria can do more to restrain Hezbollah

<P>
KAMPALA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development has set up a commission of
inquiry to investigate the closure of three commercial banks last
year and the subsequent sale of the Cooperative Bank.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Gerald Sendaula appointed Justice James Munage
Ogoola to chair the commission which is composed of three members,
Radio Uganda reported Tuesday.

The commission is expected to examine the primary causes of
failure and closure of the International Credit Bank, Greenland
Bank and Cooperative Bank and to scrutinize the procedure followed
in selling the Cooperative Bank branches to Standard Chartered
Bank and Centenary Rural Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ogoola's team will also make recommendations for strengthening
supervision of banks and Bank of Uganda's intervention policy
towards failed banks in order to protect deposits and public
funds.

The report said that the team is expected to complete its probe
in about three months' time and come up with a final report.

Following the bank closure, the Parliament passed a motion to
set up the commission of inquiry among others to investigate the

<HEADLINE> Virgin Forests Better Protected in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The city government of
Dujiangyan in southwest China's Sichuan Province has rewarded a
local farmer with 10,000 yuan (1,204 US dollars) for rescuing an
ailing giant panda last month.
</P>
<P>
The reward, equivalent to five years' salary for the farmer, is
part of the city's campaign to protect wildlife in Longxi Virgin
Forests, where the giant panda was found. The animal was later
sent to a nearby giant panda research center for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The 43,000-hectare virgin forest, just 70 kilometers from
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, is believed to be the only virgin
forest in the world located so close to a big city.
</P>
<P>
According to a newly-published research book, there are over 10,
000 species of plants and animals in the forest, nearly 100 of
which are state-protected.
</P>
<P>
But its proximity to a big city has left it vulnerable to
environmental damage from nearby humans, the book warned.
</P>
<P>
For the last decade, Dujiangyan has spent several million yuan
to protect the forest. It closed down several mines, tore down old
buildings in the area and resettled local farmers.
</P>
<P>
In a further clampdown, the city recently decided to ban all
mining near the forest and removed all tourism buildings to plant
more trees in the area, said Hou Xiongfei, the city's party
secretary.

<HEADLINE> Footprints of South China Tiger Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have found
a footprint of a South China tiger in a nature reserve in western
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
A group of biologists from Hunan Normal University in central
China recently explored the Black Mountain Reserve in the province
and found a clear and complete footprint of an animal there.
</P>
<P>
After careful examination, they concluded that the print was of
the left hind paw of a South China tiger, with its four toes
measuring 18 cm in width. They estimated the tiger weighs over 170
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger is one of the ten most endangered species
in the world and is under state-level protection in China.
</P>
<P>
The experts also found three other footprints of the animal at
the reserve, but these were not as clear as the other. They made
cast of all the prints for further study.
</P>
<P>
Black Mountain Reserve is located in Taoyuan County in western
Hunan. It covers 33,818 hectares, with the central area covering 5,
100 hectares and the highest peak 1,104 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng Xuejian, a member of the expedition team, the

findings at the reserve are strong evidence for the theory of the
South China tiger's existence in Hunan.

<P>
LANZHOU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Gansu, an underdeveloped
province in Northwest China, saw 93,800 laid-off workers find new
jobs last year with governmental assistance.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1999, Gansu's provincial government
departments issued a series of regulations on assisting the laid-
offs to find reemployment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the provincial finance office allocated 1.485 million
yuan (178,000 U.S. dollars) to subsidize 12 state-owned
enterprises in training their more than 7,700 laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 156,000 laid-offs in the province received job
retraining last year, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also made efforts to expand and
improve local labor markets to create more possibilities for the
unemployed in 1999, while some 189 illegal labor employment
agencies were shut down.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province has 705 legitimate employment agencies,
603 of which are run by labor departments at several levels.

<HEADLINE> Thailand on Right Track: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- While Thailand's formal exit
from the economic reform program with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF)will not happen until June, IMF officials agree that
Thailand is now out of the crisis and no further assistance is
necessary, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials last week concluded their quarterly review of
Thailand's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Ranjit Teja, IMF division chief for Thailand, was quoted as
saying that with growth firmly on track and foreign reserves
strong, the country had no further need to access fund facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai economy was likely to perform strongly this
year due to export recovery, higher consumer demand and expanding
production.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the economic improvement in Thailand has been so
strong in the past few months that the IMF is considering revising
its growth forecast for the Thai economy this year to "closer to
five percent"from around four percent previously, Teja said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned, non-performing loans (NPLs) will have to
come down faster to ensure a sustained recovery.
</P>
<P>
The early completion of the IMF review is scheduled to be
approved by the IMF's executive directors at a meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
Thailand asked for IMF assistance in August 1997, accepting a
17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar standby credit program after exhausting
foreign reserves in a failed effort to defend the baht.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 14 billion dollars has been drawn from the
program.The government is scheduled to make the first repayment of
the loans in November, with a 200 million dollars payment to the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Next year, loan repayments are estimated at three billion
dollars,with 1.2 billion dollars due to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said no further
drawdowns would be made from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He said no new letter of intent was necessary, as existing
policies and measures were deemed sufficient.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing we need to change for our current policy.
The key rather will be on implementation of our policy," Tarrin
said.
</P>
<P>
He said consultations between the IMF and Thai officials in
the future will still be held annually, similar to those held with
other fund members.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Push for Wider Nuke Free Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
Disarmament and Arms Control Matt Robson wants to push a plan for
a Southern Hemisphere nuclear-free zone.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post reported here Tuesday that Robson plans to
attend a disarmament conference in Geneva next month proposing the
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone be extended throughout the
Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand wants to "encourage as many people as possible to
extend the nuclear-free zones that have been declared", the
Wellington-based newspaper quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific Nuclear Free zone, signed by 13 countries
including New Zealand, came into force on December 11, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Its protocols ask nuclear weapons states with interests in the
region to respect the status of the zone, and not station or test
nuclear weapons within it.
</P>
<P>
Parties to the treaty undertake not to manufacture, acquire or
possess nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
There are three other such zone treaties in the world, covering
the Latin American and Caribbean regions, Africa and Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The concept of the Southern Hemisphere nuclear free zone is to
draw on common ground between these treaties, although Robson said
the details as to how a Southern Hemisphere treaty will be handled
are not finalized.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post said Robson played down the likely reaction
from the United States to a New Zealand minister pushing for a
Southern Hemisphere nuclear-free zone.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful that they will see it as our right as a democratic
country to put a view and a solution," Robson was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Seeks Malaysia's Support for Attending  ASEAN Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- East Timor has sought
Malaysia's support to facilitate its attendance at the various
meetings of the ASEAN leaders, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They seek our support to facilitate East Timor's attendance at
the meetings of ASEAN leaders in order to be familiar with the way
ASEAN is run," he told reporters after meeting East Timor
independence leader Xanana Gusmao here.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said that East Timor wished to be accorded an
observer status or in other capacity so as to get to know the
ASEAN members better.
</P>
<P>
It was premature to talk about East Timor's membership of ASEAN
as Gusmao himself would need at least two years to form a
government there, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of membership does not arise now. He wants to
familiarize with the ASEAN process. My stand is that we'll have to
discuss the matter with our ASEAN partners. As he has requested to
attend, we'll have to make a decision, the status of his presence,
all these we'll consider at the appropriate time," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao, president of the National Council for Timorese
Resistance, arrived here Monday night for a three-day visit as
part of his Asian tour to secure support for the reconstruction of
his strife-torn territory recently independent from Indonesian
rule.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Aid Commitment to Nepal Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign aid commitment has
almost doubled, with grants exceeding loans, in the first six
months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period of
the previous year, The Kathmandu Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily said that according to government sources,
foreign aid commitment reached 11.21 billion rupees (160 million U.
S. dollars) in the first half of the current fiscal year, a 96.32
percent increase over the same period of the previous year when
foreign aid commitment stood at 5.71 billion rupees (81 million U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
An obvious change in foreign aid is the reversal of composition
of aid. Out of the committed aid in the last six months, grants
accounted for 64.7 percent, standing at 7.48 billion rupees (107
million U.S. dollars), while loans accounted for 35.3 percent,
standing at 4.06 billion rupees (58 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Loans used to cover 70 percent of the foreign aid commitment in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The current budget year has estimated to mobilize over 26
billion rupees (370 million U.S. dollars) of foreign assistance
with 18 billion rupees (260 million U.S. dollars) of loans and
over 7 billion rupees (100 million U.S. dollars) of grant.
</P>
<P>
Among donors, the World Bank has committed the largest amount
of loan assistance to Nepal, followed by Japan, Norway and the
European Union.

Bangladeshi newspaper The New Nation reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a governmental account, the government borrowed
over 2,200 crore Taka (about 420 million U.S. dollars) in the past
six months, and in the year 1998-1999, the government's loan from
the banking sector was about 1700 crore Taka (about 327 million U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government claimed that the economic growth is being
speeded up by its borrowing from the banking sector, while the
private sector alleged that they are not getting loan facilities
from the banks due to the government's borrowing.
</P>
<P>
IMF Country Representative in Dhaka Ronald Hiks said the amount
of government's borrowing has increased as a result of the
increase in its monetary expenditure.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation in the country may rise due to the government
's borrowing from the banking system, suggesting that measures
should be taken as quickly as possible to overcome weaknesses in
the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other donors also worried about the government's
backturn from the country's trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Hiks suggested that Bangladeshi government look into resolving
the problems of the infrastructure, increase its exports, take an
effective monetary policy and preserve socio-political stability
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Companies Keen to Invest in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese companies are showing
keen interest to invest in the energy sector of Bangladesh in a
big way at a time when interest of international oil companies is
declining in the country, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese delegation consisting of representatives from
leading oil companies, trading companies and the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation, submitted various proposals to the
Petrobangla and Power Development Board of Bangladesh during a
recent visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
The companies are interested in setting up a gas-based
integrated power and fertilizer plant, laying at least 180
kilometers gas pipeline in northern districts of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese companies believed that Bangladesh is in dire need
of large scale investment in the energy sector. But the World Bank
and other donors kept their doors closed for this sector for over
a decade. That is why the Japanese investors along with bank
representatives came to Bangladesh, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Car Price Gap Remains Wide in EU: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that new car prices continued to vary remarkably last year
across the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Britain remained the most expensive EU market, while Finland
and the Netherlands as often had the lowest prices before taxes,
said the EU's executive branch in its latest report on car prices.
</P>
<P>
The average price gap across the region rose to about 35
percent, partly due to the persistent strength of the British
pound against the euro.
</P>
<P>
Within the euro zone, the gap diminished from 20.6 percent to
19.5 percent over the period since the previous report, and to 17.
5 percent if Finland were not taken into account. High taxation
of car purchase in Finland forces most manufacturers to keep
prices before taxes artificially low.
</P>
<P>
Among the euro zone's 11 members, Germany registered the
highest prices for most of the models the study covered.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission noted in its report a positive sign in
Britain that some manufacturers have cut prices, though the effect
has been mitigated by an appreciation of the pound by 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said it is still receiving many complaints from
British consumers, who said they met obstacles in car purchases in
other EU member states.
</P>
<P>
EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement
that the Commission will continue to investigate possible
restrictive practices applied by car manufacturers to impede
consumers from buying cars abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Any evidence of violation of EU competition rules will be
prosecuted immediately," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kemp, Van Exel, Issel Fined by NBA League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The NBA today fined
Cleveland Cavaliers forward Shawn Kemp and Denver Nuggets point
guard Nick Van Exel and coach Dan Issel for their conduct towards
officials this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
Kemp received a $10,000 penalty for his squabble with referee
Leroy Richardson during Saturday's 102-94 loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Kemp had a layup attempt blocked by Dikembe Mutombo midway
through the third quarter and fouled the Hawks' center hard for
his fourth personal. He engaged in a brief shoving match with
Mutombo before getting in the face of Richardson, who quickly
slapped Cleveland's leading scorer with two technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
Kemp took his time leaving the court and hurled a barrage of
verbal insults towards Richardson before play continued. Cavaliers
coach Randy Wittman walked onto the floor and earned an ejection
moments later, but was not fined by the league.
</P>
<P>
Van Exel and Issel, who each received $7,500 fines, reserved
their verbal assaults until after the Nuggets blew a franchise-
record 17-point fourth-quater lead in Saturday's 105-97 overtime
loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Van Exel, who missed the game with a strained groin, earned an
ejection from the bench with three seconds left in the extra
session after yelling at referee Tommy Nunez. Van Exel and Issel
both stormed the court after the final buzzer, arguing with the
officials on their way off the floor.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Check Assassination Order  From Former TNI Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian National Defense
Forces (TNI) is checking and seeking clarification about President
Abdurrahman Wahid's recent allegation that Gen. Wiranto was once
ordered by former TNI commander Gen. Feisal Tanjung to assassinate
him and Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri, a TNI spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI is now trying to check and seek clarification about
the president's statement because it involves the credibility of
one serving and one former state official," Antara News Agency
Tuesday quoted TNI spokesman Maj. Gen. Graito Usodo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid made the allegation when addressing members of the
Indonesian communities in Italy and at the Vatican in Rome on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president said he knew about Tanjung's order from Wiranto
himself who was then chief of the Army Strategic Reserves Command
(Kostrad). Tanjung, according to the president, told Wiranto he
had received an instruction from "higher-up" to "finish off" Wahid
and Megawati.
</P>
<P>
Wahid was at the time general chairman of the Muslim socio-
religious organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), and Megawati, leader
of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P).
</P>
<P>
Graito said there was no plan yet to ask for clarifications
from Wiranto, coordinating minister for political and security
affairs, Feisal Tanjung or President Wahid, adding that he would
report about the case to the TNI Commander Admiral Widodo AS.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, he said, it was better to consider Wahid's
statement "as a warning to the TNI to look inward and be more
careful."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Feisal Tanjung on Monday vehemently denied being
part of an alleged plan to "eliminate" Wahid and Megawati.
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect to the president who is now abroad, I
personally never ordered it. Institutionally the TNI never ordered
it," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Just hours after Feisal's denial, Wahid, arriving in Brussels,
fired a salvo at the retired general. "I'm sticking to my version,
" he said. "I received this information not only from Wiranto but
also from other sources."
</P>
<P>
Wahid then launched a stinging attack on Feisal, which seemed
to accuse him of being behind the July 27, 1996, attack on the PDI-
P headquarters in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The president's assertions on Sunday came as he was vouching
for Wiranto's credibility despite rumors of a showdown between the
two. Wahid has said that Wiranto should resign as coordinating
minister following allegations of his involvement in the violence
in East Timor in September last year.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Commission of Inquiry on Human Right
Violence in East Timor (KPP HAM) said that the former TNI
commander Wiranto was responsible for human rights abuse in the
breakaway province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The riots in East Timor left thousands of East Timorese dead
and made many others take shelter in the neighboring province.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a military coup swept the country following the
president's demand for the resignation of top minister Gen.
Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
However, Wahid on Monday in Brussels, Belgium, stressed his
government's strong bond with the TNI, brushing aside lingering
fears of a military coup.
</P>
<P>
"My visit here means that things are under control. There is a
strong bond between the government and the army," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Drug Victims Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The total number of drug
victims in Indonesia during the last three years has increased by
up to 400 percent, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The number was based on that treated in state hospitals in big
cities, Minister of Health Achmad Sujudi was quoted as saying by
local press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the minister said, drug patients recorded by nurses in
state hospitals in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, totaled 1,779,
but in 1999 the total was 8,170.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is small because those who are treated at private
hospitals and rehabilitation centers are not counted. Also, if
drug addicts who remain at home without being detected are
included, the figure could well be alarming," Sujudi said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Dadang Hawari from the Indonesian
University, drug patients in Jakarta only could be more than 200,
000, many of whom are students in universities, senior and junior
high schools.

<HEADLINE> Israel Attacks Power Stations in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes struck a
guerrilla stronghold and three power stations across Lebanon on
Tuesday in retaliation for Hezbollah guerrillas' killing of five
Israeli soldiers in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The attack left at least seven civilians wounded in the eastern
Lebanese town of Baalbek, and large areas of Lebanon, including
the capital Beirut and the southern cities of Sidon and Tyre, in
darkness, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities said in a statement that a power station
and a Hezbollah "headquarters" were destroyed in Baalbek, a center
of Hezbollah activity.
</P>
<P>
A power station in the eastern part of the Lebanese capital and
another one in Deir Nbouh in the far north were also struck.
</P>
<P>
"The army warns and cautions that a terrorist strike on Israeli
territory will bring about a widening of the confrontation and a
sharp response from Israel," said the Israeli statement.
</P>
<P>
The air attacks came after Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke
down last month as Israel turned down a Damascus demand that
Israel returns the occupied Golan Heights. Last week, the Israeli
cabinet approved air raids on suspected Hezbollah guerrillas bases
in the security zone Israel carved out in 1985 in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday air raids were in direct response to a series of
Hezbollah attacks that killed five Israeli soldiers in two weeks,
including a senior officer in Israeli-supported South Lebanese
Army.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been defending its presence in the zone to protect
its northern territory from guerrilla attacks. Hizbollah
guerrillas have been fighting to drive the Israelis out.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he expects a withdrawal
from the area by July under an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. But he has not said if a unilateral
pullout will come without peace with Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Many Israeli politicians have viewed the recent Hezbollah
attacks as a Syrian attempt to put pressure on Israel. Hezbollah
is supported by Iran, and Syria also has been believed to have
control over it, but Syria has denied.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Rebukes OSCE's Human Rights Report on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Monday criticized
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for
its scathing report on Kosovo's human rights, saying such a report
is a rude political attack against Yugoslavia and an attempt to
justify NATO's 78-day bombing of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a communique submitted to the U.N. and the OSCE Monday, the
Yugoslav government accused the OSCE of fabricating the so-called
"massgraves" and slaughters of Kosovo ethnic Albanians in its
human rights report.
</P>
<P>
All independent investigations by medical examiners had proved
the absence of "the massacres of ethnic Albanians" and the "
humanitarian disasters" in Kosovo before NATO's air campaign,
Tanjug quoted the communique as saying.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE accepted only the statement of ethnic Albanian
refugees in Albania and Macedonia, turning a blind eye to the
reports and material evidences offered by relevant Yugoslav
organizations and ignoring the fact that NATO's bombing killed
thousands of civilians, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The report demonstrated again the OSCE is a tool for NATO to
realize its political goal, the communique added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi Monday urged Austria's new Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel to maintain his country's commitment to the construction
of Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a message congratulating Schuessel on his appointment as new
Austrian chancellor, Prodi said he believed Schuessel will
demonstrate the same commitment as shown by his predecessors to
the construction of Europe and the defense of the "common European
values of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
The European Union's executive president also said he looked
forward to a "fruitful and constructive working relationship" with
Schuessel, who has faced international pressure after agreeing to
form a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party
headed by Joerg Haider, best known for remarks belittling the
crimes of Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 EU counterparts have threatened to cut bilateral
contacts with Austrian ministers, deny Austrian ambassadors'
access to ministers in the EU capitals, and terminate support for
Austrian candidates applying for positions in international bodies.
</P>
<P>
But they noted that bilateral moves should not affect Austria's
participation in the EU institutions, including meetings of EU
ministers and preparatory meetings by ambassadors and experts in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese diplomats revealed Monday that Austria will be
invited to an informal meeting of EU social affairs ministers in
Lisbon on Friday, allowing a Freedom Party minister to meet other
EU counterparts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to pour 39.5
billion yuan (4.76 billion U.S. dollars) into the technical
upgrading of its petrochemical industry, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes a senior official with the State
Administration of Petroleum and chemical Industries as saying that
66 industry projects are expected to benefit from the fund from
the central government.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the fund will be devoted to the sector's large
enterprise groups, including the China Petrochemical Corporation
and the China National Petroleum Corporation, to sharpen their
competitive edges.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a preparation for China's coming entry into
the World Trade Organization, which will expose Chinese companies

"The government's decision will promote the sector's equipment
renovation to produce more high-quality products to compete with
imports," the paper says.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Banks Still Need Painful  Reforms  by Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economic crisis has
already turned into a quick recovery, but the crisis-hit economies
in the region have to make greater efforts this year to restore
their financial system swaddled with enormous problems.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, Asian economies have made remarkable
progress in restructuring their banking system. Waves of bank
mergers, acquisitions and recapitalization have wept across the
region.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, regulators closed 328 financial institutions
since early 1998 when the country started its financial reform
program. In Malaysia, the government announced a plan to force its
59 banks and financial institutions to merge into six large groups
this year.
</P>
<P>
The reform efforts have strengthened the banking positions of
Asian economies. Even in Thailand, one of those hit hard by the
crisis, non-performing loans (NPLs) dropped to 42.3 percent last
November from around 60 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the whole region, loan growth is starting to show signs of
picking up again following a long period of stagnant lending for
almost all banking sectors. In South Korea, commercial banks
showed loan growth last October of 2.8 percent from a month
earlier and 25 percent from a year earlier. In Hong Kong and
Singapore, Goldman Sachs sees a return to 4 percent to 9 percent
loan growth this year.
</P>
<P>
"While this does not reflect the significant continued loan
contraction at non-bank financial sectors, down 42 percent year-on-
year, this is, nevertheless, good news," said a banking analyst of
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
However, these improvements do not mean Asian banks are out of
the woods. On the contrary, enormous problems still remain in the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"Asian economies have not succeeded in restoring their
financial system. What they have done is succeeded in adapting
their economies to the fiscal implosion," said Paul Krugman,
economist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
For Asian banks, how to clean bad debts remain the biggest
obstacle to further restructuring. In many East and Southeast
Asian economies, nonperforming loans still account for 10 percent
to 50 percent of the total bank loans.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, whose banking system is well-managed
compared with its neighbors, bad loans as a percentage of the
total loan portfolio of the 53 commercial banks shot up to 14.5
percent last October, the highest since the Asian financial crisis
broke out in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Asian economies may have to reduce their bad
loan ratio with more public funds, foreign investments, mergers
and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
But bank recapitalization is a tough job for many Asian
countries. In Indonesia, even the central bank needs billions of
dollars for a rescue. In early January, Indonesian officials said
that Bank Indonesia was is the red. Precise figures are still hard
to come by, but the central bank needs at least some 7 billion U.S.
dollars for recapitalization, they said.
</P>
<P>
An International Monetary Fund (IMF) resident representative in
Indonesia said that the government will have to promise to
recapitalize Bank Indonesia, tighten management control and adopt
international accounting practices in order to continue receiving
IMF aid.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, although the central bank requires thrift
banks to meet the 325 million peso (about 8 million U.S. dollars)
minimum capital requirement by the end of last year, about 40
percent of them are still capital-deficient.
</P>
<P>
Shocked by the slow reform process in the region, the World
Bank warned recently that Asian countries that only introduces
cosmetic reform to their banking systems risk plunging back into
crisis with only the slightest outside shock.
</P>
<P>
"Any external shock, whether it be a slowing down of the U.S.
economy or Japan reversing to slow growth, would send back into
difficulties those economies which remain vulnerable," said
Mashiro Kawai, World Bank's chief economist for East Asia and the
Pacific, last month.
</P>
<P>
Many economists also believe that if Asian countries want to
see their growth sustained, they must speed up the banking reform
process.

<HEADLINE> Car Price Gap Remains Wide in EU: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that new car prices continue to vary remarkably last year
across the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Britain remained the most expensive EU market, while Finland
and the Netherlands often had the lowest prices before taxes, said
the EU's executive branch in its latest report on car prices.
</P>
<P>
The average price gap across the region rose to about 35
percent, partly due to the persistent strength of the British
pound against the euro.
</P>
<P>
Within the euro zone, the gap diminished from 20.6 percent to
19.5 percent over the period since the previous report, and to 17.
5 percent if Finland were not taken into account. High taxation on
cars forces most Finnish manufacturers to keep prices before taxes
artificially low.
</P>
<P>
Among the euro zone's 11 members, Germany registered the
highest prices for most of the models the study covered.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission noted in its report a positive sign in
Britain that some manufacturers have cut prices, though the effect
has been mitigated by an appreciation of the pound by 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said it is still receiving many complaints from
British consumers, who said they met obstacles in car purchases in
other EU member states.
</P>
<P>
EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement
that the Commission will continue to investigate possible
restrictive practices applied by car manufacturers to impede
consumers from buying cars abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Any evidence of violation of EU competition rules will be
prosecuted immediately," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges U.N. Mission to Stop Terrorism in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia demanded on Monday
the U.N. special mission and NATO-led peacekeeping force (KFOR) in
Kosovo take immediate steps to end ethnic Albanian separatists'
terrorist activities in the ethnically troubled province.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Yugoslav Vice Foreign Minister Nebojssa
Vujovich urged the KFOR and U.N. mission to implement as soon as
possible their commitment and responsibility in accordance with
the U.N. Security Council's Resolution 1244 and the military
agreement, which was signed between Yugoslavia and NATO at the end
of the western alliance's bombing of Yugoslavia last June, and
deter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Vujovich noted that ethnic Albanian terrorists have conducted a
spate of terrorist activities in Kosovo right in the face of the U.
N. mission and the peacekeepers, worsening the situation in the
province.
</P>
<P>
After last Wednesday's attack on a coach full of Serbs, which
killed five and injured many, Albanian separatists and terrorists
created a disturbance recently in a Serb quarter in Mitrovich,
Kosovo, in an attempt to drive the Serbs out and occupy their
homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister also condemned the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's plan to perform a war game in Kosovo, an
inalienable part of Yugoslavia, as sabre-rattling and political
suppression of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under signed international treaties, the task of
the peacekeepers, which entered Kosovo last June to maintain
security and peace, is to protect all the residents in the
province rather than demonstrate their military deterrence.

<HEADLINE> Resigned Rebel-turned Sudanese Leader Aims at Comeback: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Rebel-turned South Sudan leader
Riefk Mashar Teny-Dhurgon, who resigned from government posts
recently, is attempting to reunite his rebel forces, a pro-
government South Sudan military commander said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commander and Chief of Staff of South Sudanese Defense Forces
(SSDF) General Aliga Houn told reporters that he had instructed his
troops to maintain their positions and repel any attacks against
the territorial safety of the homeland.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his commitment to coordination and work with the
Sudanese government to observe the cease fire and remove all
obstacles facing the peace agreement reached between the government
and southern factions, including Mashar's, in April, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mashar had resigned from his posts as Assistant President and
Chairman of the Coordination Council -- the governing body in South
Sudan, as well as leader of the United Democratic Salvation Front
(UDSF), but retained his leadership of the SSDF.
</P>
<P>
He is trying to reorganize his troops and coordinate with the
rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang.
They will target the oil-rich Wehda (unity) province in southern
Sudan, local daily Akhbar Al-Yom on Tuesday quoted Houn as saying.
</P>
<P>
Machar was previously No. 2 figure in the SPLA, which has been
fighting a 16-year-old independence war in the Christian and
animist-populated south Sudan from the Islamic government in the
north. He switched to the government side in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Houn said that Mashar did not consult his allies before
resigning from his office.
</P>
<P>
Houn vowed to establish a strong command of the SSDF to protect
the southern forces from possible secession, adding that he was
trying to reunite all southern forces.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA leaders in Nairobi, Kenya, mediated between Mashar and
16 leaders of his troops who seceded before his resignation. The
rebel movement threatened an eminent military attacks in Wehda
province where Higlig oil field is located.
</P>
<P>
Mashar escaped an attempt on his life on Sunday after a clash
between his troops and a splinter faction led by Fawlino Matit in
east Bantew, Wehda province. He has sought refuge with the Garang
forces near the Kenyan borders.

<HEADLINE> Third Round Proximity Talks on Cyprus to Start in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's Special Adviser on Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, has announced
that the third round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus
will start on May 23 in New York, Cyprus News Agency reported
Tuesday from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second round of the proximity talks Tuesday,
which began in Geneva on January 31, de Soto told reporters that
various issues were addressed "in an exploratory way."
</P>
<P>
He added that the aim of the current stage of the process is "to
prepare the ground for meaningful negotiations leading to a
comprehensive settlement."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the United Nations has been trying to bring the two
sides to negotiate for reunification through a bicommunal, bizonal
settlement. But no tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-brokered proximity talks started in the U.N.
headquarters in New York in December, during which the two sides
talked through U.N. officials shuttling between them. The talks
were aimed to finally bring the two sides to face-to-face
negotiations to reach a solution in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
De Soto said that the two sides worked with the U.N. "in a
constructive manner in exploring in greater depth the range of
issues that are before them."
</P>
<P>
He added that there are "factors external to Cyprus, such as
improved relations between Turkey and Greece which dig ground for
hope."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said he will visit Cyprus next month to be
briefed by UNFICYP, the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, on the
situation there.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of learning to do on the ground," said de Soto.

<HEADLINE> Baku-Ceyhan Pipeline Talks to Continue In Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Talks on the Baku-Ceyhan oil
pipeline project will resume in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku
next week, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new round of talks will continue to focus on the transit fee
for the Georgian section of the over 1,000-kilometer pipeline,
according to senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
"Georgia is erecting a barrier, not only on the oil pipeline,
but also on the gas project with Turkmenistan," an unidentified
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Energy officials of Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan failed to
finalize the agreement on an oil pipeline linking Baku and Turkey's
Mediterranean port city of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Ambassador to Ankara Tariel Lebanidze said at a press
conference last week that his country hoped that a more suitable
transit fee will be put forward for discussion.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the summit of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe in Istanbul last November, leaders of the
Caspian region and the United States signed agreements on the
establishment of the trans-Caspian energy corridor, which,
conspicuously, will bypass Russia and Iran.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Says Oil Price Surge Poses Uncertainty to World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, retiring
as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
after 13 years, Tuesday declared the world economy is in generally
good shape, but rising oil prices pose a considerable uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
In a farewell news conference held at the IMF headquarters in
Washington, the 66-year-old Frenchman discussed his successes and
failures in dealing with global financial crises that hit Asia,
Russia and Latin America and in making the 182-nation organization
more open and accountable.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to be leaving as we see the world economy exceeding
all forecasts for growth," said Camdessus, whose last day as
managing director is next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has arranged multibillion dollar rescue packages for
crisis-hit countries starting with Mexico in 1994. It has also
helped countries in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
make a sometimes successful transition to become market economies.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the brightening global economic outlook,
Camdessus said "one of the question marks of this very moment" is
the threat posed by oil prices that have been edging toward 30 U.S.
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
He said oil industry analysts are forecasting a price decline,
but "no one can be sure. In this context I approve the prudence of
central banks in the world that want to take the necessary steps"
to contain inflation by raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus will be replaced temporarily by his deputy, Stanley
Fischer, an American. The United States and the other major
industrialized nations have been unable so far to agree on a
permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
By unwritten rule, a European heads the IMF and an American
leads the World Bank, its sister lending institution.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Interior and
Justice Minister  Winston Spadafora said Tuesday that Panama has
asked the United States for helicopters and radars to fight drug
traffic coming from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with these instruments the security
Panamanian security forces will be in conditions to intercept
airplanes used by drug-traffickers to ship drugs to Europe and
United States.
</P>
<P>
Spadafora also pointed out that with the United States'
assistance the Panamanian police will give specialized training to
both the border forces and the forces watching the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Simon Ferro and the Panamanian Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Aleman recently signed an accord of logistic
attendance to fight drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
As a par of this accord United States will deliver to the
Panamanian government two ships and fire arms as well as an
undetermined number of motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In spite that this accord was criticized for some of the
Panamanian opposition, Spadafora guaranteed that this accord helps
to consolidate Panamanian democracy and security.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Revolutionary Party opponent (PRD), from ex-
president Ernesto Perez Balladares, considers that the
negotiations in security matters with the United States hurt the
Panamanian sovereignty.

equivalent to 38 percent of Uganda's total NPV debt outstanding at
the end-June 1999. This is expected to translate into debt service
relief over time of about 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This amount is in addition to the 650 million dollars (347
million dollars in NPV terms) of relief provided in April 1998
under the original HIPC Initiative. Total debt service relief
under the original and enhanced HIPC frameworks will yield
approximately 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the IDA and the IMF also agreed to support
Bolivia's eligibility for a debt reduction package under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative.
</P>
<P>
In NPV terms, total relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
from all of Bolivia's creditors would amount to 854 million
dollars, equivalent to around 30 percent of total debt outstanding
at the end of 1998. This is expected to translate into debt
service relief over time of close to 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This amount is in addition to the approximately 760 million
dollars (448 million dollars in NPV terms) of relief provided one
year ago under the original HIPC Initiative. In all, the NPV of
Bolivia's external public debt is estimated to be reduced by 35
percent under the original and enhanced HIPC Initiative, which is
on top of 17 percent debt reduction already provided under
traditional debt relief mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative was launched by the World Bank and the IMF
in 1996 as the first comprehensive effort to eliminate
unsustainable debt in the world's poorest, most heavily indebted
countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Households with Internet Access to Double in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. households with
Internet access will nearly double to 90 million by the end of
2004, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet households increased from 14.9 million
in 1995 to 46.5 million today, said the report from the Strategis
Group, a U.S. market research and consulting firm. Internet
penetration of businesses reached 6.3 million in 1999 and will
rise to 8.3 million by 2004. Strategis forecasts a combined
residential and business total of 171 million Internet users in
the United States in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"With economic prosperity, heavy investment, and the pace of
Internet innovation," the report said, "it is no wonder that we
have seen this rate of growth." While the projected growth of
households with Internet access seems extreme, according to the
research firm, it is quite comparable to the pace of adoption for
other major communications/entertainment media. For instance,
television usage among U.S. households grew from 9 percent to 87
percent in the 1950s. Radio jumped from 10 percent of households
to about 70 percent from 1925 to 1935 in the midst of the country'
s depression.
</P>
<P>
Internet service providers (ISPs) will benefit from the
investment in content, services and broadband capabilities,
Strategis said. Average monthly access revenues from residential
customers fell last year to 17.94 U.S. dollars. "The decline in
average residential service revenues reveals the growing, but
limited, pressure of free ISPs and other low-cost providers on the
market," the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report added, total business and residential
access revenues continue to rise and will grow more than 70
percent by the end of 2003. Access fees paid to ISPs are expected
to total 30.2 billion dollars by 2003, compared with 17.7 billion
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the access industry in the United States continues
to see growth in the number of providers. At the end of 1999, the
U.S. was served by more than 7,000 ISPs, driven by a combination
of heightened demand and relatively low barriers to entry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Political Parties Urged to Restrain Followers From Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
Tuesday issued a strong warning to political parties to restrain
their followers from resorting to violence ahead of this weekend's
referendum on the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa told a press
conference in Harare that his ministry would revoke all relevant
sections of the Law and Order Maintenance Act to ensure all
violators of the order be punished.
</P>
<P>
"If the political parties have no control over their
supporters, we will find a way of dealing them," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Zimbabwe Republic Police Public Order Unit will now be
deployed to deal with those elements of political parties which
had decided to enhance their political campaigns through
intimidation, violence and destruction of property belonging to
their opposition," he said.
</P>
<P>
The interruption of lawful meetings or rallies by parties, the
Constitutional Commission and others would no longer be tolerated,
Dabengwa noted.
</P>
<P>
He said organizers of such meetings or rallies should notify
the police to ensure that their meetings were not interrupted.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry will not sit back and watch chaos become the
order of the day towards and during the forthcoming referendum and
the 2000 elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks since the declaration of the date of
the referendum and the announcement of the dates for the 2000
parliamentary elections, some political parties had a tendency to
resort to violence, the minister pointed out.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia Flexible on Arms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Albright said unlike Russian politicians she has met in the past,
Putin did not dispute the existence of the new threats which the
United States has cited as justification for a national defense
against incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. planned to establish a national anti-missile defense
system, a move which would violate the ABM treaty signed between
Moscow and Washington in 1972. So Washington seeks to change the
treaty while Moscow opposes any changes.
</P>
<P>
"What I found interesting was that he did not deny the fact
that there were new threats and that there needed to be a way to
deal with them," she told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
"I did not find him in a total nyet (no) mode ... and I felt
that there was a way that we could work a common assessment of the
new threats," she added.
</P>
<P>
"In previous conversations that I have had, many of the
Russians had denied the existing of any new threats and felt that
this was an American plan to only deal with trying to limit their
strategic deterrence," she said.
</P>
<P>
"He did not say 'There are no threats. You're only after us.'
And so, in that regard, I found him more open-minded ...more open-
minded than I had been led to believe," she added.
</P>
<P>
Putin was named the acting president early this year when
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin stepped down.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise on Rising Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. government report on
rising productivity in the fourth quarter pushed the Nasdaq index
to the new record again while lifting the Dow industrials from
falling Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At close of the session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index rose 105.73 at 4,427.50, surpassing the record closing high
of 4,321.77 set Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 51.81 at 10,957.60, bouncing back from
falling in the two previous tradings and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 17.51 at 1,441.75.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Labor Department reported that
worker's productivity rose at 5 percent annual rate in the final
quarter of 1999, the strongest increase since the fourth quarter
of 1982. The report convinced investors that inflation remains
under control  because rising productivity offered a potential
buffer against inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the report would probably not prevent the Federal
Reserve from raising interest rates next month but the forthcoming
rate hike would not derail the stock market and the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since last June
in efforts to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 5.20 at 629.04 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 1.26 at 885.34. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 5.10 at 537.49.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,600 up, 1,452 down and 474

<HEADLINE> Internet Usage by U.S. Travelers Continue to Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. online
travelers has grown 190 percent from 29 million in 1996 to 85
million in 1999, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report from the Travel Industry Association (TIA) of the
United States is based on a telephone survey conducted among a
representative sample of 1,200 U.S. adults in August 1999. "The
correlation between the online population and travel is so strong
that almost all Internet users are also travelers with 93 percent
of Internet users (91 million U.S. adults) responding that they
took at least one trip of 100 miles or more, one-way, away from
home in 1999," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Online travel planning has surged in recent years, according to
TIA, with 52.2 million online travelers using the Internet for
this purpose in 1999, an increase of 54 percent from 1998. In fact,
Internet travel planning has increased a remarkable 1,500 percent
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Online bookings have increased as well, with 32 percent of
online travel planners making online reservations. This translates
to 16.5 million online travelers, up 146 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Travelers who make reservations for travel products over the
Internet can do so from a number of different types of sites. But
TIA said that the most popular type of sites used to book travel
are company sites that sell directly from airlines, hotels, rental
car or package tour companies. In fact, over one-half of travel
bookers used such company sites.
</P>
<P>
Although many U.S. travelers use the Internet to do travel
planning, the report said, most are still hesitant to purchase
their travel products online. In fact, 69 percent of online
travelers "look" but don't "book" online.
</P>
<P>
Security and customer service issues are the top reasons online
travel planners do not book travel online, according to the survey.
Other reasons for not making reservations on the Internet include:
rather talk to a live person or need absolute confirmation, the
Internet is too complicated or confusing, and the Internet did not
give the best deals.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Back N.Irish Direct Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Emergency moves paving the way
towards reimposing direct rule on Northern Ireland were
overwhelmingly approved by MPs in the British House of Commons on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MPs voted by 352 to 11, a government majority of 341, to
give a second reading to the Northern Ireland Bill.
</P>
<P>
The vote came as Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams issued a stark
warning that he was ready to walk away from the peace process if
there is a return to direct rule.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is now due to clear its remaining Commons
stages on Tuesday night before moving to the House of Lords and
becoming law by Friday.
</P>
<P>
MPs were told by Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson
that the Good Friday Agreement was the nearest thing to a "perfect
settlement", but that reimposing direct rule from London may be
the only way to save it.
</P>
<P>
Opening the debate on legislation which would suspend the
agreement's power-sharing assembly, Mandelson said the deal was in
danger of unraveling over the paramilitary arms decommissioning
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government legislation came after Adams warned that the
Good Friday Agreement was "the only show in town" - and that
Republicans were doing everything possible to deliver the
decommissioning of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
Adams also warned that he would review his position as Sinn
Fein leader if the assembly is suspended at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I don't intend to spend the rest of my life trying to
shore up a process that is in perpetual crisis."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandelson told the MPs the onus was on the
Republican movement to deliver disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"If violence is a thing of the past, why cannot the weapons of
violence be put permanently beyond use?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is in no-one's interest that these fragile institutions be
allowed to shatter."
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said that those who considered the Good Friday
Agreement flawed were wrong.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to scrap it and negotiate from scratch, what we
would end up with would be very similar to this agreement."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, After talks with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, Adams told a press conference in the Foreign Press
Association that the arms issues can be resolved and there was
still a chance to"avert disaster".
</P>
<P>
Adams said that the Republican movement accepted its
obligations to persuade the IRA to disarm - but it could only take
place as part of the wider settlement.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting with Blair was "focused, serious and useful
" and he "applauded and commended the government's role".
</P>
<P>
But Mr Adams added: "It is not just up to us to resolve this.
This can only be resolved by building confidence among everyone."
</P>
<P>
A suspension of the assembly is designed to prevent the first
minister and leader of the Ulster Unionists, David Trimble, from
resigning.
</P>
<P>
Trimble pledged to his party last year that he would quit if
the IRA had not started decommissioning its arsenal by the end of
January, saying that there cannot be an "armed peace".
</P>
<P>
If the legislation clears the parliament, Mandelson will be
able to suspend the assembly before Saturday's crucial meeting of
the ruling council of the Ulster Unionist Party.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wireless Device Users Total 7 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A slew of wireless carriers
introduced wireless data services in the United States in 1999 and
the onslaught is expected to continue in 2000, U.S. market
research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of wireless device users with access to
inbound and outbound information services and Internet messaging
will increase from 7.4 million in 1999 to 61.5 million by 2003 in
the United States, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
Many users, however, will not know they are using the Internet
over their wireless devices, IDC said, because the underlying
infrastructure that makes this possible is invisible to them.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, two major occurrences pushed the wireless
Internet market forward in 1999: Microsoft's involvement with the
wireless application protocol (WAP) forum and the introduction of
mobile-specific portals. WAP is a specification that provides easy,
secure access to relevant Internet/intranet information and other
services through mobile devices in a cost-effective manner.
</P>
<P>
Currently, IDC said, the portals' involvement with wireless
carriers is a market differentiator. However, because the
contracts are nonexclusive, carriers will soon have to find
another way to differentiate themselves. IDC believes the next
differentiator will be location information and its use.

LIMA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori opened Tuesday the 8th Regional Conference for the Latin
American and the Caribbean Women.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech , Fujimori said that the subject of
women is a subject of the future. "It is no conceivable neither in
the region nor in the world to continue ignoring women's presence
in the building of our society's future", said Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Minister, director of the national woman services,
Maria Josefina Bilbao, expressed in her speech concern about the
scarce conditions in which women of this region have to develop

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes to Improve Ties with Iran -- Albright  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have welcomed President Khatami's calls for people-to-
people dialogue, his verbal condemnation of terrorism and his
regret over the 1979 hostage episode. The upcoming parliamentary
elections could provide evidence that the trend towards openness
is gathering speed," she said.
</P>
<P>
After the election in 1997 of President Mohammad Khatami, the
United States hoped for a rapprochement with its former ally.
</P>
<P>
In one gesture toward Iran recently, the United States
condemned on Monday the mortar attack near the presidential palace
in Teheran and offered its sympathies for the victims.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Americanism remains a popular theme in Iran. Supreme
leader Ayatohlah Ali Khamenei said last week that Iranians would
deliver a "slap in the mouth" of the United States by voting in
large numbers in the parliamentary elections on February 18.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants European Allies to Increase Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Europeans must also bear a fair share of that
responsibility, and they have yet to do so," Cohen told the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
Cohen complained that the European countries do not have "
adequate police force," adding that about 6000 European troops
were required during the Kosovo war last year while the European
countries contribute only 1900.
</P>
<P>
"They have not committed either the manpower or the money that
would be necessary to get an adequate police force on the ground
so that our forces won't find themselves in the position of having
to carry out such activities," Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel debated a defense budget package of 305.4
billion U.S. dollars proposed by the Clinton administration for
the fiscal year of 2001 beginning this October 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget is 16.5 billion U.S. dollars higher than the current
one and is the second real increase in U.S. defense spending since
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"I come to you to ask you for additional funding. You will, in
all probability, support that, if not more," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"But then you look across the Atlantic and you look at their
budgets and they're cutting their budgets. And I have tried to
convey to our European friends that ultimately that has a
political consequence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen asked the European countries to spend more. "So it's a
message that needs to be repeated from the very highest levels...
They can't spend any less, they should spend more."
</P>
<P>
The secretary also said the European allies should reform their
military forces. "They have to reform the way in which they shape
their forces. They have to move away from having forces that are
designed to contend against a Soviet invasion across a central
front."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the hearing, Committee Chairman John Warner said
the Clinton administration was unlikely to get approval for 2.1
billion U.S. dollars in funds for those U.S. peacekeeping troops
in Kosovo and Bosnia this year unless Europe boosted its support
there.
</P>
<P>
"The United States simply cannot pull, in terms of dollar
commitment, the sole oar in this situation," Warner said. "It is
primarily a European situation and they have got to live up to
commitments."
