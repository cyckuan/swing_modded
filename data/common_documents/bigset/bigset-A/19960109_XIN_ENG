<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President On Internal policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today said his government would endeavor to make it clear to
Tanzanians and their external friends of its commitment to
serious steps towards creation of a self-reliant and sustainable
economy based on internal resources.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the State House said that in a
discussion with the visiting Swedish Minister for International
Co-operation, Mr. Pierre Schori, who called on him at the state
house this evening, President Mkapa said he believed that within
a short time Tanzanian nationals as well as external friends
would have understood clearly the path his government had decided
to take in line with his ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM)
election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The path he referred to entailed serious steps towards
efficient tax collection through new measures to be instituted by
the revenue authority which was expected to be full operational
this year.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, President Mkapa said, civic education to
inculcate the virtue of paying taxes as part of people's
obligation to the nation, would go along with the new tax
measures in order to encourage voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
Other measures which President Mkapa said his government had
decided to embark upon included instilling a new sense of
discipline within the public sector so as to plug the loopholes
for corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mkapa insisted that all political parties in the
country should work together to evolve a new political culture of
tolerance and cooperation in the service of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said peace and tranquillity were essential pre-requisites
for development in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Journalists Protest against Murder of Colleague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Journalists in Istanbul today
marched to the governor's office with a black wreath to protest
against the alleged killing by police of a leftist newspaper
reporter.
</P>
<P>
Metin Goktepe, the reporter who had served for Turkish daily
Evrensel, was found dead this morning in Eyup district of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old journalist was reportedly detained Monday by
police, who barred local reporters from covering the funerals of
two prison inmates killed in the recent rioting.
</P>
<P>
Murat Inceoglu, a reporter who covered the prisoners' funeral
with Goktepe, said police arrested his colleague when they were
trying to come to the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Inceoglu said both he and the killed reporter had been
threatened by police with death.
</P>
<P>
Levent Tuzel, chairman of the Contemporary Lawyers Group
(CHD), told local televisions that he saw severe head wounds on
the corpse at the city's central morgue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution confirmed Goktepe's arrest, but
claimed that he was released Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists who learned the killing of Goktepe, called
the incident "an attack against democracy" and demanded the
Interior Ministry investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Turgut Kazan, chairman of the Istanbul Bar Association, said the
situation was horrendous.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see the danger. Those responsible must be
punished. We have to stop all this and keep the police
within the law," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopia Fights Coffee Price Slide In World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's ambitious coffee
export plans for 1996 have been met with the slide of coffee
prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The eastern African country was set to earn 330 million U.S.
dollars with its planned export of 85,000 tons of coffee in the
1995/1996 financial year, according to a report released by the
Ethiopian coffee authority here today.
</P>
<P>
"However, the decline in coffee price in the world market
during last year made it difficult to meet the target," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
As a major coffee producing and export country in the world,
Ethiopia exported 78,420 tons of coffee and earned over 300
million U.S. dollars in the last financial year.
</P>
<P>
But Ethiopia, as one of the world's four countries known for
their consumption of coffee, would have to reduce domestic use of
coffee in an effort to compensate price fall in the world market
this year.
</P>
<P>
Although coffee is the main export of the country, Ethiopia
exports only half of its total coffee production every year, with
another half of its production for local consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government will also have to double its coffee
production and improve the quality in the new year.
</P>
<P>
As the country's biggest foreign currency earner, coffee
accounts for 60 percent of Ethiopia's export and 10 percent of
government revenue. About 25 percent of the country's
population are engaged in coffee production and trade.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Release of Frozen Assets to Cover Pilgrimage Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today demanded the release
of a sum of 50 million U.S. dollars of assets frozen in the
countries of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to
cover expenses of Iraqis' pilgrimage to Mecca and the cost of
printing the holy Qur'an.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf made the request
in letters to the secretaries general of the United Nations, the
Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi people are facing great difficulties
that have denied their right to perform their pilgrimage to Mecca,
which is one of the five basic duties for Moslems.
</P>
<P>
It is also a basic human right in the Universal Declaration of
human Rights, the Arab League Charter and the U.N. Charter, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq last year tried to use some of its frozen
assets abroad but its legitimate demands faced unjust rejection by
representatives of two states to the Sanctions Committee which he
did not specify.
</P>
<P>
The rejection was not based on any Security Council
resolution, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that tens of thousands of Iraqis intend to
perform the pilgrimage to Mecca this year which is a wish highly
respected by the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Any rejection by the Sanctions Committee of Iraq's demand to
release the assets would amount to a deliberated denial of the Iraqi
people's right to the Holy Site, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Finance Human Rights Observers in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and European Union (EU)
representatives signed today an initial financing agreement to
deploy human rights observers in Burundi shortly.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the EU pledged to provide about 518,000
U.S. dollars to finance the deployment of the first group of five
observers in Burundi's capital city of Bujumbura for a period of
three and a half months.
</P>
<P>
Under a program of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, up
to 35 observers would be sent first to Bujumbura and then
gradually throughout the country. The High Commissioner has been
seeking voluntary contributions to fund the operation, whose total
cost in 1996 is expected to reach 6.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the office of the High Commissioner put it, the main
objectives of the human rights mission will be the preventing and
limiting human rights violations and interethnic violence in
Burundi. The observers are mandated to bring cases of violations
to the attention of the authorities and recommand remedial action.
</P>
<P>
The observers are also expected to make efforts to foster a
climate of tolerance among all ethnic groups of the Burundese
population in a bid to provide preconditions for the return of
refugees to their home.

<HEADLINE> PNA May Ask Israel to Extradite Suspected Assassin of  Ayyash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) may ask Israel to extradite Kamal Hamad, suspected
of being involved in the murder of Hamas activist Yihye Ayyash,
Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police claimed that it was Hamad, a Palestinian
building contractor in the Gaza Strip, who gave Ayyash the
booby-trapped mobile phone before it exploded.
</P>
<P>
The police today sealed off Hamad's house in Gaza, while PNA
Attorney General Khalid Al-Qidrah issued a warrant for the arrest
of Hamad, who has reportedly fled to Israel soon after Ayyash's
death last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, known as "the engineer," was blown up by a refitted
mobile phone in Beit Lahya, north of Gaza city, when he was
talking to his father on the phone.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas activist, who got his nickname because of his
bomb-making skills, had been accused by Israel of masterminding a
series of suicide bombing attacks, which at least killed 60
Israelis and wounded more than 300.
</P>
<P>
Capturing Ayyash had been a top priority of the General
Security Services (GSS), but he managed to escape GSS arrest at
the last minute at least on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Ayyash's death, Hamas blamed the GSS for
being behind the murder, and threatened to launch revenge attacks
on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
The PNA appointed a special committee Monday to investigate
into the assassination, and several Palestinians from the Gaza
Strip have been detained on suspicion of involvement in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said the murder of Ayyash was personally
overseen by the GSS chief, who can only be identified as "K."
</P>
<P>
The GSS chief resigned Monday night for failing to
protect late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who was
assassinated by a Jewish extremist in Tel Aviv on November 4.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that Hamad had been a long time
informer for the GSS, and that he fled to Israel soon
after Ayyash's assassination, while others said he phoned his
sister on the same day, saying he was "on his way to the
U.S."

<HEADLINE> S.Africa To Set Up Investment Promotion Centre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has approved the establishment of a national agency to
promote investment, Trade and Industry Director-General Zavareh
Rustomjee announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Rustomjee said the non-profit national
investment promotion agency, proposed by the trade and industry
department, has been approved by the cabinet, provincial economic
departments and parties in the national economic development and
labour council.
</P>
<P>
The current investment promotion in South Africa is fragmented
with little emphasis on South Africa as an investment
destination, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"more effort is needed to exploit investment opportunities in
South Africa for new investment, particularly investment that
will create new employment opportunities," added the statement.

<HEADLINE> Britain Willing To Consider Support To Zimbabwe's Land Redistribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
willing to reconsider providing aid for Zimbabwe's land
redistribution if the Zimbabwean government spells out its needs
and the new strategies to be adopted after the failure of the
first resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by new British High Commissioner to Zimbabwe
Martin Williams at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
''It's for the Zimbabwean government to decide what its
priorities are. We need something spelt out and then we consider
what strategies are being proposed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Land redistribution, an emotionally-charged issue in Zimbabwe
because the minority white community owns disproportionately more
land, has taken centre stage again in the run-up to the
presidential elections in March.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ZANU PF Party recently endorsed President Robert
Mugabe's call for the government to compulsorily acquire more
land, whether or not the government had money to compensate the
farmers.
</P>
<P>
At independence the British government pledged pounds sterling
20 million for the purchase of commercial farms for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
However, with most of the money disbursed, the project was
stopped in 1988 after the resettlement of over 50,000 families.
</P>
<P>
Williams said although the British government recognised the
importance of the land issue, it would only consider the
priorities of the Zimbabwean government when negotiating
bilateral aid. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU Calls on Israel to Allow Free Movement of Palestinian Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The head of the European
Union Electoral Unit, Carl Lidbom, today called on Israel to
allow free movements of the Palestinian candidates in their
campaign prior to the scheduled January 20 elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Foreign Press Association at a press
conference in east Jerusalem, Lidbom, former Swedish Justice
Minister, said voters must be allowed an unimpeded access to
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must give necessary permits to allow candidates and
their supporters to travel in their election campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that now that Israel allows the elections, it
must also allow people to campaign, to travel around, and to
cross borders.
</P>
<P>
It might be, he said, that Israelis are worried about security,
but they have to make necessary exceptions, which are necessary
to allow elections.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 EU observers are now deployed in the West Bank and
Gaza monitoring the election process. An additional 100 are
expected here next week. The EU team will also coordinate
activities with 350 observers from non-EU states and various
non-governmental organizations all over the world that sent
observers.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, the EU Electoral Unit issued a statement
outlining a number of irregularities concerning the election
campaign. Lidbom said that some of these have already been
addressed although other problems still exist, particularly
concerning the freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
The EU observers have been in contact with both Israel and the
Palestinian Authority over special arrangements on the polling
day for east Jerusalem and Hebron, which could be problematic.
Israeli troops will most likely withdraw from all the Hebron
neighborhoods that day except for the areas of Jewish
settlements.

CAIRO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri met here today with Israeli Minister of Energy Gonen
Segev, who is currently visiting Egypt for talks on promoting
bilateral cooperation in the field of oil.
</P>
<P>
Hamdy el-Banbi, Egypt's minister of oil, attended the meeting
between Ganzouri and Segev.
</P>
<P>
The visit is mainly aimed at reviewing with Egyptian officials
the negotiations for a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline
linking Egypt and Israel, local press reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, through which Egypt is to export some 250 million
cubic feet of gas per day to Israel, would stretch some 250
kilometers across the north of Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have said that they hope to conclude the deal by the
end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel now imports 2 million tons of crude oil from Egypt
annually, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister today also met with Egyptian Minister of

<HEADLINE> Turkish Welfare Party Leader Asked to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel this afternoon assigned Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the
Islamist Welfare Party (RP), which came first at the December 24
general elections, to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the president's office said Demirel made
the nomination following today's consultation with all party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Welfare Party won 158 seats in the 550-member
parliament, but still far from the majority of 276 required to form
a one-party government.
</P>
<P>
During the five hour separate meetings, said the statement, no
party leader put forward a solution which would obtain a
confidence vote from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"With the situation determined, the president assigned deputy
from Konya Province, Necmettin Erbakan, chairman of the Welfare
Party which has the most seats in the parliament, to form the
government," the statement concluded.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan confirmed the nomination after a 20 minute-meeting
with President Demirel. He added that the president put no deadline
for his efforts to form the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he would first consult the party's decision making
bodies before starting contacts with other political parties for
possible coalition formation.
</P>
<P>
If Erbakan fails, President Demirel will likely ask either
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of the True Path Party or Mesut Yilmaz
of the Motherland Party to try. A deadlock could lead to elections
again.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Growth Forecast in UK Consumer Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Growth in consumer spending in
Britain in the second half of this year will be the strongest
since 1987, a leading independent forecaster said today.
</P>
<P>
The Ernst &AMP; Young Item Club, one of Britain's most respected
forecasting groups, said the economy would grow slowly in the
first half of 1996 but it would then accelerate because of a
strong recovery in consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
This outlook supports the projection by Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, in the last budget. He forecast that
strong growth in consumers' expenditure, of about 3.5 percent this
year, will underpin fast economic growth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Early signs that the pick-up in consumer activity may already
have begun also emerged today. The latest survey by the British
Retail Consortium showed that the amount of money spent in the
high street in December was 4.3 percent up on a year earlier, the
largest rise since April 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Item Club said consumer confidence would be bolstered by
tax cuts, the National Grid rebate for electricity customers, and
by windfalls from building society sales and from maturing
tax-exempt special savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
It forecast gross domestic product to grow by 2.5 percent this
year. It expects consumer spending to grow at an annual rate of
3.5 percent in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
But it believes there are still risks to economic growth,
especially if the UK's trading partners grow slowly. It also sees
dangers of inflation if a consumer spending boom leads to high
wage growth.

LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
asked his Vice President, Kow Arkaah, to step down from office
during a ceremony to celebrate the administration's third
anniversary on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings was quoted today by a report as asking, "how can a
man who has formed an alliance with our opposition parties
continue to be the vice president of this government?"
</P>
<P>
"He insists he can still sit in at cabinet meetings because
the constitution says so. He tends to subvert the government from
within," Rawlings noted.
</P>
<P>
Arkaah was sitting beside his wife, Marian, and Rawlings and
his wife, Nanakonadu, at the three-hour ceremony, during which
the president took a military salute from 120 officers and 2,100
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The parade was watched by more than 15,000 people including
diplomats.
</P>

It was alleged last week that there was a dispute and clash
between Rawlings and Arkaah at a cabinet meeting last month.

<HEADLINE> Social Workers Rise Sharply in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Social work has become the
fastest-growing occupation in Britain with battalions of community
care workers, residential care assistants and home helps recruited
to look after an ageing population.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the Central Statistics Office today
showed the number of social workers rose by nearly 25 percent from
794,000 in 1990 to 964,000 last year, almost entirely because of
the expansion in care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
That increased number is four times as much as that of those
serving in the Armed Forces, which stands at 238,000 now.
</P>
<P>
The figures reflect a deep-seated change within British
society. Families no longer look after the old people at home but
would rather have them looked after in residential homes, both
public and private.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are now nine million people aged
between 50 and 64 in Britain who are entitled to collect pensions.
Their ranks will be swelled in the decades of the next century as
the post-war "baby boomers" reach pensionable age.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the number working in the construnction
industry has fallen from 1,116,000 in 1990 to 818,000 last year,
and the number employed in manufacturing from 4,605,000 to
3,480,000, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing industry, the mainstay of the country's
economy, unemployment is running at about 16 percent. Some workers
have moved to Germany and other continental countries in search of
work and others are being retrained, according to the statistics.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Fails To Host COMESA Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The annual summit of COMESA,
scheduled to have taken place in Namibia this month, has been
postponed following concern about the security of heads of state
and government.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Bingu wa Mutharika today told the
Zimbabwean National News Agency from Lusaka, Zambia, that
Namibia, which offered to host the summit last year, had since
notified COMESA that it could not host the heads of state and
government and their officials.
</P>
<P>
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
formed in 1993, stemmed from the defunct Preferential Trade Area
for Eastern and Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were underway to find a suitable venue for the summit,
Mutharika said.
</P>
<P>
"We will be holding the summit within the next two months and
the target is to have it by March because everything in terms of
documentation and preparation is in place. We just need to get
the venue and inform the members," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed joint COMESA/SADC (Southern African
Development Community) summit to discuss the dual membership of
countries to both organizations, he said no date had been set for
the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said a joint ministerial committee comprising 10 ministers,
five each from SADC and COMESA, had been appointed to discuss
preparations for the proposed summit.

<HEADLINE> Slow Growth Forecast by UK Car Industry This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Britain this year
will grow at a relatively slow pace because the pace of economic
growth is set to slow, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT) predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts prepared by car, truck and component
firms for the SMMT, this year's economic growth will fall below
the Treasury forecast of 3 percent, leaving growth slower this
year and next than it has been in preious years.
</P>
<P>
Members of the SMMT said that uncertainty about job prospects
and a subdued housing market meant consumer confidence would
remain fragile.
</P>
<P>
The comments came after a difficult year in which car sales
rose just 1.8 percent, and are forecast to rise by only 1.3
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Pyne, SMMT chief economist, said, "Most of our members
believe the absence of a sustained improvement in the feel-good
factor will continue to act as a major impediment to further
significant growth in expenditure on durables, including cars."
</P>
<P>
Last year's car sales rise of 1.8 percent was underpinned by a
7.2 percent rise in fleet registrations. But manufacturers
believed the fleet replacement cycle was probably at its peak and
would decrease in 1996, the SMMT said.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Airlift Comes to End Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Three cargo planes from the
United States, Britain and France flew this morning the final
three flights of the humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo which ended
officially around midday today, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told a regular news conference that
although the whole airlift operation was completed, the UNHCR
"will be keeping in place a mechanism so that we can mount
emergency airlift in large refugee crises in the future".
</P>
<P>
As the longest airlift in history, the Sarajevo airlift began
on July 3, 1992 and surpassed the Berlin airlift of 1948-1949 in
duration on October 8, 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, as of January 4, a total of 160,677 tons of
humanitarian aid had been flown into Sarajevo aboard 12,951
flights. The tonnage breaks down as 144,827 tons of food and
15,850 tons of medicine, equipment and other humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Since it began, some 20 nations have participated in the
airlift. For much of that time, however, five nations have flown
regularly. They are Canada, France, Germany, Britain and United
States. A number of international humanitarian agencies, including
the International Committee of the Red Cross have also been
involved.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that during many months of the Bosnian war, the
airlift was almost the sole link between Sarajevo and the outside
world, often delivering more than 85 percent of all aid reaching
the city.
</P>
<P>
In addition to aid delivery, the airlift has helped with the
medical evacuations of more than 1,100 patients from Bosnia. It
also has carried thousands of journalists into the city throughout
the war.

<HEADLINE> Former Zambian President Kaunda On Political Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda said here today that he will definitely bounce back to
power in that country's elections scheduled for October this
year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwean National News Agency,
Kaunda refused to admit any liability to ruining the once vibrant
copper-rich Zambian economy during his 27 years' rule, which
ended in 1991 when he was ousted by Frederick Chiluba of the now
ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said, he had been approached by an array of Zambians
requesting him to save the country from corruption and economic
deterioration in his country.
</P>
<P>
''Now they (Chiluba and his followers) are so worried about my
return to politics and they are now trying all sorts of tactics
to stop me,'' Kaunda said.
</P>
<P>
He spelt out a four-point agenda for his government:
</P>
<P>
-- to bring back the ''one zambia one nation" policy;
</P>
<P>
-- to rebuild the agricultural sector;
</P>
<P>
-- to create jobs for zambians; and
</P>
<P>
-- to hand over government to clean hands.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said he was in Zimbabwe to visit his two married
daughters.
</P>
<P>
After a defeat by the MMD in that country's first multi-party
elections in 1991, Kaunda, 72, retired from politics a year
later. He, however, reentered politics in July last year when he
won back the leadership of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP). enditem

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM on Possible Indian Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
said today Pakistan would have a "considered and measured
response" if India detonated its second nuclear device.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks here today when she met a
group of Japanese journalists, according to the official
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
She added that "But it will be absolutely tragic for the
subcontinent with India actually detonating its nuclear test."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that India, who tested its first nuclear bomb
in 1974, is planning the second test in the near future.
</P>
<P>
She said, "Some people say that perhaps India wants to detonate
this test to see whether Pakistan actually had the knowledge and
the capacity to convert its knowledge into a nuclear reality."
</P>
<P>
"By taking a decision, we have to take all these facts into
consideration. But I hope time will never come when we will make
such a decision."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed her confidence that the world
opinion will convince the Indian leadership that "we are at the
brink of 21st century and we should better enter the century with
peace."
</P>
<P>
"I will, therefore, place importance on the stated position of
the Indian authorities that there will be no test," said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the claim opposition leader Nawaz Sharif had in the
past that Pakistan possessed a nuclear device, Benazir said, "I
think this was not the viewpoint of Nawaz Sharif when he was the
prime minister."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Benazir said, has never denied that it has certain
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
But because they believe in non-proliferation, they have never
turned or used this knowledge into creating a nuclear device, said
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is our policy today to continue on the path of
non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
"By doing so, we will not make devices, not to detonate
devices, not to export any nuclear technology and we have shown
tremendous responsibility and restraint."
</P>
<P>
Benazir said during her scheduled four-day official visit to
Japan from January 17, "I shall also take an opportunity to
discuss the security matters with the Japanese prime minister,
including threat of nuclear proliferation and the threat of
missile race."

earlier today, according to Sergei Medvedev, the president's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also ordered a thorough investigation of how the attack
could happen and berated the ministers who attended the meeting for
the crisis, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 Chechen militants headed by Salman Raduyev, 28, the
son-in-law of rebel Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed into
Kizlyar in northern Daghestan bordering Chechnya early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
They seized the city hospital and two more buildings nearby and
took more than 1,000 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev reportedly threatened to start shooting the hostages if
his demands were not met immediately. He is demanding the immediate
withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and adjacent regions.
</P>
<P>
However, in Moscow, the demand is seen as "completely
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Russian forces had already taken measures earlier this
afternoon against Chechen militants who had encircled 145 Russian
troops in the Cheryomushki residential area in Kizlyar, according
to the Itar-Tass news agency,
</P>
<P>
The Kizlyar crisis closely resembles the attack on Budennovsk
in southern Russia last summer when Chechen militants under the
command of Shamir Basayev killed over a hundred civilians and took
over a thousand hostage.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin personally held talks with
Basayev to free the hostages. In exchange, peace talks began in
Chechnya and Basayev and his men were allowed to escape.

Johannesburg, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Standing
Committee on Intelligence of the South African Parliament today
held a five-hour close-door meeting to decide on the probe of
claims that some top police officers have been spied on by the
National Intelligence Agency (NIA).
</P>
<P>
The secret meeting, attended by 15 of the 17 members, decided
to investigate all the allegations of the use of listening
devices and other forms of surveillance on senior police
officers.
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg-based Star newspaper last week reported the
entire top structure of the police, including National
Commissioner George Fivaz, was being spied on. It quoted unnamed
sources as saying the NIA had assigned this task to former
Vlakplaas police commander Dirk Coetzee.
</P>
<P>
However, Both NIA and Coetzee have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Cape Town after the meeting,
Committee Chairwoman Lindiwe Sisulu said the police and NIA would
be asked to submit reports on the allegaions within 14 days.
</P>

The committee would then meet again on February 7 to consider
the reports, Sisulu added.

SHANGHAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Residents in China's largest
metropolis have been donating money for a memorial pavilion for a
giraffe.
</P>
<P>
The giraffe died in July, 1993 after suffering from serious
inflammation caused when its stomach became clogged with plastic
bags left by visitors at the Shanghai Zoo. At the time, its fifth
baby had just been born 28 days before.
</P>
<P>
The pavilion is being sponsored by the zoo and Shanghai's
People's Broadcasting Station in an effort to urge local residents
to better protect wildlife and maintain a better environment.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi Xinquan, the zoo's director, the giraffe's
body will be kept in a crystal glass case in the pavilion, which
will be called "Pavilion of Tears" as a way of showing residents'
sympathy for the animal.
</P>
<P>
The giraffe was born in 1978 in Japan and was offered as a gift
to the residents of Shanghai in July 1980.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Side Says Sovereignty Not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus's sovereignty is one and
undivided and it is not negotiable, the island's National Council
declared here today after a meeting presided over by President
Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Reading a written press release issued by the Council,
government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told his daily press
briefing that in view of the forthcoming initiatives on Cyprus,
the National Council completed today the exchange of views on
latest developments on Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The National Council is the top advisory body to the President
on the handling of the Cyprus problem and is made up of the
leaders of the four parliamentary parties.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said, "the National Council reaffirmed the position
that before going to direct talks between President Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash there should be a common
ground on the basic aspects composing the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
He said the Council also reaffirmed "there is a single and
undivided sovereignty and there is no question of discussion."
</P>
<P>
"Our side is ready to discuss matters of competence of the
federal state and the federal territories, the issues of
security, guarantees and all other basic aspects of the Cyprus
problem," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side demands separate sovereignties for
the two federal cantons that would compose a federal state of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Today's National Council meeting was the continuation of the
discussion held on December 23, 1995, following a shuttle
diplomacy on the island by U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard
Beattie last December, resulting in a document in which Denktash
made a shift in his position by agreeing to support European Union
(EU) membership of a federal Cyprus, provided the sovereignty and
political equality of the Turkish Cypriots are recognized.
</P>
<P>
But the document was rejected by the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government expects that the U.S. and the EU will
launch parallel initiatives on the Cyprus problem very soon.
</P>
<P>
Richard Holbrooke, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
European and Canadian Affairs, announced that he would visit
Cyprus, Greece and Turkey early in February before leaving the
diplomatic service later in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who brokered the Bosnian peace accord, has promised
to make 1996 a year of the "big push" on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Italian Presidency of the European
Union is expected to propose to the EU Council of Ministers the
appointment of an EU coordinator on Cyprus to act parallel with
Beattie.
</P>
<P>
The international community's peace initiatives came following
a stalemate in the peace talks last year between the two
communities on the island, which was divided in 1974 when Turkey
militarily intervened following a short-lived coup seeking union
with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Tax Collection Exceeds Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's tax collection from
July to December 1995 exceeded the government's target by 2.6
billion rupees (75.9 million US dollars), a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) Alvi Abdul Rahim
told a press conference that taxes collected in the six months
amounted to 118.6 billion rupees (3.46 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The target for this period is 116 billion rupees (3.38 billion
dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CBR exceeded the target after the effective
enforcement of tax collections, improvement in the performance of
customs intelligence and investigations and in the education on
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
He said that collection of customs duty and sales tax on
imports in November and December 1995 was extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
Customs duty and sales tax collections from July to October
1995 reached 22.7 billion rupees (662.8 million dollars) while
17.2 billion rupees (510.9 million dollars) of those taxes were
collected in November and December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Direct tax collections increased from 32 billion rupees (934
million dollars) in July-December 1994 to 33 billion (963 million
dollars) in the same period of 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, indirect tax collections amounted to 85.6
billion rupees (2.50 billion dollars) during July-December 1995
against 84 billion rupees (2.45 billion dollars) over the
corresponding period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in tax collections indicated that there was
room for further improving the tax collections, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
He said that the target of tax collections for the whole fiscal
year running from July 1995 to June 1996, which is 264 billion
rupees (7.71 billion dollars), would be achieved although it was a
difficult one.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Increase Cooperation with Britain (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rifkind said that establishing long-term relations with China
is a strategic approach of the British government.
</P>
<P>
Britain is willing to develop relations with China in all
areas, and is willing to push for developing partner ties
between the European Union and China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on economic and trade ties, Qian said that Britain is
an important trading partner of China's and bilateral trade has
been increasing yearly. He added that Britain has the greatest
amount of investment in China among EU members, and that there is
immense potential for Sino-British economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that political relations become better in order to
develop economic and trade ties, and hope that British products
become more competitive and its loans more flexible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the EU will cancel restrictions on
imports from China so as to benefit the development of economic and
trade ties between the EU and China.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind told Qian that Britain is willing to cooperate with
China in its economic development, and added that Britain has
always been in favor of free trade and would continue to urge the
lifting of restrictions on EU imports from China.
</P>
<P>
When Qian visited Britain last October, the British side
reiterated that Taiwan is a province of China and that Britain
will not develop political ties with Taiwan. Qian expressed his
appreciation for this position, noting that he hopes Britain will
keep the promise it made in the joint communique on exchanging
ambassadors and continue to deal with the Taiwan issue with
caution.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said that Britain's "one China" position will not
change.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he also appreciates the British government's position
of not recognizing the so-called Tibetan authorities in exile, and
that he hopes the British government will not allow Tibetan
separatists to conduct activities aimed at separating China, on
British territory.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said Britain will maintain its traditional position,
that is, that Tibet is a part of Chinese territory.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Urged to Reduce Current Account Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Noted economic analysts today
urged the Indonesian government to give priority to cutting the
country's rising current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's current account deficit reached an alarming level
of 7.9 billion US dollars by the end of 1995, more than double the
3.5 billion dollars of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop organized by the Econit Advisory Group here, the
economic analysts warned that Indonesia's current account deficit,
if unchecked, would remain a "cloud" over the country's economic
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the government should be more offensive and
pro-active in pursuing international trade to reduce the
ballooning current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the swelling deficit to an imbalance in trade
where import growth moved faster than export growth.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the current account deficit, which is some 100
percent higher than the government projection, indicates
weaknesses in planning and coordination of economic policies on
macro and micro levels, said the analysts.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the deficit can become a source of instability
in managing the macro-economy.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to reschedule some mega projects,
especially those over 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhannad, the current
account deficit of the fiscal year of 1996-97 is targeted to drop
to 6.9 billion dollars, or 3.1 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> mee010914hke --Demirel Meets Party Leaders on Government Formation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today met leaders of all the five political parties in
the parliament to discuss the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
Demirel told reporters following the five hour consultation
that he would appoint one party leader "as soon as possible" to
set up a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
But he added that such a government to be formed must be a
coalition that would obtain a confidence vote from the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot endorse or send to the parliament (for approval) a
government which would not be able to get the confidence vote,"
said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the party leader he would assign should
assure him of the vote of confidence "at least on paper."
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Demirel said he called upon all party
leaders for "cooperation, self-sacrificing and understanding,"
since the results of the December 24 elections showed that no
party can form a government on its own.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) became a leading force in
the 550 seat parliament with 158 deputies, but far behind a 276
seat majority required for setting up a one-party government.
</P>
<P>
Two central-right parties, the True Path Party (DYP) and the
Motherland Party (ANAP), trailed the RP with 135 and 132 seats
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Two left-wing parties, the Democratic Left Party (DSP) and the
Republican People's Party (CHP) obtained separately 76 and 49
seats.
</P>
<P>
Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Welfare Party, has maintained
that the president should first nominate him as prime minister to
try to form a coalition and hinted that his party could make
compromises in order to become a governing party.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan turned 180 degrees in the past two weeks and appeared
in public with a new image. He claimed that his party was the
most secular party in Turkey and they could cooperate with any
parties without prejudice.
</P>
<P>
However, public opinion still favors a coalition between ANAP
and DYP, with assured support from the other left-wing parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some newspaper columnists pointed out that the
Welfare Party should not be excluded from the political forum and
that the president should first nominate its leader Erbakan to
form the government.
</P>
<P>
If he fails, they said, then the president could assign other
party leaders to retry.

<HEADLINE> Gaza International Airport Under Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Work has commenced on Gaza
International Airport and the first phase will be completed in
June this year, reported the Jerusalem Times.
</P>
<P>
The Assistant Director General of Palestinian Civil Aviation,
Salman Mahmoud Abu Halib, was quoted as saying that the relevant
authorities had supervised operations outlining the airport's
enclosure, uprooting trees and leveling the land. He added that
"work will then start on digging for the runway."
</P>
<P>
The airport will be built in two phases. Abu Halib said, "The
airstrip, aircraft hangers and an air traffic control tower along
with departure and arrival halls will be constructed first,
followed by an extension of the runway, and the buildings of
hangers and fuel stations."
</P>
<P>
Abu Halib estimates the total cost of the two phases to be 36
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has been presented with the
first payment of 18 million dollars for the project by the
Egyptian Al-Ahli Bank in the form of a loan.
</P>
<P>
"The second phase of construction will be funded by the
revenues of the airport and Palestinian airlines and some
international institutions," said Abu Halib.
</P>
<P>
The site of the airport covers an area of 590 acres and all
owners of the land will be given due compensation, decreed by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
According to Abu Halib, only light aircraft will be used to
carry passengers at first. The planes will fly 50 people at a
time and their destinations will be fairly local, such as Amman,
Cairo and Cyprus. After the completion of the transitional phase,
there will be domestic flights to Jericho and other locations on
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Abu Halib also mentioned that the PA had signed agreements
with some Arab countries, including Jordan, Egypt, Morocco and
Qatar concerning air travel between them.

BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's railways are expected to
transport 143 million travellers during Spring Festival this year,
2.03 million people or 1.3 percent more than for the same period
last year, said an official from the Ministry of Railways today.
</P>
<P>
Guo Lin, vice-minister of railways, said that the highest daily
passenger load during a 50-day period starting January 30 is
expected to be 3.5 million people. The Spring Festival falls on
February 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
China plans to put 84 more trains on the tracks during this
period, in addition to the current 2,176 trains, to accomodate the
increased passenger volume, he said, calling on railway workers
across China to make full preparation to ensure smooth passenger
flow during this festival season.

<HEADLINE> Growth in China's Railways Over Next Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The brisk growth of China's
railways over the past five years is to continue to the end of the
century, according to the Ninth Five-Year-Plan for the railways
that was disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, which is still to be discussed by
railway officials from across the country in the next three days,
China is to build some 8,100 km of new railway lines in the
1996-2000 period, which will boost the nation's total railway
length to 68,000 km.
</P>
<P>
The central government will fund 6,100 km of the 8,100, and the
rest will be handled by local governments.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, China will turn 2,700 km of the present
lines into double tracks, and 4,300 km into electrified lines.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have seen the fastest period of expansion
of China's railway network, with 11,800 km of tracks laid, twice
the figure of the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious plan in the past five years has been the
Beijing-Kowloon railway line. The 2,538-km-long line cost 40
billion yuan, making it one of the most expensive projects in the
history of new China, second only to the Three Gorges Dam under
construction on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the remarkable expansion of the railway line,
railway transportation remains a "bottleneck" for the country's
economic development, said an official with the Ministry of
Railways.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year-Plan will put special emphasis on the
expansion of the railway for shipping coal from Shanxi, Shaanxi,
and Inner Mongolia to east and south China.
</P>
<P>
To increase north-south lines, the country plans to continue
construction work on the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, and electrify
the Wuchang-Guangzhou section of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, as
a means of increasing speed of passager trains on the line.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work on a high-speed railway linking Beijing and
Shanghai will begin in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Ferries will most likely play a greater role in China's
railways in the future. A ferry system that is still in the works
will connect the Chinese mainland with Hainan, the country's
second largest island and its largest special economic
zone. Another one will cross the Bohai Sea, greatly reducing the
distance between east and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China is another region that will be given top
priority in future railway construction. Major projects underway
or listed in the plan include the Nanning-Kunming Railway, the
Xi'an-Ankang Railway, double tracks on the Guiyang-Kunming and the
Liupanshui-Zhuzhou lines, and electrification of the
Chengdu-Kunming Railway.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China, the railway from Harbin to Dalian will be
electrified. A passenger line will link Shenyang (the capital of
Liaoning Province) and Qinhuangdao, paving the way for a
high-speed line between Beijing and Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
In northwest China, efforts will be concentrated on
double-tracks and electrification. A new line will extend to
southern Xinjiang, for development of the oil resources in the
Tarim Basin, China's important oil base.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that, over the next five years, China will
invest as much as 330 billion yuan in railway construction, with
the figure rising to 420 billion yuan if technological upgrading
is included.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah met here today with Eritrean Interior Minister
Ali Said Abdullah, who is simultaneously envoy of the Eritrean
President Isayas Afewerki, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Eritrean envoy handed the Amir of
Kuwait a written message from President Afewerki.
</P>
<P>
The message dealt with the latest developments of the
Eritrean-Yemeni dispute over the Red Sea island of Greater Hanish,
KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Interior Minister said upon his arrival in Kuwait
City Monday that Kuwait's position on the Eritrean-Yemeni dispute
over the Greater Hanish island is neutral and even-handed, and
that it is not partial like that of the Arab League, the
London-based Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported
today.
</P>
<P>
He said the Arab League represented by its Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid, "is not entitled to decide the Eritrean-Yemeni
dispute without relying on documents and proofs to confirm the
truth."
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Greater Hanish, one of the three islands
claimed by both Yemen and Eritrea, flared up into armed conflict
in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The island, now under Eritrea's control, sits astride one of
the world's major shipping lanes 160 kilometers north of the Bab
el-Mandeb Strait, southern gateway to the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Yemen, which has the support of the 22-member Arab League and
the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, has repeated its claims
that Eritrea invaded the island and called for Eritrea's
evacuation of the island.
</P>
<P>
While Eritrea claimed Yemen first put troops on the island in
early November. But Yemen said the situation became tense after
Eritrea ordered all Yemenis off the island November 11 and
attacked it on December 15.

<HEADLINE> Australia Expected to Attract More Chinese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 57,000 Chinese
citizens are expected to visit Australia this year, according to
Jamie MacDonald, an offical with the Australian Tourist
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jamie MacDonald was speaking at a promotion meeting held in the
capital of south China's Guangdong Province today.
</P>
<P>
Australia's scenic spots and services for tourists were
introduced during the meeting to more than 200 tourist agents from
south China's Hainan Province, southwest China's Yunnan Province
and Guizhou Province, and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Through October of last year, 38,500 Chinese visited Australia,
up 40 percent over 1994, according to statistics provided at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Last year the commission held the same promotional gathering in
Beijing, China's capital, and in Shanghai, the country's largest
metropolis, in order to increase its share of China's tourism
market.
</P>
<P>
The reason given for using Guangzhou as this year's site for
the promotion was that many overseas Chinese have relatives in
Guangdong who are, therefore, potential travel customers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Decides to Raise Minimum Wage from April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The minimum wage levels in 25 of
Indonesia's 27 provinces will rise by an average of 10.63 percent
in April, according to a decree by the Manpower Ministry received
here today.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wages include basic wages and "fixed allowances,"
which are defined as those not related to the presence or
productivity of the workers.
</P>
<P>
The new minimum levels are the result of deliberations between
representatives of employers, workers and the local administration
in each of the 25 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The wage increase rate is higher than the 8.6-percent inflation
rate registered in the country in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decree allows companies to apply for exemptions from the
new minimum wage levels for a period of up to 12 months if they
cannot afford the pay hike.
</P>
<P>
The increase is the lowest in the last four years. The
government raised the minimum wages by an average of 17.76 percent
in 1993, by nearly 30 percent in 1994 and by an average of 18.6
percent in 1995.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Medicines and health personnel
have been sent to flood-stricken areas in Jakarta, capital of
Indonesia, to prevent the outbreak of diarrhea and skin diseases,
sources from the National Red Cross said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Health Office, the National Red Cross and several
state and private institutions have distributed food, medicine and
clothes to the victims of the flood, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry for Social Affairs, 13 tons of rice
was handed over to the city administration Monday and another five
tons will be distributed soon.
</P>
<P>
The Coordinating Ministry of People's Welfare has promised to
distribute the aid properly to the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The massive floods sweeping the capital during the weekend has
receded since last night. Life in the worst flood-stricken areas
was returning to normal today.
</P>
<P>
Five people were reportedly killed and six others still missing
in the worst flood hitting Jakarta since 1976.
</P>
<P>
The floods began coursing through low-lying areas of Jakarta
last Wednesday, when relentless torrential rains caused river to
break their banks and swell to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestion developed in almost every corner of the
city. Police confirmed that the traffic jam was one of the worst
in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
Thousands were made homeless and took shelters in nearby schools
or government offices.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta is crisscrossed by at least 13 rivers that pose a
perennial threat of flood. The large number of houses along the
river banks added to the threat by narrowing the waterway.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto Monday inspected the flood-stricken areas
and urged residents who live by the river banks to leave these
sites.

GENEVA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Governors of the world's most
powerful central banks voiced optimism on Monday about the world
economic outlook despite concerns that there may be a slowdown in
recovery, Swiss media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is performing "all in all well" and European

The bankers' group also discussed the economic situation in
Japan and the United States. Tietmeyer said the group saw growing

LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A British Trident submarine,

</P>
<P>
HMS Victorious, second of the Royal Navy's Trident submarines,
left its Clydeside home base earlier this week to go on Atlantic

<P>
The British Defence Ministry would confirm neither the precise
content of the 16 missile tubes nor that the vessel was on a
patroling mission.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government had earlier announced that
Victorious would be first Trident submarine to deploy the new form
of nuclear deterrent.

LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has condemned the recent
attack on the west African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG by
some Liberian warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The condemnaton was made by a Nigerian government delegation
led by Major-General Abdul- Salam Abubakar, Chief of Defence
Staff, in the Liberan capital Monrovia during a meeting with
members of the Liberan Counil of State, the colective presidency.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was in Liberia to assess recent developments in
that country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Three Nigerian soldiers in the ECOMOG were killed in the
attack by fighters of the United Liberation Movement for
Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO-J).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the council members, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi described the developments as "very ominous", thereby
causing serious setbacks to ECOMOG's disarmament and
demobilisation program in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was unfortunate that some signatories to the
Abuja peace accord of August 19, 1995, could unleash their troops
to attack, slaughter and wound ECOMOG soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi advised the council members "to keep faith with the
Abuja accord".  enditem

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Blames His Ministers for Kizlyar Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
blamed the Kizlyar hostage crisis on his "power ministers" at an
urgent meeting convened this morning in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Laying the blame on the Federal Border Service and its director
Andrei Nikolayev, Yeltsin said, "We have received another blow."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Russian president will take radical
measures to settle the crisis, his press secretary Sergei Medvedev
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, some 400 Chechen militants headed by Salman
Raduyev, 28, the son-in-law of separatist Chechen president
Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed into Kizlyar, a town in the northern
Daghestan, one of Russia's 89 regions, which borders on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Within a short span of time, the militants seized the buildings
of a maternity home and a city hospital and held hostage 100
civilians driven into the hospital from nearby multi-storey houses.
</P>
<P>
The militants demanded that Russian troops immediately withdraw
from Chechnya and threatened to kill the hostages if their demand
is not met.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the militants refuse to
sign any contract or to have negotiations. All attempts to talk
the militants into stopping the fighting and sitting down for
negotiations have failed so far, an Interior Ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 70 militants are keeping the hostages in the city
hospital while the rest of them are fighting in other parts of the
town. The militants have seized the bridge across the Terek river
and whistling of bullets can be heard in other parts of Kizlyar
including the railway station.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 9 (Xinhua)-- Uganda will soon begin its
implementation of the Uganda National Plan of Action for
Nutrition (UNPAN) which was formulated following the
Internatioanl Conference on Nutrition in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The UNPAN seeks to reduce or eradicate hunger and malnutrition
in Uganda by improving household food security, advocating proper
diet and healthy life style, and prevention of infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of food and nutrition in
the Ministry of Agriculture today, the ministry has decided to
implement the plan in all the 39 districts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Three districts with special nutrition problems have been
singled out to implement the plan first. They are southeastern
district of Kamuli, Mubende District in the southwest and the
district of Rukungiri. Nutrition committees to be set up in three
districts will be held responsible for identified food and
nutrition problems and they are also obliged to raise proposals
for improving nutritional wellbeing of the districts.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry will work together with the Ministry
of Health in implementing the UNPAN.
</P>
<P>
Malnultrition in Uganda, malnutrition of children in
particular, is reportedly the highest in Africa. A recent
demographic health survey shows that half of Uganda's children
under the age of five are dwarf and over 20 percent children are
underweight.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says Foreign Terrorists Part of Global Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 09 (Xinhua) -- The foreign terrorist suspects
lately arrested in the Philippines are part of worldwide efforts
of extremists to establish bases of operations from which to
launch terrorist attacks, a Philippine official said today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine intelligence agents have arrested 35 suspects since
the beginning of the new year, said Interior and Local Government
Secretary Rafael Alunan in a report to President Fidel Ramos at a
cabinet meeting in Malacanang today.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists are seeking to sow discontent among various
communities against the established government, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those arrested were suspected to be part of a worldwide
extremist movement that is trying to establish a base in many
countries, including the Philippines," Alunan said in his report.
</P>
<P>
He said that the arrest of Abdul Karim Murad in Manila and
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef in Pakistan led to the discovery of a terrorist
cell operating in Metro Manila, which was composed of
international and local terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Yousef is being indicted for his complicity in the World Trade
Center bombing in New York in February 1993. The arrest of Murad
led to the foiling of a terrorist plot to assassinate Pope John
Paul II when he was on a visit to the Philippines in January last
year.

<HEADLINE> Chun Accused of Raking in 635 Mln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan accumulated about 635 million U.S. dollars of slush funds
while in office from 1980 to 1988, a prosecution official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"It has been confirmed that Chun stashed more money than former
President Roh Tae-woo during his presidency," said Choi Hwan,
chief of the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office (SDPO).
</P>
<P>
Chun was arrested on December 3 last year on charges of leading
the military mutiny on December 12, 1979 and was indicted by the
SDPO 18 days later on charges of violating the Military Criminal
Law.
</P>
<P>
He is currently under medical treatment at the National Police
Hospital here due to symptoms of dehydration and malnutrition
resulting from his three-week-long fast protesting his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Roh, who was arrested on November 16 last year, has been
already indicted on charges of amassing 571 million to 584 million
U.S. dollars of slush funds during his 1988-1993 presidency. He
has 292 million U.S. dollars left in the funds, the prosecution
said earlier.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the size and mobilization techniques of their
slush funds, Chun appears to have been more adept than Roh," Choi
said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the remaining balance of the slush funds, Choi
said that Chun's is smaller than Roh's "because Chun withdrew and
spent more than Roh during and after his presidency."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
guide the trading of derivatives in the country, the Central Bank
said today.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank
allows a bank, non-bank financial intermediaries performing
quasi-banking functions and its subsidiaries to engage in
financial derivatives activities upon prior approval by the
monetary authorities.
</P>
<P>
This type of service by a bank falls under its regular banking
units and foreign currency deposit unit (FCDU).
</P>
<P>
However, the Monetary Board mandates that these financial
institutions will only be granted the license to engage in
derivatives provided they comply with 11 pre-qualification
requirements.
</P>
<P>
A minimum capital of 200 million pesos (8 million US dollars)
will have to be put up for specific category by these financial
institutions or networth of the same amount.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions wanting to engage in derivatives should
first invest and have an electronic data processing capability,
including the appropriate computer hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the occurrence of the Barings PLC scandal in the
country, these financial institutions must adopt "adequate
internal control system and procedures" to include record keeping.
</P>
<P>
Only those with minimum experience of two years will be
appointed as key officers and traders responsible for derivatives.

ethnic variety and absence of restrictions on cross-border

<P>
The King, in his opening address, told the participants that
without development there is no peace and stability, and in turn,
development and prosperity will not be realized without peace and
political stability.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian Group ministerial meeting came at a time

The whole world is making efforts to achieve comprehensive
peace and stability, while the world economy is moving toward
further liberalization and openness, symbolized by a prevailing

<P>
MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will ink bilateral repurchase agreements with the
central monetary authorities of Malaysia and Thailand this week.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said today that the
amount covered by the agreements remains confidential since public
disclosure of this amount could lead to speculation in the
currency market.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral repurchase agreements will provide the respective
signatory countries liquidity to maintain currency stability
during speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
The repurchase agreement is an agreement between the
signatories to buy securities for an agreed amount of cash and to
agree to sell back the same securities at a specified later date
for a specified amount.
</P>
<P>
It allows the respective central banks to raise the US dollar
from its counter-party against its holding of the US government
securities, enabling the central banks to come up with cash
without necessarily liquidating their US securities holdings.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank and the Hongkong Monetary Authority
signed a similar agreement on December 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Most monetary authorities in the region have inked bilateral
repurchase agreements to ward-off speculative currency attacks
arising from the financial crisis in Mexico.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Narcotics addiction is becoming
a serious problem requiring a prompt solution in the southern part
of Thailand, with the use of drugs spreading rapidly among young
Thai-Muslims, according to a senior Thai official here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister attached to the prime minister's office, Prasong
oonpong, said drug traffickers used southern provinces as a
transit point where narcotics smuggled from the Golden Triangle
would be further smuggled across the Malaysian border or shipped
to other continents by sea.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Triangle is the notorious opium producing area
straddling Myanmar, Laos and northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the risk of being captured at border checkpoints or
seaports, those traffickers sold part of their consignment in the
provinces at the prices affordable to local residents, and the
youth were their prime customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said leaders of Muslim communities had full
support in the fight against drug abuse. They would preach
Islamic teachings which prohibit the use of narcotics during
weekly religious services.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal arrived here today on a two-day official visit which
marks the final stage in a campaign to heal a rift between the two
countries caused by the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit to the Kingdom by a high-ranking Saudi
official since 1990 when relations between the two countries
became soured for Jordan's positions on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister is expected to hold talks with King Hussein
of Jordan, his Jordanian counterpart Abdul Karim Kabariti and
other senior officials on bilateral relations and a prospective
summit meeting between King Hussein and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Prince Saud is expected to discuss preparations for the summit
and reestablishment of some ties with Amman.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein had planned to visit Saudi Arabia on December 9
last year to meet with King Fahd, but the Saudi leader's sudden
illness postponed the scheduled visit.
</P>
<P>
The two monarchs have not met each other since July 18, 1990,
two weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Ambassador to Jordan Abdullah Sudairi arrived in Amman
last November, five years after the Gulf Kingdom recalled its
ambassador during the Gulf crisis, marking the return to normal
of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes First Reading of Bill on Implementing Oslo 2 Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament)
passed Monday night the first reading of a bill on implementation
of PLO-Israeli Oslo 2 accord on extending Palestinian autonomy in
the West Bank, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio's report, the bill is to introduce
legislation for different aspects of the Oslo 2 agreement,
including a clause to allow Arab residents of east Jerusalem to
cast votes through post offices there in the Palestinian Council
elections.
</P>
<P>
Before the plenum debate, the Knesset spent hours arguing
about the interpretation of the House Rules on whether the vote
could be seen as a non-confidence motion, as the opposition
demanded, or a motion of confidence in the government, as the
coalition wanted.
</P>
<P>
A non-confidence motion would have postpone the vote by another
week, while a confidence motion means the vote takes place on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
The opposition wanted to delay the vote to disrupt the
Palestinian Council elections due to be held on January 20, since
the bill must pass three readings for the elections to take place.
</P>
<P>
The debate began after frantic meeting, and following the
Knesset House Committee's decision to accept the government's
request for a motion of confidence and to rule out the possibility
of a filibuster, as the opposition wanted.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister David Libai presented the government's call
for the bill to be passed, pointing out that the agreement has
been internationally accepted and must be observed.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders criticized not only the bill and Oslo
accords but also the government's handling of the bill's passage,
saying the government had trampled on the Knesset procedure and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu warned that Jerusalem's status
would be harmed by the bill.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker of the Knesset Ovadia Eli (Likud) said he had
absented himself from the Knesset presidium's meeting on the
handling of the bill to protest the fact that the House Rules had
been ignored.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the debate, it was decided that the House
Committee would determine to which committee the bill will be
referred for preparation for second and third readings.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said in its report that the Likud is still
contemplating further maneuvers to stall passage.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Greatest Concern Over U.S. Transit Permit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed its
greatest concern and strong displeasure over the United States'
erroneous decision on allowing Li Yuan-zu to make a transit
through the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chen Jian told a routine news
conference that the Chinese side has lodged solemn representations
with the U.S. side over the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Taiwan is a very sensitive issue in Sino-US
relations and bears upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan authorities are attempting to create 'two Chinas'
or 'one China, one Taiwan' in the name of making a stopover in the
United States. And this is bound to meet with the resolute
opposition of all the Chinese people," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "by allowing Li Yuan-zu to make a transit through
the United States, the U.S. government has violated the principles
set forth in the three Sino-US communiques."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side had made solemn representations with the
U.S. side before it made this erroneous decision, Chen recalled.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, in disregard of the "solemn representations"
and "resolute oppositions" of the Chinese side, the U.S. side was
still bent on its way of making its erroneous decision.
</P>
<P>
"And the Chinese side wants to express its greatest concern and
strong displeasure," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We demand the United States government to strictly abide by
the principles enshrined in the three joint communiques between
China and the US, and take concrete and effective measures to
prevent the Taiwan authorities from engaging in activities aimed
at splitting the motherland under the pretext of making a stopover
in the country so as to avoid further damage to its relations with
China," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets Ministers Over Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
convened an urgent meeting with his Prime Minister Viktor
chernomyrdin and a number of "power ministers" today to discuss
how to settle the Kizlyar hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, Chernomyrdin entrusted his first deputy Oleg
Soskovets to deal with the issue, a government spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
Early today, some 400 Chechen militants headed by Salman
Raduyev, 28, the son-in-law of rebel Chechen separatist president
Dahokhar Dudayev, suddenly appeared on the outskirts of Kizlyar, a
town in the northern Daghestan, one of Russia's 89 regions, which
borders Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Within a short period of time, the militants seized the
buildings of a maternity home and a city hospital. They were
driving residents from nearby multi-storey houses into the
hospital. Now, they are holding nearly 100 hostages there.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Interior Ministry spokesman said that the militants
have barricaded the doors and the windows of the hospital, staying
themselves on the ground floor and keeping the hostages on top
floors.
</P>
<P>
Part of the militants have left the city hospital and
penetrated into living quarters of the town, and seized the bridge
over the Terek river near the town, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev formed last year a unit of militants called the "Lone
Wolves" and "has been for long masterminding plans to spread the
fire of war to the territory of neighboring Daghestan," Chechen
government spokesman Ruslan Magomadov said.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev demanded Russian troops withdraw from Chechnya, and
were threatening to kill all the hostages if the demand was not
met.
</P>
<P>
"Wolves have come to you. Withdraw troops from Chechnya or
shooting of civilians will begin," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Kizlyar is now being cordoned off by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
The Kizlyar seizure clearly resembles the attack on Budennovsk
last summer where Chechen militants under the command of terrorist
Shamir Basayev killed over a hundred civilians and took over a
thousand people hostage.
</P>
<P>
The attack made Chernomyrdin personally hold talks with Basayev
to free the hostages. In exchange peace talks began in Chechnya
and Basayev and his men were allowed to escape.

MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Russian Interior
Ministry's officers left here earlier today by air for Kizlyar to
help deal with a hostage crisis there, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The group is headed by deputy commander of Interior troops
General Viktor Gaflov, the news agency said, without giving the
exact number of the group.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 Chechen militants under command of Salman Raduyev, 28,
the son-in-law of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev,
stormed into the city of Kizlyar in the neighboring Russian local
republic of Daghestan early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
They seized a city hospital in the northern Daghestani city and
are holding over 100 hostages there. Part of the militants have
left the hospital and penetrated into the living quarters of the
city.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is discussing the situation in
Kizlyar with his "power ministers," and will hold an additional
meeting to find a solution to the crisis with his Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedv said.

<HEADLINE> hke010936-- ASEAN to Urge NAFTA to Ease Motor Vehicle Export Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will urge North America to ease a new rule
that discriminates motor vehicle exports from the region during
the ASEAN-US dialogue in Bali, Indonesia, on January 11-12.
</P>
<P>
Jose Concepcion Jr., chairman of the Philippine ASEAN Council,
said today that a newly imposed regulation requires motor vehicle
exports to the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) to have at
least 60 percent local content.
</P>
<P>
This will shut out the bulk of vehicles from the ASEAN region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the regulation's adverse impact on regional exports,
officers of the ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCI) have
agreed to raise the issue with Winston Lord, US assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affair.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion also said that the ASEAN-CCI will also push for the
creation of the ASEAN-NAFTA Business Council, which will serve as
a forum where businessmen from both blocs could thresh out
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful cooperation can only take place if both parties
establish a relationship based on mutual respect, recognizing
disparities in per capita incomes," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-US dialogue will also tackle the phased reduction of
tariffs called for by regional trading blocs and the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue is expected to discuss the proposal to extend the
scheme that allows ASEAN exports to enter the American market at
low or zero tariff.

<HEADLINE> China Severs Diplomatic ties with Senegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Chen Jian announced here today China's decision to
suspend its diplomatic ties with Senegal as of today, and that all
the agreements between the two governments will also cease to be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The government of Senegal and the Taiwan authorities announced
that they "reestablished" their so called "diplomatic relations"
on January 3.
</P>
<P>
"This decision by the government of Senegal has violated the
relevant principles enshrined in the communique on the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Senegal on
December 7, 1971 and broken its solemn commitment to "recognizing
the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole
legitimate government representing all the Chinese people," Chen
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The erroneous decision by the government of Senegal, which
runs counter to the fundamental interests of the two peoples and
goes against their aspirations, has seriously damaged the friendly
relations and cooperation between China and Senegal. In view of
this, the government of the People's Republic of China has decided
to suspend its diplomatic relations with Senegal as of January 9,
1996," he said.

Noting that "all the agreements between the two governments
will also cease to be implemented forthwith," Chen said "it must
be pointed out that the Chinese people has always cherished
friendly sentiments towards the Senegalese people, and made
enormous efforts in support of the cause of the Senegalese people
to safeguard their state sovereignty and develop the economy."
</P>
<P>
"The reverse of the relations between the two countries is not
something that the Chinese side wishes to see happen. The
Senegalese side shall be held responsible for all the consequences
arising from its wrongful decision," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Video Screening Businesses to Be Re-registered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Commercial showing of video
tapes in China will require examination and re-registration before
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular issued by the Ministry of Culture,
departments in charge of the business at all levels must conduct
the examinations and re-registration work within this month.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in the circular that some problems have
cropped up during the rapid growth of the commercial showing of
video-tapes both in rural and urban areas in China over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that there are more than 60,000 halls and other
venues in the country where people can watch video films or rent
tapes from stall owners.
</P>
<P>
Some video salons have violated the regulations made by the
Chinese government about protecting intellectual property rights
by showing some smuggled or pirated video-tapes. And some of the
latter have been deemed pornographic.
</P>
<P>
The circular ordered local departments in charge of the
business to ban the public showing of video-tapes without
certification.
</P>
<P>
Without approval from the departments no one can start a
commercial video-tape showing business.
</P>
<P>
Illegal video tapes are banned, and anyone who shows
pornographic or reactionary video films will be liable to arrest
by the police.
</P>
<P>
Applications for re-registration by private business people
will be refused if they do not have fixed locations for showing
video films or the premises do not meet the standards of
public security or the fire regulations.
</P>
<P>
From January 1 this year, China began to ban the commercial
showing of feature film CDs and LDs in an effort to bring an end
to infringement of copyrights in this field.

<HEADLINE> 400 Chechen Militants Seize 100 Hostages in Kizlyar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 Chechen militants loyal
to rebel Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev have reportedly seized
some 100 hostages in the Daghestani town of Kizlyar Early today, a
Russian Interior Ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
Daghestan, one of 89 Russia's regions, neighbors Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen gunmen, who refer to themselves as the "wolves,"
are headed by Dudayev's son-in-law Salman Raduyev, the source
said, adding that they seized the local hospital and the maternity
home in the town in the northern Daghestan in the delta of the
Terek river.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Raduyev, who formed in
Gudermes, the second largest city in Chechnya, last year a unit of
militants called the "Lone Wolves," demanded an immediate
withdrawal of russian troops from Chechnya and were threatening to
kill the hostages if the demand was not met.
</P>
<P>
"Wolves have come to you. Withdraw troops from Chechnya or
shooting of civilians will begin," Raduyev stated.
</P>
<P>
Clashes are currently going on In Kizlyar, and it has been
unclear so far how many people were killed.
</P>
<P>
At first, the militants managed to seize part of the Central
City Hospital, which is now blockaded by Russian Interior Ministry
troops.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, who attacked the Daghestani town, blew up two
helicopters at the local airport which they failed to seize
because they were repulsed by Russian army forces, the source
noted.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Prime Minister viktor Chernomyrdin held an urgent
meeting on the situation in Kizlyar and entrusted his first deputy
Oleg Soskovets to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Soskovets has been instructed to call up in one hour the heads
of all the necessary ministries and departments to consider how to
deal with the seizure of Kizlyar, his spokesman Yuri Mihailov told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"The official reaction of the government on the events in
Kizlyar will be made public shortly," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
It was Chernomyrdin who personally interfered to resolve a
similar crisis in the southern Russian city of Budennovsk last
summer which was seized by Chechen militants under the command of
terrorist Shamir Basayev.
</P>
<P>
The premier held direct telephone talks with Basayev and
ensured the release of over a thousand hostages. In exchange
peace talks began in Chechnya and Basayev and his men were allowed
to escape.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Republican Leaders Resume Budget Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today turned down a new Republican proposal to seek smaller
savings from Medicare, Medicaid and welfare during resumed budget
talks with congressional Republican leaders, Republican sources
said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
and other congressional leaders from both parties met for about
four hours among themselves and with Clinton and his aides.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the talks were
"at a point where they're either going to get an agreement or
they're not. It's not going to drag on for another number of
weeks."
</P>
<P>
Another round of talks has been scheduled for Tuesday, McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks were the negotiators' first since Clinton
unveiled his proposal for balancing the budget in seven years
using conservative Congressional Budget Office accounting.
</P>
<P>
Congressional Republicans, led by Dole and Gingrich, arrived at
the White House today with a plan that would scale back 72 billion
U.S. dollars from their proposed savings on Medicare and Medicaid
and welfare over seven years.
</P>
<P>
"They were just rejected," the Associated Press quoted
Representative John Boehner, R-Ohio, a member of the House
Republican leadership, as saying. Boehner is not a bargainer but
is following the talks.
</P>
<P>
Dole said negotiators should know by Tuesday night whether a
deal was possible. He broke away from the talks briefly and
returned to the Senate, where he said "there's a spirit of
cooperation and credible negotiation" at the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
But two other Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that before Republican leaders departed, Clinton told them
that on Tuesday both sides should bring their final offers and an
exit strategy, i.e., a way to describe to voters why the talks
broke off.
</P>
<P>
House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, described
the new Republican offer as "essentially a last offer." "There is
virtually no flexibility left in any of these numbers," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSASKA, January 9 (Xinhua)-- Fortyeight state-owned companies

productive capacities, rehabilitation of existing plants,
promotion of new capital investments and social projects.
</P>
<P>
There are still some 100 parastatals which are lined up for

<HEADLINE> Noted Chinese Bridge-Building Specialist Commemorated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held here today to
mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Mao Yisheng, a
noted Chinese engineer and bridge building specialist.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the Great Hall of the People, one of
China's famous buildings which Mao was involved in constructing.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Vice-Premier
Zou Jiahua, president of the China Association for Science and
Technology Zhu Guangya and other State leaders were present at the
forum, as well as some scientists and Mao's relatives.
</P>
<P>
Mao, who died at the age of 94 on November 12, 1989, was not
only a founder of China's bridge building engineering theory, but
an educator and a former leader of the CPPCC and Jiusan Society, a
non-Communist party in China.
</P>
<P>
"We cherish the memory of Prof. Mao because his outstanding
performance of his duty made him a model for today's Chinese
scientists," said State Councillor Song Jian at the forum.
</P>
<P>
Born in Zhenjiang, in east China's Jiangsu Province, in January
1896, Mao studied civil engineering both at home and in the United
States in his 20s.
</P>
<P>
He was head of the design and construction of east China's
Qiantang River Bridge, the first railway-highway bridge designed
and built completely by Chinese specialists and engineers, in 1933.
</P>
<P>
He also participated in the design work of the country's first
modern bridge over the Yangtze River in central China's Wuhan City
as well as the Great Hall of People after New China was founded in
1949.
</P>
<P>
As a senior member of the International Bridge and Structural
Engineering Association and the member of other renowned overseas
scientific and technological bodies, Mao also helped promote
academic exchanges between Chinese scientists and their foreign
counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Solution to Palestinian Refugees' Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon calls for a solution to
the issue of some 500,000 Palestinian refugees in this country,
stressing that a peace in the region will be "incomplete" without
finding a settlement of the problem.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet held Monday night in honor of Speaker of the
Canadian House of Representatives Gilbert Parent, Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berri reiterated his country's refusal to resettle
the Palestinian refugees in his country.
</P>
<P>
There is "a Lebanese unanimity on an absolute refusal for a
resettlement of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon," the Shiite
house speaker said, "and Lebanon supports a right for them to
return to their homeland" in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the right of return for the Palestinian
refugees is guaranteed by the international law and the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On anti-Israeli movement in the Israeli established "security
zone" in south Lebanon, He noted "the resistance of our people
against the (Israeli) occupation and hostility has become a weapon
of peace for Lebanon to confront the Israeli terrorism, because
the occupation and the Israeli violence continuously threaten
Lebanon's peace and its prosperity, and cause serious damages to
the peace process in the region."
</P>
<P>
He called for the implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 425 which demands an Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri underlined that a united Syrian-Lebanese position is
concentrated on the realization of a just and comprehensive peace
based on all international decisions.
</P>
<P>
Canadian House Speaker Parent, on his part, emphasized
Canada's continuous support for "Lebanon's independence and
sovereignty on all its land."
</P>
<P>
"We support an implementation of the resolution 425, an
extension of Lebanon's authority to all its land, and a
withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Lebanon," Parent said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a realization of the comprehensive peace in
the Middle East will benefit Lebanon and its neighbors," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Canada's desire to strengthen political, economic
and social relations with Lebanon.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Airlines (MAS)
today announced that it would order 25 wide-bodied aircraft worth
four billion US dollars from the Seattle-based Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia Airlines Chairman Tajudin Ramli said the order
comprises 15 Boeing 777s and 10 B747-400s with an option for two
more B777s and three B747-400s.
</P>
<P>
Tajudin Ramli told a press conference today that the first B777
will be delivered in May 1997 and the first B747-400 in September
1997.
</P>
<P>
"The remaining aircraft delivery schedule will be on a
staggered basis up to the year 2001," he added.
</P>
<P>
MAS also said that it has selected Rolls-Royce engines for the
B777 aircraft and Pratt and Whitney engines for the B747-400s.
</P>
<P>
Tajudin told the press that the selection of the aircraft was
made after careful and thorough evaluation, taking into account
Malaysia Airlines' fleet requirements and route expansion over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia Airlines plans to use the B777 (10 of which will be
200 series and five 300 series) on its long haul routes where
market demands do not require bigger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Tajudin said the B777s 200 series could fly 12 to 13 hours
non-stop while the 300 series could fly six to seven hours and has
a passenger capacity of about 281.
</P>
<P>
The MAS carried a total of 40 million passengers last year and
for 1996 it expected to see an increase of 7.2 percent for
domestic passengers and 12 percent for international services.

HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's flue-cured tobacco
sales earned the country about 3.6 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (390
million U.S.Dollars) last year, 53 percent more than the previous
year's earnings, the Herald newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, total export earnings could be more because of the
higher value after processing, it said.
</P>
<P>
The final sold weight of 198 million kilogrammes last year
exceeded the official estimate of 190 million kg with
the highest average yield on record of 2,664 kg per hectare.
</P>

The selling season was predominantly characterised by firm
prices for flue-cured tobacco because of the leaf shortage

<HEADLINE> Guilin's Exotic Culture Enthralls Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to this city in the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region can not only view the so-called
"most beautiful landscape in China", but also be captivated by the
exotic local culture, thanks to the availability of a new series
of tourist programs.
</P>
<P>
Staying in the four-star Guishan Hotel, guests can appreciate
dazzling performances by singers and dancers from the local
Zhuang, Dong, Yao, Miao and Jing minority nationalities.
</P>
<P>
After that, they can watch a fashion show presenting the
colorful costumes of the ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The "Clog Dance" usually brings the performance to a
climax. Tourists can never resist the temptation of putting on a
pair of wooden clogs and dancing together with the professional
dancers to the cheerful music.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism authorities said that the Guishan Hotel is only
one of several quality hotels which offer such performances, which
are usually as attractive as their names, such as "A Luxurious
Night", "An Exotic Night" and "Ethnic Folklore Garden".
</P>
<P>
As one of the first group of 24 historical and cultural cities
given protection by the State Council, Guilin boasts large number
of historical and cultural sites and relics, and now their tourism
potential is being tapped.
</P>
<P>
The three most-popular cultural tourism routes are:
</P>
<P>
From the neolithic caves at Zenpiyan to the Moyan cliff
carvings, via scenic Diecai Mountain on the bank of the Lijiang
River and ending at the stele garden in Qixing Park.
</P>
<P>
The second takes tourists from the residence of King Jingjiang
of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) to Mount Duxiu, the Tombs of the
Jingjiang Kingdom and Mount Raoshan.
</P>
<P>
The last, which is designed for those interested in China's
modern history, takes in the headquarters of the Eighth Route
Army, tombs of famous generals and soldiers of the War of
Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945) and the
residence of Li Zongren, a veteran Kuomintang leader.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Oppositions Reject New Polls Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The mainstream opposition parties
in Bangladesh have rejected the new schedule for the upcoming
general elections announced by the Election Commission (EC)
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new schedule, the date of the polls was deferred from
February 7 to February 15. It was the second time that the EC
changed the date of polls.
</P>
<P>
On December 3 last year, the EC announced January 18 for the
date of the elections. But it changed the date to February 7 on
December 15 because the opposition parties still insist that Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia step down so as to pave the way for
formation of a neutral caretaker government to conduct the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
In response to the postponement, Shiekh Hasina, former
opposition leader in the parliament and president of the largest
opposition party -- the Awami (people's) League, said that mere
changes in the schedule without resolving the main issue of
holding free and fair elections under a neutral caretaker
government would not end the lingering political crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Hasina also criticized the EC for making fun
with the nation by changing the date of polls repeatedly. This
proved the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was suffering
from indecision, she observed.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution to the present crisis is the free and fair
election under a caretaker government ensuring participation of
all the political parties of the country," the opposition leader
said.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the oppositions also resolved to continue
their two-day nationwide strike which started at 06:00 a.m. Monday
to press home their demand.
</P>
<P>
Fresh programs will be announced by the opposition parties at
their public meetings in Dhaka today, sources said.

BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The fruitful talks between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Senior General Than Shwe,
chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council of
Myanmar, are expected to spur the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made here today by Chinese Premier Li Peng

he has attached to the bilateral ties, calling him an old friend
with whom the Chinese people are very familiar.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits
are of great significance for furthering the bilateral ties. He
added that Myanmar attaches great importance to both
Myanmarese-Chinese ties and co-operation with other countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that with the approach of the 21st
century China will play a very important role in the maintenance
of the stability, peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, no matter what happens in the world, Myanmar
will continue to develop the traditional Myanmarese-Chinese
friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe expressed his thanks for China's long-term supply of
aid to his country.
</P>
<P>
China advocated that the co-operation should be strengthened
between both the governments and businesses of the two countries,
Li said, adding that the Chinese government will encourage and
support Chinese businesses which wish to establish small and
medium-sized co-operative projects with their Myanmarese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting they agreed that efforts should be made to
uphold their traditional national cultures while learning advanced
technology from the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> China Works out Program for Legal Science Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China will place emphasis on
expanding the scale of legal science education and cultivating
more higher-level personnel versed in the law, according to
sources attending an ongoing national conference on legal science
education.
</P>
<P>
According to a development plan drafted by the Ministry of
Justice for promoting legal science education during the Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000) and up to the year 2010, China will
continue to improve its university and college schooling, adult
education and occupational training, so as to meet the growing
demand for legal personnel.
</P>
<P>
Legal science education in China's universities and colleges
will be focused on cultivating more law graduates and enlarging
the number of post-graduates majoring in law, especially versatile
students and those suitable for the country's opening-up.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century the number of university and college
students studying legal science is planned to be pushed to three
percent and to 4.5 percent by 2010, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
During the coming five years the number of units under the
ministry's jurisdiction which are authorized to issue master's
degrees will be raised to 70, and the units authorized to issue
doctor's degrees will be raised 12. Also three to five senior
legal personnel training centers will be set up.
</P>
<P>
At present, university and college students studying legal
science account for only 2.2 percent of all students.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the socialist market economy there has
appeared a sharp demand for legal personnel to meet the needs of
the country's legislative, judicial and executive departments, as
well as various businesses, social organizations, institutions of
legal science education and research.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry show that during the next five
years China's courts, procuratorates and judicial departments will
need 600,000 legal personnel with secondary law schooling or
above. But the present higher-learning institutions lag far behind
the demand.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the State will have to promote adult follow-up
education and occupational training in legal science.

<HEADLINE> Bank Intervention Fails to Stem Indian Rupee's Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The US dollar broke the 35.50
rupee barrier and closed sharply higher at 35.77/80 rupees despite
intervention by the Indian central bank on Monday in support of
the rupee at the foreign exchange market in Bombay, the Times of
India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The dollar-rupee trade was very volatile due to hectic all
round demand for the US currency.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of India (SBI), the leading player, made bulk of
the purchases for few public sector undertakings. Some other local
and foreign banks also joined the buying bandwagon, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar selling intervention by the Reserve Bank of India
(the central bank) failed to stem the steep rise of the US unit,
they added.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has breached the 35.70 mark and if the current
buying spree persists, it may test the 36 rupee level in the near
future, the newspaper quoted a local dealer as saying.

<HEADLINE> Village Girl Becomes "Peace Angel" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- "She is the most outstanding
child I have ever met," said President of Portugal Mario Soares
three years ago when he met Gao Jianhong.
</P>
<P>
Gao, an ordinary Chinese peasant girl, was invited by former
Indian President Venkataraman together with the Portuguese
president and other world figures to attend India's National Day
celebrations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year old Gao, known as the "peace angel" in her hometown
of Zuozhuang in central China's Henan Province, has written
letters to over 100 heads of state worldwide, appealing to them to
do their utmost to maintain world peace so that all children of
her age can go to school.
</P>
<P>
"Gao looks no different from her classmates, but there is
something different about her," one of her teachers said.
</P>
<P>
Whenever she learns from newspapers or the tv about wars, tears
will come to her eyes.
</P>
<P>
Why do some people in the world fight each other? Gao used to
wonder when she was still in primary school.
</P>
<P>
"I was too young to understand that and it was also beyond my
ability to stop the wars," Gao said with her bright eyes shining.
</P>
<P>
But several years later, she has proved to be an "peace angel"
who writes letters to leaders of countries all over the world in
the hope of bringing peace to the world.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed rather strange to most people," Gao said. "But I was
very excited when I got replies from the leaders of Singapore,
Mongolia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and India soon
after I had my dream."
</P>
<P>
In her letters she pleaded with the leaders to work for a world
without war, in which all the children of the world could live
happily.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years she has written more than 120 letters
to 117 state leaders and received about a dozen replies from them,
and some 700 letters from friends both from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Now, as a high-school student, she has realized that the
significance of her endeavor has not been so great as she had
dreamed when she was a small girl.
</P>
<P>
"But I will continue to write to other world leaders and my
friends all over the world," she said. "I wish to become a
diplomat in the future so that I can really devote myself to
bringing about world peace."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Leading Capital Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Capital to the tune of nearly
200 billion yuan was transacted at the Shanghai Financial Center
in 1995, making the city China's major capital distribution center.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an 82.67 percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
All the funds flowing into the center, or 104.465 billion yuan,
were borrowed by local financial institutions, and of 94.003
billion yuan going out of the center, 92.45 percent went to other
parts of China, official statistics revealed.
</P>
<P>
In June the center transacted a record 26.86 billion yuan. At
the end of June 25.748 billion yuan-worth of funds remained
outstanding, also a record.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the center's lending interest rates, which fluctuated
more than ten times, failed to top ceilings set by the central
bank and affected the national lending interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In December capital worth 18.109 billion yuan was traded at the
center, up 44.61 percent from November, and the outstanding funds
reached 21.464 billion yuan, 26.11 percent more than in November.
</P>
<P>
The ballooning transactions at the end of the year resulted
from the fact that more funds were used to purchase agricultural
and sideline products, and year-end distribution reduced deposits
in banks, which then had to finance the capital gap, experts
pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- World women's bodybuilding
champion Jojo Sinclair of Singapore has tested positive for drugs,
an official of the Singapore Bodybuilders Federation (SBBF)
revealed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The lightweight champion, who might be deprived of the world
crown, will be suspended from competition if a second urine test
scheduled for January 23 in Belgium confirms she took the banned
drug stanazol, according to Mariappan Letchemenon, general
secretary of the SBBF.
</P>
<P>
Letchemenon had been informed by the International Bodybuilding
Federation that one of the two urine samples Sinclair had
submitted for routine testing at the World Championships in
November had tested positive for stanazol, an anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
Stanazol is the same drug that Canadian Ben Johnson tested
positive for at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair won the world title in the lightweight division (52
kgs) over 36 other competitors, qualifying for the Miss Olympia
contest in Atlanta later this year. She was the first Asian woman
to win a world title in this sports.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Collects Record Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The personal income tax revenue
of this city of some 13 million people, with China's largest urban
economy, almost doubled in 1995, the local tax bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's official statistics indicated today that Shanghai
collected a total of 1.51 billion yuan (about 182 million US
dollars) in individual income tax last year, up 98.4 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 figure was also seven times that of 1990, the bureau
said, adding that personal income taxes accounted for 6.9 percent
of the city's total collection of industrial and commercial taxes
last year. The personal income tax proportion was merely 0.9
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign employees in overseas-funded ventures and
the self-employed made up 80 percent of the contributors of the
personal income tax in 1990, but currently the tax base has
expanded to include almost levels of society, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, China's 1995 individual income tax revenue is
expected to overshoot the target of 12 billion yuan. The national
figure was 7.24 billion yuan in 1994.

NEW DELHI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- It is inevitable that Pakistan
will grant Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) status to India, Commerce
Minister of Pakistan Ahmed Mukhtar said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Times of India newspaper, Mukhtar said
the granting of MFN to India is a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that there will soon be good news about
the MFN status, which means that no trading partner is more or
less favored than any other counterpart.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister stressed that India should provide a
level playing field in trade and commerce for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that while Pakistan had completely liberalized
its import regime, India still continued to maintain a number of
quantitative restrictions on imports.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar, who is leading a Pakistani delegation, came here to
attend the first meeting of commerce ministers of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which opened on

BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has lagged behind other
Southeast Asian Nations such as Singapore and Indonesia in
insurance business, said a survey published here today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently has 13 life and 67 non-life insurance firms,
while Indonesia has 50 general and 94 life insurance companies,
and Singapore has 14 general and 94 life insurance firms, said the
survey conducted recently by the Thai Ministry of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The survey will help the government assess Thailand's existing
insurance business and work out new policies for its future
development, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of Thai insurance market should be in line
with the economic and social development, it added.
</P>
<P>
The opening of new life insurance firms in Thailand will not
affect existing ones as less than 10 percent of Thai people hold
life policies, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the growth of the general insurance market
in Thailand is at 20 percent a year and life insurance at 18
percent a year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Takes New Steps to Invigorate State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial and commercial center, is pushing forward the reform of
state enterprises by adopting a series of new measures this year.
</P>
<P>
The city is to set up new enterprise groups in the forms of
selling, merging, share-holding, leasing and contracting.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after some money-losing state enterprises
were merged with larger and well-operated ones, formed
Sino-foreign joint ventures or adjusted their product mix, said a
municipal government official.
</P>
<P>
Under the principle of independent operation, self-distribution
and self-discipline, the city will build a number of property
rights markets. Twenty state firms have already sold their
property rights, and the number of such firms will reach 300 by
the year 2000, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and foreigners will be allowed to take out leases
on state enterprises for certain periods of time before purchasing
them.
</P>
<P>
Other methods will also be tried out so long as they do not
cause a loss of state property, said Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The mayor pledged that his city will set up a number of
enterprise groups each yielding a business turnover of 100 billion
yuan a year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Goes Ahead With Privatization of Estates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite protests from several
sectors, the Sri Lanka government has decided to go ahead with its
program for the privatization of tea and rubber estates, official
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The program has come under fire by both trade unions and the
business community, though for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, in a letter to the Ministry of
Plantation Industries, has highlighted many flaws in the
privatization procedure, especially the lack of transparency.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions of the Ceylon Workers Congress, and the Lanka
Sama Samaja Party, two partners in the ruling Peoples' Alliance
government, have also objected to it and even threatened to stage
a strike.
</P>
<P>
Ceylon Workers Congress leader, Cabinet Minister S. Thondaman,
has said that they were not against the principle of privatization
but the salary structure for the workers under the program.
</P>
<P>
The Public Enterprise Reform Commission which is implementing
the program has insisted that the program would be continued as
usual.

The bus operators, who were not permitted by the government to
increase bus fares, have made alternate demands instead seeking
operational concessions.
</P>
<P>
They demand three pairs of duty free tyres annually, the
reduction of the import duty of spare parts by 35 percent, and the
import of reconditioned vehicles at cheaper prices.

COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has pledged peace and harmony for her country in 1996,
saying that a firm and viable base will be set up before yearend
to bring an end to the prolonged ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga made the remarks while attending a series of
functions recently in her hometown of Attanagala, 31 kilometers
north of Colombo to commemorate the 97th birth anniversary of her
Late father S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who was one time prime minister.

She said the present government's main objective was to see an
end to the war and allow the people of all communities to live in
peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
She added that the government would not forget the services
rendered by the youth who are left destitute. Vocational training
would be provided for these war invalids.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga became president in November 1994 on the platform
to establish peace in this island country, which has been torn by

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Makes Headway Towards Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The four-nation South
American trade block Mercosur has made great achievements in
internal and external trade since it was founded fours years ago.
</P>
<P>
And the Mercosur 2000 program approved by the four countries at
a presidential summit in December has committed the bloc to
further economic and trade integration.
</P>
<P>
Even so, after the first full year of tariff union between
members of the most important trade bloc in Latin America, several
challenges, including inter-Mercosur trade disputes, have cast
doubt over whether the path toward further integration will be a
smooth one.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade among the four member countries -
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - jumped nearly 400
percent to more than 15 billion U.S. dollars last year from the
4 billion dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
External trade between Mercosur, a market with a total
population of 200 million and combined gross national product of
more than 800 billion dollars, and other regions gained a
year-on-year increase of 25 percent to reach 150 billion dollars
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of trade in Mercosur, or the Southern
Cone Common Market, has helped stabilize the economy and improve
the financial situation of each member nation, contributing to low
inflation and strong, stable currencies.
</P>
<P>
It has also boosted capital inflows as foreign investors see
great potential for growth in the market.
</P>
<P>
Already the largest recipient of direct European investment in
Latin America, Mercosur estimates more than 10 billion dollars in
combined foreign investments flowed into the region in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur confirmed its intention to strengthen relations with
other regional economic blocs by signing a framework agreement
with the 15-nation European Union (EU), on December 15, 1995 to
establish a common market between the two regions. Trade with the
EU accounts for 26 percent of Mercosur's total external trade.
</P>
<P>
Observers say relations among the four member nations have
also been reinforced with increasing visits between public
officials, top-level dialogues and contacts among bankers,
businessmen, scientists and artists.
</P>
<P>
An important challenge for Mercosur in 1995 lay in the
stability and growth of national economic programs, to guarantee
the continuing growth of the market. The member countries decided
to coordinate macroeconomic policies such as monetary and
adjustment policies in future.
</P>
<P>
 Mercosur's biggest challenge in 1995 was the unilateral
adoption by one of the partners of emergency measures such as a
temporary restriction on certain imports, tariff increases on
special products or the expansion of the list of products subject
to tariffs.
</P>
<P>
This provoked trade disputes that were overcome, most of the
time, through top-level dialogues and negotiations or were debated
during Mercosur summit meetings.
</P>
<P>
However, acknowledging that such stumbling blocks in the
formation of a genuine free trade zone are natural, the four
countries aim to intensify integration by consolidating and
improving the tariff union.
</P>
<P>
They are searching for ways to perfect the common trade policy
and institutional juridicial development and to eliminate and
harmonize nontariff barriers to trade by adopting common technical
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur 2000 program approved in December set up concrete
goals to be reached by the year 2000 in agriculture, industry,
mining, energy, service, transportation, communications,
infrastructure, tourism, finance and taxes, as well as
macroeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
Issues on the agenda for 1996 include market expansion, the
tariff system, foreign investment, the exchange of services and
government procurement policies.
</P>
<P>
The desire of Mercosur members to make improvements through
different mechanisms demonstrates their determination to push the
block ahead on a long-term strategic view instead of seeing it as
a temporary alignment, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Former Swedish PM Acquitted of Crimes in Credit Card Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Chief Prosecutor Jan
Danielsson today declared former Deputy Prime Minister Mona Sahlin
not guilty in a controversial "credit card scandal" after his
talks with Sahlin.
</P>
<P>
Sahlin's attorney said in a press bulletin that judicial
investigations on Sahlin may come to an end soon.
</P>
<P>
The former deputy prime minister charged with special
responsibility for equality issue was the only candidate for the
chairmanship of the Social Democratic Party before she stepped
down for alleged involvement in the "credit card scandal."
</P>
<P>
Last October, Swedish press disclosed that Sahlin had paid with
government credit card 25,000 Swedish Kronas (3,500 U.S. dollars)
for her spendings on private clothes, restaurant bills and car
rents.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors launched judicial investigations into the issue and
found that she used the credit card but paid off her debt soon
afterward.
</P>
<P>
The credit card drama is a matter of moral integrity, which did
not constitute a "crime," the prosecutors said.

BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of Commerce
has outlined temporary regulations on agricultural imports
originating from World Trade Organization (WTO) countries, a
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The temporary regulations outline Thailand's position on rules
of origin governing the import of 23 agricultural products, for
which Thailand has opened its market under WTO commitments.
</P>
<P>
The regulations gave details on calculation methods and
classification of the farm products.
</P>
<P>
Rules of origin define how much of a given product is derived,
produced or has been added in value by an exporting nation. It is
an important factor in international trade when determining the
quotas and tariffs for a product.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the temporary regulations are
necessary as the World Customs Organization, which oversees
regulations on import and export of the 23 products, is preparing
rules for all WTO countries.
</P>
<P>
The temporary regulations are subject to the Thai cabinet
approval.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition to Step up Monitoring Function </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Key members of the Thai
opposition parties have agreed that they will step up monitoring
the administration's performance.
</P>
<P>
Key figures of the four opposition parties, namely the
Democrat, the Chart Pattana (National Development), Seritham
(Freedom-Justice) and Solidarity, announced "the end to the
six-month honeymoon period with the government" after holding a
joint meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after months of the opposition's
seemingly lackluster efforts in its role and responsibility of
exercising its power in monitoring the executive's performance.
</P>
<P>
Seritham Party leader Arthit Ouairat said after the meeting
that the opposition would from now on step up its role in
overseeing the government's work after having given Banharn
Silpa-Archa-led government enough time to run the country without
intervention or any real serious criticism.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has also decided to send a fact-finding team to
London to dig up more information on the Kockrums submarine
scandal touse as the ammunition to torpedo the government,
possibly in a censure debate in March.
</P>
<P>
In the scandal, key members in Prime Minister Banharn's Chart
Thai (Thai Nation) Party have been accused of having accepted
bribery from the Swedish submarine exporter in the run-up to the
general election on July 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish company had hoped to increase its chance of winning
an order for two submarines which the Thai Navy has been
considering purchasing at a cost of 17 billion baht (680 million
US dollars).

WARSAW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jozef
Oleksy started a week-long vacation today amidst the political
storm caused by allegations that he was a Moscow spy.
</P>
<P>
"Whether he will return to work after the vacation depends on
the development of the situation," said a government spokesman at
a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Oleksy did not think about resignation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Luczak will be in charge of
the government during Oleksy's absence, an official statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Former Polish president Lech Walesa accused Oleksy of serving
the Soviet and Russian intelligence three days before the swear-in
ceremony of President Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist
fellow of Oleksy.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy has admitted that he had good relationship with a
Russian diplomat, who later turned out to be a KGB agent, in the
1980s and 1990s, but he denied that he knew the diplomat's real
identification.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister denounced former president Lech Walesa's
charges as a "dirty provocation."
</P>
<P>
The Polish parliament has set up a special committee to
investigate into the matter.
</P>
<P>
Military prosecutors, who are examining the evidence against
Oleksy, asked the State Protection Office security service to
provide additional material by January 20 to decide whether to
launch a formal probe.

<HEADLINE> Australia Stock Exchange Enhances International Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Stock Exchange
(ASX) has tried to step up its bid to become the Asia-Pacific
region's financial center by linking with the New Zealand Stock
Exchange (NZSE).
</P>
<P>
The Trans Tasman Index, or TT100, was launched on Monday for
calculating the weighted index of 100 top stocks both in Australia
and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The two stock exchanges are linked with a computerized system
which provides real-time data about stock prices in both markets
during trading days.
</P>
<P>
TT100 is designed to encourage people to think of the two stock
exchanges as a whole rather than two separate markets, today's
Australian Financial Review reported.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the TT100 index was only part of ASX's
long-term strategy to establish an automated, internationally
integrated market with almost 24-hour trading.
</P>
<P>
The ASX is planning to develop a Pan-Asian Index, an integrated
price index of all major stocks in five to six Asian stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the Jakarta Stock Exchange of
Indonesia had contacted ASX on the Pan-Asian Index. AXS sources
said that an agreement on creating a uniform index might be
finalized among some regional stock exchanges by mid 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ASX is considering extending its trading hours to
accommodate trade in Southeast Asia and New Zealand. ASX chairman
Maurice Newman said that international cooperation was a natural
development for stock exchanges in the region.
</P>
<P>
"What we have been able to achieve between Australia and New
Zealand is technologically achievable with any other nation," said
Richard Humphry, managing director of the ASX.
</P>
<P>
In order to compete with other regional stock exchanges such as
those in Singapore and Hong Kong, the ASX has taken major efforts
in improving market liquidity and cutting cost. It realized
paperless settlement last year with the completion of its Clearing
House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS).
</P>
<P>
It is expected to begin to adopt T+3 practice this year. Under
T+3 settlement discipline, transfer of securities between brokers
must be carried out on the third business day after the stocks are
traded.
</P>
<P>
In a trend of internationalization of world financial markets,
investors are comparing different stock markets in search for
those that have the highest liquidity, lowest cost and minimum
risk.
</P>
<P>
With its automatic stock trading and settlement systems, the
ASX has been able to cut its fees to a competitive level compared
with other regional bourses.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ASX is striving to provide more security
products for overseas investors. It has become the most active
derivatives market in Australia.
</P>
<P>
In the next step of the launch of the TT100 index, it will
create derivatives based on the index. It is also planning to
develop a number of derivatives based on its ambitious Pan-Asian
Index.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 20 percent of the total annual
turnover of Australian securities is traded in stock markets
outside Australia. So the ASX is determined not only to retain its
share of the local security market, but push for more shares in
the Asia-Pacific financial market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers' Life Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's agricultural reform over
the past 17 years has largely promoted the development of the
rural economy and improved farmers' life, official sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that farmers in parts of China's rural areas
now live a comparatively comfortable life, while in most of the
countryside the farmers are having adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the per capita income for farmers is expected to reach
more than 1,550 yuan, discounted for inflation, roughly four times
the 1978 figure, according to the latest estimates of the Ministry
of Agriculture. Farmers are earning more money from
non-agricultural activities, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the non-agricultural income for farmers accounted for
about 31 percent of their total income, compared with 7.6 percent
17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of income, the consumption of farmers has also
increased by a large margin. They are now eating more more edible
oil and more meat compared with several years ago, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Also, rural residents are paying more attention to improving
their housing. Statistics show that last year the per capita
housing space of rural residents was 20 sq m, 2.6 times the 1978
figure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, electric fans, washing machines, refrigerators,
motorcycles and color TV sets have become common in rural families.
</P>
<P>
China has also witnessed rapid growth of rural bank
deposits. In 1994 such deposits in the Agricultural Bank of China
and credit co-operatives reached 837.7 billion yuan, up from 9.96
billion yuan in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Ministry of Agriculture admitted that there
are still some problems in the countryside, noting that though
Chinese rural residents enjoy a better life, the growth rate of
the income of the farmers is still low.
</P>
<P>
According to a government plan, by the year 2000 all Chinese
will lead comparatively comfortable lives, which requires that the
real growth rate for farmers' incomes in the next five years
should not be lower than 6.9 percent. The growth rate for farmers'
incomes in 1995 was five percent, still 1.9 percentage points
lower than the planned target.
</P>
<P>
Though difficulties are ahead in achieving, by and large, a
comparatively comfortable life for rural China, there exist good
chances for the country's agricultural development, and the
Chinese government will continue to give first priority to the
sector of the Chinese economy.

<HEADLINE> Honduran President Satisfied With Amnesty to Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tegucigalpa, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Honduran President Carlos
Roberto Reina has stunned Hondurans by saying he is satisfied with
the amnesty granted to servicemen blamed for the "disappearance"
of hundreds of people during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Reina, a former President of the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights, has been a staunch critic of human rights violations and
political crimes throughout his 50-year political career. Many
Hondurans believed it unlikely anyone would receive an official
pardon for such crimes from the present government.
</P>
<P>
The president said: "the court has done the right thing, and
this is a road which leads to the reconciliation of the Honduran
family."
</P>
<P>
Reconciliation is the most important thing in Honduras at
present, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Reina, who became president in November 1993, warned that
all those who are not covered by this amnesty will have to face
justice eventually since the amnesty has not been given to
felonies outside the political atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Reina, making the statement at a New Year church mass, also
promised to pay compensation to the families of 187 people who
disappeared during the last decade and to build a monument
dedicated to them with their names engraved on it.
</P>
<P>
The "disappearance" of Honduran citizens in the 1980s was
related to the armed forces and right-wing "death squads",
according to human rights organizations including Inter-American
Court of Human Rights and Amnesty International.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed to Acquire Bulk of Loral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Military contractor
Lockheed Martin Corp. is to buy the bulk of aerospace electronics
manufacturer Loral Corp. in a deal worth more than 10 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement announced today by both companies, Lockheed
Martin will acquire Loral's defense electronics and system
integration business for about 9.1 billion dollars, including 2.1
billion dollars of assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
The deal, the largest in the defense industry, will put Loral's
business in Lochheed's arsenal with an expected annual revenue of
30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition is another major consolidation in the defense
business. Lockheed Martin was created last year through the 10
billion dollar merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corp.
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Northrop Grumman Corp. purchased the defense
electronics holdings of Westinghouse Electric Corp. for about 3
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic combination with Loral solidifies Lockheed
Martin's leadership position as a world premier high technology
company," said Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin, with an annual sales of 23 billion dollars, is
organized in five business sectors including aeronautics,
electronics, energy and environment, information and technology
services, and space and strategic missiles.
</P>
<P>
Loral, which has sales of 6.7 billion dollars a year, produces
a variety of defense and aerospace-related computer systems
including radar jamming electronics for jet fighters, aircraft
data and voice recorders, and air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
When the transaction is completed, the Loral business units
will constitute a sixth sector, tactical systems, of Lockheed.
And the companies expect to complete the transaction by the end of
next month.
</P>
<P>
The remaining satellite and telecommunications businesses of
New York-based Loral will be reorganized into a new company,
called Loral Space and Communications Corp. Lockheed Martin is
also buying a 20 percent stake of the company.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updated with new figures hke -- Heavy Snow Paralyzes US East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The worst snow in 70 years
paralyzed most parts of the eastern United States today, closing
government offices, schools and airports. At least 40 deaths were
blamed on the blizzard.
</P>
<P>
The storm buried Philadelphia with 30 inches of snow and dumped
over 27 inches in New York City. In Washington, D.C., snow reached
a record of 25 inches before the sky cleared just before noon.
</P>
<P>
Knee-deep snow kept most of workers at home and prevented
children from going to school. Only emergency vehicles were
allowed on many highways and New York Streets. Some roads were
blocked by roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
Much of the Federal government was shut down again today, but
this time by Mother nature, not by a budget impasse that
furloughed thousands of government employees for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government's Office of Personnel Management said the only
people expected to report to duty today were those needed for law
enforcement, hospitals and other emergency work.
</P>
<P>
Most state offices and schools were closed today, as were many
businesses in the region. New York City canceled classes for the
first time since 1978. The United Nations was also closed.
</P>
<P>
The New York Mercantile Exchange and the New York Commodity
Exchange were shut down. The New York, American and Nasdaq stock
exchange opened, but were one and a half hours late and the
sessions were brief.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said at least 40 deaths were blamed
on the storm, thousands were left without power, and any travel -
by plane, train or automobile - was nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
Major airports for Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark,
and New York City shut down and converted their waiting areas into
overnight shelters for stranded passengers. There was no word when
the airports will open again.
</P>
<P>
At New York's airports, drifts were as high as 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
Governors declared states of emergency in all or parts of
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New
York, New Jersey and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore region got 23 inches of snow. Weather service
said there hadn't been that much snow in the area since January
1922. But most of the snow was in the Appalachians mountain area
in West Virginia, whose Webster County got as much as 43 inches of
snow.
</P>
<P>
In northern Virginia, some residents ventured to go outdoors
and began digging out their cars buried under knee-deep snow as
the sun came out in the afternoon. But in Boston, the heavy snow
was till continuing.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke: U.S. Seeks to Open Office in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) - The United States wants to
open an office in the Serbian province of Kosovo bordering
Albania, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and chief negotiator
for the region Richard Holbrooke said here today.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who brokered the Bosnian peace agreement last
November, said that the U.S. government has been holding
extensive talks with Serbian President Slobodon Milosevic for
opening the office.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to try to establish in the very near future a
United States official presence in the capital of Kosovo,"
Prishtina, Holbrooke said in an interview with the Voice of
America.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke disclosed that the office might be run by the U.S.
Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the U.S. office would help reduce tension
surrounding Kosovo, an autonomous province whose population of two
millions is 90 percent Albanian.
</P>
<P>
Albania has criticized Belgrade for settling large numbers of
Croatian Serb refugees in the province, warning that the move
could trigger open conflicts between Serbs and Albanians living in
the region and require Albania to respond.
</P>
<P>
While attacking "the oppression of the people there by the
Serbs," Holbrooke said that the United States acknowledged that
Kosovo was part of the "Serbia-Montenegro political structure."
</P>
<P>
"The United States is not seeking or supporting its
independence. We are simply seeking -- and this is essential --
the equitable treatment of its people in terms of human rights,"
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. negotiator is going to the Balkan capitals later this
week to prepare for U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the
region. The White House has announced that Clinton is scheduled to
visit Bosnia before January 23 to see the on-going deployment of
the American peace implementation force there.

<P>
ZAGREB, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Apache helicopters,
which are equipped with TV cameras and heat sensors, were flown to
Sarajevo to deter snipers from attacking NATO peacekeepers,
according to reports reaching here from Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
NATO, in Bosnia to implement the Dayton peace agreement, made
the decision after a series of attacks on aircraft and shooting
incidents in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an Italian soldier was wounded in Sarajevo, a French
plane hit by bullets and a U.S. C-130 aircraft threatened by small
arms fire. Meanwhile, British soldiers were repeatedly attacked in
central Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Rayner said the attacks,
which have not been blamed on any of the former warring sides,
were sporadic but NATO wanted to show it could not be pushed
around before the trickle of incidents turned into a serious
challenge.

<HEADLINE> Cities Halt Commercial Showing of Laser Disks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The commercial showing of laser
disks (LDs) has basically stopped in most Chinese cities,
according to an investigation by Xinhua reporters.
</P>
<P>
Reporters made the investigation last week in cities throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
In Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province, a dozen
salons which had previously shown LDs commercially have stopped
showing them.
</P>
<P>
The manager of one of the salons told reporters that he had not
previously known that the business violated the copyright
law. However, now that the government has publicized this fact, he
said, he has no choice but to obey the law.
</P>
<P>
Su Jie, a reporter with Xinhua's Fuzhou Bureau, found no
cinemas or other locations showing LDs or compact disks (CDs) in
the capital city of Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The manager of an audio and video shop in Kunming, capital of
the southwestern province of Yunnan, told Xinhua reporter Li
Zhilang that authorized products will have a bigger market from
now on, dealing a blow to the pirates.
</P>
<P>
A manager of the New Construction Cinema in the city told Li
that he ordered his staff to show authorized films only after he
read the new regulation in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
In the northern port city of Tianjin supervisors have been sent
to CD and LD factories to monitor their production, ensuring they
have been granted proper authorization.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing and Shanghai film makers told Xinhua that the move
has encouraged them, as they expect more people to return to
cinemas to watch domestically-made movies.
</P>
<P>
However, reporters found two shops still had some stockpiles of
pirated CDs and LDs. Public security officers and culture
officials accompanying the reporters immediately closed them.
</P>
<P>
China began on January 1 this year to ban the commercial
showing of feature film CDs and LDs in an effort to bring an end
to rampant infringement upon copyrights in this field.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Culture Ministry said that almost every Chinese
city has followed the regulation.
</P>
<P>
An official said that the places, particularly Guangdong and
Hainan provinces, where piracy was rampant previously, have
adopted tough measures to enforce the crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Budget Talks Resume at White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and congressional Republican leaders resumed talks on Monday to
try to reach agreement on balancing budget in seven years.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
and other congressional leaders from both parties met for about
four hours among themselves and with Clinton and his aides.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said that overall the
two sides continued to move closer to their mutual goal of a
seven-year plan for balancing the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
Another round of talks has been scheduled for Tuesday, McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's talks were the negotiators' first since Clinton
unveiled his proposal for balancing the budget in seven years
using conservative Congressional Budget Office economic
accounting.
</P>
<P>
The Republican leaders arrived at the White House today with a
plan that would scale back 63 billion dollars from their proposed
savings on Medicare and Medicaid over seven years.
</P>
<P>
After they had met for more than two hours, the White House
spokesman said the talks were "at a point where they're either
going to get an agreement or they're not. It's not going to drag
on for another number of weeks."
</P>
<P>
House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, described
the new Republican offer as "essentially a last offer." "There is
virtually no flexibility left in any of these numbers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dole told the Senate during a break from the talks that
"There's a spirit of cooperation and credible negotiation" at the
White House meeting that Republican leaders found encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Dole said on the Senate floor that while there was no deal so
far, talks would continue "as long as there is some spirit of
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich called Clinton's balanced budget helpful but
grudgingly offered.
</P>
<P>
The two sides differed sharply over the size and shape of
prospective tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, furloughed government workers headed back to their
jobs, except those in Washington and elsewhere stranded by
snowstorms.

<HEADLINE> International Scientific Exchanges Brisk in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
is utilizing various international channels to import and export
advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, according
to the provincial commission of science and technological
co-operation, the province reported some 1,100 projects for
international scientific co-operation and exchanges, sent abroad
nearly 2,000 people for academic exchanges and imported more than
200 technicians. At present, Hunan has set up stable scientific
co-operative relations with more than 40 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The province attracts scientific workers, entrepreneurs and
financiers with its rich natural resources and academic
achievements. The Japanese government has decided to grant a loan
of 1.1 billion Japanese yen to a water conservancy and
agricultural development project in Yuanjiang City.
</P>
<P>
International exchanges have also alleviated the funding
pressure on the province. The Medical College of Hunan has
acquired one million US dollars-worth of scientific instruments
and funds from abroad over the past two years, with which a number
of high-level scientific achievements have been scored.
</P>
<P>
Last September the province held an international show of
China's latest technology and products. Scientific institutes from
the United States, Germany, Hungary and Italy displayed some 300
new-technology and products. The show concluded with more than
three million US dollars-worth of technology transacted.

<TEXT>
<P>
At about 7:00 AM, children have their breakfast, which usually
consists of porridge, dumplings and steamed bread, Wang explained,
adding that 80 children under the age of five are given milk and
eggs.
</P>
<P>
At 8:15 AM, 48 mentally-retarded children aged 8-16 attend a
special class while 40 other children, aged 4-7, are being taught
in another classroom.
</P>
<P>
At 10:30, the children begin their lunch, which consists of
rice, meat, vegetables and soup, after which they take a nap until
2:00 PM, followed by two hours of physical education that includes
jogging, a tug-of-war, or other games.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xu said that at 4:00 PM supper is served, and is much the
same as what they have for lunch. They then watch TV, eat some
candy or fruit at 7:00, and go to bed at 8:00.
</P>
<P>
According to two doctors at the institute, children eat better
than average residents in nearby rural areas and their nutrition
is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xu said that the institute has 13 teachers, three doctors,
and three nurses and tailors. On average every child has six suits
of clothing.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jingui, another child-care worker, told the reporter that
some older children not only wash their clothing and bowls
themselves, but also help others who have difficulty in walking.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, ten children doing well in their studies
have been sent to study in a township-run middle school about two
km from the institute. On the way to school, those children who
can walk well push the wheelchairs of children with leg
deformities.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, the institute is intended for
children under the age of 16 only. But, in some cases, it
continues to support those who are enrolled in high schools or
schools of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
A poem by one of the children goes like this:
</P>
<P>
 I am a handicapped orphan,
</P>
<P>
 Here in this institute I receive maternal and fatherly love.
</P>
<P>
 We're studying in a bright and spacious classroom,
</P>
<P>
 We're chasing each other around a beautiful lawn;
</P>
<P>
 We all say that the orphanage is our home.

<HEADLINE> "The Orphanage Is Our Home" (1)  -- Children in the Hangzhou Welfare Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua Correspondent Zhang Qizhi) -- On a
warm winter day, a group of children -- some in wheelchairs, some
walking with crutches -- could be seen playing merrily on the lawn
near some castle-like villas.
</P>
<P>
When one child fell down, a middle-aged women hurried up to
help him get back up, saying: "Don't I always tell you to walk
slowly, but you don't listen. Next time, I hope you'll remember."
</P>
<P>
This scene was one this reporter saw at the Hangzhou Welfare
Institute for Children here in the capital of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The institute is on 15,000 sq m of ground surrounded by an
orchard, 15 km from downtown Hangzhou. It is home to 250 orphans
and handicapped children, including 100 who are severely
mentally-handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The director of the institute, Wang Xu, is a woman in her 40's,
who explains that the institute was founded by the French in 1869
and was taken over by the Hangzhou City government in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Sitting and knitting on a red wool sweater, she said, "My
institute now provides medical care, treatment, and education to
handicapped children," then added with a smile, "All 87 workers in
the institute are busy knitting sweaters for our children."
</P>
<P>
Chen Jin, a young child-care worker, commented, "They have lost
their homes and their parents. They are the most unhappy children
in the world. Yet here they can expect maternal love from us."
</P>
<P>
Three month ago a handicapped child had an operation on his
urinary tract. While the child was in hospital, Chen looked after
him round the clock for several days. Her fiance also came to help
her.
</P>
<P>
Every child-care worker serves as the children's mother and
teacher, Wang Xu noted. Child-care workers are also required to
teach the children how to take care of themselves, as well as
support and protect themselves. "In short, we encourage them to be
strong-willed," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the presence of a child-care worker, a
three-year-old girl, her hands grasping the bannisters of a
staircase, inched up step by step from the first floor to the
third floor. Her face was red with exertion and her nurse's face
was perspiring.

<HEADLINE> Wool Prices Expected To Rally in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices are
expected to rally as the market started the new year trading
today.
</P>
<P>
Wool International (WI), the Australian sales body in charge of
disposing the country's huge wool stockpile, hoped that the prices
would go up this year.
</P>
<P>
Bob Richardson, WI managing director, said that there was a
strong demand on international market after the three-week
Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
WI has sold 120,000 of the 187,000 bales of wool it is required
to sell in the March quarter this year, today's Australian
Financial Review quoted Richardson as saying.
</P>
<P>
This helped ease the pressure on WI, which had to sell wool in
forward contracts at a discount of 30-40 US cents per kilogram
when wool prices plummeted by 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Wool prices closed at 612 cents per kilogram clean at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
WI expected wool prices to move between 610 cents and 650 cents
in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that WI's forward sales at the discount price
would have a "minimal impact on the market, while increasing
demand from China was very reassuring to wool growers."
</P>
<P>
But the overall picture of international wool market is still
bleak, while a "second stockpile" is emerging in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Falling prices in the second half of last year prompted wool
growers and brokers to withhold wool from the market. Now there
are about one million bales of wool in the hand of wool brokers, a
third of the size of the old stockpile.
</P>
<P>
Australian wool growers have reduced the number of sheep this
year. Some local experts predicted that as world demand increased
and stockpile ran out, the market would face a sudden shortfall of
wool supply in the medium term.

<HEADLINE> Monte Carlo Rally Still Attractive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Monte Carlo Rally will not be
part of the World Championship this year, while race organisers
expressed their confidence that the race would still draw plenty
of participants.
</P>
<P>
The four-day event starting on January 22 will be restricted
to two-litre non-turbo cars, paving the way for a new-look World
Championship in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Two other races, the Tour of Corsica and the season-ending RAC
Rally in Britain, will also be outside the World Championship
this year.
</P>
<P>
"We don't really mind as we'll have 150 participants," the
Winter Classical Rally spokesman Patrick Mannoury said.
</P>
<P>
German driver Armin Schwarz, who will drive a Toyota Celica,
become the top favourite.
</P>
<P>
Toyota will be hoping for a good showing after being banned
from the World Championship for using illegal turbo-restrictors
in the Catalonia Rally in Spain in October.
</P>
<P>
Francois Delecour of France, winner in 1994, will turn to be
Schwarz's archrival.
</P>
<P>
The Former Ford driver will enter the race in a new Peugeot
306. Peugeot is returning to the Monte Carlo event after a
10-year absence.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court Monday
rejected an appeal by former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson who
wanted to overturn his rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 29, who has won two bouts since his release from prison,
was found guilty of raping Desiree Washington, a then 18-year-old
beauty pageant contestant, in his Indianapolis hotel room in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was released from an Indiana prison March 25 after
serving about three years of his six-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
In his Supreme Court appeal claiming that his constitutional
rights had been violated, Tyson challenged the state system under
which prosecutors have the power to help select the judge who
presided over his trial.
</P>
<P>
Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz also
argued in the appeal that several defence witnesses had been
improperly excluded from testifying at the trial.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court denied Tyson's appeal without
comment.

GUANGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China has made notable progress in curbing random collection of
fees in rural areas, relieving farmers of a nearly
300-million-yuan financial burden in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, the province's farmers have public
fees of less than 2 percent of the average per capita income, far
below the state ceiling of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
To lighten farmers' burden, the provincial government made
explicit stipulations that all fund-collection activities launched
by various localities should be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The province also set up a special office in charge of curbing
random collection of fees from farmers, focusing on the cost of
electricity, fees for purchase and marketing of farm products,
marriage registration fees, and fees for handling labor
certificates.
</P>
<P>
Most cities and counties in the province set up telephones for
farmers to help report on random collection of fees in the rural

URUMQI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A new tourism route designed by
Chinese Vice-premier Zhu Rongji in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region will open to travellers this coming
spring, said Abulat Abdurixit, chairman of the Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "World Wonder" route will cover scenic spots such
as Tianchi (Heaven Lake) in the Tianshan Mountains, Huoyan
(flaming) Mountain, Karez, the mosque in Turfan, ancient cities in
Jiaohe and Gaochang, the Taklimakan Desert, and the grape corridor
in Hetian.
</P>
<P>
"Hetian alone has such things as a 1,500 km grave corridor, a
number of 500-year-old fig trees, and 500-year-old walnut trees,"
Zhu Rongji said when making an inspection tour of Xinjiang last
September.
</P>
<P>
Cultural relics, the desert, rare animals and plants, a unique
mountainous landscape, and local customs in the region will make
the tourism route more attractive, experts said.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdurixit, travellers from Hong Kong, Macao, and
Taiwan can make a visit there for less than 2,000 US dollars.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Not to Stop Serbs Moving Property out of Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The commander of NATO-led IFOR
troops in Bosnia Admiral Leighton Smith said today the Serbs in
Sarajevo who wish to move away would be allowed to take their
property with them.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR would in no way obstruct the lawful movement of any
citizen or deprive them of the right to take away with them any
personal property, Smith said after meeting with the Serb
parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik today in Pale, the stronghold
of the Serbs in the south suburb of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Serbs living in Sarajevo have fled to other Serb
places in the past few weeks before the five Serb Sarajevo
districts are placed under the Muslim-Croat rule after March 19
under the peace agreement. Fearing possible retaliation from their
former enemy, more of the 120,000 population in the affected parts
are ready to leave, making a mass exodus looming.
</P>
<P>
The Serb news agency SRNA said that at the meeting today,
Krajisnik again conveyed to Smith the strong concerns of the Serbs
about the fate of the Serb Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbs want a political settlement because they want to
stay on in the city and they do not accept Muslim authority," the
Serb official said.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnic has demanded earlier the delay for the transfer of
the Serb sectors but the request was turned down by the commanders
of the IFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said the international community had been protecting
the Muslims in Sarajevo for three and half years, but now was
turning a deaf ear to the pleas of the Sarajevo Serbs in their
hour of need.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic also said today
that the Serbs in Sarajevo would neither leave their homeland nor
accept the Muslim rule in the capital city, according to SRNA.

<HEADLINE> UK Consumer Spending Revives at the End of 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A pick-up in British consumer
spending at the end of last year emerges today with figures
showing that borrowing on credit cards rose in November.
</P>
<P>
Lending for the purchase of second-hand cars also expanded,
with a 21 percent growth of finance for used-cars, suggesting that
the car market is gradually reviving.
</P>
<P>
The data, from the Finance and Leasing Association, is likely
to fuel hopes in the City that the recent Christmas holiday
triggered an upsurge in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The association found that the use of plastic cards in November
shot to 610 million pounds (946 million US dollars), a 16 percent
leap from last time.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the data showed that finance for investment provided
by finance and leasing companies rose by 16 percent in the year to
November.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, strongly
believes that consumer sentiment and spending is set to improve.
</P>
<P>
But many City economists believe Clarke's aarcasts are
over-optimistic. However, most suspect that there has already been
some pick up over Christmas, not least because anecdotal evidence
suggests retail sales have been fairly strong.

BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Implementation
Force IFOR warned all parties in Bosnia today that IFOR would
respond severely to any attacks on its troops in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Fire will be returned and it will be lethal," Tanjug news
agency quoted IFOR spokesman in Sarajevo Col. Mark Rayner as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached after two gunshots were fired at the

</P>
<P>
Rayner said that attacks had been sporadic, and none of the
parties were blamed, but NATO would not wait for incidents to grow
into a menacing danger.

Attacks on IFOR soldiers have become quite frequent recently.
IFOR troops were shot at for six times in the past four days and
there were no official confirmation who was responsible for the
attacks.

Heavily-armed 60,000-strong IFOR began to pour into Bosnia in
mid-December and their deployment will be completed by the end of
this month to enforce the peace agreement signed in Paris last
month.

Two Apache helicopters, equipped with guns, television cameras
and heat sensors, patrolled the skies over Sarajevo today.
</P>

Meanwhile, a joint Bosnian Serb-IFOR commission said in a

soldiers on January 6 near Sanski Most in western Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic: Serbs Not to Accept Muslim Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic said today Serbs would neither leave Sarajevo nor accept
Muslim authority in the city, according to the Serb news agency
SRNA.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic made the remarks at a meeting with intellectuals in
the Serb part of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnian peace agreement, five Serb-held Sarajevo
suburbs will be reverted to the control of the Muslim-Croat
federation by March 19. The Serb authority has been opposed to the
handover of their land to their former enemy.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic said, "The Serb Sarajevans cannot free themselves of a
feeling of insecurity, so we must devise a solution together."
</P>
<P>
The Serb leadership has asked for the delay of the transfer
till the end of September on the ground that the Serbs need
transitional period. But the demand was turned down by the
NATO-led Implementation Force, IFOR, commanders.
</P>
<P>
If the Serbs were to leave, Izetbegovic would settle a million
to 1.5 million Muslims in Sarajevo and the nearby town of Visoki,
the Serb leader said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not leave and we do not accept Muslim authority, and
the international community is obliged to settle the problem," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the Serb authority has threatened that
if the peace agreement relating to Sarajevo problem was not
changed, the 120,000 Serbs in the affected Sarajevo sectors would
all leave their homeland. Hundreds of Serb Sarajevans have already
fled to other Serb territories in the past few weeks and more are
ready to leave. A mass exodus in Serb part Sarajevo is looming
large with intransigence by the international community and the
deadline of transfer approaches.

<HEADLINE> British, Dutch Shares Surge On Oil Price Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Stocks in London and Amsterdam
rose to record highs today as the markets were driven by the oil
price boom, but other major European bourses ended lower.
</P>
<P>
The world oil price surged near the two-year highs as news
struck the markets that the eastern United States was hit by the
worst snowstorms in decades.
</P>
<P>
The world's benchmark Brent crude futures for February delivery
closed in London at 19.22 U.S. dollars a barrel, up 17 cents from
Friday and near the 1994/95 highs of 19.38 and 19.41 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
London, Europe's largest stock market, was mainly boosted by
oil shares, which pushed the Financial Times Stock Exchange index
of 100 leading shares to a record close of 3,720.6, up 16.1 points
and beyond the previous record of 3,715.6 set on January 3.
</P>
<P>
But trading was restrained by the unclear prospect of the U.S.
budget talks. Dealers said they would not expect stronger
performance of the shares market until the budget stalemate was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam bourse also benefited from oil shares. Its AEX index
shot up 1.21 percent to a record close of 503.66.
</P>
<P>
But other European exchanges failed to keep the momentum of the
new year rally. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished down 1.16 at
1,916.56.  The Frankfurt DAX-30 index was down 8.40 at 2,323.48.

<HEADLINE> New Party To Push for Peace In Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A small party in Angola today
called on the European and African countries which have close
ties with Angola to lend new incentives to the peace process in
the war-torn nation.
</P>
<P>
The Angola Social Democratic Party said in a communique
released here that it would be on top of the party's agenda in
1996 to persuade these countries to do so.
</P>
<P>
The recent release of 361 POWs of the UNITA rebels by the
government marked a big step forward to the implementation of the
1995 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But the peace process was so far still held back by sporadic
fightings, bickering at each other over arms buying and
employment of foreign mercenaries, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party was established in November,
1989 and was granted a legal status in 1992. It won one seat at
the multi-party parliamentary elections in October the same year.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Slashes White Afrikaner Homeland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki today voiced the government's strong opposition to the idea
of so-called Afrikaner self-determination which he said would
tear apart South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The route to address what they (the Freedom Front) see as
Afrikaner self-determination is not via the establishment of a
Volkstaat (white homeland)," said Mbeki in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Expanding on the 84th anniversary statement of the ruling
party, the African National Congress (ANC), Mbeki raised concern
over the so-called Afrikaner language and culture.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want destruction of the Afrikaner language or
culture. But we are saying: You cannot take the route of
establishing ethnic or racial states as party of the solution,"
said Mbeki, adding "that route is not on."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the ANC is continuing discussions with the
Freedom Front.
</P>
<P>
Afrikaner, Dutch descendants of the South African whites, had
been demanding the establishment of an independent Volkstaat in
the country.

Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has been put in charge of
enclosing the territorial group in Kizlyar, while Daghestan's
State Council Chairman Magomedali Magomedov has been ordered to
negotiate with the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
All the orders were issued after an emergency meeting was held
this morning in the Kremlin, during which Yeltsin discussed with
his Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin abd "power ministers" how
to deal with the Kizlyar crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 Chechen militants stormed into Kizlyar in northern
Daghestan bodering on Chechnya early this morning, and took some
3,000 hostages, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The militants headed by Salman Raduyev, 28, the son-in-law of
rebel Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev, demand that Russian
troops be pulled out not only from Chechnya, but also from the
entire North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
They threaten to kill the hostages kept in a city hospital and
two adjacent buildings in the town of population of some 400,000
people. Before two rounds of negotiations between the Russian
authorities' representatives and the Chechen terrorists were held
in the hospital this afternoon, first two hostages were killed.
</P>
<P>
Fierce street battle resumed in the town after the first round
of talks yielded no result. The talks restarted at about 19:00
Moscow time (16:00 GMT) at the hospital territory after shooting
in the area was suspended.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, tens of the terrorists were
killed in the fighting around the hospital, while five Daghestani
police officers and five civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's First Deputy Oleg Soskovets told reporters here
tonight that the government is taking urgent measures.
</P>
<P>
Special operations units have been rushed from Moscow to
Kizlyar, the city in Russia's component republic of Daghestan, the
official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The special force of the Federal Security Service's (FSB)
anti-terrorism center is led by FSB First Deputy director
Colonel-General Viktor Zorin, the source added.
</P>

around Chechnya. Police patrols have been reinforced with armored
vehicles and communication equipment.

here tonight, Russian Nationalities and Regional Policy Minister
Vyacheslav Mikhailov said Moscow will use both talks and force in
solving the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Kizlyar seizure clearly resembles the attack on Budennovsk
in southern Russia last summer where Chechen militants under
command of terrorist Shamir Basayev killed over a hundred
civilians and took over a thousand hostage.
</P>
<P>
The attack made Chernomyrdin personally hold talks with Basayev
to free the hostages. In exchange the Chechen militants were
allowed to escape and peace talks began in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Illegal Immigration challenges S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Increasing Illegal
immigration was challenging South Africa, Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi rang the warning bell here today.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is now before the cabinet," Buthelezi told a press
conference after meeting with Thomas Constantine, head of the
United States Drug Enforcement Agency.
</P>
<P>
Suspended repatriation of Mozambican refugees from the country
was a major cause, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the overall picture of the illegal aliens in
the country, Buthelezi said: "It is definitely getting worse."
</P>
<P>
An estimated three million illegal immigrants are believed to
be staying in South Africa, creating related problem of
cross-border drug dealings.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said a South African official delegation was
expected to visit the United States this month to learn ways to
curb cross-border drug dealings and the related problem of
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, comprising a Home Affairs official and members
of the South African National Defense Force and the police, will
spend about 10 days in the US.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot we can learn from them to equip our own people
to deal better with this problem," said the Minister, adding the
United States had extensive experience with illegal immigration
from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
However, Constantine said the combination of drug smuggling
and illegal immigration across the 1,600 km U.S. border with
Mexico was the source of about 75 percent of cocaine entering
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the immigration service in our country has been
doubled over the last three or four years," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Soldiers Held Hostage In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Some Nigerian soldiers serving in
the west African peace-keeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG
are still being held hostage by an armed faction there, the
Nigerian military confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen, the Director of Defense Information, Fred
Chijuka, said that efforts were being made to secure their
release.
</P>
<P>
Fighters of the Krahn wing of the United Liberation Movement
for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO-J) began attacking the ECOMOG
troops in Tubmanburg, some 60 kilometers northwest of Liberian
capital Monrovia on December 28. They were later driven back.
</P>
<P>
Chijuka said that the actual number of those killed by the
rebels could only be confirmed when all those kidnaped had been
returned to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian defense headquarters last week confirmed that
three Nigerian soldiers had been killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman stressed that Nigeria had not increased
its troops in Liberia, although the Economic Community of West
African States had asked Nigeria for more soldiers to facilitate
the disarmament of the armed factions under the Abuja peace
accord signed by all parties in the Liberian conflict last
August.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently has about 6,000 solders in the ECOMOG peace
force, which was sent to Liberia in 1990 by the Economic
Community of West African States.
