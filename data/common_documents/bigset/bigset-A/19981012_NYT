AL LEWIS, `MUNSTERS' GRADPA, MAKES A QUIXOTIC BID FOR GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Afew days before Election Day, one of the candidates
for governor of New York will defy basic political strategy by
going to New Jersey. There, he will don a vampire's cape, apply
enough makeup for a suitably ghoulish cast, and help the Fairfield
Garden Center promote its sale of Halloween costumes and lawn
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the scheduling challenges for Al Lewis, the Green Party
gubernatorial candidate for now, Grandpa Munster forever. October
was his busy season well before he aspired to elected office, and
he has places to go: a New Jersey garden center, a Minnesota mall,
even some gig at a haunted house in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done these, God knows, how many times,'' said the
candidate, in that streetwise voice so eerily familiar. ``If they
don't pay, I don't go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis never disrespects the bumbling vampire he portrayed
more than 30 years ago on ``The Munsters'' television series. It
has paid his bills, brought him international fame and lately given
him the opportunity to promote _ sometimes eloquently, other times
nastily _ a contrarian world view shaped by 88 years of knocking
around. He was 24 years old when his Democratic opponent, Peter
Vallone, was born, and 35 when Gov. George Pataki, the Republican
incumbent, came into this world.
</P>
<P>
   He spends part of each day signing autographs, waving to people
who call out ``Grandpa,'' answering expressions of love from
strangers with exhalations of ``Yeah, yeah'' and ``God bless.'' But
he is just as likely to rage against General Electric's pollution
of the Hudson River, recite statistics suggesting that the poor pay
too much in taxes, or dismiss those who disagree with him as fools
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   And while he may dodge the occasional question _ about his
educational background, for example _ Lewis readily volunteers
information that other candidates might keep to themselves. ``Are
you then going to tell me that I am also a friend of what some
people label America's greatest pornographer, Al Goldstein?'' he
snapped. ``Yes, I am! I've never denied that. Am I also a friend of
John Gotti? Yes! He's a man who, whenever I was in his company,
treated me with respect _ never belittled me, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   With piercing eyes in perpetual squint and with sideburns that
burst from his jowls like exploding pillows, Lewis looks very much
like a man who once concocted tonics in a bathtub by night, then
touted the restorative powers of the beverage by day. Back then, he
called himself ``The Professor.'' At various points in his life of
wandering, he has also worked as a circus roustabout, a merchant
seaman, a restaurateur, and, of course, a character actor for radio
and television.
</P>
<P>
   But it was by landing the role of Grandpa Munster, from 1964 to
1966, that Lewis earned his curious niche in the public
consciousness; he calls it ``jerkumstances.'' Now, through the
wonders of satellite dishes and reruns, he is seen, again and
again, mouthing the same sitcom lines, turning into the same rubber
bat on a string. ``If we went to Tokyo, Milan, Paris, Marseilles,
Glasgow or Prague,'' he said, ``all they'd yell is, `Grandpa!'''
</P>
<P>
   That one role spawned decades of appearances at Halloween
parties, autograph and memorabilia shows, children's programs and,
well, pretty much anything campy. A couple of years ago, he
appeared at a ``Mr. and Mrs. Nude'' contest at a nudist camp in
Indiana (``Nice people own it,'' he said). And he recently served
as master of ceremonies for the 30th anniversary party of Screw
magazine, the publication of his friend, Goldstein, the
pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is fine and good. But how did Al Lewis became a
gubernatorial candidate?
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Lewis ran his own weekly radio program on WBAI, a
format that allowed him to drop his Grandpa routine and share
political views shaped largely by his mother, a garment worker who
made sure he attended the annual May Day rallies in Union Square
Park. ``You want to lay blame for what I have to say?'' he asked.
``Blame it on my mother. Go to the cemetery in New Jersey and throw
rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of his populist ruminations reached several members of the
Green Party, which, like other minor political parties in New York,
are ever vigilant for candidates who might bring them the 50,000
votes needed to secure automatic placement on the ballot for the
next four years. And this year, the pressure on so-called third
parties is intense. A new party, the Working Families Party, has
emerged, and is backing Vallone, while the Liberal Party continues
to endorse Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross _ even though she lost the
Democratic primary and even though her wealthy husband, Wilbur
Ross, took back most of the roughly $4 million he had pledged to
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding acknowledged that these
circumstances require him to ``roll up my sleeves and work.'' But
he still had time to pass judgment on the Green Party's choice of
Lewis as its candidate for governor: ``What that represents is a
gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig Seeman, the Green Party official instrumental in
luring Lewis, said the actor's appeal went beyond his fame. Some
research found that he was also a longtime advocate of various
causes and had appeared at political rallies over the years. ``He's
very much green in his politics,'' Seeman said.
</P>
<P>
   After being approached by the Green Party in the spring, Lewis
consulted with his wife, Karen _ the director of Eviction
Intervention Services, a tenants' rights group in Manhattan _ and
his three sons. They told him to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Having humbly accepted the nomination, Lewis now travels around
the state, often at his own expense, talking green: for affordable
housing, community gardens and a clean environment; against
union-busting and the privatization of public hospitals. His
assessment of his rivals is succinct. Vallone, the New York City
Council Speaker, is ``a nice guy but a hack politician''; Pataki
is, simply, ``a potato head.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' quixotic campaign has had its share of setbacks and
discrepancies. He received some criticism, for example, for saying
he was 75 _ not 88 _ on a voter registration form. It was an error
of necessity, he explains, required to counter the rampant age
discrimination in the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   The most devastating hit came last week, when a state Supreme
Court justice refused to allow Lewis' name to appear on the ballot
as ``Grandpa Al Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of Elections, said
the board had opposed the request because ``it's our opinion that
people don't go around calling him `Grandpa Al Lewis' all the
time.''

CALIFORNIA DESERT KEY REGION IN EFFORT TO BUILD NEW SPACECRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM SKEEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The United States is about to embark on a revival
of experimental aircraft and Southern California's Antelope Valley
will play key roles in that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental aircraft taking to the air will include technology
demonstrators for a space station ``lifeboat'' and a new spaceship,
and the forerunner of a military space plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-vehicles are what is going to turn us into a space
transportation excellence country,'' Jess Sponable, former Air
Force program manager of DC-X, which investigated vertical takeoff
and landing spacecraft, told an audience at the weekend Space
Frontier Conference in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible ``X'' program in the Antelope Valley is the
X-33, a space plane that will launch next summer to test technology
needed for a reusable spaceship. Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works
facility is building the X-33 in Palmdale, approximately 50 miles
north of Los Angeles, and expects to fly the aircraft in July from
Edwards Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to proving technologies, including the ``aerospike''
rocket engine, heat protection and design concepts, a major goal of
the X-33 program will to use ``aircraft-like'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the requirements is to prepare the craft for a flight in
two days with less than 50 people, said Gene Austin, NASA's X-33
program manager.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin expects to take the technology from the program
and use it on the VentureStar reusable spaceship the company hopes
to fly in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Another program with a major Antelope Valley connection is X-38,
aimed at developing a lifeboat for use in an emergency by the crew
of the international space station. Four X-38 vehicles will be
tested.
</P>
<P>
   The first X-38 made a successful inaugural flight March 12, but
its parafoil -- a steerable, rectangular parachute with the surface
area of a Boeing 747 wing -- twisted and ripped during its
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believe they have solved the twisting problem and
expect to conduct two additional flights in December.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for testing an X-38 from space in November 2000. A
fully functional crew return vehicle is needed for the space
station in 2003, said John Hopper, the Johnson Space Center's
deputy X-38 program manager.
</P>
<P>
   One X program that might come to the Antelope Valley is the
X-40A, an effort to develop a spaceship for the military. The Air
Force conducted a successful test flight of the vehicle in August,
dropping it from a helicopter at 9,000 feet over Holloman Air Force
Base in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wants to conduct a series of 10 to 20 flights
beginning in July using a B-52. The Air Force is considering
Edwards Air Force Base for those tests, said program manager Maj.
Ken Verderame.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has issued two $4 million contracts to Boeing and
Lockheed Martin to develop the military space plane concept. Skunk
Works is looking at the possibility of basing the military space
plane on the X-33.
</P>
<P>
   Another X program that will come to the Antelope Valley is the
X-43A, an effort to develop jet propulsion systems that will
function at extremely high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for attaching the vehicle to a Pegasus space booster
that would be launched at 24,000 feet from a Lockheed L-1011
airliner. Program officials are shooting for a first flight in
January 2000.

COMMENTARY: A WOMAN WHO BOWED OUT ON HER OWN TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. _ Until the last days of her life, Elaine
Benson told only a chosen few that she was dying. Even when the
effects of chemotherapy forced her to wear a wig, and friends
noticed, she brushed them off with a joke or a fib.
</P>
<P>
   To reveal the secret would have cast a shadow over the summer
season on the East End of Long Island, in a community that
considered Ms. Benson its soul and her art gallery its cultural
center. It would sadden those who knew her, affect her many civic
projects and burden people who depended on her.
</P>
<P>
   That was not Ms. Benson's way. ``She didn't want anyone to look
at her with sad eyes,'' said her daughter Kimberly Goff, who will
succeed Ms. Benson as head of the Benson Gallery here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone makes a big deal about dying, it disrupts
everything,'' said Dan Rattiner, publisher of a weekly newspaper
for which Ms. Benson wrote a column that appeared without fail
until the last week of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Benson is dead at 74 of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and more
than 500 friends assembled Sunday at the public-access television
station in Wainscott to mourn her.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were a Who's Who of artists and writers, among them
Claes Oldenberg, Robert Dash, Shana Alexander and Jerry Della
Femina. Valet parking, a well-stocked bar and a mountain of
crudites were provided. White orchids decorated the tables.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, carpenters and hospital orderlies were part of the
gathering, which was marked by quiet grief as Ms. Benson's
accomplishments were celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will miss her most as the heart and soul of this
community,'' said Betty Friedan, the author and feminist, who
delivered one of 15 brief eulogies that were punctuated with Cole
Porter and George Gershwin tunes. ``And believe me, there is a soul
to this place, beyond all the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bird Francke, a journalist and author, also saw Ms. Benson
as the embodiment of the hidden side of the Hamptons. ``We are
always being misinterpreted,'' she said. ``We are a people who love
each other, support each other and support the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benson's resume was lengthy and bold, crossing many areas of
civic life in the town she had called home since 1964. She was a
founder (along with the second of her three husbands) of the Benson
Gallery on Montauk Highway, where she was known for nurturing young
artists, and a weekly columnist for Dan's Papers, where she took
young journalists under her wing and was known on the masthead as
Faculty Adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ms. Benson raised more than a half-million
dollars for causes as diverse as the John Steinbeck Writers Room at
Southampton College, the Animal Rescue League, and the East End gay
rights organization. She was also the director of community
relations at Southampton Hospital and a board member of the local
television station.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends were as diverse as her endeavors. Ms. Francke
described Ms. Benson as a ``very good friend,'' adding that
``everyone will say that same thing _ that was her gift.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and discovering young artists, like Nico Yektai, a
29-year-old sculptor. He had his first showing at the Benson
Gallery three years ago, when Ms. Benson made room for his work in
an already full exhibition of emerging talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at my portfolio, nodded, and said, `I can work with
this,''' Yektai said. ``She was so generous of spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's issue of Dan's Papers had pages of elegiac letters,
as well as a memorial article about Ms. Benson. It also reprinted
her last column, from the Oct. 2 issue, which went to press after
her death.
</P>
<P>
   In that column, Ms. Benson told readers of the diagnosis she had
been given more than two years earlier, while she was nursing her
husband, who was ill with throat cancer, through his final days.
She wrote, in spare, uninflected prose, of her decision not to
resume chemotherapy when her cancer recurred, and her wish that
there be no visits or flowers.
</P>
<P>
   She had left nothing to chance. The music for her memorial
service had been chosen and the caterer hired. The service was to
be held in the same space where friends had mourned her husband,
Joseph Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   The master of ceremonies would again be Frazier Dougherty, owner
of the television station. He was to wear the same vintage Bill
Blass suit _ red-and-black plaid _ and the same patent-leather
dancing slippers with grosgrain bows.
</P>
<P>
   He was also instructed not to tell a soul what he knew until
after her death. ``That was Elaine's way,'' Dougherty said, as a
dapper pianist played Cole Porter's ``You'd Be So Easy to Love.''

FOOTBALL COLUMN: NO TIME FOR PARCELLS TO PLAY FAVORITES NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The New York Jets' season took an unexpected turn
for the worse here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This game against the reeling Rams was cast as a winnable
challenge. No, Curtis Martin was not playing, and St. Louis was not
a division rival. But the Jets were on a roll, so this was a good
chance to let Glenn Foley shake off the rust. The Jets would see
what Foley had after a two-week layoff and how they would function
without Martin, their star running back. How did they do? Terribly.
Absolutely terribly.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Smith, the veteran defensive back, blamed the loss on lack
of preparation and overconfidence. Overconfidence? How a team that
finished 1-15 two seasons ago and failed to make the playoffs last
season can be overconfident against anybody is a mystery. But that
is what Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets might expect to be a step slower without Martin, but
Foley's performance is disconcerting, rust or no rust. Before he
was finally replaced by Vinny Testaverde in the third quarter,
Foley turned the ball over three times, twice on interceptions,
once on a fumble on a first-quarter blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's performance is bound to turn what had merely been a
dilemma into a full-blown controversy. And there should be
controversy. Foley is now 1-7 as a Jets starter; Testaverde is 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, early as it is, are at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second consecutive season, the quarterback position
is a harpoon in Bill Parcells' side.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has told Foley _ and the news media _ that the starting
quarterback job is his as long as he is healthy. Parcells' loyalty
to Foley is admirable, but he has stubbornly stuck by his guns, and
now must deal with more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the coach defended his handling of the quarterback
situation last season. Parcells is given quite a bit of license,
with good reason. We all know the biography _ two Super Bowls won
with the Giants, a Super Bowl appearance with New England. He
revived the Jets after a 1-15 season, and nearly got them into the
playoffs. That is why some members of the news media accept his
gruff style and barking.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells had better let this one go. Testaverde should be
the Jets' quarterback. Testaverde is not a crowd favorite; he is
not a Parcells favorite. He's not my favorite, for that matter.
That's not the point. He's better, he's healthier and actually had
a full head of steam going into Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   When Foley is sharp, he's accurate and tough and all the things
we've said. But on Sunday he was rusty. In the first half, his
fumble with one minute 26 seconds left in the first quarter led to
the Rams' first score and lit a spark. From that point on, the Rams
applied the pressure. They wanted to see, as Parcells wanted to
see, whether Foley could function coming off an injury.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, Testaverde has been the perfect Jets
company man, saying that he just wanted to fit in, wanted to help
the Jets in any way possible. But after two strong starts, the
35-year-old veteran is becoming more aggressive in talking about
assuming the starting role. ``There's no question I would have
liked to play earlier,'' he said. ``But it's coach's decision as
always. I'm not going to argue with him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was noncommittal when he was asked about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know; let me see what goes on,'' he said. ``Like I
said, it wouldn't have made any difference who was playing today.''
</P>
<P>
   That's doubtful. Testaverde has been sharp. While Foley said he
wasn't affected by his two-week layoff, rustiness showed.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde didn't have to win the job; Foley gave it back. Now
we wait and see the wisdom of Solomon and Bill Parcells' attempt to
get the harpoon out of his side.

DAVID EVANS, 74, PIONEER IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif., Texas)  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David C. Evans, a pioneer in the field of computer graphics and
a noted computer scientist who oversaw the education of some of the
computer industry's most influential figures, died on Oct. 3 after
a long battle with Alzheimer's disease, his family said. He was 74
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who was a native of Salt Lake City, was also the
co-founder with Ivan Sutherland of Evans &AMP; Sutherland Computer
Corp., a maker of powerful graphics systems that are used for
engineering, scientific and military applications that require a
detailed visual rendering on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   During stints in the 1960s as chairman of the computer science
departments at the University of California at Berkeley and at the
University of Utah, Evans was closely associated with an era of
pioneering work that paved the way for the modern computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a flowering of technology at the University of Utah
and his students took these ideas and ran with them,'' said
Sutherland, who is now a vice president and computer researcher at
Sun Microsystems Inc. ``His strength was that he realized the
department couldn't do everything and so he decided to do one thing
well and that was graphics.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his best students went on to develop seminal ideas that
were instrumental in creating some of the most influential
companies in various branches of the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Evans studied electrical engineering at the University of Utah
and earned a doctorate in physics. He then went to work at Bendix
Corp., where he served as a project manager on two of the company's
computers, the G15, introduced in 1955, and the G20, introduced in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans, correctly predicting that Bendix was not going to
succeed in the computer industry, left to join the computer science
department at the University of California at Berkeley. He became
the head of the university's work for the Pentagon's Advanced
Research Project Agency, known as ARPA.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the agency was funding a broad range of basic
research projects from which grew many of the key innovations of
the modern computer industry in personal computing, networking and
work stations.
</P>
<P>
   At Berkeley, Evans and his students made advances in the area of
virtual memory, an important concept in computer science that
allows the size of programs and data files to exceed the actual
memory size of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   He also led a group of students and researchers in the design of
a computer that became known as the SDS 940. Brought to market in
the mid-1960s by Xerox Corp., it was the first commercial
time-sharing computer system, enabling a number of computer users
to simultaneously use a single computer.
</P>
<P>
   One of Evans' best-known Berkeley students was Butler Lampson,
who became a pioneer in the development of personal computers and
work stations at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center and at Digital
Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While at Berkeley, Evans also met Sutherland, who had recently
become head of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, James Fletcher, then president of the University of
Utah, recruited Evans to move back to Salt Lake City and create a
computer science department.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Evans recruited Sutherland to a faculty
position at Utah from Harvard, where after leaving ARPA he had been
conducting research in head-mounted display screens for airplane
pilots and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1968, during a dinner conversation while the two men
were on a business consulting trip in Phoenix, that they decided to
start Evans &AMP; Sutherland Computer even while continuing the work at
the university.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland said that Evans' distinctive contribution in computer
graphics was in the insight that each individual point in a
computer image _ each pixel _ differs only incrementally from the
pixels adjacent to it. By computing only these differences, rather
than creating an entirely new pixel in each instance, a computer
can reserve tremendous amounts of processing power and speed for
the creation of more complex graphics than would otherwise be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   He also led a group working on ``raster'' computer graphics _
building images by computing and displaying them an entire
horizontal screen line at a time _ a popular alternative to the
``vector'' method, in which an electronic beam scans an image onto
a screen much as a pencil draws a picture on paper.
</P>
<P>
   However, Evans' greatest contribution may have been the fact
that at both Berkeley and Utah, he recruited and taught an
extraordinary group of graduate students who went on to
groundbreaking careers in computing.
</P>

JOSEPH CATES, 74, PRODUCER OF INNOVATIVE TV SPECIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Cates, a pioneering television impresario and
Broadway producer with an eye for quality, an ear for a good
country twang and a weakness for trapeze acts, died on Saturday at
Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications after long treatment for leukemia,
his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry in which he was ever in danger of becoming known
as the actress Phoebe Cates' father and the Hollywood director Gil
Cates' brother, Cates more than held up his end of the
show-business dynasty he founded.
</P>
<P>
   By his own estimate, from the live high school talent program he
staged for the old Dumont network in the late 1940s to his recent
string of fund-raising specials for Ford's Theater in Washington,
Cates wrote, directed and produced more than 1,000 television
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he helped create the first big television game
show, ``The $64,000 Question,'' cast Art Carney as Jackie Gleason's
pal, designed the original set for ``The Honeymooners'' and almost
single-handedly made the television special a regular feature of
network broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won two Emmy awards as an independent producer _ for
a 1970 Anne Bancroft special and for a 1972 tribute to George
Gershwin _ Cates preferred television specials devoted to comedy,
circuses and country music, as well as beauty pageants, popular
music and award ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan, Cates _ who changed his name from Katz
when he entered show business _ attended New York University and
flew rescue missions in the Pacific in World War II before getting
his accidental start in television.
</P>
<P>
   While working in advertising after the war he got the idea of
using television to sell candy, and signed a contract with Dumont
to do a high school talent search program that he called ``Look
Upon a Star,'' with Bess Myerson, the 1945 Miss America, as host.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on a $100 budget, limited to two cameras and facing
the unforgiving pace of live television, Cates managed to pull it
off and emerged as one of the most experienced and skilled
variety-show production specialists in a fledgling medium.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon in demand, working at Dumont with Gleason and Carney
on ``The Cavalcade of Stars'' and with Buddy Rogers on ``The
Cavalcade of Bands,'' then moving to NBC to produce the ``Bob and
Ray'' show.
</P>
<P>
   His network experience helped lay the groundwork for his later
career as an independent producer, which included a succession of
specials with Alan King, Robert Klein, Steve Martin and other
comedians, and more than 200 circus programs, not to mention a
string of David Copperfield magic shows and a number of musical
programs for Gene Kelly, Ethel Merman, Victor Borge, Perry Como,
Andy Williams, Nat King Cole and others.
</P>
<P>
   A master showman who knew how to promote as well as stage a
complicated production, Cates demonstrated his flair when he
switched to Broadway in the 1960s and staged ``Spoon River
Anthology.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dramatic readings of the poetry of Edgar Lee Masters
drew rave reviews but virtually no customers, Cates wrote an
impassioned letter to The New York Times, chastising those who
regularly complained about a lack of quality on Broadway and then
failed to support it when it was staring them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The letter attracted so much attention that it extended the
show's run and enhanced Cates' reputation. His later Broadway
productions included ``What Makes Sammy Run,'' and ``Joe Egg,'' but
it was his experience with ``Elmer Gantry,'' based on the Sinclair
Lewis book, that established his credentials as a man of infectious
tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   After losing $400,000 on the the original short-lived Broadway
production of ``Gantry,'' in 1970, Cates cheerfully kept producing
the show over and over at regional theaters for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   For all his other work, Cates, who had a native New Yorker's
awed infatuation with country music, seemed proudest of the dozens
of country music specials he produced with Johnny Cash. Those
shows, which used sophisticated lighting and other softening
techniques, were credited with making country music safe for a mass
medium, and the country music industry was so grateful that Cates
became the only producer honored by the Country Music Hall of Fame.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A raconteur who could hold an audience spellbound for hours at
the Friars Club simply by telling stories about the old days,
Cates, a gregarious man who tended to turn casual acquaintances
into lifelong friends, was at once a television visionary and a
creature of habit. Indeed, he kept a weekly poker game going for 41
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter Phoebe and his brother, Cates, who
was married three times, is survived by a son, Phillip, of Los
Angeles; two other daughters, Valerie and Alexandra, both of
Manhattan; a sister, Kit Adler of Los Angeles, and two
grandchildren.

SPORTS COLUMN: NOW THE FIELD SEEMS NEARLY LEVEL TO BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Look at the body language,'' someone was saying in
the press box as the Atlanta Braves took the field for the bottom
of the eighth inning Saturday afternoon. ``Looks like their best
friend died.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, under the circumstances: it was their hopes that
appeared about to be deceased, for the San Diego Padres were
administering yet another beating of this remarkable team, and this
remarkable franchise. There was Chipper Jones, the third baseman,
looking as though the distance between his dugout and nearby third
base was six miles. And Andres Gallaraga looking as if he were
walking uphill to first base. And poor Gerald Williams, trekking to
right field, which had to be in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were about to go up by three games to none against
the team that won 106 games during the regular season, whose
pitchers have a slew of Cy Young trophies gathering dust on their
mantelpieces. The team has spent so much time in the playoffs and
World Series in this decade that their fans have demonstrated an
uncommon ennui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we can make it interesting,'' said Bobby Cox, the
Braves' manager, after Saturday's game. ``Win tomorrow, win the
next day, and go home with two. You can still make it really,
really interesting, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think!'' What a qualifier. It was the difference between the
Eternal Optimist and the Realist. No team in baseball history has
come back from a 3-0 deficit in a post-season series.
</P>
<P>
   And for huge chunks of Sunday night's game it seemed the Braves
were cooked. But not so fast. They demonstrated the heart of a
champion. Twice they fell behind to the Padres, in the third and
sixth innings, and twice they battled back to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   And then their batters finally decided to mean business, and
they scored six runs in the seventh, highlighted by a lead-gaining
slap single by the ancient shortstop Ozzie Guillen, and a
grand-slam homer by Gallaraga.
</P>
<P>
   In fact earlier, both Guillen and Gallaraga were guilty of
hurting rather than helping.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, starting for the first time in this series, didn't
adequately play a ground ball in the third, which led to the
Padres' first, and lead, run. Gallaraga has foundered at the plate,
batting .091 going into Game 4, and was less than spectacular in
the field and on the bases. But suddenly it was 8-3 for the nearly
defunct Braves. Suddenly the noisiest crowd in the National League
Championship Series, the gathering of 65,045 faithful in Qualcomm
Stadium that had been chanting ``Sweep! Sweep!'' to the certain
delight of the Braves' players, become as quiet as a canyon.
</P>
<P>
   And then there had to be alarm in the hearts and cue-ball heads
of some of the fans. In honor of a few Padres players who had
shaved their heads for post-season play, they also had a razor
taken to their locks. A local television station had sponsored
barbers setting up shop on the street beyond center field and were
doing a brisk business. The shaving cream was flying. One after the
other came out looking like Curly of the Three Stooges, or at least
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Now they, and the Padre personnel, were looking at the
conceivable return of three of baseball's best pitchers: John
Smoltz on Monday night and, if Andy Ashby can't hold the Braves in
this game, then Tommy Glavine will materialize on the mound in Game
6 in Atlanta and it will be Greg Maddux redux in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all supposing, of course.
</P>
<P>
   What we have learned is that the Braves were mighty when they
were nearly expunged. Denny Neagle, the Braves starter on Sunday
night, had said before the game: ``If this is going to be my last
start of the year, I'm going to pitch my type of game. Sure there's
pressure, but I'm not going to want to be home over the winter and
think that I wasn't the pitcher I know I can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll throw the way I always do,'' he added, ``and hope that we
can score more runs than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   He was true to his word, pitching decently in his five-inning
stint and keeping the Braves in contention just when it appeared,
in the immortal words of one of their native laureates, that they
were Gone With the Wind.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pitchers over the course of the series had pitched
well enough to win in most instances, but their hitters had somehow
discovered the Fountain of Ineptitude. They had scored three runs
in three games. Now it was literally a different ball game.
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves departed their dugout to take the field in the
bottom half of the ninth inning on Sunday night, with that
pleasantly plump 8-3 lead, Chipper Jones bounded out to third base
and Gallaraga was at first in a flash. And for Gerald Williams,
right field had magically moved out of Idaho and back to San Diego.

   Braves lede for 5-star for Monday
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Stinson
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   San Diego The Atlanta Braves are still deep in a cave, where it
is still very dark. But from somewhere Sunday night came a draft of
fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Slump-ridden Andres Galarraga's grand slam off Dan Miceli juiced
a six-run seventh inning as the Braves came from behind twice to
beat San Diego 8-3 in their biggest outburst in 14 postseason
games. No club has ever come back to win a series after losing the
first three games, but at least the Braves have given themselves a
chance, closing what has been a disasterous NLCS to three games to
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel now it's a two-game series,'' manager Bobby Cox said,
``We need to win two, then get back home and see what happens
there.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz faces Andy Ashby in tonight's Game 5 (8:10 p.m.),
with the Braves in search of a four-game winning streak. Fourteen
times this season, Atlanta has strung together four victories or
more. If there was a more critical postseason performance than
Sunday's, Cox can't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's either win tonight or go home,'' Cox said. ``So
it's darn big right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Martinez, who retired a batter in the sixth, recorded the
victory in relief of Denny Neagle, who came out after 5 2/3 and the
Braves trailing 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The rally began with Javy Lopez, who had struck out in his
previous three at-bats. He tied the game with a first-pitch homer
off Joey Hamilton to open the seventh, making it 3-3. Andruw Jones
then served an infield single over the mound, chasing Hamilton for
left-hander Randy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Gerald Williams struck out, and after Jones took
second on a wild pitch, Greg Colbrunn failed to advance him with a
ground-out. But Ozzie Guillen flicked a slider down and out of the
strike zone into left, allowing Jones to score after left fielder
Ruben Rivera bobbled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Myers then walked Chipper Jones, which forced manager Bruce
Bochy to bring in right-hander Miceli to face Galarraga, who to
that point was 4-for-24 in the postseason. He drove Miceli's second
pitch over the center-field wall, the sixth grand slam in NLCS
history and the first since Gary Gaetti's blast off Greg Maddux in
Game 2 of 1996 Atlanta-St. Louis series.
</P>
<P>
   That all this work came against the Padres' vaunted bullpen was
almost as significant as the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it just didn't happen for us tonight,'' Padres manager
Bruce Bochy said. ``They've done a good job for us all year. We
just couldn't get it done. That's going to happen sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres hadn't been able to do anything dramatic this month
unless Jim Leyritz is involved, and the first baseman obliged in
the sixth, right after Neagle had baffled him with a change-up to
leave the count 1-2. Leyritz enhanced his reputation for abusing
the Braves by lining the next fastball over the right-field fence.
It was his fourth homer in the postseason and gave the Padres a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, struggling through a miserable NLCS without a hit
in his first seven at-bats, tied the game in the sixth, after
Chipper Jones hit a two-out double and Andres Galarraga walked.
Klesko sent his first hit of the series into left, scoring Jones to
tie it 2-2, although Galarraga cut the rally short when he was
caught between second third while Jones scored.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart, one Atlanta constant this month who brought a
.300 postseason average into the game, opened the fourth with a
triple that just eluded Steve Finley at the wall in right-center.
That marked Atlanta's first extra-base hit in 21 innings this
series, the first since Lockhart's double in the fourth inning of
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hitters had gone 2-for-20 to that point in the series
with runners in scoring position, but Jones delivered a two-strike
single to left to close the gap to 2-1. The run matched the
production of the Braves' previous 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego broke out in the third, taking a 2-0 lead with two
outs, after Neagle had blown through the order with five strikeouts
against the first nine men he faced. He then walked Quilvio Veras
on four pitches and averted one disaster when Klesko went to the
wall in left to catch a Finley blast for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Gywnn would not let Neagle off the hook, sending a
double into the right-center gap to allow Veras to score from
first; Ozzie Guillen's throw to the plate was way off line. After a
Ken Caminiti chopper that short-hopped Guillen, Leyritz lined a
single to right to bring in Gwynn for a two-run lead.

BIOLOGISTS GAIN A TOEHOLD AGAINST A PESKY MUSSEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Zebra mussels do not generate much good news. A
decade ago, the mussels, thumbnail-size bivalve mollusks, were
accidentally carried from Eastern Europe to the Great Lakes by
shipping traffic. They have since spread across North America,
clogging the cooling systems of power plants, crowding out native
species and cloaking docks and rocky areas with bristling mats of
sharp, striped shells.
</P>
<P>
   So when scientists began finding the microscopic larvae of the
mussels in Lake George, in the Adirondacks, three years ago, nearby
residents feared they would soon face a full-scale invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But now biologists say that in Lake George, the relentless
spread of the mussels appears to have stopped, apparently deterred
by the lake water. Even though mature zebra mussels can live in it,
the larvae quickly die, according to laboratory tests completed
last month at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the research spread through lakeside communities,
there was a collective sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news,'' said Deanne Rehm, town supervisor of
Bolton, on the west shore of the 32-mile-long lake. ``We have
enough threats to the quality of the lake without some new nuisance
coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism should be tempered, though, said Dr. Sandra
Nierzwicki-Bauer, the director of Rensselaer's Darrin Fresh Water
Institute, where the studies were done. It is unlikely that the
finding will lead to a treatment that can stop the mussels in other
waters, she said, and there is always the possibility that the
mussels will eventually adjust to the lake's seemingly hostile
conditions and begin proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zebra mussel has shown it is able to adapt over time,''
Dr. Nierzwicki-Bauer said. ``Nature seems to find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   For roughly 200 years, zebra mussels have been easily finding
their way across two continents, spreading first across Europe as
newly dug canals linked their home range in the Caspian and Black
seas with surrounding waterways.
</P>
<P>
   And almost every time they have colonized a new area, they have
become a nuisance. In the mid-1800s, after arriving in France,
clusters began blocking water pipes in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing in the Great Lakes in 1988, they hitchhiked on
barges down the Mississippi River and spread to hundreds of lakes,
carried as invisible larvae in bait buckets or the bilges of
speedboats from one fishing spot to another.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to clear the mussels from the pipes of power plants and
other structures have cost tens of millions of dollars, federal
biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Connecticut became the 20th state to report
finding adult mussels, said Amy Benton, a fisheries biologist at
the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in East Twin Lake, in Litchfield County, Conn., found
several zebra mussels while dredging another unwanted imported
species, a weed called Eurasian milfoil, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Small numbers of zebra mussel larvae were first detected in Lake
George in the summer of 1995, Dr. Nierzwicki-Bauer said, but were
only present in a few samples. Larvae were found again in the
summer of 1997, she said, but a protracted survey by scuba divers
failed to turn up any mature zebra mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the discovery of the larvae created a stir, with local
residents concerned about the potential harm to pipes, to the
lake's native mollusks and other species, and to underwater
shipwrecks dating from the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of mature zebra mussels was ascribed initially to the
lake's naturally low concentration of calcium, which the mussels
need to form their shells. Lake George contains calcium at levels
that are about half the concentration seen in nearby Lake
Champlain, Dr. Nierzwicki-Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   To test that theory, the Fresh Water Institute placed adult
zebra mussels in tanks filled with water from Lake George. Despite
the low calcium level, the adult mussels thrived.
</P>
<P>
   But when larval zebra mussels were placed in water from Lake
George, they all died within a week, Dr. Nierzwicki-Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   To test whether calcium or the pH of the water is the factor
affecting larval mussels, she said, next spring the laboratory will
try to raise larvae in water from Lake George that has had its
calcium level and pH adjusted to match conditions in surrounding
waters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There have been a few similar reports of lakes in which zebra
mussel larvae were found, but no adult colonies became established,
Dr. Nierzwicki-Bauer and other biologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists tracking the progress of invasive species said
they hoped that Lake George could stay free of zebra mussels, but
said it was too soon to tell whether it would.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O'Neill, the director of the National Zebra Mussel and
Aquatic Nuisance Species Clearinghouse at the State University of
New York, Brockport, cited the example of Conesus Lake, in New
York's Finger Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mussel larvae showed up one summer in a plankton sample and
were not seen again that year,'' he said. ``They were not seen the
next year, either, or the year after that.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials announced that the mussels had failed to take
hold. ``The next summer, they showed up all the way around the
lake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And as was recently discovered, the zebra mussel is not the sole
molluskan threat in the United States. A closely related species,
the quagga mussel _ named for an extinct relative of the zebra _
has also made its way here. The two species appear to be dividing
and conquering, with the zebra mussel preferring hard surfaces and
shallow waters, while the quagga mussel, also from Eastern Europe,
colonizes sandy, deeper areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the exotic plants, animals and bacteria coming over, I
don't think a week goes by that we don't hear of another
potentially harmful critter,'' O'Neill said. ``It never ends.''

SENATOR AGAIN CRITICIZES RIVAL FOR MISSING VOTES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Signaling that he had settled on a new line of attack
in his re-election effort, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato assailed Rep.
Charles Schumer again Sunday for missing votes in Congress this
year, as Schumer campaigned across Long Island on his proposal to
make college tuition tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest instance of this type of criticism, D'Amato,
waiting to march up Fifth Avenue in the Hispanic Day Parade,
attacked Schumer for missing votes, this time on bills of concern
to Hispanic voters. His remarks marked the latest instance, in
speeches and in television advertisements, in which D'Amato has
criticized Schumer for the same shortcoming _ missing votes this
session _ but used different examples in order to give the attacks
fresh currency.

   ``When people send us to Congress, they expect us to work full
time,'' D'Amato said, standing next to Herman Badillo, the former
Democratic congressman who became a Republican earlier this year.
``They don't expect us to put politics first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's inordinate to say when your opponent has
missed over 100 votes and key votes, even on the issue of Puerto
Rican statehood or the plebiscite issue, whether it should be
commonwealth statehood, when he misses key votes and he's in
Washington during that, he's absent without leave,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   As D'Amato marched, Schumer, D-Brooklyn, campaigned in the heart
of D'Amato's base _ Nassau County. He strode down the Long Beach
boardwalk where D'Amato is known to jog, attracting a largely
favorable reception by strollers, power-walkers and volleyball
players enjoying the warm October weather.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance at Adelphi University, Schumer called again for
all college tuition to be made deductible for families with incomes
up to $150,000, and he criticized D'Amato for voting to restrict
some scholarship benefits to college students,
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to show that when it comes to families and helping
families afford college, Al D'Amato and I are polar opposites,''
Schumer said. ``One of my top goals in the Senate _ a goal I've
campaigned on from the day I announced _ is a goal to make all
college tuition deductible. On these issues, Al D'Amato opposes me.
He's blind to the struggle of ordinary families who worry that they
won't be able to prove a college education for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's focus on Schumer's attendance _ including a
Spanish-language television advertisement that began airing at the
weekend, and another news conference with D'Amato scheduled for
Monday morning _ comes after three weeks in which it has seemed
that the senator has been grappling to find an issue to use against
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has variously attacked Schumer as liberal, and portrayed
him as antagonistic to upstate regions. But a series of public
opinion polls showed the race in a statistical dead heat, with
Schumer still viewed favorably by voters.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's aides said that their polling, which they do almost
every night, has led them to believe that Schumer was being hurt
with questions about his attendance record, and that they would
thus stress it heavily for the time being. This is an attack that
is often used on sitting legislators, who often find themselves
torn between their campaign and governmental obligations.
</P>
<P>
   And because it involves a series of votes on different subjects,
it is the kind of issue that can be recycled. ``Get used to it:
You're going to be hearing this every day,'' said one of D'Amato's
aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Schumer has had a strong attendance record:
92 percent. However, he missed about 100 votes this year, making
his attendance record 77 percent this year, because he was
campaigning. Many of those votes were on bills that were passed or
rejected by overwhelming margins, on amendments, or on technical
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer brushed off D'Amato's attack on Sunday. Schumer noted
that there are far more votes in the House than in the Senate, many
of which are devoted to housekeeping, and he asserted that he had
been in Washington for key votes when he was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been there for 92 percent of the votes over the 18
years I've been in Congress,'' he said. ``But when you run for the
Senate, you have two obligations: One is to be as effective a
legislator as you can be and second, to let the voters of New York
know you feel. And I've been carrying both obligations and I think
I've been carrying them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to D'Amato's voting record, Schumer added: ``Sometimes
you wish he wouldn't have been there to vote.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schumer's college tuition plan has been a centerpiece of his
campaign. D'Amato's spokesman, Robert Bellafiore, said the senator
had supported some bills in Congress that would provide tax breaks
for college tuition. ``He's taken no position on this specific
proposal,'' Bellafiore said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato marched with Badillo and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, along
with a few Hispanic politicians, in the parade. Although parades in
New York during the campaign season are the kind of events that are
assured of winning publicity for a candidate, things went a little
off on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato was waiting for the parade to start, posing for the
photographers and television cameras, when a commotion erupted:
Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith had arrived to lead the
march. Every camera abandoned the political leaders for the movie
stars, and stayed with them for the rest of the march.

FALCONS DEFEAT GIANTS, 34-20 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Dan Reeves returned to Giants Stadium
tonight, turning back the clock in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' new team, the Atlanta Falcons, looked rejuvenated, but
the New York Giants and their offense looked worse than it has
since Reeves's last Giants team in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And when Atlanta's wholesale 34-20 dismantling of the Giants was
complete, with the booing of the home crowd enveloping their final
moments on the field, the 1998 Giants were six games into making
the stunning successes of last season seem a distant mirage.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-4 record, the Giants trail the Dallas Cowboys in the
National Football Conference East by two games. They are 1-2 at
home.
</P>
<P>
   There was little the Giants did right offensively on Sunday
night. Worst of all, Danny Kanell had his second straight poor
outing. Kanell's protection was shoddy, and he was sacked five
times, but Kanell also completed just 11 of 21 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Most telling, he passed for only 100 yards as the Giants rarely
even attempted a long pass.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell's evening included an embarrassing turnover at his 3-yard
line, when Atlanta defensive end Antonio Edwards took the ball out
of Kanell's hands and scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the second half that Atlanta (4-1) suddenly found it
easy to move the football against the Giants' defense. Gaping holes
were opened in the Giants' defensive front four, and since the
Giants' linebackers were often blitzing, it made it easy for the
Falcons to run the football.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' first possession was an 11-play drive that took up
6 minutes and 21 seconds and ended with a 26-yard field goal by
Morten Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the third quarter, the Giants' defense began to look
unsure and weary since the Giants' offense was doing little to give
it a rest.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:28 left in the third, Atlanta wide receiver Terance
Mathis dashed down the sideline behind Giants cornerback Carleton
Gray, who was playing because Phillippi Sparks was sidelined with a
sore right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler, who would finish the game
with 266 passing yards on just 14 completions in 27 attempts, had
no trouble finding Mathis in the open field, Mathis catching the
ball for a 55-yard touchdown pass that gave Atlanta a 24-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   When another Giants three-and-out followed, the Giants' defense,
rarely off the field in the second half, was overmatched during the
Falcons' next possession, which ended with another touchdown and a
31-13 Atlanta lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal play was a 19-yard scramble by Chandler on a
third-and-3 at midfield. As Chandler was being tackled out of
bounds by the Giants' Percy Ellsworth, Gray was called for a
15-yard unnecessary roughness for a hit at the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Chandler hit tight end Brian Kozlowski, a
former Giant, with a 25-yard pass to the Giants' 1-yard line.
Chandler scored two plays later, running untouched into the end
zone on a bootleg right.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Randy Fuller sacked Kanell on a cornerback blitz when
the Giants got the ball back, forcing a fumble that Fuller
recovered on the Giants' 15-yard line. It led to a 32-yard field
goal by Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants back-up quarterback Kent Graham replaced Kanell in
the final six minutes and scored on a 5-yard run with 2 minutes and
44 seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense, under siege after a dismal performance in
last week's defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, got off to a
inauspicious start on Sunday night when Kanell was sacked on the
Giants' first play.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of this three-play drive was remarkably typical of the
Giants' ineffectual offense this season. Charles Way picked up 3
yards on second down, and then on third-and-16, the Giants got 14
yards on a pass from Kanell to Amani Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the Giants started the game, the Falcons somehow
started in worse fashion. Their running back Jamal Anderson fumbled
on Atlanta's first play, and the Giants' Conrad Hamilton recovered
on the Falcons' 36-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants once again looked feeble on offense, advancing
the football just six yards in seven plays. Brad Daluiso salvaged
something from the turnover, kicking a 46-yard field goal into the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants led 3-0, but it didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   On its second drive, Atlanta went after Giants cornerback Jeremy
Lincoln, who was playing in the nickel defenses because Sparks was
out.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln was called for pass interference, a 16-yard penalty that
put Atlanta inside Giants territory. Two plays later, Falcons' wide
receiver Tony Martin caught a 36-yard touchdown pass from Chandler.
Martin got behind Giants safety Tito Wooten on the play, catching
the ball just as he passed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the Giants took possession of the football with
two minutes remaining in the first half that they mounted a
touchdown drive _ and this was executed with the Giants in their
two-minute offense.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell completed four passes in seven plays as the Giants moved
to the Atlanta 39-yard line. From there, Kanell found David Patten
deep downfield behind Falcons' cornerback Elijah Williams for a
touchdown pass 41 seconds before intermission. The score brought
the Giants within a point, 14-13.

 &HT;    Braves avoid sweep, beat Padres 8-3
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Atlanta Braves are still deep in a cave, where
it is still very dark. But from somewhere Sunday night came a draft
of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Slump-ridden Andres Galarraga's grand slam off Dan Miceli juiced
a six-run seventh inning as the Braves came from behind twice to
beat San Diego 8-3 in their biggest outburst in 14 postseason
games. No club has ever come back to win a series after losing the
first three games, but at least the Braves have given themselves a
chance, closing what has been a disastrous NLCS to three games to
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel now it's a two-game series,'' manager Bobby Cox said,
``We need to win two, then get back home and see what happens
there.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz faces Andy Ashby in tonight's Game 5 (8:10 p.m.),
with the Braves in search of a four-game winning streak. Fourteen
times this season, Atlanta has strung together four victories or
more. If there was a more critical postseason performance than
Sunday's, Cox can't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's either win tonight or go home,'' Cox said. ``So
it's darn big right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Martinez, who retired a batter in the sixth, recorded the
victory in relief of Denny Neagle, who came out after 5 2/3 and the
Braves trailing 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The rally began with Javy Lopez, who had struck out in his
previous three at-bats. He tied the game with a first-pitch homer
off Joey Hamilton to open the seventh, making it 3-3. Andruw Jones
then served an infield single over the mound, chasing Hamilton for
left-hander Randy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Gerald Williams struck out, and after Jones took
second on a wild pitch, Greg Colbrunn failed to advance him with a
ground-out. But Ozzie Guillen flicked a slider down and out of the
strike zone into left, allowing Jones to score after left fielder
Ruben Rivera bobbled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Myers then walked Chipper Jones, which forced manager Bruce
Bochy to bring in right-hander Miceli to face Galarraga, who to
that point was 4-for-24 in the postseason. He drove Miceli's second
pitch over the center-field wall, the sixth grand slam in NLCS
history and the first since Gary Gaetti's blast off Greg Maddux in
Game 2 of 1996 Atlanta-St. Louis series.
</P>
<P>
   That all this work came against the Padres' vaunted bullpen was
almost as significant as the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it just didn't happen for us tonight,'' Padres manager
Bruce Bochy said. ``They've done a good job for us all year. We
just couldn't get it done. That's going to happen sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres hadn't been able to do anything dramatic this month
unless Jim Leyritz is involved, and the first baseman obliged in
the sixth, right after Neagle had baffled him with a change-up to
leave the count 1-2. Leyritz enhanced his reputation for abusing
the Braves by lining the next fastball over the right-field fence.
It was his fourth homer in the postseason and gave the Padres a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, struggling through a miserable NLCS without a hit
in his first seven at-bats, tied the game in the sixth, after
Chipper Jones hit a two-out double and Andres Galarraga walked.
Klesko sent his first hit of the series into left, scoring Jones to
tie it 2-2, although Galarraga cut the rally short when he was
caught between second third while Jones scored.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart, one Atlanta constant this month who brought a
.300 postseason average into the game, opened the fourth with a
triple that just eluded Steve Finley at the wall in right-center.
That marked Atlanta's first extra-base hit in 21 innings this
series, the first since Lockhart's double in the fourth inning of
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hitters had gone 2-for-20 to that point in the series
with runners in scoring position, but Jones delivered a two-strike
single to left to close the gap to 2-1. The run matched the
production of the Braves' previous 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego broke out in the third, taking a 2-0 lead with two
outs, after Neagle had blown through the order with five strikeouts
against the first nine men he faced. He then walked Quilvio Veras
on four pitches and averted one disaster when Klesko went to the
wall in left to catch a Finley blast for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Gywnn would not let Neagle off the hook, sending a
double into the right-center gap to allow Veras to score from
first; Ozzie Guillen's throw to the plate was way off line. After a
Ken Caminiti chopper that short-hopped Guillen, Leyritz lined a
single to right to bring in Gwynn for a two-run lead.

 &HT;    Falcons roll to a Giant win, 34-20
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A national television audience learned
Sunday night what Falcons fans have known all season: Atlanta's
better half is the second.
</P>
<P>
   After a sluggish first half, the Falcons dominated the New York
Giants in the final two quarters, scoring on four of their first
five possessions after halftime for a 34-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Falcons' first victory on prime-time TV in four
years, and it left the Falcons (4-1) tied with the San Francisco
49ers atop the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, leading 14-13 at half, broke open the game behind
running back Jamal Anderson, who ran for 83 second-half yards to
finish with 110 yards on 30 carries. He is just the third Falcons
player to run for more than 100 yards in three straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler threw touchdown passes of 36 and 55
yards, and ran 1 yard for a score early in the fourth quarter to
finish off the Giants (2-4).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has outscored its five opponents in the second half this
season by a total of 96-30.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won with the help of a 2-yard fumble return by
reserve defensive end Antonio Edwards early in the second quarter,
the first consistently heavy pass rush all season (six sacks), and
a couple big plays.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, each team gained just 125 yards. Chandler
completed 7-of-16 passes for 113 yards, and Anderson and fullback
Bob Christian each lost fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta took a 7-3 lead in the first quarter on a 36-yard
touchdown pass from Chandler (14-of-27, 266 yards) to Tony Martin
on a post route.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta stretched the lead early in the second quarter, when
Edwards stripped the ball from New York quarterback Danny Kanell,
plucked the ball out of the air and took a big step into the end
zone for a 2-yard score. That made it 14-6 with 13:05 left in the
first half. In the third quarter, the Falcons cranked it up. They
went 65 yards on 11 plays to start the second half, scoring on
Morten Andersen's 26-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On their next possession, Terance Mathis got open down the right
sideline for a 55-yard touchdown reception for a 24-13 lead.

CLEVELAND _ Rule No. 1: Never provide the competition with any
extra incentive to go out and beat you, especially if he's
nicknamed ``Boomer.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rule No. 2: Don't fall behind Boomer early.
</P>
<P>
   While warming up in the right-field bullpen prior to Sunday's
critical Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, New
York Yankees starting pitcher David Wells received a rude greeting
as a few Cleveland fans shouted insults directed at Wells' family.
</P>
<P>
   Wells got mad, then got even, and now the Yankees are one
victory away from advancing to the World Series for the second time
in three years after a 5-3 victory over the Indians before a crowd
of 44,966 at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which holds a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-seven
series, can secure the AL pennant Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disturbed because of some reactions I got out
there when I was warming up,'' said Wells, who gave up two runs in
the first after the Yankees provided him with a three-run lead in
the top half of the inning. ``When you have a bunch of clowns out
there that start talking about your mother, and not knowing that my
mom passed away a year and a half ago, it really bothered me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What got me was that some little kids started to do the same
thing. They were lowlifes trying to be cute. I don't care what they
say about me. When they talk about any members of my family, it
really bothers me. So to all those idiots out there, this one is
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a home run on his fourth pitch of the game to
Kenny Lofton, part of a two-run response to an early New York
outburst, Wells took his frustration out on the Indians over the
next six-plus innings. He struck out 11 batters, a career high for
the postseason, to remain perfect in three playoff starts this
year.
</P>
<P>
   After swinging the momentum in its favor with two straight
victories over the Yankees earlier in the week, Cleveland has
dropped two in a row and must win the next two games _ both in New
York _ to return to the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said
after his starting pitcher failed to get past the second inning for
the second time in the ALCS. ``We've got to put it on the line two
more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Chad Ogea, who won two games against Florida in
the World Series last year, ran into trouble from the get-go,
falling behind 3-0 after seven batters while lasting just 1
innings. Jaret Wright, bypassed for Sunday's start after lasting
two-thirds of an inning in the series opener, walked seven but gave
up just one run _ a solo home run by Chili Davis _ in six innings
of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Here's all you need to know about what kind of day it was for
the Indians: Ogea hit two batters, walked two and allowed a pair of
singles that staked the Yankees to a 3-0 lead before Wells even
stepped to the mound. Chuck Knoblauch was hit to lead off the game,
and following a strikeout by Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill singled and
Bernie Williams walked to load the bases. Davis, who was 2-for-5
with three RBIs, hit a two-run single past a diving Richie Sexson
at first base. Tim Raines drove in another run two batters later
with a grounder to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dug ourselves a hole fairly often this postseason,''
said Hargrove, whose Indians have been outscored 15-3 in the first
inning of nine playoff games. ``We've been able to come back from
that, but it's not the ideal way you want to come into the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland rallied to within 3-2 in the bottom half of the inning
on Lofton's leadoff home run and a sacrifice fly by Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   New York added a second-inning RBI single by O'Neill and a
fourth-inning homer from Davis to go ahead 5-2. The Yankees did not
have a hit after the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove defended going with Ogea instead of Wright, who lowered
his ERA for the series from 67.50 to 8.10.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jaret's) last two starts in the postseason weren't what we've
come to expect out of him, and so, consequently, we went with a
more experienced pitcher in Ogea,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, can match the postseason success of Wells. In
going 3-0 with a 1.90 ERA in this year's playoffs, he has allowed
only five earned runs in 23 innings while limiting opponents to a
.202 batting average. He is 7-1 lifetime in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Even after watching Wells give up two early runs and fall behind
in the count on several occasions, Yankees manager Joe Torre didn't
panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an animal. He goes after you,'' Torre said. ``He fights
it and battles it. I'm probably prouder of his effort tonight than
maybe the shutouts and even the perfect game because (of what this
game) meant to us and he didn't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who pitched a perfect game May 17 against Minnesota,
worked out of potential disaster in the fifth when he got Travis
Fryman to pop out to end the inning with two runners on base. Wells
struck out five of the final eight batters he faced before being
lifted with one out in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera came on in relief for the Yankees and induced
Mark Whiten to hit into a 4-6-3 inning-ending double play. Rivera
threw the ninth to earn the save.
</P>
<P>
   As Wells walked off the field in the eighth, he showed a little
extra emotion toward the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are entitled to be crazy and wild; that's part of the
game,'' Wells said. ``But I think they should just focus on trying
to rattle you up and not get personal with other people than that
individual.''

BRAVES BEAT PADRES, 8-3 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The heart of the Atlanta Braves' batting order
finally woke up from its National League Championship Series funk.
The question now is whether it will be too late.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this game, the Braves had dropped the first three
games of the four-of-seven-game series, in large part because their
Nos. 3 through 6 hitters _ Chipper Jones, Andres Galarraga, Ryan
Klesko and Javy Lopez _ had not driven in a run. But on Sunday
night, before 65,042 screaming fans at a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium,
the four combined to drive in every run but one as the Braves
rallied for an 8-3 victory over the San Diego Padres to avert a
humiliating sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The last four runs of the game came off the bat of the player
who had been the biggest disappointment of what was turning into
the biggest disappointment of the post-season, the Braves
themselves. Galarraga, who had been 1 for his previous 12 in the
series, smacked a grand slam off Dan Miceli to cap a six-run
seventh inning, three batters after Ozzie Guillen, a surprise
starter, had singled in the go-ahead run off Randy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen's opposite-field hit to left had come four batters after
Lopez had homered off Joey Hamilton to tie the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 34 innings of the series, Padre pitchers had held
the Braves to five runs. After Galarraga's grand slam, the Atlanta
batters had bettered that total by one in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day began, Jones, Galarraga, Klesko and Lopez were a
combined 5 for 36 (.139). On Sunday night, the four went 5 for 14
with a pair of homers, and gave the Braves hope they can get back
to Atlanta down 3 games to 2 in the series, if John Smoltz can
defeat Andy Ashby here on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel now that it's a two-game series here,'' Atlanta
Manager Bobby Cox had said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won the first and are still breathing. But no team in
baseball history has ever rallied back from a 3-0 post-season
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Sunday night's game justified Cox's decision
to start Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle had taken exception after Saturday's loss when he was
asked for the umpteenth time about Cox's choice to start him with
the Braves facing elimination instead of coming back with Smoltz on
three days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle had won 16 games this season, 20 the year before. And
even though he had taken a cortisone shot in his left shoulder
after this season, Neagle was basically saying that he merited a
crucial start without second guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Like his more celebrated counterparts in the Braves' rotation,
Neagle pitched a competent game. But, when Neagle departed after
five and two-thirds innings trailing by 3-2, the crowd was chanting
for a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had scored twice in the third on a run-scoring double
from Tony Gwynn (who was 5 for 31 in his career against Neagle up
to that point) and a two-out, run-scoring single from Jim Leyrtiz.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Braves scrapped their way back. Hamilton was
throwing the ball as hard as 96 miles per hour. But Keith Lockhart
belted a triple to right-center field on Hamilton's first pitch of
the fourth and Jones singled home his first run of the series, as
the Braves drew within a run.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Dave Stewart, the San Diego pitching coach. Galarraga
then grounded into a short-to-second-to-first double play, and
Hamilton retired Klesko on a grounder to short to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a one-run game entering the sixth when Jones _ who
had been 2 for 12 over the first three games _ doubled into the
right-field corner with two out for his second hit of the day.
Galarraga worked out a walk. And then Klesko singled to left for
his first run batted in of the series to tie the game at 2-2,
although Galarraga was caught in a rundown on the play to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   When Leyritz stroked a 1-2 pitch from Neagle over the
right-center field fence in the bottom of the sixth for his seventh
career post-season home run, the Padres had a 3-2 advantage and it
looked as if Leyritz would be the hero again.
</P>
<P>
   But then Lopez knocked a fastball over the fence in right for
his first rbi of the series to start the seventh. The game was
deadlocked at 3-3. Andruw Jones followed Lopez's homer with an
infield single to second, and that was all for Hamilton, who gave
way to Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers had
said that he acquired Myers from Toronto in a waiver-wire deal Aug.
6 to give the Padres a left-handed presence in the bullpen. But
many feel Towers did so to keep Myers away from the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Myers did more to help the Braves than the
Padres on Sunday night. After retiring pinch-hitter Gerald Williams
on a fly to left center, Myers threw an 0-2 wild pitch to
pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn that allowed Jones to take second with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Caminiti robbed Colbrunn of a hit by throwing
him out on a hard smash to third, Guillen slapped a two-out,
run-scoring single to left. Ruben Rivera closed his glove too soon
trying to field the ball on a hop, enabling Jones to beat the throw
home, and the Braves had a 4-3 lead, their first of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, meanwhile, took second on Rivera's belated throw home,
then advanced to third when Lockhart beat out an infield hit on an
0-2 pitch. Myers then walked Chipper Jones on a full-count pitch to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   On came the right-hander Miceli to face Galarraga, who drilled a
1-0 pitch 459 feet to deep left-center field for his first four
runs batted in of the series. As he belted just the sixth grand
slam in NLCS history, Galarraga yelled something to himself as
loudly as he could.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had a five-run lead and were on their way to their
first victory of the series. &QL;

John P.Lopez 
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ It was a story about redundancy. Redundancy, I said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The running back, the receiver, the cornerback, the defensive
tackle and the offensive line. Old reliables. Emmitt Smith, Michael
Irvin, Deion Sanders, Leon Lett and Nate Newton and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly for some people, even those who have celebrated
Sunday-afternoon regular-season victories again and again over the
years, there remains a spark and a thrill in simply putting on the
pads, playing the game and earning a dollar or two. Or 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it never gets old. It never causes the nerves to fray.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys 27, Panthers 20 on Sunday showed us that no matter how
much money is in the bank, how pitiful your division is looking and
how abundantly average your team might be compared to what it once
was, some people still bust their tails when the whistle blows.
</P>
<P>
   For some, even those with stars on their helmets and
championship rings on their fingers, an October regular-season game
against a bad team is not monotony _ something you would rather
skip in favor of a hunting trip. It still means something.
</P>
<P>
   You step in, bad knee and all, like Lett did Sunday afternoon,
and you have maybe your best game of the season with six tackles, a
forced fumble and dominance up front.
</P>
<P>
   You grab the ball deep in the backfield like Smith did time and
again against the Carolina Panthers, knowing you probably have lost
a step and the defense will be keying only on you since Troy Aikman
is on the sidelines with an injury. But you twist for every extra
yard on every play. You finish with 112 yards, score a touchdown
and look terrific all day.
</P>
<P>
   You get smashed to the ground on a run-of-the-mill sideline
pattern, like Irvin did late in the first quarter, bloodying your
nose. But you step back in and just moments later set up a
touchdown with a clutch catch on virtually the same route. You have
your best game of the year, finishing with six catches and 146
yards.
</P>
<P>
   You dominate an entire side of the field during the
game-deciding stretch, like Newton and Larry Allen did Sunday, and
ultimately earn all the praise from the head coach after the
offense rocks the Panthers for 428 yards.
</P>
<P>
   You ice the game by prowling quietly for three-plus quarters,
almost anonymously, if that's possible for a guy nicknamed Neon,
then step in front of a last-ditch toss, like Sanders did in the
final seconds, and intercept the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was explosive. Redundant. Irvin was clutch. Redundant.
Deion made a big play. Redundant. Lett clogged the middle, and the
offensive line made big, gaping holes.
</P>
<P>
   We have heard all these things before.
</P>
<P>
   But it never gets old for this team from the NFC Least searching
for mention among the NFL heavies of 1998. And it all seemed
particularly significant in Dallas on this day, when the opponent
was a winless team whose starting quarterback gave up and whose
starting tailback forgot how to find the airport.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same old story for the Dallas Cowboys at Texas
Stadium. That's the promising news. Great players still did great
things.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly for some people, being young, popular and a
multimillionaire remains a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   But for Kerry Collins, the Panthers starter who shocked his team
last week when he announced he had lost his mental edge and
willingness to play the game, it was all too much. The $6 million
signing bonus Collins received three years ago and the $1.1 million
bonus before this season apparently were enough to send him into a
funk and ultimately a duck-hunting trip over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After his self-demotion, Collins was deactivated for Sunday's
game. Some of his teammates would tell you calling Collins
deactivated is itself a redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a seat on us,'' Panthers guard Corbin Lacina said.
``The last couple of weeks, Kerry didn't have anything for us. He
didn't have the confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, running back Fred Lane missed the team's charter
on the way to Dallas and was benched by coach Dom Capers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our rules,'' Capers said. ``We abide by them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers spent the postgame wondering how things could have
gone so wrong so fast. Just two seasons ago, this was a team that
beat the Cowboys in an impressive playoff show. Just last December,
they beat them again.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, while Carolina might have played hard under the
hand of former Cowboys backup Steve Beuerlein, it made critical
mistakes and failed to make critical plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a passion out there,'' fullback William Floyd said.
``Steve was the new sheriff in town, and he acted like it. He
wanted to be out there. He took control. But we didn't have enough.
I don't know what it was that killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Deion still wanted to play and did. Collins didn't. Irvin still
wanted to play and did. Lane missed the plane. Smith, Newton,
Allen, Lett. They all wanted to be here.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still felt the hunger, even on a run-of-the-mill NFL
Sunday afternoon. Apparently, it never gets monotonous for these
guys.

SPORTS COLUMN: WAS THERE OR WASN'T THERE A SPY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for updating) (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ You can call it espionage, or you can
call it surveillance. But in pro football, a spy by any other name
would smell as sour.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants lost to the Atlanta Falcons Sunday night, 34-20,
part of the story line was the Giants' suspicion during the week
that Dan Reeves, the former Giants coach who now tutors the
Falcons, had a spy peering at the Giants' outdoor practice field
from high in the nearby Sheraton Meadowlands Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Giants official, a Falcon assistant coach who had
been on Reeves' Giants staff, Joe DeCamillis, was suspected of
being involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
   DeCamillis, who is also Reeves' son-in-law, denied any
involvement, saying: ``I ain't doing anything like that. Coach
Reeves would be angry if he knew someone did that.'' But as the
Giants' coach for four seasons, Reeves realized the Sheraton and an
adjacent high-rise office building afforded a clear view of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan wanted to put up a wall to block that view of the practice
field,'' a former Giants official recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Reeves did or didn't do last week, the Giants had a
security official with high-powered binoculars surveying the
windows of the hotel and the office building during practice. Coach
Jim Fassel also took the team inside the team's practice bubble to
go through the new plays designed for the Falcon game.
</P>
<P>
   Such paranoia by Giant coaches isn't new. The week before a 1991
game with the Washington Redskins, Coach Ray Handley had similar
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times,'' Handley said then, ``when teams were
very well advised of things that we were doing in games that we
thought were new and would surprise them, but it did not surprise
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever did or did not occur during practice that week, the
Giants lost that game, 17-13, in what was an 8-8 season.
</P>
<P>
   Spying, or the suspicion of spying, is not new among National
Football League coaches. Whenever a helicopter flew anywhere near
the Jets' practice in the week before a game with the Oakland
Raiders three decades ago, Coach Weeb Ewbank glared at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Davis has somebody up there watching us,'' Ewbank growled,
referring to the Raiders' managing general genius. ``Don't do
anything until that copter leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Davis enjoyed a sinister reputation. Harland
Svare, the San Diego Chargers' coach who had been a Giants
linebacker, once sat in the visiting locker room at the Oakland
Coliseum and shouted at a light fixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you're up there, Al Davis,'' Svare said. ``I know
you're up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Told later of Svare's accusation, Davis didn't hesitate to
perpetuate his sinister reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing wasn't in the light fixture,'' Davis said. ``I'll
tell you that much.''
</P>
<P>
   To thwart the possibility of spying, each NFL team now has a
security guard, if not several guards, at its practice complex. As
the Los Angeles Rams' coach three decades ago, George Allen was the
first coach to take that precaution, hiring Ed Boynton, a retired
Long Beach, Calif., policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Double O,'' Boynton accompanied Allen to the
Redskins. He once chased a suspect from the chemical lab of the
high school near the Redskin training camp in Carlisle, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   At least a decade before Double O arrived, Paul Brown, the Hall
of Fame coach of the Cleveland Browns, was his own security
officer. Whenever the Browns practiced in cavernous Cleveland
Stadium, if a stranger suddenly appeared, Brown would stop practice
and have the stranger ushered out.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank, a Browns' assistant under Brown, took that distrust to
Baltimore as the Colts' coach _ even a distrust of Brown himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, when the defending champion Colts were about to play
the Browns, Ewbank sent the equipment manager, Fred Schubach,
across the street from the open end of Baltimore's old Memorial
Stadium to check for suspicious strangers in the Ednor Garden
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all Colt fans here,'' one resident told Schubach, ``but
if Coach Ewbank feels that strongly about it, come in and look
around.''
</P>
<P>
   No suspicious strangers were found, but the Colts lost, 38-31,
one of their three defeats that season in repeating as NFL
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches, not only Jim Fassel, still think a suspicious
stranger might be out there somewhere watching practice. And it's
easier for a spy now. For years, some NFL teams didn't wear numbers
on their practice jerseys to thwart the possibility of spies. But
when each team began filming practices, numbers were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Spies or no spies. &QL;

DESPITE HYPE, WIN VS. DENVER WASN'T A `MUST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To borrow from the football vernacular, the ``hot
read'' angle for today's column would be a spirited bash of the
Seahawks for squandering their 3-0 seasonal start.
</P>
<P>
   The recent three-game stretch against some of the NFL's best,
which ended Sunday, was forecast to be the season-maker for Paul
Allen's little investment in sinew instead of cyber.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Seahawks lost at Pittsburgh and Kansas City and Sunday
at the Kingdome 21-16 to Denver, the conventional wisdom is that
the season is toast, the Seahawks are still boys among men, and
let's see what the Sonics are ... well, forget that last part.
</P>
<P>
   Still, was not the game against the defending Super Bowl
champions called a must-win game in some precincts? When a team
loses a must-win, is there anything left but the eternal abyss, or
worse _ the Mariner bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   To make our offense a little less predictable, we'll skip the
hot read, and choose another route.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a must-win game _ not even in the NFL, where the
overused phrase ``big game'' has the same value as an air kiss in
Hollywood. It didn't make or break the Seahawk season. It proved
little except that biggest difference between the Broncos and
Seahawks is running back Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   A considerable difference, true, but the Seahawks aren't in the
Super Bowl hunt. The Seahawks will be thrilled to take a little
postseason food off the table and come back for big meat another
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like with two minutes to go, we're going to win this
game,'' said Seahawk guard Pete Kendall. ``I think it was third and
nine, and we knew we were in four-down territory (at the Denver 28)
and there was no doubt we'd make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, quarterback John Friesz threw a bad pass that was
picked off. End of game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was hardly worse that the pass Denver quarterback John
Elway threw in the second quarter that Seahawk linebacker Darrin
Smith intercepted and returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were few Seahawk mistakes that weren't matched by
the Broncos. So too for the splendid plays. The Seahawks had only
the one turnover, had the same number of QB sacks as Denver and had
about the same penalty yardage. Elway was little better than the
Warren Moon/Friesz combo. The only difference in total offense came
on Davis's 70-yard run in the final minute when the game was being
tucked away.
</P>
<P>
   Friesz put it as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody all the time,'' he said, ``is doing a little bit
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about it. Despite losing the alleged three big games, the
Seahawks have not been physically dominated nor soundly beaten.
They have lost them by a combined 19 points, 11 at KC in the first
tsunami recorded in Midwest weather history.
</P>
<P>
   They are bleeding from a hundred small wounds, most
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the difference was the Seahawks healed up from some,
moved on and were on the edge of upsetting the champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games, when we'd get backed up by a penalty,
forget it,'' said Kendall. ``I thought today we did a good job of
overcoming adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug ourselves a hole, but in the second half, we got to a
point were we could see out.''
</P>
<P>
   What can be seen is the shrunken distance between themselves and
the Broncos. The most recent two games against Denver have been
lost by a total of eight points. Last November, the Seahawks fell
30-27 at Mile High when they were stopped on downs at their own 46
with 1:02 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the defense curbed the NFL's No. 2 offense with some
superlative work by the secondary. The offense, once Moon was
benched _ which should have happened sooner, given his reduced
effectiveness from a cracked rib _ moved against a good defense
better than it has all season.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to the Seahawks is nothing like what used to
happen to them, even as recently as early last season.
</P>
<P>
   They are no longer ill-prepared, overmatched and under-talented.
They have the NFL's fourth-highest payroll, quality veterans on
either side and a little depth on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   They have offensive problems, but it doesn't include turnovers.
It's not as if coach Dennis Erickson and his staff don't know
offense.
</P>
<P>
   That was the indictment of these coaches before _ offense was
(begin italic) all (end italic) they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effort is not a problem, either,'' said Friesz. ``It's a great
group of guys who were meant to win football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesz recalled during his time as a backup in San Diego that
the Chargers started the 1992 season 0-4 and won 11 of the next 12
``with not nearly the talent of people we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Players always dismiss talk of tight games, moral victories,
cutting the gap and other such sporting homilies as irrelevant to
the matter of W's and L's. But that political correctness ignores
the simple fact that the stage of almost has to be reached before
it can be surpassed.
</P>
<P>
   There are no must-wins for teams in the almost category.
</P>
<P>
   The only must is to get better, for which the 10-game season
starts in two weeks.

   SEATTLE _ As the tears began welling in Warren Moon's eyes, it
was difficult to tell which hurt more: The cracked rib just behind
his left armpit, or the sting of losing a third straight close
game.
</P>
<P>
   Moon paused, heaved a heavy and prolonged sigh, then finally
offered, ``It's a combination. I am in a lot of pain right now, but
I'm very disappointed about the outcome of this game too. We had a
chance to win and we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third week in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, all the ingredients seemed to be there for an upset of
the unbeaten Denver Broncos. The defense again played well enough
to win, and even scored on a 23-yard interception return by
linebacker Darrin Smith. The first true sellout at the Kingdome
since 1993 was loud enough to disrupt the Broncos' offense and at
times seemed capable of willing the Seahawks to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But again, as was the case in losses at Pittsburgh and Kansas
City the previous two weeks, the offense didn't hold up its end and
the Broncos escaped with a 21-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the rib Moon cracked in Kansas City that forced the
Seahawks quarterback to leave the game in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the interception John Freisz threw right at Broncos
linebacker Glenn Cadrez after replacing Moon. It happened at the
Denver 27-yard line, with 1 minute, 49 seconds left in the game and
with wide receiver Joey Galloway wide open over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on another slew of penalties against the Seahawks'
struggling offense and suddenly suspect special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Seahawks are now 3-3 and searching for
answers to too many questions heading into their bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' defensive end Michael Sinclair said. ``I
don't think they came in here and just blew us away. That's the
frustrating part, not winning these games when we've had chances to
win them. But we're not getting it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something. We've got to change something.''
</P>
<P>
   The now 6-0 Broncos had something to do with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis ran for 208 yards, the second-highest total ever
against the Seahawks, just behind Bo Jackson's infamous 221-yard
effort in a Monday night game at the Kingdome in 1987. Davis scored
on a 2-yard run in the fourth quarter and then eliminated any
Seahawk comeback hopes that remained after Cadrez's interception by
bolting 70 yards to the Seattle 5-yard line with less than 90
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway, making his first start after missing the
previous two games with a sore hamstring and back, threw TD passes
of 50 yards to Rod Smith and 19 yards to Shannon Sharpe. Smith
finished with eight catches for 136 yards, both career highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here, we knew it wasn't going to be a typical
regular-season game. It somewhat had playoff implications to it and
it felt like a playoff game,'' said Davis, who now has rushed for
865 yards and nine TDs in just six games _ a pace that would
produce a 2,306-yard, 24-TD season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was huge, no doubt about it. Coming into their place
and beating them here is definitely a check for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Broncos could not checkmate the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Elway's TD passes on two of the Broncos' first four
possessions, the Seahawks stayed close because of Smith's
interception return and a 23-yard field goal from Todd Peterson to
cap the opening series of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's big play, the fourth interception return for a TD by the
defense this season, came from the zone-blitz package that has been
so successful for the Seahawks. The linebacker dropped into
coverage on the weak side and all of a sudden there was Elway's
pass that was intended for Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened up and my eyes got big because I saw that he was
going to throw it ... He probably didn't see me at all,'' Darrin
Smith said. He was right. He did fool Elway, who is in his 16th and
perhaps final season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something I haven't seen in 16 years, when the
soft-side linebacker picks off a weak-side hook,'' Elway said.
``I'm giving the credit to Darrin. He made a great, great play. If
I had to do it again, I'd throw the same play, the same pass I
threw. He just made a great play.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense seemed to make plays all afternoon to keep the
Seahawks in this game. Linebacker Chad Brown made 14 tackles,
including a sack. Cornerback Willie Williams broke up four passes.
Cornerback Shawn Springs intercepted his third pass of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense was brilliant most of the game,'' guard Brian
Habib said. ``They kept us in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   After Davis scored to make it 21-10, and Moon was forced to
leave the game, it seemed the Seahawks were done. But Friesz hooked
up with Mike Pritchard on a 50-yard TD pass to cut the lead to five
points with 10{ minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great play by Pritchard and it was also a great
read by Friesz,'' coach Dennis Erickson said, noting that they saw
the Broncos were blitzing and made them pay.
</P>
<P>
   And Friesz wasn't done. On the Seahawks' next possession, he
drove them from their own 23 to the Denver 28. Suddenly, it was
Mile High Stadium in November of 1995, when Friesz came off the
bench to erase a 20-point deficit against the Broncos for the
biggest comeback win in Seahawk history.
</P>
<P>
   But it took Cadrez only a blink to slap everyone back to
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Cadrez was supposed to be blitzing on the play. But when his gap
closed, he said, ``I figured don't just waste myself. So I backed
up and kind of read the quarterback. He looked one way and I went
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesz never saw the Broncos' linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a guy you don't look at,'' Friesz said. ``You've got
your eyes moving a thousand different directions and at that time
the clock is going off in your head and you have to get rid of the
ball. He was the guy I lost and didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Then result, for the Seahawks, was pain on top of pain.

SURPRISING CAL COMING TO SEATTLE 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After going without a victory for 26 years at USC, Cal
has now won two in a row in Los Angeles against the Trojans. The
Bears might start thinking anything is possible, even a victory
over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cal (4-1) comes to Husky Stadium Saturday as the third of four
straight October home games for Washington (3-2). Through good
times and bad, through Joe Kelly and Jason Shelley, nothing has
been quite as certain for Washington as a victory over Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1976, Don James' second year as coach, has Cal beaten
Washington. The Bears have whiffed in the 15 games since then,
sometimes in the worst-imaginable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Cal had the Huskies down 27-3 in Seattle and lost 28-27
in what is regarded as Washington's biggest comeback ever. In 1993,
in what might have been Damon Huard's worst and best game at
Washington _ he had a fumble and four interceptions _ the Huskies
fell behind 23-3 in the third quarter, and rallied in the final
moments for a 24-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing is contagious,'' coach Tom Holmoe said Sunday from his
office at Cal, and he hopes winning is, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cal has beaten Houston, Oklahoma and USC by a total of six
points. The latest was a 32-31 win over the Trojans, achieved on a
22-point comeback in the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you win a couple of close games, you just believe you're
going to do it,'' Holmoe said. ``If it happens again, the team will
know it's been in close games.''
</P>
<P>
   At Montlake, meanwhile, Washington savored a 53-12 victory over
Utah State, behind 13 sacks. UW coach Jim Lambright assessed
injuries, and it appears wide receiver Ja'Warren Hooker's is worst
of the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker sustained a subluxation of the right shoulder, which
means there was movement in the joint, probably sidelining him
against Cal. Receiver Gerald Harris might play for the first time
since the Nebraska game, however.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Willie Hurst was limping with a bruised hip incurred
Saturday. The Huskies hope to have him available to practice by
Tuesday but his status is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Brock Huard is able to throw lightly despite his
injured shoulder, but is highly unlikely to play. He would give way
again to Marques Tuiasosopo.
</P>
<P>
   Against USC, the Bears fell behind with an uncharacteristic
performance on defense, and won it with an unusual outburst by the
offense. Cal allowed USC 296 yards in the first half and trailed
31-10 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cal then clicked on offense, its season-long bugaboo, went ahead
and was at the USC 22 when the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 42 runs and 42 passes, which is very good,'' Holmoe
said. ``Early in the season, I guess we were pretty predictable.
Maybe last night, we mixed it up better.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmoe's offensive coordinator, former Dallas Cowboys tight end
Doug Cosbie, called plays from the press box for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright liked the Cal victory over USC, but not primarily
because it helps get his team's attention for the Bears. He's
thinking standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives USC (4-2, 2-1) a loss,'' he said, smiling.

PINIELLA SAYS M'S NOT SEEKING SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If changes are made to the Mariners' coaching staff
for 1999, manager Lou Piniella said, they will not be made with an
eye on his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't thought anything like that,'' Piniella said Sunday
from his home in Tampa, Fla. ``We're just trying to put together
the best staff we can.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . We have explored some possibilities, but it's not with
the idea of putting a coach in place to succeed me or not.
Invariably, that's going to happen, but that's not why we're
looking as an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella, who has managed the M's since 1993, is under contract
through the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are contacting coaching candidates from inside and
outside the organization, and former Colorado Rockies manager Don
Baylor is a possible addition.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, a teammate of Piniella's with the 1983 and '84 New York
Yankees, managed Colorado for six years until being replaced by Jim
Leyland last week. Baylor has been offered a front-office job with
the Rockies and will earn $600,000 from them next year.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella did not say if the Mariners had talked to Baylor, but
he indicated the team will not make large-scale coaching changes.
Four of the M's seven coaches have been re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad year last year,'' said Piniella, whose team
finished 76-85, ``and when you do, you look at all you can and see
where you can improve. That's the first order of business (the
coaching staff), and it will be done in short order.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Woody Woodward and Piniella both said a decision
should be made on the coaches by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward has also been reviewing reports on potential free
agents and players who might be available through trade, and
keeping track of the team's prospects in the instructional league.
</P>
<P>
   M'S NOTES: Several Mariners have undergone minor surgeries since
the end of the season. Left-hander Jeff Fassero is throwing lightly
at the M's spring-training complex in Peoria, Ariz., after having
three loose bone chips removed from his elbow and should be
recovered by the end of December. Designated hitter Edgar Martinez
(left) and first baseman David Segui (right) both had arthro-scopic
knee surgery and also should be fine before spring training. . . .
Right-hander Freddy Garcia, who would have gotten a September
call-up if not for a triceps injury, is in the instructional league
learning to throw a circle change-up, which should relieve the
stress on the muscle. ``He's coming along fine,'' Piniella said. .
. . The prospect who has Piniella's immediate attention, however,
doesn't even play baseball. Piniella's son Derek plays football for
Virginia Tech, and Piniella will take in the Hokies' homecoming
game against Temple this weekend.

THIS VICTORY WAS VERY UNCARDINAL-LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Electrical power finally was restored to Sun
Devil Stadium on Sunday. Cardinals fans got the shock of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   They saw a game so unusual, a victory so un-Cardinal-like, that
even the players expressed amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Usually when the boys in red pants commit five turnovers and get
a punt blocked they find themselves playing catch-up at the end of
the game as they did last week, trying desperately to stop the
clock. But here they were, with three minutes left, beating the
Chicago Bears, 20-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't led by 20 points in the fourth quarter
since _ hmm, how long has it been?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Centers couldn't remember ever enjoying such a comfortable
lead. He has been a Cardinal nine long years.
</P>
<P>
   This was beyond unusual. This was unheard of. But then who ever
heard of a middle linebacker picking off an enemy pass and then
stealing a second one and then a ``third'' and also causing a
fumble and snatching a blocked punt out of the air and doing a
Walter Payton imitation, running 31 yards for a first down, all in
``one'' game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe it,'' Centers said, speaking for us all.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald McKinnon did it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals defense did it. This group which is establishing
an identity and a reputation picked off four Erik Kramer passes and
forced four fumbles. Eight Chicago turnovers. That's a lot, even
for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill saw one team suffer
eight turnovers in a game was in 1950. Cardinals quarterback Jim
Hardy delivered eight passes into the hands of the Philadelphia
Eagles. Like milk of magnesia, the NFL record has stood the test of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (1-5) is a bad team, one of several. The Bears primarily
exist this year for the purpose of taking a pie in the face. But
``eight'' turnovers. Dave Wannstedt may not survive this.
</P>
<P>
   For all anyone knows, the Bears may have fired their head coach
during the third quarter but Wannstedt never got the message.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon intercepted it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals let their first shutout in six years slip away.
But how can anyone mark down the defense? This group continues to
get better and better. Playing without their starting cornerbacks,
the Cardinals snuffed the Bears running game and turned Kramer's
afternoon into a nightmare. There was Eric Swann, in his face.
There was Simeon Rice, scooping up a Curtis Enis fumble. There was
McKinnon, here, there, everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon is small for an NFL middle linebacker. Some questioned
whether he could replace Eric Hill. But you know how many
interceptions Hill made in nine years as a Cardinal? Three fewer
than McKinnon did in one day.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the right place at the right time, always around the
football. Kramer, his victim, must have felt like a good-natured
volunteer from the audience who spends a few moments on stage with
a nightclub magician. Before sending the fellow back to his seat,
the entertainer, an accomplished pickpocket, says, ``Oh, you forgot
your watch . . .'' Then, matter-of-factly, ``Did you drop this?''
handing the subject his wallet. Money clip, pocket comb and
suspenders follow.
</P>
<P>
   For a defensive coach, this was a dream game. Dave McGinnis
called it a ``monster'' effort. This was a game that helps
reinforce the players' belief that they have something special
here, or will some day. Positive results build confidence and trust
in the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like inviting friends over for dinner,'' McGinnis, the
defensive coordinator said, ``and they can't get enough to eat.''
He looked around him, at the happy faces. Simeon Rice's grin lit
the locker room. ``They like what we're feeding them.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense is growing. It carried the offense again. That the
Cardinals could produce only 20 points off eight turnovers against
a weak team is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a big win, an important win. The Cardinals are 3-3,
for the first time since 1991. They're playing in a weak division.
Can they win eight games, or nine?
</P>
<P>
   A linebacker intercepted three passes Sunday. At halftime, a
63-year-old man kicked a 25-yard field goal and won $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anything seems possible. &QL;

GIFT BEARERS  
 CARDINALS' DEFENSE FORCES 8 TURNOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Perhaps it happened when they were located on
Racine Street, or when they were the Morgan Athletic Club or the
Normals.
</P>
<P>
   Some time in the Racine/Chicago/St. Louis/Phoenix/Arizona
Cardinals' 100-year history, they must have forced their opponent
to commit eight turnovers as they did in Sunday's 20-7 victory over
the Chicago Bears at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL and the Cardinals aren't aware of it. So the eight
takeaways, including three interceptions by middle linebacker
Ronald McKinnon, stand as a team record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't never had a defense this good,'' said Cardinals
offensive tackle Lomas Brown of his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Bears quarterback Erik Kramer entered the game having thrown
only two interceptions and having been sacked only four times. He
was picked off four times and sacked twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, 3-3 for the first time since 1991, also forced
four fumbles and deflected about a half dozen passes. Three of the
tips resulted in interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our front four is causing so much havoc,'' said cornerback
Aeneas Williams, who played sparingly after suffering a sprained
ankle on a first-quarter interception return. ``They are getting to
the guys before they even get to the line of scrimmage. They are
getting to the hole and stripping the ball. They are hitting guys
before they are prepared to get hit, and the balls are coming out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe in the adage: Defense wins games. Offense
brings the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 50,495 fans wasn't thrilled with the offense's
three lost fumbles and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the Cardinals' 20-point output instead of perhaps
double that amount. Five times they began drives in Bears'
territory but managed only two touchdowns and two field goals by
Joe Nedney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our defense wasn't playing like they were, it could have
been 70 (points),'' said Bears Coach Dave Wannstedt, whose team
dropped to 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' most important turnovers were the two forced in a
two-minute span late in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They were leading, 3-0, when former Bears defensive lineman Carl
Simpson stripped rookie running back Curtis Enis at the Cardinals'
48. Defensive end Simeon Rice picked up the loose ball and ran 27
yards to the Bears' 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``This defense is like a desert swarm,'' said defensive tackle
Eric Swann.
</P>
<P>
   Five plays later, reserve running back Mario Bates scored on a
2-yard run, his first touchdown as a Cardinal, to give them a 10-0
lead with 1:53 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Bates forced Glyn Milburn to fumble, and
the Cardinals' Kwamie Lassiter recovered at the Bears' 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bates' second 2-yard score gave the Cardinals a 17-0 halftime
lead, their biggest margin of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals turned the ball over on their first two
possessions of the second half, but their defense held each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're killing ourselves,'' Brown said. ``The defense is
carrying us now. When we hold up our end of the bargain, we're
going to be something to contend with.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense also was responsible for the Cardinals' final score.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the fourth quarter, McKinnon stripped
fullback Ty Hallock at the Bears' 43. Rookie defensive end Andre
Wadsworth recovered at the 45, setting up Nedney's 40-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon wasn't finished putting on a show.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bears' Ricky Bell blocked Scott Player's punt midway
through the fourth quarter, McKinnon picked it up near the right
sideline and cut across the field for a 31-yard gain and a first
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out of gas,'' Wadsworth said. ``He blew a gasket after
he came to the sideline. He lost oil. He got a flat tire.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon's three interceptions were a single-game record for a
Cardinals linebacker. His 31-yard return of the blocked punt was
the team's longest run of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do it all,'' said McKinnon, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   The only downer for the defense was allowing the Bears to score
on a 79-yard touchdown pass with 2:30 left. Otherwise, they would
have had their first shutout over the Bears in 71 years.

   Ironically, this land-locked desert state promises to have it
biggest Olympic impact in the water. Arizona has some of America's
best-and-brightest swimming prospects. One is a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was Arizona's most decorated Olympian in 1996. He won two
individual silver medals and two relay gold. It's the silver that
people remember. And it's the silver that sets the stage for him to
attract a lot of attention before Sydney. Hall lost twice to
Russian Alexander Popov. He has yet to beat him. A Hall-Popov
rematch looms.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an if. Arizona's most-decorated Olympian is also its
most controversial. Last summer, the Phoenix Swim Club sprinter
served a two-month suspension, later lifted, for a positive
marijuana test. He's often at odds with USA Swimming, one of the
United States Olympic Committee's many Olympic governing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, USA Swimming appreciates his singular talent. It continues
to pay him a stipend to train. Despite the controversy, he's a
member of its All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also has come to symbolize a potentially rich area in which
to train and develop Olympic swimmers. A leading Olympic candidate
is Misty Hyman, a Stanford sophomore and a former Shadow Mountain
High School star and a link in the long line of great butterfly
swimmers that includes Ahmann, a 1992 silver medalist from Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman missed making the 1996 team by three-hundreths of a
second. Ironically, her greatest challenge in 2000 could come from
young women within the state. There's Kayln Keller at Phoenix Swim
Club, Hyman's teammate Jana Krohn at the Valley's Desert Fox Club,
Ashley Tappin of Tucson and 1996 Olympian Trina Jackson, also of
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Tappin and Jackson are members of the national champion
Hillenbrand club, which is coached by Frank Busch of the University
of Arizona. Busch is swimming's 1998 Coach of the Year. He's a
leading candidate for the next Olympic job.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson also is a major corner of the gymnastics map. It's known
for Strug and her vault with a sprained ankle en route to a team
gold medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Tucson's impact on gymnastics could come from the men.
Yewki Tomita, 18, is a contender for the U.S. team. His dad, Yochi
Tomita of Tucson's Gymnastics World, is in line for a coaching
post. He was an Olympic assistant in 1984. Another leading
possibilities is Jason Gatson, a Mesa native and national team
member.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential Arizona Olympians: &QL; 
Track &QL; 
Dan O'Brien, the 1996 decathlon gold medalist, has a home in the
Valley. Sprinter Tim Harden, a member of 1996's silver-medal
winning 400 relay, is living and training in Tempe. Arizona senior
Amy Skieresz of Tucson is a possibility in distance events. Trina
Painter of Flagstaff is a contender in the marathon. Two-time
Olympic hurdler Lynda Tolbert-Goode has talked about Sydney, and
former ASU sprinter Maicel Malone, a 1996 relay gold medalist, is
expected to make another run. Gea Johnson, free from a drug
controversy, has talked about a comeback in the heptathlon. &QL; 
Wrestling &QL; 
Jones, a former ASU coach now at West Virginia, might attempt a
comeback. Two Valley wrestlers, 1996 silver medalist Melvin Douglas
and fellow Olympian Townsend Saunders, also are possibilities. In
all, the Valley-based Sunkist Kids has 12 wrestlers ranked by U.S.
Wrestling. In Greco-Roman, heavyweight Matt Gahfari, a 1996 silver
medalist, is a good bet to make a return. &QL; 
Boxing &QL; 
Gyms in the Valley's Mexican-American neighborhoods are filled with
kids who could be the next Carbajal, a 1988 silver medalist.
Featherweight Ray Martinez, 18, is a leading contender. At 140
pounds, Ramon Olivas is quickly emerging after a national
Blue-and-Gold title a few weeks ago. At heavyweight, there are
former Scottsdale resident Davarryl Williamson and Keith Govan of
the Police Athletic League. &QL; 
Archery &QL; 
Barrs, formerly of Mesa and now of Salt Lake City, figures to try
for his third Olympics. He'll bring his Walkman. His wife, Janet
Barrs, is another contender. Also don't forget Atlanta gold
medalist Justin Huish, formerly of ASU, and 1996 teammate Judi
Adams of Scottsdale. &QL;

`ATHLETES' DEFI NITION UPSETS DISABLED

<P>
   PHOENIX - After 104 years without a definition, the U.S. Olympic
Committee has decided who qualifies as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ice dancers are in and ballroom dancers out _ or vice
versa. But the definition of ``athlete'' which establishes the
criteria necessary to be a member of the Athletes Advisory Council
and athlete member of the board as approved Sunday on the final day
of the USOC board of directors meeting in downtown Phoenix .
</P>
<P>
   ``No document in the history of the USOC has ever gone through
so many revisions,'' said Steve Sobel, chair of the USOC membership
and credentials committee.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote was not unanimous, as representatives of disabled
sports questioned why their athletes remain ineligible for the AAC,
board of directors and groups operating under the board. To qualify
for those positions, an athlete must have represented the United
States in the Olympic or Pan American Games, world championships or
an Operation Gold event within the 10 years preceding election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only do this one step at a time,'' USOC President
William Hybl told Doug Pringle of the Disabled Sports Associations.
Hybl then established a task force, to be chaired by Terry
O'Donnell, to integrate disabled athletes into the highest reaches
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, two disabled athletes are being invited to AAC
meetings as observers.
</P>
<P>
   The 110-member board also heard from John Krimsky, USOC deputy
secretary general, about a 50-city Magic of the Olympics tour that
will run from February through August 2000 as a buildup to the
Sydney Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stops will be the Phoenix Symphony Hall, where
opening ceremonies are being held today for the eighth U.S. Olympic
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour Magic of the Olympics will feature the U.S. Olympic
Symphony with music of John Williams and conductor Keith Lockhart,
video from Olympic historian Bud Greenspan, pop entertainers and
Olympic athletes such as decathlete Dan O'Brien of Phoenix,
heptathlete Jackie Joyner Kersee, gymnast Mary Lou Retton and diver
Greg Louganis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know of the Olympics, but not about the Olympics,''
said USOC Executive Director Dick Schultz. ``It's all part of
building the brand, which supports a variety of programs we have
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   All presumably with a positive impact on the USOC-Salt Lake
Organizing Committee joint marketing of the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake committee, told the
board that replacing IBM as an Olympic worldwide sponsor is one of
the most critical short-term issues. IBM is ending its 30-year
Olympic association after the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Today's congress highlights will include appearances by 60
Olympians at 17 Valley schools through the Champions of Life
outreach program, and a keynote address by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., at the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Olympians scheduled to be at schools and working with
students in interactive sessions at the Phoenix Civic Plaza deck
are wrestler Matt Ghaffari, archer Justin Huish, gymnasts Shannon
Miller and Blaine Wilson, swimmer John Naber and speed
skater-cyclist Chris Witty. &QL;

BATES' TD CARRIES `WORTH THE WAIT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Sure, Adrian Murrell is a proven back who
deserves his starting assignment in the Cardinals backfield.
Getting him plus a seventh-round draft pick from the New York Jets
in exchange for a third-round pick was one of the the Cardinals'
great off-season heists.
</P>
<P>
   But there is talent on the Cardinals bench, too. Mario Bates was
signed as a free agent, and Michael Pittman was drafted in the
fourth round. And neither has been getting much action.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bates hadn't touched the ball at all until he carried
it three times Sunday in the first half of the Cardinals 20-7 win
over the Chicago Bears. But two of those three totes went for
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time coming,'' Bates said. ``But it was worth
the wait. The coaches kept telling me, `Be patient, be patient.'
Coming into the season, I thought the rotation might be different.
The main thing is I was able to do something for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman proved to be a bulldog, and not just because he is from
Fresno State. He carried 17 times for 56 mostly hard-fought yards.
In the fourth quarter, when the Cardinals (3-3) enjoyed a 20-0 edge
and were interested in running out the clock, Pittman got the call
13 times, responding with 54 yards. He fumbled one away, though,
setting up the Bears only score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a rookie mistake that I learned a lot from,'' Pittman
said. ``I have a bad habit of stretching the ball out to get extra
yards. In that situation, I should just go down because we had a
big lead and we wanted to use the clock. Next time, I'll do what I
have to do to hold onto the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just good to get a few opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell still was the team's leading rusher with 67 yards on 21
carries.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was the first time the Cardinals got into the
three-back rotation, and it produced 145 rushing yards on a
season-high 46 carries, allowing the Cardinals to control the clock
for a season-high 36 minutes _ a whopping 12-minute advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they decided to do it undercover,'' Bates said with a
smile. ``Every running back wants the ball. It was nice to finally
touch the ball. It's hard to get enough carries for everybody. We
have a lot of talent back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin has been looking for this kind of production
from the ground game. Realizing he had two capable backs who were
just spectators for five weeks, he had the coaches design specific
packages for each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Mario and we like Michael and we want to get them in,
but sometimes it's hard to do,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, Bates and Pittman each has a significantly different
style that makes them a formidable rotation, according to center
Aaron Graham, who calls the blocking schemes up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittman likes to cram it up in there. He's a really hard
runner,'' Graham said. ``Adrian is a slashing type runner. Mario
did a great job on the goal line. You've got speed and power with
those three guys, and you can give the defense different looks.
That's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this defense of ours is playing, giving us great field
position, if we can put points on the board we're going to win
games. We still have work to do on our offense, but being able to
run the ball is big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting close to where we want to be with our offense,''
Graham said.``We should have been able to score some more, but
we're excited. We've made progress. It wasn't great, but it was
good.'' &QL;

GAME BALL IS 1 OF MANY MCKINNON HAD HANDS ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - As the Cardinals celebrated their 20-7 defeat of
the Chicago Bears Sunday, the team announced that tackle Eric Swann
had been named the ``Truly Nolan Defensive Exterminator of the
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a Truly Interesting question. What more is Ronald
McKinnon supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see:
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon intercepted three Erik Kramer passes, a single-game
Cardinals record for a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   He caused a fumble, punching the ball away from Kramer for
teammate Andre Wadsworth to recover. It led to a 40-yard Joe Nedney
field goal and 20-0 Arizona lead.
</P>
<P>
   And he turned disaster into a positive play when the Bears'
Ricky Bell blocked Scott Player's punt deep in Arizona territory.
McKinnon hauled the ball in and headed upfield like a tailback for
31 yards and a first down.
</P>
<P>
   His performance was Truly Unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of big plays Ronnie made, I haven't been around
anyone who's done anything close to that in a game,'' said
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin, who awarded McKinnon a game ball.
</P>
<P>
   Swann had a nice game himself, playing despite swelling in a
knee that had made him questionable for the game. Swann didn't
start but came off the bench to deflect a couple of passes,
including one that McKinnon intercepted, and recorded his third
sack of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So, a Truly Perplexed McKinnon had to wonder what else it takes
to get that award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work hard?'' McKinnon asked.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Cardinals undersized middle linebacker is used to
being overlooked. He went undrafted in 1996, despite leading North
Alabama to three consecutive NCAA Division II national
championships and winning the Harlon Hill Trophy _ a Division II
version of the Heisman _ as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Even after McKinnon started 11 games at outside linebacker and
five at the inside position last season, there still were questions
whether the 6-foot, 240-pounder could adequately replace Eric Hill
in the middle after Hill signed as a free agent with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   There should be little doubt now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the size and speed that maybe you're always
looking for, but he gives you everything he's got on every play.
He's a tremendous asset to this football team,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   If McKinnon needed any more motivation, he might have gotten it
Saturday when defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis brought along
another undersized linebacker he used to coach _ Hall of Famer Mike
Singletary.
</P>
<P>
   The former Chicago Bear great was on hand to watch McKinnon's
performance Sunday. &QL;

BRAVES COULD PULL IT OFF 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The following is not a prediction. Simply call it a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves are uniquely qualified to become the first
team in the history of major league baseball to win a best-of-seven
after being down, three games to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to B-S anybody,'' said Braves manager Bobby Cox
immediately after his team's 8-3 victory over the Padres Sunday
night. ``I have a lot of faith in our pitching staff. And it's
about time our bats came alive. If we had any kind of clutch hits
in the first two games, we could have won, and that includes the
game (Kevin) Brown pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   The least anyone now can say about the Braves is that they are
alive and breathing comfortably. Cox sends all-time postseason win
leader John Smoltz to the mound Monday night. He has to feel pretty
good about that, no?
</P>
<P>
   We know he's feeling a lot better about his team's offense after
watching the Braves knock out 12 hits, the most resounding of which
was the 459-foot grand slam struggling cleanup man Andres Galarraga
deposited deep into the left-center field seats off San Diego
reliever Dan Miceli to cap a six-run seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had stroked 44 home runs this regular season, but only
one of them had come after Sept. 7. As for the postseason, suffice
it to say that merely putting the ball in play has been an
achievement for the affable and dignified Venezuelan slugger.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to the plate in the seventh, his evening's work had
consisted of two bases on balls and a 6-4-3 double play. He was 1
for 11 with no runs batted in and five strikeouts. The Big Cat had
been a Big Tabby.
</P>
<P>
   But Miceli fell behind and then made the fatal mistake of
placing a fastball in the old wheelhouse. Galarraga swung the bat
and the ball took off for parts unknown. There was never any doubt
that we were looking at a grand slam. The only question was whether
or not we were looking at an unsanctioned, non-NASA satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good hitter,'' said San Diego manager Bruce Bochy of a
man who has driven in 411 runs in the last three years. ``I was
hoping he wasn't going to find his stroke right there. Miceli fell
behind, and Galarraga got a pitch he could handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox had told people before the game that he felt his biggest gun
was ready to fire. ``I just thought the odds were with us tonight
with his bat,'' Cox said with a shrug. ``It had to happen sometime.
That was a very big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Braves party was having a difficult time believing
the team's batters were as impotent as they had looked in the first
three games. They were too wise and perhaps even too gentlemanly to
say much about the San Diego starting staff, which, aside from the
frightening Brown, does not have anyone of All-Star caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking, `If we could just catch a break,''' Cox said.
``I'm not saying we were playing well enough to have three wins, or
anything, but it was time for the worm to turn a little bit with
our lumber. We haven't been hitting the daylights out of the ball,
but it helps to have one fall in that's not hit hard.''
</P>
<P>
   So guess what? Mixed in with the grand slam by Galarraga and the
leadoff homer by Javy Lopez that tied the game at 3-3 in the
seventh and the triple by Keith Lockhart and the line double by
Chipper Jones were puny infield hits by both Lockhart and Andruw
Jones. Suddenly the Atlanta box score had some meat for a change.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pitching, Denny Neagle was good enough, and the
relievers were very solid indeed. Neagle, making his initial 1998
postseason appearance, worked 5 2/3 innings and was chased
following an opposite field homer by _ who else? _ Jim Leyritz and
a double by Ruben Rivera. Dennis ``El Presidente'' Martinez retired
the one batter he faced to wind up being the pitcher of record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Neagle pitched a great game,'' maintained Cox.
``They really only hit four balls hard. The ball Leyritz hit was, I
thought, a gapper. But I noticed in batting practice that the ball
was jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres seemed to have the ol' Mo squarely on their side when
the amazing Leyritz, who had knocked in the second San Diego run
with a solid single to right back in the third, hit a 1-2 pitch
from Neagle over the right-center-field fence with one away in the
home sixth to make it 3-2. The noisy gathering of 65,042, already
convinced that their squad is some sort of Destiny's Darlings, was
in a celebratory mood.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez, no stranger to postseason heroics, jolted them back
to reality when he hit the first pitch from starter Joey Hamilton.
And from then on things got ugly, as Randy Myers, the world's most
expensive set-up man ($4 million-plus per), did everything from
throw a wild pitch, give up a go-ahead single to Ozzie Guillen, and
walk Chipper Jones to load the bases for Galarraga to clear with
one mighty swing.
</P>
<P>
   It was, frankly, a rare bullpen failure for the Padres, who are
far more than the feared Trevor Hoffman in the late innings. ``It
just didn't happen for us tonight,'' said Bochy. ``The bullpen's
done a tremendous job all year. Hey, it's gonna happen sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy remains sanguine, and you would, too. He's still got the
3-1 lead, the weight of baseball history and a fully rested Brown
ready in Game 6, if necessary. But Cox has a few things going for
him, too. No manager in a comparable position has ever had three
prime-of-life Cy Young Award winners lined up like this.
</P>
<P>
   And now the bats are stirring. You can be sure that Cox slept
better than any 1-3 manager in baseball history Sunday night.

CARDINALS NOW MUST TAKE A GIANT STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The roller coaster goes up. The roller coaster
goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Twists and turns. Staggering climbs and precipitous drops.
Thrills around every corner. And when it's over, you're right back
where you started.
</P>
<P>
   The mad dance around mediocrity continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 3-3 means nothing if we end up 3-4,'' tight end Chris
Gedney said. ``We've ``got'' to learn to take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Until they do, the Cardinals will never shed their conspicuous
past.
</P>
<P>
   When the clock put an end to one mess of a football game on
Sunday, after the hosts accepted every turnover from Team Creme
Puff and walked off with a 20-7 victory, there was a certain amount
of satisfaction in the air.
</P>
<P>
   With a win over Chicago and a win in St. Louis _ cities that
once housed the family business _ the owner probably thinks his
head coach is Lombardi, not Tobin. With a defense accumulating its
share of respect and bad nicknames, the draft-day chatter is
starting to seem prophetic. And with a win total that is one shy of
last season, it is easy to think the compass is pointed in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Parlaying eight turnovers into a 13-point victory over Da
Bares is nothing to brag about. Not when Jake Plummer is still
throwing ill-advised passes. Not when the revamped offense is still
sputtering. Not when the average scoring drive on Sunday was a
whopping 27 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave (the football) to us, we gave it to them, and they
gave it right back again,'' Gedney said. ``One of those days where
no matter what they did, Chicago wasn't going to win that game.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those days when a good team would've won by 45 points.
Instead, the Cardinals were lining up to field an onside kick in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after hearing the chatter in the Bears' locker room,
you'd have thought they lost to a Pop Warner outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Bears Coach Dave Wannstedt, not even sure of the Cardinals'
proper name: ``Phoenix is a good team. But we didn't give ourselves
a chance to play as good as we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears lineman Big Cat Williams on the Cactus Curtain: ``Yeah,
they have big names on the defensive line. But I don't feel they
were a big factor today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears center Chris Villarrial on the apparent domination of Eric
Swann: ``We were stuffing him on the line, but he was getting his
paws up in the air and batting the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears defenseman Mike Wells: ``The whole damn day was a slap in
the face to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Bears are as ignorant as they are bad. But
they're right about one thing. This was nothing to brag about.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's a steppingstone to something bigger. Unless they
take out the New York Giants on Sunday in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Now that would be progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 4-3 would be huge,'' Plummer said. ``Winning in New York
would send a message to other teams going into our bye week.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, things could be so much brighter. If Andre
Wadsworth had been in camp all summer, the Cardinals may have been
ready to win in Dallas. If they hadn't squandered a game against
the Raiders, they'd be sitting at 4-2. Nevertheless, six weeks into
the season, they're probably just where you expected them to be.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, the Cardinals have to settle in to their
destiny. They must decide who they are, what they're about, where
they're going to finish.
</P>
<P>
   They are heading to New York, ready to battle the road, the turf
and former offensive coordinator Jim Fassel. They are embarking on
one of those weeks that reveal a lot about the character of your
football team. Another chance to prove much has changed in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to be 6-0,'' Plummer said. ``We should've won last
week, but we've moved on. And being 3-3, compared to last year, I'm
very happy. But we want to get above .500.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. If they're really a team on the rise, they must get off
the roller coaster. And for once, get out ahead of the curve. &QL;

PLUMMER DUE HEFTY RAISE, IF CBS REPORT IS ACCURATE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - If  &UR; Mike Lombardi of CBS television is correct,
 &UR; Jake Plummer is on the verge of becoming a wealthy young man.
</P>
<P>
   But while it is a foregone conclusion that Plummer, the
Cardinals' second-year quarterback, is due for a huge pay bump
before long, Cardinals officials say it's not necessarily coming
this week, as Lombardi reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to know,'' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who started his 15th game Sunday, a 20-7 win over the
Chicago Bears, is making $302,100 in base salary this season, the
second year of a three-year deal that included a $700,000 signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   For most starting quarterbacks, another zero could be added to
the end of the base salary. Plummer is due to get $362,500 in base
salary next season, but the Cardinals are expected to tear up the
deal before training camp next summer.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of circumstantial evidence to point to a quick
deal. The Cardinals are roughly $3 million under the NFL salary
cap, and Plummer's agent,  &UR; Leigh Steinberg, is due in Phoenix today
for a book signing.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is imminent, according to  &UR; Bill Bidwill Jr.,
Cardinals vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS reported that? It's news to me,'' Bidwill said. &QL; 
Guaranteed success &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive lineman &UR; Eric Swann laughed at the report in
a Chicago newspaper that he had guaranteed a win. The Bears'
offensive linemen took it personally and responded with highly
indignant statements.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, playing on arthritic knees that caused him to miss
practice on Thursday and Friday, heightened their indignity by
making a sack, forcing a fumble and constantly pressuring
quarterback  &UR; Erik Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said it,'' Swann said. ``That's not my style. I think
it was just something their coaches made up to motivate their
players. I've never made any statement to the media about
guaranteeing a win or being boastful in any way.'' &QL; 
Hey, get back here! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rookie running back  &UR; Michael Pittman had only five carries in
the first five games before Plummer handed the ball to him 17 times
_ for 56 yards _ Sunday. Thirteen of those carries came in the
fourth quarter, a load that so exhausted Pittman that he tried to
take himself out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled at him as he was leaving the field to get back in the
huddle, that you don't take a break,'' Plummer said. ``But he's in
on all those special teams, and he was tired. He made big plays
today . . . and he had a great game.'' &QL; 
Lonesome ends &QL; 
 &UR; Joe Nedney's 49-yard field goal in the first quarter was the
longest of his career by two yards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mario Bates' two rushing touchdowns marked the first such
performance by a Cardinals back since  &UR; LeShon Johnson did it 34
games ago at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' eight takeaways are the most by a defense since
San Francisco took eight from New Orleans on Sept. 14, 1997. It
marked the most turnovers by a Cardinals foe since Seattle coughed
it up eight times on Oct. 29, 1995.

ALL'S WELLS FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CLEVELAND _ He's still a big man in this, his hometown, but
there's only one place where they call him the Boss.
</P>
<P>
   And now that his New York Yankees have seized the advantage in
the American League Championship Series with a 5-3 win in Game 5
Sunday, don't think for a moment that George Steinbrenner ever
fretted that the Cleveland Indians, the team in the town he left
behind, would rain on the historic parade of the team he has called
his own for the last quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked out of here with friends Friday night, I said,
`We're going to win this thing,''' Steinbrenner said in his usual
don't-even-dream-of-thinking-anything-else way. ``That's how
worried I was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 48 hours since Steinbrenner supposedly uttered his
fearless forecast, the outlook for his Yankees has taken a dramatic
bounce. Down 2 games to 1 after the Indians turned the Bombers into
the bombees with four home runs in Game 3, the Yankees responded to
their first advanced calculus test of the year by acing it. They
won Game 4 behind Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, the clever
righthander who defected from Cuba, and Game 5 behind David Wells,
the free-spirited lefthander who inhabits his own universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how many Christmas dinners he's going to be
over,'' said Steinbrenner, who reluctantly bent his martial dress
code to allow Wells to pitch with his uniform jersey flapping and
T-shirt exposed, ``but we're going to sit together for some hockey
games, like we did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even getting to like that Metallic band.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who at that moment was passing Steinbrenner in the
hallway outside the visitors' clubhouse, overheard the Yankees
owner talking about his favorite band.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Metallica,'' Wells said, emphasizing the last syllable.
``Metallica.''
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a 3-0 lead in the first inning against Chad Ogea, the
Indians' starter of last resort and even less fortune whose
deflection turned a double play ball by Paul O'Neill into a
rally-stoking single, Wells gave the Indians two right back in the
bottom of the inning. The first came on a leadoff home run by Kenny
Lofton, who later in the game would be lulled into acting like the
slugger he's not, dropping his bat at the plate on a big fly he
supposed was another home run but was just another out.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel and Travis Fryman followed Lofton's home run with
hard-hit singles, and when Vizquel stole third, he put himself in
position to score on Manny Ramirez's sacrifice fly. The Indians,
even without injured starters Sandy Alomar and David Justice, had
Wells in an unaccustomed fix.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells struck out Mark Whiten and Richie Sexson to put an end
to that uprising, and then held the Indians to just one more run,
Jim Thome's 439-foot crank into the second deck in the sixth, while
striking out a total of 11, a career high in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Thome connected, the Yankees had expanded their
lead, adding another run off the luckless Ogea in the second on
another single by O'Neill, and one more off Jaret Wright in the
fourth. That one came on a home run by Chili Davis, the DH who for
much of the Yankees' record-setting season was recuperating from a
torn tendon and ligaments in his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carried me all year, it's about time I did something,''
said Davis, the 38-year-old DH who said he was thinking of the man
who might have been playing in his place, Darryl Strawberry, before
doctors discovered he had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who struck out five of the last eight batters he faced,
was lifted by manager Joe Torre after whiffing Vizquel, the first
batter in the eighth. His departure did not come without protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have time to send everybody back,'' Wells said he
told Torre, who already had summoned reliever Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson gave Torre reason to regret his decision when he hit
Fryman with a pitch and gave up a single to Ramirez, putting the
tying runs on base.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was ripe for a massive second-guess, especially by a
certain suit. ``Was I managing?'' Steinbrenner said, deadpan.
``Yeah, I sent word down.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has been known to dial the dugout, but never, he
said, with Torre. Asked if he were managing along with his manager,
Steinbrenner shook his head. ``I don't do that anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When did he stop, the day before?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``When I got Torre.''
</P>
<P>
   His faith in his manager was rewarded when Torre went to his
closer, Mariano Rivera, and Mark Whiten, the Mexican League refugee
who had homered in Game 3, bounced into a rally-killing double
play. It was started by second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who had
just moments earlier taken a step in the right direction, courtesy
of Yankees coach Willie Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie just moved me over a little bit when Mark got ahead in
the count,'' Knoblauch said. ``From the sound of the bat, I knew
Mariano had jammed him, so I knew I had to come charging fast to
give Derek Jeter any chance to turn the double play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter did his part, and Rivera did his with a flourish, striking
out Enrique Wilson for the final out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Series shifts back to New York, the Yankees one game
away from matching the Boss's blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody expected us to roll right through everyone,'' said
O'Neill, ``but we didn't. We knew it wouldn't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wish we could fly to our ballpark and play right now.''

PATRIOTS EXCEL IN CRUNCH TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Many of the Chiefs were stunned and
speechless after sustaining a 40-10 loss to the Patriots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer, wasn't one of them,
although small talk wasn't his top priority after the game.
</P>
<P>
   He did muster this tribute to the team that had just embarrassed
his: ``In my opinion, they're the best team we've played all
season, and that includes the Minnesota Vikings, who we played in
preseason. They've got offense, they've got defense, and they've
got a kicking game that involves excellent athletes, and clearly
they had the better of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs were considered one of the AFC elite entering the
game, with a 4-1 record despite playing without quarterback Elvis
Grbac for four of those games and playing two of them in miserable
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who are now 4-1 and who stand atop the AFC East
with the New York Jets coming to town for a showdown next Monday
night, did the unthinkable to the Chiefs. They held them to 14
yards rushing while New England gained 206 yards on the ground, 104
of them on 23 carries by rookie Robert Edwards, including his fifth
rushing touchdown in his first five games, something that hadn't
been done since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger. Drew Bledsoe completed 17
of 26 pass attempts for 226 yards and three touchdowns, helping
lead the offense to 31 first downs.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, besides making the play of the game by stopping a
fourth and 1 in the first quarter, also corrected a problem from
its first four games _ allowing third-down conversions. The
Patriots entered the game allowing such conversions 45.3 percent of
the time, but Sunday the Chiefs converted only 1 of 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs' weapons were rendered ineffective. Derrick Thomas
was held to five tackles and had no sacks. The Chiefs' defense
didn't sack Bledsoe and couldn't stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   It was so one-sided that backup running back Sedrick Shaw gained
68 yards. Scott Zolak and Tom Tupa each saw time at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say we're one of the elite teams because we
haven't beaten Denver,'' said Ty Law, who held Andre Rison to one
catch for 5 yards. ``When we beat Denver, we can start talking like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point?
</P>
<P>
   Many thought it was the defense stopping the Chiefs on fourth
and 1 on their 48-yard line in the first quarter. Schottenheimer
wasn't one of them. ``It was not a game-turner,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   On third and 1, Donnell Bennett was stuffed for no gain by
Willie McGinest and Lawyer Milloy. There was little hesitation by
Schottenheimer to go for it. His team trailed, 7-0, and desperately
needed momentum. Coaches often say if you can't make less than a
yard, you're not good enough anyway. And so the handoff from Grbac
went to fullback Tony Richardson. Henry Thomas engaged the Chiefs'
line while Ted Johnson and Todd Collins came over the top and
finished the play, stopping Richardson for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't gonna be like this next week (vs. the Jets),'' said
Chris Slade, who caused a fumble after Bennett had carried for 12
yards, which was recovered by Henry Thomas, which set up the first
Patriot score, a 1-yard run by Edwards with 4:53 left in the first
quarter. ``They ain't gonna quit. That fourth-down play was a big
stop for our team. I think they quit after we stopped them.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea they would give up like that,'' said Law. ``We
really sent a message that it's difficult to come into our house
and win a game. I think they know that now.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest said he never would say the Chiefs quit. He had been
fired up on that very drive. The Chiefs had started at their 24 and
were at the 39 in the blink of an eye as McGinest was called for
being offsides. He felt the offensive lineman had flinched and that
the call should have gone the other way, and as he argued he took
off his helmet, an automatic 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty. At
the time it looked like it could have given the Chiefs some
momentum. Grbac connected on an 8-yard pass to Kimble Anders. But
the Chiefs were stuffed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that get me hyper,'' said McGinest. ``People might
say I lost my cool right there, but I was right. I made the mistake
of taking my helmet off, but after that happened I got so fired up
I wasn't going to let them get anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That stop only helped produce 3 more points for the Patriots, as
they made it 10-0 on Adam Vinatieri's 32-yard field goal, but it
gave them hope and deflated the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The defense held the Chiefs to just 1 yard on their next
offensive series, and this time the offense cashed in. After Troy
Brown's nifty 12-yard punt return to the 50, Bledsoe drove the team
home in seven plays, with Edwards ending the drive with a 15-yard
TD catch. He made a nice grab while stretched out to catch a high
ball. Bledsoe made the play by eluding Leslie O'Neal and Derrick
Thomas and stepping up into the pocket _ just like Dan Marino used
to do _ to get off his throw.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead, 17-0, early in the second quarter, the Patriots sensed
they could go for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell it was getting to them,'' said defensive
lineman Chad Eaton. ``In the first quarter their guys were standing
up and cheering for their team. By the second quarter there was
less of it, and by the third quarter everybody was on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Where was Derrick Thomas in all of this, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   He, too, disappeared. Armstrong and Moss both drew him at
various times and took him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just straight blocking,'' said coach Pete Carroll.
``Bruce had a fabulous game taking care of him and Zefross did a
great job when he had him. We did a couple of other things to take
care of him, but it was mostly man-against-man.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key play came when Patriots punter Tupa was roughed by
Ron George. The Chiefs had stopped the Patriots for the first time
midway through the second. Tupa punted 35 yards into the wind to
the Chiefs' 24, but long snapper Mike Bartrum was called for
holding. The Chiefs made the worst possible decision. They took the
penalty, forcing another punt. Instead of making a play, George hit
Tupa's left leg and he went down.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had first and 10 at the Chiefs' 46, and they
pounded the ball on the ground with Edwards again. A reverse run by
Terry Glenn resulting in an 8-yard loss was made up for moments
later when Bledsoe spotted Shawn Jefferson alone on the right side
for 31 yards to the Chiefs' 16.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Edwards ran for 6 and 8 yards before Bledsoe found
Coates all alone for a 2-yard toss and 6 more points with 2:48 left
in the second. The Patriots led, 24-0, and the rout was on.

PATRIOTS FINALLY SHOW METTLE AGAINST IRON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Kansas City Chiefs played playoff
football Sunday. Unfortunately for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, who have been knocked out of the playoffs five times
in the first round in the past eight years, entered Foxboro Stadium
armed with the top-ranked defense in the league. Three hours later,
they left with people thinking that defense was simply rank,
because on a day when the Patriots knew they had to prove something
against a future playoff rival, they did.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of losing games like this against football's
heavy iron, New England wasted no time dismembering the Chiefs'
defense, running up 27 first-half points on a team that had allowed
just 24 first-half points in its first five games. From that point
on this was no longer a football game. It was a mugging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rhythm going with the running game and the passing
game that was really nice,'' Patriots coach Pete Carroll said after
his team had finished off the Chiefs, 40-10, to improve its record
to 4-1 and its self-esteem to Norman Vincent Peale-like levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any area of the game we didn't feel good
about today. I wasn't thinking it would be a game like this. I
thought it would be a much tighter game but there was nothing
stopping us today. It was a fine day's work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a dominating day's work, the kind veteran safety
Willie Clay talked quietly about his club badly needing several
days earlier. As Clay spoke last Wednesday of what the Patriots
were about to face, he thought back to the kind of beatings the
Broncos and Packers had administered not only to New England but to
other teams who thought they could compete with them the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   In such games, the top teams make statements about themselves,
Clay said, and when possible they make loud ones. If that's the
case, the Patriots were a shoulder-padded version of Metallica
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of the second half, New England led, 27-0, had
piled up nearly 150 yards more than the Chiefs' offense, and had
not allowed Kansas City to convert a third-down situation. But that
was only the beginning, although what came next was the end for
Kansas City on this day.
</P>
<P>
   New England took the second-half kickoff and marched 81 yards in
eight plays. Through a long day, the Chiefs would six times allow
New England to gain first downs by penalties, but on this drive,
they were relatively uncooperative in that manner.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, the Patriots had them by the throat and did what
the best of teams do in such a circumstance. They made the Chiefs
pay again, driving them into the ground with Robert Edwards rushing
for 38 of his 104 yards on this drive and tight end Ben Coates
finishing it off by breaking open in the end zone for an 11-yard
touchdown catch that pushed the margin to 34-0 just 4:12 into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered not a whit after that what the Chiefs were up to
because the issue was decided and Kansas City had learned a hard
lesson. It learned what happens to a team that comes to New England
these days not ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   After that score the game became a simple matter of collecting
numbers, and the Patriots collected some big ones and one little
one. Edwards rushed for 100 yards for the first time in his career
while also becoming the first rookie since the NFL-AFL merger to
score a touchdown in each of his first five games. Terry Glenn
finished with seven receptions for 78 yards and once again could
have had more had a couple of throws been on target. Drew Bledsoe
threw for three touchdowns, including two to Coates in a reminder
of the old days. But as important as all those numbers were, the
smallest ones, like the 14 yards the defense allowed the Chiefs'
running game, said the most.
</P>
<P>
   Those 14 yards rushing were the second lowest allowed in Patriot
history and led to a remarkable total yardage disparity of 304
yards (438 vs. 134) and an equally mind-boggling difference in time
of possession. The Patriots controlled the ball for nearly three
quarters of the game (41:48 to 18:12), dominating with Edwards's
power runs and Bledsoe's deft passing until the Chiefs finally did
what no one thought they'd do.
</P>
<P>
   They spit the bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``By halftime they just quit,'' Patriots linebacker Chris Slade
said. ``When we stopped them on fourth down (after Henry Thomas
stuffed up the middle and linebackers Todd Collins and Ted Johnson
slammed down Tony Richardson for no gain on a fourth and 1) it
seemed to stun them.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so, because New England not only scored on that drive
to make it 10-0 but went on to score the next five times it had the
ball. By the time they finally slowed down, the Patriots had made a
statement, all right.
</P>
<P>
   What that statement means in the long run is difficult to assess
24 hours after the fact, but if nothing else it surely accomplished
one thing. It will give old friend Bill Parcells heartburn all week
as he tries to prepare his New York Jets for a Monday night
confrontation here in another game where Willie Clay and his
teammates will try to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A statement just like Sunday's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion they're the best team we've played and that
includes the Minnesota Vikings,'' Chiefs' coach Marty
Schottenheimer said. ``They've got offense, they've got defense.
Clearly they had the better of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on a gray, rainy day that was loud and clear to everyone at
Foxboro Stadium. Especially the Chiefs.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ The first question to Bobby Cox before Game 4 of the
National League Championship Series concerned a cat named Andres.
The Braves' manager was asked why Atlanta's cleanup hitter, Andres
Galarraga, seemed to be clean out of hits and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Cat, 1-for-11 with five strikeouts and performing more
like a fat cat, hadn't issued a loud hiss in this series, which the
Padres were trying to end shockingly in the minimum four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just missing some pitches,'' Cox said. ``Hitting some
high pop-ups, things like that. We feel he's getting close. As you
know, a guy like him can carry you in a series like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox shrugged. ``Maybe today,'' he said, ``Andres can unleash
some of his power.''
</P>
<P>
   But after three plate appearances Sunday, Galarraga had
unleashed nothing, walking twice and grounding weakly into a double
play to stifle a potential breakout inning that had begun with
Keith Lockhart's leadoff triple and Chipper Jones' ensuing RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   When Galarraga arrived in the batter's box with the bases loaded
in the seventh inning, he was the only Braves starter other than
the pitcher, Denny Neagle, who didn't have a hit. Although
Atlanta's brink-of-disaster lumber slumber was showing signs of
being over _ Javy Lopez's home run and Ozzie Guillen's RBI single
had just put the Braves up 4-3 _ Galarraga was still snoozing.
</P>
<P>
   A catnap? He must have lulled Dan Miceli to sleep, too. If prior
results matter, and baseball people surely act as though they do,
the Padres had to love the matchup. Galarraga was 1-for-7 with five
strikeouts against Miceli, explaining why Miceli had been hustled
out to the mound at such a crucial juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the percentages, they call it. But the past should never
be used as a fail-safe guide for predicting the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought the odds were with us tonight with
(Galarraga's) bat,'' Cox said, reflecting on his now-prophetic
pre-game comments. ``It had to happen sometime and, boy, it was a
big one tonight. Just a big, big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Miceli's second pitch to Galarraga, a 92-mph fastball over the
middle of the plate, was ripped so hard and so far, neither San
Diego outfielder in the vicinity of where it rocketed out of the
park, on a line above the fence in left-center, bothered to move
more than a couple of steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit a ball he could handle,'' said Padres manager Bruce
Bochy. ``Miceli didn't have anyplace to put him after he'd fallen
behind. We were in a jam there. That's going to happen sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dingers ring louder than others. This one was deafening,
and it hushed rowdy Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Thank you, God,' for this one,''' Galarraga
admitted. ``That is probably the best pitch I've seen in the whole
series.''
</P>
<P>
   The locals, 65,042 strong, had come to celebrate San Diego's
second-ever National League pennant, this one to be secured not at
the expense of the hapless, lovable Cubs, as was the case in 1984,
but over the team everyone else in the league loves to hate. The
Braves inspire jealousy because they spend and win at will,
explaining why they have become permanent participants in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in a row. But Atlanta, batting .200 against the Padres
through three losses, was in danger of going down swinging _ and,
mostly, missing. Would you believe 34 K's after 30 innings? And the
Braves' offense had produced just three runs behind John Smoltz,
Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and, after three innings, Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   So Galarraga, who has accumulated more than 500 RBIs over the
past four regular seasons, exceeded said total with one mighty
swing. It was the sixth grand slam in NLCS history, and only time
will tell whether it's too little too late for Atlanta, which had
brought him down from Colorado for moments such as these.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has recovered from a 3-0 deficit in a baseball playoff
series. The Padres remain cocky enough occupying the catbird seat
that Bochy won't do what he did against the Astros _ that is, send
Kevin Brown out on three days' rest tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy is finished gambling. He'll stick with his rotation this
time, pitching Andy Ashby against Smoltz in a repeat of the Game 1
pairing the Padres took, after a two-hour rain delay, in 10 innings
3-2. Brown, San Diego's brightest postseason star, will be saved
for a possible Game 6 matchup Wednesday in Atlanta against Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Andy's turn,'' Bochy said. ``He's a big reason why we're
in this situation. And he's pitching on his normal days' rest.
That's why he'll be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Smoltz think of the 8-3 win?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still playing,'' he said. ``That's what we have to focus
on, nothing else. Of all the teams that have been down 3-0, I like
our chances the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-1 isn't a fun place to be, but compared to what could
have been their alternative, it's well, it's the Cat's meow.

REEVES, THE INSIDER, LOVES EVERY MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Atlanta's Dan Reeves, the former New
York Giants coach, to show just how well he still knows his old
team. In the first quarter, Falcons wide receiver Tony Martin took
a slow seven steps or so off the line of scrimmage, then bolted in
the direction of safety Tito Wooten. The reason for Martin's delay
was obvious: Reeves, who drafted Wooten, knows Wooten's biggest
liability is that his attention span is about as long as the life
of a fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Wooten looked off Martin, thinking the receiver was
running a short route. Then Martin broke into a gallop, running
right by Wooten, who was caught completely by surprise. Martin had
five steps on Wooten when the ball was in the air for a 36-yard
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves 34, Giants 20. Somewhere, Dave Brown is throwing his
Reeves voodoo doll against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   This game was the worst nightmare for Giants coaches and
players. In addition to losing to Reeves (they would rather have 17
hours of gum surgery than lose to him), the Giants found that he
was like a Wall Street inside trader. He knows the Giants better
than they know themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Danny Kanell sometimes isn't careful with the ball
when sidestepping a pass rusher, so the Falcons were coached to
swipe at it whenever they got the chance. It paid off. Falcons
defensive end Antonio Edwards, who played three games with the
Giants last season, knocked the ball out of Kanell's hands, caught
it in midair, and scampered into the end zone for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, particularly the Giants' ownership, this is the
worst way to lose. They are beat by their former coach, who on his
way out the door bashed the way the team did things. After leaving
New York, Reeves always felt that if he got the chance to run an
organization again, the way he did in Denver when the Broncos went
to three Super Bowls, he could produce a winner. Now, beating his
former team, Reeves and his supporters will be saying, ``I told you
I could coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing this game puts the Giants at 2-4, and with key division
rivals Arizona and Dallas both winning, New York is in peril of not
getting into the playoffs. If at the end of the season the Giants
don't make the playoffs because of one loss, Sunday night's game
may be the one that kept them out. Did Reeves drive a stake through
the heart of his old team?
</P>
<P>
   But before fans flood the Giants with telegrams asking why they
ever let Reeves go, just remember that it was not a true fit. It
could never have been, because Reeves wants to run a team by
himself. He wants total control, which he has with Atlanta and
could never have had with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   What led to the divorce following the 1996 season was a series
of disagreements between Reeves and the front office. Reeves said
that he rarely got what he wanted and that the Giants were
inflexible. The Giants said Reeves got 90 percent of what he wanted
and have pointed to a number of examples as proof.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves brought to the Giants his first-round bust from the
Broncos, linebacker Mike Croel, management didn't believe in the
player's talent but let Reeves have him anyway. Reeves also signed
quarterback Tommy Maddox, another of his first-round underachievers
from Denver, against management's better judgment. The Giants'
multimillion-dollar indoor practice facility is nicknamed the ``Dan
Dome'' because he wanted it and got it.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' leaving was the best thing for all involved because
toward the end of his tenure, the situation deteriorated. After the
1995 draft, Reeves was angry when it was leaked to the news media
that he favored running back Rashaan Salaam over Tyrone Wheatley.
But it was Reeves who told reporters that the Giants' draft room
was ``the most argumentative place I have ever been.'' The Giants
say he blamed them for something he did.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all that matters is that the Giants are in trouble and the
Falcons look like a playoff team. Chris Chandler picked them apart.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves was in New York, his offenses were predictable and
unimaginative. Now, Atlanta is an offensive powerhouse. The most
embarrassing moment for the Giants had to be when Steve DeBerg, a
former assistant coach with the Giants, got into the game. He is 44
and was playing when Ronald Reagan was president.
</P>
<P>
   The victory will probably energize Reeves like no victory has in
years. Though he would never admit it, this in a way was his Super
Bowl. The Giants still run their team the right way, using a
two-tiered system instead of the one-man czar, but for now, Reeves
gets the last laugh. And make no question about it _ for the next
several days he will be the happiest man alive. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ ``Sweep, sweep, sweep.'' The chant was almost
deafening, and that was before the first pitch had been thrown.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some two hours later Sunday, you could have made a case that the
Q in Qualcomm Stadium stood for quiet. That was around the time the
Atlanta Braves silenced the crowd by scoring six runs in the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   It served as the catalyst for the Braves' 8-3 victory over the
San Diego Padres and helped them avoid being swept in the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Open mouth, insert broom; there would be no sweep party on this
night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Braves brushed up on the subject of winning,
something it appeared they had forgotten how to do until the
must-win wake-up call of Game 4. The Braves turned a one-run
deficit into a five-run lead with the explosive seventh-inning
rally keyed by Andres Galarraga's grand slam off Padres reliever
Dan Miceli. It was only the sixth bases-loaded homer in the history
of the NLCS and the first since Gary Gaetti hit one for St. Louis
against the Braves in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I hit it, I said, `Thank you, God,''' Galarraga
said. ``It was a fastball right down the middle of the plate.
That's probably the best pitch I'll see in this series. That's the
biggest home run I've ever hit. I kept us alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres will get a second chance to finish off the Braves
tonight when they send Andy Ashby to the mound against John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going to be do-or-die for us,'' Braves left fielder
Ryan Klesko said. ``But with the type of pitching we have, you
can't count us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's starting pitchers _ Atlanta's Denny Neagle and San
Diego's Joey Hamilton _ basically battled to a stalemate, but the
game turned on the ineffectiveness of the Padres' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Randy Myers and Miceli allowed three hits and four
runs in the decisive seventh inning. The Braves had scored one run
off the Padres' relievers in their first seven innings of NLCS
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen had been doing a great job, but it just didn't
happen for us tonight,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``They
couldn't quite get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Padres did their job, knocking out Neagle in
the sixth inning. Hamilton was soon to follow. From that point, it
became a battle of the bullpens _ a showdown the Braves won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Martinez, John Rocker, Odalis Perez, Rudy Seanez and
Kerry Ligtenberg shut out the Padres over the final 3 innings. The
Padres managed three baserunners after Neagle left the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves welcomed the return of their offense, which managed
to score more than two runs for the first time in the series. Not
surprisingly, the middle of the Braves' batting order _ dormant for
most of the series _ played a large role in the offensive
awakening. Chipper Jones, Galarraga and Klesko combined for four
hits, three runs and six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone came through,'' Klesko said. ``We hope this gets us
going again. It's key for us to drive in some runs, because more
times than not, our pitching is going to give us a very good chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' chances of winning the game and wrapping up the
series looked pretty good in the third inning when second baseman
Quilvio Veras walked and scored on Tony Gwynn's double into the
right-field gap. Jim Leyritz singled home Gwynn to give the Padres
a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton promptly gave back one of the runs in the fourth
inning, when Braves second baseman Keith Lockhart crushed the first
pitch of the inning over Steve Finley's head in center field for a
triple. Jones brought Lockhart home with a single to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tied the score in the sixth inning with some clutch
two-out hitting by Jones and Klesko. Jones ripped a double down the
right-field line and scored on Klesko's base hit to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds were definitely in favor of those guys getting some
hits to fall sooner or later,'' Hamilton said of the Braves' Big
Three, who are hitting just .184 in the NLCS. ``They're all good
hitters, and good hitters are going to get their fair share of
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz energized the crowd of 65,042 in the sixth when he hit a
line-drive home run over the wall in right field to put the Padres
up by a run. It was Leyritz's fourth home run this postseason and
the seventh playoff homer of his career. The crowd didn't settle
down until Leyritz took a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``That felt nice,'' he said. ``At that point, I thought we had
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton mishandled prosperity again, this time serving up a
game-tying, first-pitch homer to Javy Lopez to open the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a bad pitch,'' Hamilton said. ``It was so bad, I
don't even see how Javy hit it. That pitch almost hit him in the
neck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves then went for the jugular. Ozzie Guillen put them on
top later in the seventh with an RBI single off Myers, and
Galarraga's grand slam put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time the bats came around,'' Cox said. ``It was
time for the worm to turn a little bit with our lumber.''

WELLS PROVED A REAL CHARACTER WIN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ He looks like a sack of inner tubes under a Yankee
baseball cap. He gets away with facial hair when none of his
teammates are allowed a whisker. He's the only Yankee who told the
Boss to put up his dukes when the two exchanged insults in the
clubhouse last year. When ubiquitous locker room suckup Kevin
Costner offered congratulations, David Wells said, ``Hey, Dude. You
want a jockstrap or something?''
</P>
<P>
   And on this World Series-bound team of past, present, and future
stars _ a team that has now won a major league record 120 regular
and postseason games _ David Wells is The Man. Sunday, he beat the
Indians, 5-3, in the fifth game of the ALCS, and dedicated the
victory to the fans who hazed him about his late mother while he
was warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those idiots out there _ this one's for you,'' Wells said
after the game. ``When you get a bunch of clowns out there who
start talking about your mother, not knowing that my mom passed
away a year and a half ago ... There were some low lifes out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of got me out of focus and it took me a while. I was
fighting myself. I played against the Yankees for a long time, and
I never heard anybody get personal with my family members at Yankee
Stadium. And this is not the first time it's happened in Cleveland
with me. I don't understand it and I don't appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells got off to a shaky start. After getting staked to a 3-0
first-inning lead (it took Cleveland starter Chad Ogea almost a
half hour to get three outs), he almost gave it all back in the
bottom of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton led with a homer just inside the foul pole, then
Omar Vizquel and Travis Fryman singled and Wells had to face the
heart of the Cleveland order. He compounded the pressure by
uncorking a wild pitch, but got out of the inning, still leading,
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little uncomfortable when he got behind on the
hitters,'' said Yankee manager Joe Torre. ``Normally when we get
him runs he shuts them down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to wake up,'' admitted Wells. ``Obviously. I had to move
the ball around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' star southpaw struck out at least one batter in
every one of his innings except the fourth. He was The Show _ even
on a ball he never touched. Early in the game, Wells charged toward
the Yankee dugout after a pop fly and almost tumbled down the steps
as the ball bounded out of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was goofy all night,'' Torre said. ``He's just one of many
colorful players who play the game. He's a loose horse, no question
about it. He enjoys the game and it's catching.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some laughter on the mound when Torre came out to lift
him in favor of Jeff Nelson in the eighth. Wells had just fanned
Vizquel, giving him five punchouts of the previous eight batters.
Like a band refusing to leave the stage, Wells initially would not
give Torre the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a second wind,'' said Wells. ``I felt like I did in the
second or third inning. I just wouldn't give him the ball. He tried
to pry it out of my hand. That's how good I felt. I wanted to stay
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine refusing to yield the baseball. Wells never wants to
come out. He never wants to rest. He said he'll pitch Game 7 of
this series on two days rest if they need him. He wanted to pitch
Game 4 when the Yankees trailed, 2 games to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said, ``He had some left. He wanted me to send Nellie
back. I told him to just go and get the round of applause.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland fans showered him with mock cheers as Wells walked to
the dugout. He waved his cap at them in mock appreciation. It was
good theater.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's move almost backfired when Nelson put two runners on
base, but Mariano Rivera made an early entrance and got a double
play grounder from perennial bowser, Mark Whiten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real testimony to his ability that Wells was able to
pitch that deep into the game,'' said Cleveland manager Mike
Hargrove. ``It didn't look like he had command of his pitches like
he did in the past, but he pitched well enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells went 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA this year. He pitched a perfect
game, appeared on Letterman, and started the All-Star Game. On a
team with David Cone and Andy Pettitte, there was never any doubt
who the No. 1 starter was. Wells is now 3-0 with a 2.90 ERA in the
1998 postseason and he'll be ready to start the first game of the
World Series in New York Saturday night. Or Wednesday in Game 7.
His lifetime postseason record is 7-1 with a 2.41 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably prouder of this effort tonight than the shutouts
and the perfect game because of what it meant to us,'' said Torre.
``He had so much fun with it tonight. He's an animal. He goes after
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland fans should have learned a lesson from Fenway nuts. In
1990, Boston fans taunted Oakland's proud righty, Dave Stewart,
calling him ``Lucille'' while he warmed up in the bullpen. Stewart
took the mound and beat the Red Sox, 9-1, en route to another
Oakland sweep of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys cave in when they're mocked. Guys like Stewart and
Wells just come back and beat you in your own house.

UNIMPRESSIVE OPENING ACT FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ He had had a night to sleep on it and rehash
it over and over.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the final analysis, Bruins coach Pat Burns, though
pleased his team escaped with a point in the 3-3 tie with St. Louis
in the season opener, wasn't all that excited about the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) night we didn't play well,'' said Burns, after
leading the Bruins through a spirited, and often times physical,
90-minute practice Sunday at Ristuccia Arena. ``Everybody in the
dressing room knew it. We went out there, we hadn't played in over
a week, it was opening game, the big celebration. Those things all
came into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't excuses, these are the facts. The players knew
after the game that they didn't play that well. We gave them the
puck a lot. We did things that the Boston Bruins last year never
did. That's why we have training camp. This is all starting over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Burns did like was the goaltending of Byron Dafoe, who
turned back 29 of 32 shots, and who couldn't be blamed for two of
St. Louis's three goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron Dafoe kept us in the game the whole time,'' said Burns,
who watched the Bruins twice overcome two-goal deficits. ``We were
making some awful mistakes out there. I think the puck weighed
about 20 pounds there for awhile. We were getting a lot of passes
intercepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he'll come right back with Dafoe in Monday's holiday
matinee against the Islanders at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, facing a seven-game road trip after Monday's game, was
asked how important it was to crack the win column before heading
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game's important, every one of them,'' he said. ``If we
lose the game, we don't say `Oh, no, we lost the game and now we
have to go on the road and it's going to be disastrous.' Everybody
asks `Is this the most important one, is that the most important
one?' Every game's important, including (Monday's).
</P>
<P>
   ``But like I say, there's going to be highs, there's going to be
lows and we know that. But you can't tell the players, `If we lose
this game, boys, we're done on the road trip.' You might as well go
to Hawaii and send the points in to the other team if you're
thinking that way. We're going out to try and win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob DiMaio thinks a win against the Islanders would be the
perfect going-away gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean a lot to us confidence-wise before going on such
a long road trip,'' said the Bruins winger. ``It would be nice to
know we play well at home. These points that we get here are
invaluable because you never know what will happen on a long road
trip. Oh, yeah, they're very important to team confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be a good home team and if you can have momentum
going on a road trip like this, it can do nothing but benefit you.
We're looking to have a good solid game and take that with us on
the road.''
</P>
<P>

   Dmitri Khristich, slowed the past two weeks with a shoulder
sprain, skated full tilt Sunday and Burns said he'll play Monday.
Burns also said Chris Taylor, who sat out the opener, will suit up.
Peter Nordstrom, Peter Ferraro, and Antti Laaksonen are among the
candidates to be scratched. Burns said rookie defenseman and top
pick Jonathan Girard also will sit this one out ... Defenseman
Dennis Vaske was the only player to miss the practice. He is out
indefinitely with back muscle spasms ... The Bruins have redesigned
their web page (www.bostonbruins.com) in conjunction with their
75th anniversary season. There's a team history page as well as
player bios and updated statistics ... The Islanders fell to the
Penguins, 4-3, in their opener. New York fell behind, 4-0, in the
first period before scrambling back.

L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY USE BOOK AID FOR RAISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY AND TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles school board members are likely this
week to reopen negotiations with teachers -- and top administrators
and other staff -- for new pay raises using a $60 million state
funding windfall intended for textbooks and improved educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Three board members said in interviews they are willing to
consider a 2 percent districtwide hike and sources said there is no
serious opposition from the other board members.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on top of a contract for a 10 percent pay raise over
three years signed just last year, the new raises are certain to
spark controversy for a district already facing a potential breakup
movement and Mayor Richard Riordan's well-funded effort to seize
control of the board in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles teachers -- who in a recent year beat the county,
state and national average for teachers with pay of $44,474 for
about nine months of work -- are spearheading the effort to reopen
negotiations. But board sources said any raise also would be
granted to administrators and other employees.
</P>
<P>
   The board is expected to discuss the issue Tuesday behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers union and some board members said the Los Angeles
Unified School District should boost salaries to remain competitive
with other districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a teacher shortage,'' said school board member Valerie
Fields, whose district includes the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be competitive,'' said Fields, who was a primary
grade teacher for 12 years. ``We want to get teachers with
credentials. We don't want to rely on people with emergency
credentials. We need to do what we can to attract and retain
qualified teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, the most recent year for which national comparative
figures are available, the LAUSD teacher's average of $44,474
compared with averages of $42,992 statewide and $38,436 nationwide.
Los Angeles ranked ahead of San Diego and San Francisco in starting
salaries but lagged behind in pay for teachers with advanced
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal on the table would extend pay raises not only to
teachers but to all other employees and even could be the basis of
raising salaries for the superintendent and other top managers.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Julie Korenstein and David Tokofsky said they
would vote to reopen contract discussions if accountability
measures are part of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy was foundering, the teachers saved the school
district by taking pay cuts,'' Tokofsky said. ``Now, when the
economy is booming, it seems only fair that they should benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   School board member Jeff Horton declined comment on the issue
because it involved labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Barbara Boudreaux said she would consider granting
pay increases to all school employee groups and restoring
eliminated jobs, such as those of gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to reopen negotiations if accountability is part
of the pay raises,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not morally correct or politically correct to ask for pay
raises if you are not performing for that raise,'' Boudreaux said,
adding that she is not satisfied with the steps the United Teachers
Los Angeles union has taken thus far to hold members accountable
for student performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``UTLA has been dragging its feet, and that troubles me,'' she
said.

CHIEFS TAKE OFF WEEK A LITTLE EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The National Football League had the Kansas
City Chiefs scheduled for an off day next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Patriots, they decided to take it a week
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the worst game we've played since I've been
here,'' said general manager Carl Peterson. Coach Marty
Schottenheimer wasn't quite sure if he agreed. ``It could have
been,'' he said, ``but there might have been ones just as bad that
fell through the cracks and you don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played bad, and that is disturbing. I had no idea this
would happen. I didn't think we could make the kind of mental
mistakes we made today. We made enough mistakes in this game to
last us a whole season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have the bye week to deal with these problems. The
solutions are right there in the locker room, and we are going to
deal with those next week. We have the players to play a lot better
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs failed in every phase of the game: offense, defense,
special teams, and, most of all, mentally. They did some things
that were just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, one talk show analyst said this was a game that
would show if the Patriots could reach the next level.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the question was: Could the Chiefs get back to
the level they have played at in recent years?
</P>
<P>
   These are not the Chiefs of even a year ago. They are not as
formidable along the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, the Chiefs were the No. 1 defensive team in
the league, giving up 240 yards per game. Sunday they gave up 438,
nearly double what they had allowed in each of their first five
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got us down, 17-0, they could do just about anything
they wanted to do,'' said the Chiefs' Derrick Thomas, who was
handled by Bruce Armstrong of the Patriots. ``We never got them in
(long-yardage) positions where we wanted them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs had been giving up just 127 passing yards per game.
Bledsoe had 174 at the half behind great protection from his
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The calling card of the Chiefs' defense is its speed, and it has
a great reputation for pressuring the passer.
</P>
<P>
   But Foxboro Stadium is not Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City,
where the Chiefs are nearly invincible with their noisy home crowd
impacting the offense of the visiting team.
</P>
<P>
   In this one, the opposite happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crowd really got into the game when they jumped on us
like that,'' said Chiefs center Tim Grunhard. ``When a team jumps
in front like that, the defensive coordinators get very creative.
They give you things you've never seen before. And that is tough to
deal with. We just couldn't run the ball, and that made it tough.
But we will be better. We have to believe we are better than this.
New England is very good. Edwards seemed to give them real energy,
the way he was running with the ball and made extra yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the numbers, these tell the story of the game: The
Patriots rushed for 206 yards, the Chiefs 14. And the Patriots
controlled the ball for 41:48, leaving the Chiefs 18:12.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, the Patriots were 29th, or second worst, in
the league in time of possession, averaging 26 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was easy for them,'' said Schottenheimer. ``They
played excellent. You cannot give a quarterback of that caliber the
time he had to throw the ball today. He never had to feel hurried.
He could feel very comfortable and say to himself, `today is going
to be one of those days.' He made some outstanding plays, and some
throws that only a few quarterbacks in this league can make.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our side, the frustration is the dumb things we did.
Roughing the kicker when we had great field position. Getting a
penalty on a field goal that gives them a first down and sets them
up for a touchdown. We don't usually play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things killed us on offense,'' said Chiefs
quarterback Elvis Grbac. ``Offsides, going in motion. There is no
reason for that. These are things that we have to correct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their day,'' said Schottenheimer. ``Take nothing away
from them. They were excellent.''

LOS ANGELES: that troubles me,'' she said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When teachers were given a 6 percent pay raise last year, with
the promise of a total of 10 percent over three years, UTLA pledged
it would implement an accountability clause in the contract. That
has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   The union plans to stage a rally at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday outside
district headquarters at 450 N. Grand Ave. to push for reopening
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve a raise,'' said Janett Humphries, president of
Local 99 of the Service Employees International Union, which
represents 32,000 classified employees, including bus drivers,
cafeteria workers and teaching assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood by the LAUSD when times were tough, and we took a 10
percent pay cut,'' Humphries said. ``We believe the budget contains
enough for increased compensation and expanded programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and other employees believe they should share in the
district's windfall of state funding the superintendent intended to
use to help ease a textbook shortage and improve the quality of
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Superintendent Ruben Zacarias has raised concerns that
important programs might have to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is in the position of looking at increased employee
compensation against programmatic enhancements,'' said district
spokesman Brad Sales. ``You take $54 million for pay raises at 2
percent and you have a dollop left over.''
</P>
<P>
   Raises might cut into Zacarias' list of $54 million in
school-related priorities, including library books, staff
development and expansion of tutoring and summer-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales has said there is about $60 million in unrestricted money
-- not enough for a 4 percent pay raise and educational programs.
It would cost the district about $100 million to grant 4 percent
raises.
</P>
<P>
   During a rally last week at district headquarters, UTLA
President Day Higuchi said the district has received a 10 percent
increase in state funding that would provide enough for books,
programs and better pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers recognize the need for books, classroom materials and
smaller classrooms,'' Higuchi said. ``We haven't asked for the bulk
of the money. It's either restricted or comes with strings. We're
making a reasonable guess about what is otherwise available without
touching those programs. We're asking for the right to negotiate
for that money.''
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi said the district needs to increase pay to attract
teachers who now opt for better working conditions in smaller
suburban school districts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Higuchi, about 25 percent of the 3,000 teachers
hired this year were fully credentialed. About 20 percent of the
school district's estimated 40,000 teachers are uncredentialed,
district officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The average LAUSD teacher salary has risen to $45,500 for the
1998-99 school year, ranging from a low of $31,926 with an
emergency teaching credential to a high of $60,466 after 30 years
experience with a master's degree and doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, the average annual salary for teachers in
the 46 unified school districts was $43,834 in 1995-96, the latest
year for which data was available.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with intense pressure from various unions, school board
members, who receive a majority of their campaign funds from those
groups, are falling into place in support of additional pay raises,
sources said.

GREAT SCHEME GIVES BLEDSOE MORE CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The only question left after the Patriots
offense shredded what is universally regarded as one of the NFL's
better defenses may be this: What does Larry Kennan think now of
the emerging juggernaut in New England?
</P>
<P>
   Week by week the New England offense is emerging from the
darkness and murk of last season and improving game by game, so
much so that, as receiver Terry Glenn put it, ``Guys are really
starting to jell. We've got a lot of confidence in each other
now.'' Glenn said he wasn't surprised the Patriots scored 40 points
Sunday, saying the Chiefs ``kind of gave up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of what is becoming a fine mix of running and
passing is the quarterback, Drew Bledsoe. And, as Glenn pointed
out, Bledsoe and the offense should be getting better as the season
wears on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only my third year here and we're into our third
different offense,'' said Glenn, who had seven catches for 78
yards. ``And it was a little difficult to learn at first. And right
now we're starting to learn it and Drew is starting to feel
comfortable with it. And I think that's the big key _ Drew feeling
comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable?
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Patriot fans Sunday saw Bledsoe do something
that no one ever imagined he could or would do _ run a naked
bootleg that left jaws gaping all across New England and resulted
in a 23-yard pass to a wide-open Glenn. Not to mention Bledsoe's
ducking under Kansas City's Derrick Thomas, scooting away from the
Chiefs' rush, and hitting Robert Edwards with a nifty 15-yard TD
pass in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just kind of an impromptu kind of play,'' said
Bledsoe, who has been adding improvisational quarterbacking to his
usual repertoire of crisp passes from the pocket to Glenn, Ben
Coates, Shawn Jefferson, and friends. The TD pass to Edwards ``was
designed to go to Terry to the right _ I had three receivers to the
right _ but the Chiefs did a nice job of covering it. I felt some
pressure from the backside, but I think Bruce Armstrong did a nice
job of running their guy by me and then I saw Robert ... and I
chucked it out there ... and he made a great catch for the
touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   And the play from the ozone, the naked bootleg? The play that
even his teammates knew nothing about?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the option is going in next week,'' first joked
Bledsoe. ``But naaah ... it's something we've talked about at
different times during the season. My intention was to try and run
for the first down, but when the guy came off (Glenn), I threw it
to Terry. Nobody else knew about it, so I figured it was probably
going to be called back because there was going to be a penalty for
linemen downfield. But it so happened that nobody was downfield,
and it ended up being a great play.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is all coming together for the offense, coordinator Ernie
Zampese's system doing so much more than Kennan's offense did last
year, Bledsoe quarterbacking better than ever, Edwards running the
ball very well, and the receivers intense and involved, all of
which gives opposing defenses much to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take our receivers against anyone,'' said Bledsoe. ``I
told Terry Glenn before the game, `Listen, you're going to have
(cornerback) Dale Carter on you, but I'm coming at you anyway
because I think you can get open on him.' And Terry did a nice job
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be the final factor in the offense renaissance,
Glenn's returning to past form. Man-to-man against Carter, one of
the better corners in the league, was a challenge that Glenn said
he welcomed. Time after time, Glenn escaped Carter's jamming at the
line of scrimmage and beat the corner, before Carter hurt his knee
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carter may be the best corner in the league,'' said Glenn.
``He plays the position almost as if he's the wide receiver. At
first, he was playing the position the way he always plays it, but
then we started beating him with some short outside stuff, and then
he changed his bump-and-run stuff and came up even more. And then
Drew was able to go at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly with short slants, ``and we were able to attack him
the way Carter was doing his defense,'' said Glenn. ``I started
releasing to the inside and Drew hit me on a couple of slants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We played as good as we can play against a good team,'' said
Bledsoe. But the Patriots, Bledsoe went on, ``weren't trying to
fool them except for a few plans to contain Derrick Thomas. We
didn't really do anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be the most pleasant prospect of all for New England
fans, that Sunday's 40 points against a good defense may be more
routine than extraordinary. As was supposed to happen _ but didn't
_ last season.

EDWARDS SCRAMBLES TO MAKE TD CATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ On the play that coach Pete Carroll called
``the big play of the day,'' Robert Edwards was doing his duty,
protecting Drew Bledsoe from Derrick Thomas and onrushing pals,
when the scheme broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play wasn't designed to go to me,'' said Edwards, the
Patriots' rookie running back. ``I was supposed to be blocking the
back side and I looked back and saw that Drew was scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, football instinct must come to the fore to save a busted
play. Some players have that instinct, many don't, just as some
teams have it collectively and some don't. But on that first-down
play from the Chiefs' 15-yard line early in the second quarter,
Edwards showed he is more than a promising running back. Much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always taught in camp and at the beginning of the
season,'' said Edwards, explaining why he departed from his
blocking duty, ``that whenever Drew scrambles, we should try and
get open, so Drew won't get hit. So I scrambled and Drew just laid
the ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have been enough in assessing the full Edwards package
that the back found an opening in the Chiefs' secondary, giving
Bledsoe an inviting target, but when Bledsoe threw the pass, it was
a bit too long, forcing Edwards to leap through the air headlong.
But the rookie not only caught up to the pass, he had the soft
hands to caress the ball before landing in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for it,'' said Edwards of his catch, which would have
been remarkable even for a wide receiver, and then modestly added,
``It was a good throw.'' Said Carroll of the TD grab: ``That was an
incredible catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards Sunday gained 104 yards on 23 attempts in little more
than a half of football, his first 100-yard game in the NFL.
Edwards Sunday scored two TDs, the fifth consecutive game he has
scored, the first time since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger a rookie had
scored a TD in his first five pro games. Edwards showed he is more
than a football player with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that you have to like about him,'' said Carroll, ``is
his ability to break a tackle. This really is the first time that
(opposing) guys couldn't get him down. He came around the corner a
couple of times and there was one guy, two guys, three guys he just
kept shaking off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most New England football fans know that Edwards, in effect, was
traded for Curtis Martin. The Patriots used the draft choice the
Jets gave up for signing Martin to select Edwards as their first
pick. So far, so very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my first couple of games, I was thinking a lot,'' said
Edwards. ``I was trying not to make mistakes, but now I'm getting
more comfortable and I'm starting to relax and just go out there
and play just like I did at Georgia. I'm not second-guessing myself
now on a lot of things I do; I'm just making a decision and going
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert is not the fastest guy and he's not the toughest guy in
terms of running people over,'' said teammate Terry Glenn, ``but
he's got all of it mixed in together. Now when we look for guys to
step up and make big plays, that's what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, for one, said Edwards's impressive entry into the NFL
was not surprising to him. ``We drafted him in the first round
because of his talents,'' said the QB, ``and he's really starting
to show those talents now. He's doing a nice job running with some
freedom and making some nice cuts. He's also doing a nice job of
making some yards after that first hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And this isn't surprising to be happening so soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' replied Bledsoe. ``I mean, he's a first-round draft pick
... that's what he's supposed to do. You know, I was a first-round
draft pick as a quarterback and I was supposed to come in and play.
That's what he's supposed to do, but he's doing a nice job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from words of many Patriots, it is becoming clearer that
Edwards not only may be as good as hoped when he was drafted first
by the team, he may be even better. The comparisons to that last
good running back to come out of Georgia _ the Broncos' Terrell
Davis _ now do not seem as far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's strong and he runs aggressively,'' said Carroll of his
rookie. ``And he slashes at you and he just keeps on coming.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards also has that football instinct and he has those
soft hands, and now his presence alone does so much for New
England's passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that (Edwards's running) has a big effect on our
passing success,'' said Carroll. And as Kansas City coach Marty
Schottenheimer put it, ``If you let them run the ball, they've got
a double-edged sword, and you've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the words from Kansas City center Jeff Smith captured
this phenomenon of a rookie back, still virtually anonymous outside
New England but who is making the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their running back, that young kid they have,'' said
Smith, ``is going to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the politically correct words, that ``I'm not here
to replace Curtis, I'm just here to do my job, and I'm just trying
to do my job well. But now I'm getting better and I'm starting to
feel a lot of things. I'm just reacting now and not thinking about
what I'm doing.''

PATRIOTS DEFENSE PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Willie McGinest, bothered by an encroachment
call against him with 4:42 left in the first quarter Sunday, yanked
off his helmet and gave the officials an earful. The officials
yanked out their yellow flags and gave the Patriots defensive
lineman a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst moved the ball from the Chiefs' 24-yard line to the
39, and it marked the first blunder by a unit that stalled the
Chiefs on Kansas City's first drive of the game and forced a
turnover on the second. When Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac
completed an 8-yard sideline pass to Kimble Anders on first down,
it appeared as if momentum was shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Chiefs thought so, too, for on second and 2 they ran
the ball up the middle, electing to attack the core of the defense.
Donnell Bennett gained 1 yard, so Kansas City tried again, up the
middle on third and 1. No gain by Bennett, stopped by McGinest and
Lawyer Milloy. The Patriots had made their case, but the Chiefs
wanted one more try at their core.
</P>
<P>
   And the guy who began the series with an embarrassing loss of
temper couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to go for it,'' McGinest said. ``I wasn't ready
to get off the field yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs ran up the middle a third time, and saw Henry Thomas
seal the middle and linebackers Ted Johnson and Todd Collins jump
over the top to stop fullback Tony Richardson. Momentum never came
close to shifting after that, and the Patriots went on to a 40-10
rout of the Chiefs. It marked New England's first win over Kansas
City since Oct. 4, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   A Chiefs offense that entered Sunday's game averaging 127.6
rushing yards and 184.2 passing yards a game managed just 14 yards
rushing (2 yards in the second half) and 120 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold a team that prides itself on running the ball, that
says something,'' said free safety Willie Clay. ``We had a lot of
guys running to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also had one interception against an offense that
hadn't thrown one all season. Kansas City converted just one of 10
third-down plays in the game and was 0 for 2 on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practiced the (fourth down and 1) play all week and we knew
in that situation they give the ball to the fullback,'' said
Johnson. ``It was great penetration by the defensive line. That's
the key to that deal. You have days like that. A lot of things went
our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson led the team with six tackles, followed by Milloy with
five. Slade had three tackles, one forced fumble, and one sack.
McGinest, who left the game briefly because of a left knee injury,
had two tackles and one pass defensed.
</P>
<P>
   In helping lead the charge, the defensive end made up for his
outburst. ``Things like that just get me hyped,'' said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people see the game and they think, `Oh, he's going
to lose his head. He's overreacting,''' he said, ``but the tackle
clearly jumped. And I went off his move and they called me. Then I
took off my helmet. I wasn't thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that I just got so fired up and my adrenaline was
pumping and the defense just fed off of me. They thought they had
the momentum, and hey, our defense has said we're not going to let
anyone get a yard on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, which entered the game having scored at least 16
points in each of its five games, never got closer than the Patriot
36-yard line in the first quarter. When the Chiefs scored their
only touchdown, with 52 seconds left in the third quarter, the game
had all but been decided.
</P>
<P>
   That meant a lot to a unit that said all week it had read
clippings lauding Kansas City's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long we heard stuff about us being underdogs and
Kansas City being a better team, No. 1 in defense and No. 1 in many
offensive categories,'' said McGinest. ``We just stayed humble, we
just wanted to come out and execute. When we play together as a
team it's hard to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots might need a similar effort next Monday night, when
they host the New York Jets and their former coach, Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Claus is coming to town,'' said Ty Law. ``(Parcells)
plays Santa Claus to the team and motivates his team to win. We
still didn't play a perfect game (Sunday). There were things we
need to improve on and coach Parcells will pick that up.''

GALARRAGA GETS HIS GROOVE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ At the time it sounded less like a hunch than a
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel he's getting close,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said
of his sluggish slugger Andres Galarraga two hours before the
Braves' do-or-die game against the Padres Sunday in the National
League Championship Series. ``He's just missing some pitches. Maybe
today he can unleash that power.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Cox's instincts were sharper than Ryan Leaf's
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's October was developing as dismally as that of the
San Diego Chargers' petulant rookie quarterback. The Braves' first
baseman brought a batting average of .091 into the fourth game of
the best-of-seven series. The player who collected 121 RBI during
the regular season had one hit (and three errors) to his name,
which was starting to sound suspiciously like goat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he trudged to the plate with the bases loaded in the
top of the seventh inning, he had left seven runners moored to
bases in 13 at-bats. He was well on his way to infamy when San
Diego reliever Dan Miceli delivered a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-0 count, Miceli threw a 92-mile-per-hour fastball that
Galarraga bashed over the left-center field fence with plenty of
room to spare. The ball soared some 440 feet and lifted the Braves
to an 8-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's shot struck the collective gut of the Qualcomm
Stadium crowd of 65,042, which forgot a fundamental rule of
baseball in the sixth after Jim Leyritz's solo homer broke a 2-2
deadlock. Never mind that you never, ever, ever look one at-bat
ahead, much less nine outs, the carried-away crowd started chanting
``Sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, already out of sorts after losing three games they
just as easily could have won, were in no mood to be baited.
Galarraga wasn't the only one who finally fought back against a
tide that was threatening to sweep the Braves out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez, last seen striking out Saturday to end the eighth
inning with the bases loaded and the Braves behind by one, struck
out on three straight pitches in his first plate appearance Sunday.
But he dug in and laced starter Joey Hamilton's first pitch of the
seventh over the right-field fence to knot the game at 3 and tie
the crowd's collective stomach in knots.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones then singled and advanced to second when Randy
Myers, who came on in relief of Hamilton, threw a wild pitch with
Greg Colbrunn at the plate. Ozzie Guillen, who was making his first
start of the series _ chalk it up to another Cox hunch _ singled
with two outs, scoring Jones, who easily beat Ruben Rivera's throw
from left after Rivera bobbled the ball. Keith Lockhart then
singled and Chipper Jones walked to set the stage for Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had been there, botched that. He had flied out to deep
center in the 10th inning with the tying and winning runs on base
last Wednesday to end the first game.
</P>
<P>
   But he showed the same resiliency that had served him so well
during his 13-year wait to play in a NLCS. He also dredged up the
sweet swing that had produced 44 home runs during the regular
season. Galarraga, 37, froze as soon as the ball left his bat and
followed the majestic flight of the sixth grand slam in NLCS
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit it, I said, `Thank you God for this one,''' said
Galarraga, who started his major-league odyssey in Montreal and
moved on to St. Louis and Colorado before signing a three-year, $24
million deal with the Braves this past November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really needed (the homer) and the team really needed it to
stay alive,'' Galarraga said. ``They haven't been throwing me too
many good pitches. That's probably the best pitch I've seen all
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before Galarraga got his groove back, there were subtle
signs for those San Diego fans willing to take off their
rose-colored glasses that the Padres' charmed run was sputtering.
In the first inning outfielder Tony Gwynn struck out, a rarity
along the lines of a total eclipse of the sun. In 461
regular-season at-bats, he struck out only 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded with a two-out double in the third that drove home
Quilvio Veras, whom starter Denny Neagle had walked, for the
Padres' first run. Leyritz singled Gwynn home and just like that
San Diego had one more run than the Braves had mustered in the
previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, the starter whom everybody but Cox seemed to think
should be shunted for John Smoltz, yielded all the Padres' runs.
But Dennis Martinez, John Rocker, Odalis Perez, Rudy Seanez and
Kerry Ligtenberg stymied the Padres, allowing them only one hit the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is the Padres will get another look at Smoltz, who has
lost only one game since June 26. If nothing else, Cox's crew has
made good on its word to make this series interesting.  &QL;

POWER FAILURE STUNS FIESTA

 BC_F AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If Saturday's power failure at Sun Devil Stadium
didn't spark Fiesta Bowl Executive Director John Junker to push for
a new home for his game, it did provide a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be evident why there are concerns,'' Junker said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Junker was watching the Notre Dame-Arizona State game from a
press-level suite when a transformer blew during halftime, causing
most of the stadium's electricity to fail and knocking the ABC
regional telecast temporarily off the air.
</P>
<P>
   When he became aware of the extent of the problem, Junker said
his thoughts went something like, ``Thank goodness this isn't a
night game, and thank goodness this isn't January 4.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the date of what college football is billing as its
national championship, in the Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium _ at
night. A similar occurrence ``would not be in the best interests of
the Valley of the Sun, Arizona and our community,'' Junker said in
an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had it been a night game, it would have been a real mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Junker voiced concerns about the condition of Sun
Devil Stadium as it relates to other, newer stadiums that might
want to join the Bowl Championship Series that currently includes
the Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Sugar bowls.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Junker said he was ``keeping an open mind'' about
the Cardinals' proposed $650 million stadium at Rio Salado and that
he was wondering about the future of Sun Devil Stadium, which is 40
years old.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident on Saturday, Junker said his view was
reinforced, but he would not talk about the new stadium proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so busy preparing for the game, we haven't taken a
specific position, per se,'' he said. ``But one position we have
taken is that we have to have the best place possible to continue
our growth. That shouldn't be surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU stadium manager Tom Sadler, who said it might be several
days before the cause of the problem is known, rented a generator
and had it installed Saturday night. There was full power for
Sunday's Chicago Bears-Cardinals game.
</P>
<P>
   Junker praised Sadler and his staff, ``but it's obvious there
are reasons to have concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those apparently is television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was a wake-up call,'' said ABC producer Jay
Rothman, who will produce the Fiesta Bowl. ``We will do everything,
based on (Saturday), to be bullet-proof in terms of having the
appropriate power, generators, what have you.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC did not have a backup generator on hand and was able to
resume its telecast only when limited power was restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very unusual situation to have this in a major
stadium, considering that it's also an NFL stadium,'' said director
Chip Dean, an ASU graduate who played free safety for Frank Kush in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we be prepared to guard against this? Certainly. Do I
think this is a black mark against the Fiesta Bowl because maybe
the stadium is old? Definitely not. I look at it simply as a
strange situation that we'll address and they'll address.''
</P>
<P>
   Topics already being addressed include relocating the broadcast
booth, from which Keith Jackson will call his last college football
game, and improving camera placements. The press box at ASU is
among the highest of any stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   All the Fiesta Bowl tickets have been sold, so ABC likely would
have to buy some seats, remove them, and then build its new press
box.

COATES'S ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Ben Coates was a man of many moves but few
words Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But his statistics did the talking after the Patriots' 40-10
thrashing of the Chiefs, a game in which Coates caught two passes _
both for touchdowns _ to move into a distant second place on the
Patriots' all-time list with 44 career scoring receptions, behind
Stanley Morgan (67).
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is that Morgan was a wide receiver
and Coates is a tight end who does a lot more than just catch
passes in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my receivers against anybody's,'' said quarterback
Drew Bledsoe, who hit Coates with a 2-yard strike in the second
quarter and an 11-yard toss into the right corner of the end zone
that had the veteran Coates stretched to the limit late in the
third quarter, making it 34-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK, two catches, two scores,'' said Coates before
quickly departing the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Coates passed Gino Cappelletti (42 TD catches) and with his 13
receiving yards, he is only 42 behind Cappelletti for fourth place
on the team's all-time list. Cappelletti stands at 4,589 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen for the Pro Bowl the last four seasons, Coates had been
hobbled by ankle injuries this season and sat out the second game
against Indianapolis. He had seven receptions a week ago against
New Orleans (his highest total in 32 games) and his scores Sunday
were his first of the season, indicating that he is starting to
round into form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hooked up for a lot of touchdowns over the years,'' said
Bledsoe. ``On the second one today, when I released the ball it
felt good but the wind took it. I didn't know if he was going to
get it, so he made a nice play on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put it in the end zone, you know he's going to get
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Coates put on an extra burst, taking the ball in full
stride before his momentum nearly took him down the runway leading
to the Patriots' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rhythm going with the running and the passing game,''
said coach Pete Carroll, who saw Coates, as in so many games in the
past, contribute to the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Willie McGinest, who has bumped shoulder pads with Coates in
practice for five seasons, put it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's the ultimate competitor,'' said McGinest. ``With Ben,
it's like being at the bank. You know your money's safe. And if the
bank gets robbed, you're insured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a silent threat. He doesn't say much, he just gets it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, said McGinest, ``we really go at it. It all starts
there. He's always working hard and he's been around long enough
(since 1991) to know a lot of the tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's experienced, a big, strong guy who can run, who's smart
and can find the gap, and any time you've got that combination in a
tight end, well, what more can you say?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want any other tight end on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   For four seasons, Patriots running back Tony Carter was an
opponent and the former Chicago Bear said he's glad to be on the
same side as Coates these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a great player, a Pro Bowl type. He's one of those
guys who's popular in the locker room, who keeps things together,''
said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played against him, his name always came up. He was one
of the guys you had to stop if you hoped to stop the New England
Patriots. You can't say all he can do is catch the ball, because
he's such an excellent blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he believes Coates was feeling more comfortable on
the field Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had some nicks and some things that set him back this
year, but he's getting the job done. He's moving in the right
direction,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Coates wasn't saying much, however.
</P>
<P>
   But his numbers continue to speak volumes about the best tight
end in franchise history.

BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's tough to say who's more depressed this morning.
The people running the Rose Bowl or all those Nebraska backers who
already had made their holiday travel plans to Phoenix so they
could watch their beloved Huskers compete for the national
championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Nebraska's depresssion is obvious. Check out
Saturday's result: No. 18 Texas A&AMP;M 28, No. 2 Nebraska 21. Bye-bye
Phoenix, so long and farewell to a chance to win another national
title. At least not in the Fiesta Bowl. And not without lots of
help from lots of other teams who are ahead of them, including Big
12 rival Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers saw their 19-game winning streak end. ``We're down
and hurt right now,'' said first-year coach Frank Solich, who
watched his team barely survive upstart Oklahoma State a week ago.
``We're not accustomed to taking a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Texas A&AMP;M accustomed to handing them out, at least not to
Top 5 teams. The win over Nebraska was the Aggies' first against a
Top 5 team since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Rose Bowl's woes? How would you like to be on the
Rose Bowl committee this morning? For decades, the esteemed
gentlemen in the white suits pined for a Big Ten/Pac-10 matchup of
No. 1 vs. No. 2 for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Now it could, with Ohio State No. 1 and UCLA
No. 2 in Sunday's polls. Only problem is, if things stay that way,
the dream matchup will be played in the Fiesta Bowl, which will
host this season's national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The only escape hatch for the Rose Bowl could be the continued
improvement of Notre Dame, which rolled over Arizona State Saturday
night and has a clear shot at earning a Bowl Championship Series
at-large slot. If that happens, and the Rose Bowl loses either the
Pac-10 champion or Big Ten champion to the Fiesta, count on the
Irish being in Pasadena on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The other Nervous Nellie out there is Kansas State, which is now
top dog in the Big 12 after its victory over Colorado and
Nebraska's defeat. The Wildcats still have that monster grudge
match with the Huskers in November, but right now they are the team
with the clearest path to the Big 12 championship game in St. Louis
and a BCS slot, perhaps in the Fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may be a bit premature, of course, but Showdown
Saturday, as some are calling it, cleared some of the murkiness
from the national championship picture.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the best bets for the Fiesta Bowl matchup are either
Ohio State vs. Tennessee or Ohio State vs. UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA will know more when it faces unbeaten Oregon at the Rose
Bowl Saturday. With so much at stake, one wonders if Bruins
officials will decide to reschedule that canceled game against
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear-cut favorite in the Heisman Trophy race now,
although Texas's  &UR; Ricky Williams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who picked up 139 yards and
scored two touchdowns in the Longhorns' 34-3 win over Oklahoma, and
UCLA quarterback  &UR; Cade McNown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who threw a pair of touchdown
passes in the Bruins' 52-28 romp over Arizona, seem to be slightly
ahead of the pack ... Nebraska also lost a 40-game regular-season
winning streak ... Poor Auburn. The Tigers, who according to the
NCAA computer have the toughest schedule in college football, can't
catch a break. Their 38-21 loss to Mississippi State Saturday
dropped them to 1-4, their worst start in 46 years ... Is North
Carolina's defense back? The Tar Heels, who struggled through the
early part of the season, held Pittsburgh to 181 yards in total
offense and only 48 yards rushing in a 29-10 win. Or maybe Pitt
isn't that good ... Say hello to the new Prairie View. Cheney
State's 50th straight game without a victory, a 42-22 loss to
Kutztown, set a Division 2 record. Cheney also has the longest
current losing streak, 37 games ... Talk about a bad day. St.
Mary's (Calif.) lost, 49-0, to Utah and lost six fumbles, threw
four interceptions, and rushed for minus-29 yards ... Washington
had 13 sacks in a 53-12 win over Utah State ... With Nebraska's
loss, UCLA's 14-game winning streak is the longest in Division 1-A
... How sore is Purdue quarterback  &UR; Drew Brees  &LR; this morning? Brees
completed an NCAA record 55 passes (in 83 attempts) in a 31-24 loss
to Wisconsin. ``My arm is fine,'' Brees said. ``I can't believe we
lost the game.'' ... Arkansas and Oregon are a combined 11-0.
Neither was ranked in the preseason ... California scored 22 points
in a five-minute stretch in turning a 31-10 deficit to USC into a
32-31 victory ... Don't look now, but Virginia and Georgia Tech are
leading the ACC ... South Carolina is 1-5 after losing to Kentucky
Saturday, which puts Gamecocks coach  &UR; Brad Scott  &LR; on the endangered
species list.

   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Arizona football Coach Dick Tomey has seen many
things in his 36 years of coaching, but a team scoring three
touchdowns on three consecutive offensive plays, all in the span of
a little over two minutes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been involved in a situation like that,'' Tomey
said. ``That's a moment in the history of Arizona football that we
all need to hope is not repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   And he watched it all over again Sunday morning as he reviewed
tape of the Wildcats' 52-28 loss to UCLA Saturday night at Arizona
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (4-0) and Arizona (5-1) were playing a nice little game of
serve-and-volley until the Bruins broke loose. First, flanker Danny
Farmer beat cornerback Chris McAlister for a 64-yard touchdown
pass. On the next possession, tailback Keith Brown from Mountain
Pointe High scored on a 54-yard run. Then following an
interception, Brown scored from 20 yards out to complete the 21-0
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 50 minutes, it's a great game, as good a game as you've
ever seen,'' Tomey said. ``And then you erase the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   At least you do if you were cheering for Arizona, which saw its
chances for a Fiesta Bowl bid and a shot at a national title
ruined. The Wildcats dropped from 10th to 16th in the AP poll,
while UCLA moved from third to second, thanks in part to Texas
A&AMP;M's upset of previously unbeaten Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Tomey seemed to still be battling the emotional
hangover. He lamented the mistakes that cost the Wildcats the game,
while also starting to look ahead to this Saturday's game at Oregon
State.
</P>
<P>
   The loss broke Arizona's nine-game winning streak, dating back
to early November of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have somebody come do that to you on your home field just
really hurts,'' he said. ``I think the guys are really
disappointed. I hope so. I hope it hurts like hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had this feeling in almost a year. We just have to
hate it enough that we don't want it to occur much.``
</P>
<P>
   While pleased with some aspects of his team's play on Saturday,
Tomey was particularly disappointed with two areas: the Wildcats'
tackling and a lack of a running game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona limited UCLA quarterback Cade McNown to a substandard
performance (10-24, 171 yards), but the Bruins' tailbacks were
relentless. The regular starter, Jermaine Lewis, was suspended for
the game for his involvement in a fight, but the Bruins didn't
suffer. Freshman DeShaun Foster rushed 20 times for 118 yards and
two touchdowns. Brown finished with 91 yards on nine carries and
two touchdowns. Overall, the Bruins rushed for 297 yards on 44
carries, a 6.8-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Foster) is an outstanding player,'' Tomey said. ``He's big
and fast, and he's hard to tackle. But at the same time, our
tackling at times was atrocious. But given all that, with 11
minutes to go in the game they have 230 something yards in total
offense. They've had that in the first quarter in some games, so we
were doing some things right, but not nearly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   While McNown was helped by his running game, Arizona
quarterbacks Ortege Jenkins and Keith Smith had little support. The
Wildcats rushed for just 90 yards on 40 carries. Starting tailback
Trung Canidate had just 16 on 13 rushes.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey, however, doesn't think the loss will create any
psychological problems for the Wildcats this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if people are going to work as hard as we've worked
and accomplish as much as this team has accomplished, and let one
disappointing game . . . talk them out of being successful, then
I'd be disappointed,'' he said. ``I think we're stronger mentally
than that.''

KEALY'S ONLY WAY OUT IS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - It was an unlikely scenario for a hometown lad
and one of the country's top freshman quarterbacks of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Crowd boos.
</P>
<P>
   Being replaced by an inexperienced backup.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what it has come to for Arizona State's Ryan Kealy,
who may have hit rock bottom in the Sun Devils' 28-9 loss to Notre
Dame Saturday. Although the quarterback's struggles are only one
element of ASU's 2-4 start, it's a mystifying occurrence for a
player who showed such promise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One day after the loss, Coach Bruce Snyder tried to make sense
of Kealy's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very competitive, very emotional guy,'' Snyder said.
``He doesn't come across that way in normal conversation. But I
think he really runs deep. And it's not shared a lot. You combine
those two things with high expectations and with the team not
playing the way it should, and he feels like he's not doing what he
could to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things tearing and pulling at him. I'm a
two-bit psychologist, I guess, uncertified, but I really feel for
him. He wants to be good. He wants to help this team so badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is a lot more fun when you have guys like that, as
opposed to guys who don't care as much. I like working with him. I
want to help him. The team wants to help him. This record is
certainly not all his fault. But to him, it just feels as if it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's numbers this season are almost identical to his first
six games last year, when he had yet to find his groove: A 54.5
percent completion rate in 1998 vs. 54.9 in 1997. Eight touchdowns
vs. seven touchdowns. Seven interceptions in 1998. Seven
interceptions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Kealy picked up the pace during the second half of 1997,
throwing eight more touchdown passes and only one interception.
This is where ASU thought the sophomore would pick up this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Sun Devil Stadium crowd was vocal about its
impatience and booed Kealy after bad plays.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans have been terrific,'' he said. ``My only hope is that
people would understand that the guy is really trying and really
cares. If they're booing me, I don't have a problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here's a guy that's won a lot of games around here that
really cares what he's doing. So that's hurtful. Unexpected?
Probably not, because a minority of today's fans aren't sensitive
to that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he bounces back and has a four-touchdown game, things
will change, and we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   When will that be? Snyder hasn't said who will start against
Stanford on Oct. 22, only that he is is scrutinizing ``every
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defeat, Snyder said he was pleased how the team
reacted to the loss in the locker room. Several players, including
safety Mitchell Freedman, center Grey Ruegamer and tailback J.R.
Redmond, stood up and spoke to the team about not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were adamant after the game about turning this thing
around,'' Snyder said. ``They were angry. I don't think there is
any quit at all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to charge into what we're going to call our second
season. We have five solid games, league games. If we solve our
problems and play well, we can get most of them and end up at least
with a decent taste in our mouth.'' &QL; 
Note &QL; 
Snyder is awaiting a definitive word on defensive end Quincy Yancy,
who sprained an ankle and knee in the game. It appears he won't
need surgery. &QL;

OSORO CATCHES ON QUICKLY 
</HEADLINE>
 MARATHON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Everyone expected Sunday's Chicago Marathon to be
fast. It's just that no one expected a rookie to be fastest. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Morocco's Khalid Khannouchi won here in a stunning 2
hours 7 minutes 10 seconds, the fastest first marathon in history.
He returned as the favorite Sunday, intent on bettering that
remarkable time. But as Khannouchi faded in the final miles,
victimized by the combined burdens of a bad left ankle and the
heavy crown of defending champion, newcomer Ondoro Osoro of Kenya
stormed past in the final mile for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Khalid, in more ways than one: Osoro's 2:06:54 is now
the fastest debut ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first marathon and I think I am very happy,'' said
the 30-year-old, whose effort in almost ideal conditions catapulted
him to third on the all-time performance list and earned him
$55,000 for the win and more than $50,000 in performance bonuses
and incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi was second in 2:07:19, Gert Thys of South Africa
third in 2:07:45, and Joseph Kahugu of Kenya followed in 2:07:59.
It was the first time in history the top four times were under
2:08. Moses Tanui, the Boston Marathon winner in 1996 and 1998, was
a distant fifth in 2:09:43.
</P>
<P>
   Osoro was joined in the winner's circle by countrywoman Joyce
Chepchumba, who bided her time behind Colleen de Reuck for 22 miles
before passing the cramping South African. Chepchumba, who trains
in Germany with world-record holder Tegla Loroupe, then put more
than three minutes on de Reuck on her way to victory in 2:23:57.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a Kenyan man and woman were victors in the
same major marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Osoro, in the lead pack throughout much of the race, ran wisely,
especially after a surge by Khannouchi and Thys at 20 miles gapped
him by a minute. By 23 miles he was a second in front of Thys and
just seven seconds behind Khannouchi, and by 26 miles he led
Khannouchi by 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``After passing him, I wanted to run fast so that when he comes
to sprint I'm already gone, because he's a very good sprinter,''
said Osoro, who finished three seconds behind Khannouchi in the
Utica Boilermaker 15K in July.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no sprinting Sunday for the 26-year-old
defending champion, who was harboring a secret: His left ankle was
hurting for the past two weeks, and being in shape to run even
faster than last year soon would mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running with the pain,'' said Khannouchi, who had to be
carried into the postrace news conference. ``I was thinking about
dropping out, but I just decided to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Osoro any stranger to pain. After several years of
running track and cross-country, he was severely injured in a car
accident when a 12-ton truck smashed into him on the notoriously
hazardous Kenyan roads. Knocked unconscious, his right arm broken,
his hip injured, Osoro could not compete for two years. Now
training in Boulder, Colo. where he lives with his wife and four
children, Osoro turned to road racing after his recovery, and holds
the world record (45:37) for a 10-mile loop course.
</P>
<P>
   De Reuck appeared to be in control through 19 miles, when she
held a 38-second lead on Chepchumba. But de Reuck's quadriceps
began seizing, and less than 2 miles later the 27-year-old took the
lead for good, running a personal best by almost three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joyce just came flying by me,'' said de Reuck, who finished
fifth last April in Boston and third in 1997. Trailing her by 16
seconds was Elana Meyer, the South African who holds the
half-marathon world record but has yet to win at 26.2 miles after
two seconds and a third at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no one came close to claiming the $1 million put up
by New Balance for an American breaking Bob Kempainen's 2:08:47 US
record: Jerry Lawson, the likeliest candidate, dropped out at 6
miles when a strained right hamstring caused his calf to tighten,
and the first American, Rod DeHaven of Madison, Wis., came in at
2:13:01, 15th overall. Attleboro, Mass., native Mark Coogan was
20th in 2:15:32. Kristy Johnston was the first American woman,
eighth overall in 2:32:37.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best story belonged to Tatyana Pozdnyakova, a
43-year-old who paid her own way from Ukraine _ and then the $60
entry fee on top of that _ to enter at the last minute. Not only
did Pozdnyakova's $16,500 in prize and bonus money for winning the
master's division give her an impressive return on her investment,
but her 2:29:25 is the second-fastest marathon run by a woman over
40.

BRAVES SHOW SIGNS OF LIFE

<P>
   SAN DIEGO - Thump-thump. Thump-thump. Thump-thump.
</P>
<P>
   That was the faint sound of a heartbeat emanating from the
Atlanta Braves' clubhouse after the team fought off elimination in
the best-of-seven National League Championship Series with an 8-3
victory over San Diego in Game 4 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   A mere nine outs away from having their 1998 season flat-line in
a most humiliating fashion (which is what a four-game sweep will do
to a club), the Braves' offense uncorked a six-spot on San Diego's
pitching staff in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   A one-run Atlanta deficit turned into a Braves rout. The six
runs in the seventh inning doubled what the Braves' offense, which
basically spent the previous 34 innings sleep walking, had managed
to score in the first three games combined.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the stranglehold the Padres had on this series doesn't
seem quite as tight as it did 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego still has the upper hand. Atlanta must play nearly
perfect baseball the rest of the way to pull off what would be a
first in the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But believe it or not, all the talk in the winning clubhouse
centered around the impossible becoming possible, overcoming a 3-0
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   You know what? This is the only team today, possibly in the past
30 years, capable of staring history in the face and rewriting it.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will send John Smoltz, the winningest pitcher ever in
the postseason to the mound today against Andy Ashby. Smoltz, who
gave up two runs and walked a season-high five batters in Game 1,
was practically oozing with confidence after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it like I'm not going to be the guy to let the
season end,'' Smoltz said. ``It won't be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Smoltz extend the series _ three times he's pitched with
the Braves facing elimination in the NLCS, and the Braves have won
all three _ Atlanta's next pitcher would be Tom Glavine, who would
oppose the great Braves slayer, Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   If a Game 7 occurs, it would be four-time Cy Young Award winner
Greg Maddux against Sterling Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Can history unfold right in front of our eyes over the next four
days? The odds say no. The Braves say yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize history says this cannot happen,'' Atlanta
pitching coach Leo Mazzone said. ``But when you're talking about
one of the greatest rotations in the history of the game, anything
can still happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a staff that has consistently responded under the gun.
Hell, if they pull this off, I may very well just go retire. I know
it can't possibly get any better.''
</P>
<P>
   In 118 previous seven-game series, not once has a club overcome
a 3-0 deficit to win.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not one of those clubs has had the benefit of sending
Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux in order to try to pull it out of the
Grand Canyon-sized hole the Braves placed themselves in by losing
the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlanta's rotation is unmatched, the Braves found
themselves trailing for one very good reason _ they weren't scoring
runs. Atlanta was in search of a hero Sunday who did not pitch and
up stepped Andres Galarraga, the Big Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who had four hits (all singles) in his first 23
postseason at-bats in 1998, slammed a massive 459-foot grand slam
to put a big, fat exclamation point on Atlanta's six-run uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the raging overflow crowd of 65,042 went nearly
silent. All you could hear were the 35 or so people who leaped out
of the Braves' dugout and Ted Turner and Jane Fonda, who cheered
madly while hugging from their front-row seats along the third-base
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having done something positive in this game gives me the
chance to do something positive again in the next one,'' Galarraga
said. ``I think we have the team to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Braves victory tonight would make that heartbeat sound
more like, THUMP-THUMP! THUMP-THUMP! THUMP-THUMP. And that's a
sound the Padres simply do not want to hear. &QL;

BRIERE CLOSE TO RETURNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN AND TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Daniel Briere won't rush it, but the Coyotes center hinted that
he could play with the team next Monday when the Boston Bruins come
to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be ready Thursday, that's for sure, but after that,
who knows? I think I might be ready,'' said Briere, sidelined
because of a concussion after getting dumped by Anaheim's  &UR; Ruslan
Salei in the final preseason game. ``I rode the bike (Sunday), got
in a little workout, and I was feeling pretty good, actually. There
were no symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere, who led the team in scoring during the preseason with
seven points, will skate alone today and Tuesday and possibly will
resume regular practices with the team within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   As for the five-game suspension and $1,000 fine that was handed
down to Salei, Briere said the punishment fit the crime. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say. It's your life you're talking about there,
and I was in and out (of consciousness) for a few minutes,'' he
said. ``Maybe it should have been for more games, but at the same
time, I think the league's going to be better about stuff like that
this year. They're going to take more action against those kinds of
cheap shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending five straight full seasons in the minor leagues
and missing virtually all of training camp with the Coyotes because
of sprained knee ligaments, defenseman
 &UR; Bryan Helmer finally appeared in his first NHL game Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous at the start, but after a while, I felt
pretty good,'' said Helmer, 26, who signed as a free agent this
summer after getting caught in a logjam with the New Jersey Devils,
who are talent-rich in blue liners. ``I just wish it would have
went the other way with a win. But it was finally nice to get my
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Deron Quint was scratched from the opener, the
result of a concussion he received late in the final preseason game
against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be only another four or five days,'' said Quint, who
also has a cut on his chin and upper lip after receiving a high
stick on the play. ``I hope to be back in time for Thursday night's
game against Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Wing  &UR; Brad Isbister was a healthy scratch. &QL;

   SAN DIEGO _ The Big Cat is back. Sooner or later you knew Andres
Galarraga would come to life for the Braves. And the best thing
about it for Atlanta is he just could be the spark for the biggest
comeback in major league baseball history.

   After a woeful September and a 1-for-12 slump in the National
League playoffs, Galarraga Sunday night did what earlier in the
season was expected of him almost every night. With the Braves on
the brink of elimination, he came through with a grand slam to
highlight a six-run seventh-inning explosion that carried Atlanta
to an 8-3 victory over the San Diego Padres in Game 4 of the NLCS.
The Padres still lead, three games to one. But at last the Braves
have some momentum, and with their pitching it may help them out of
the mighty hole they're in.
</P>
<P>
   This was classic Atlanta baseball. With the Braves clinging to a
4-3 lead, Galarraga stepped up and hit his slam off Padres
righthander Dan Miceli, which stunned a crowd of 65,042 at Qualcomm
Stadium that only an inning or two before had been calling for a
series sweep. This is what the Braves wanted to see after trading
away Fred McGriff last winter and signing Galarraga. The Big Cat
had only two home runs and nine runs batted in during September.
Sunday night's blast was dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5 Monday night, Andy Ashby of San Diego and John Smoltz
of Atlanta will hook up in a rematch of Game 1. If the Braves win,
it's back to Atlanta for Game 6 and possibly 7. Be aware, however,
that no baseball team has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit in a playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge,'' said Denny Neagle, a 20-game winner a year
ago who gave up three runs in 5 2/3 innings but gave Atlanta a
chance to win. ``More importantly, some of our big guys came
through. I think Galarraga needed that. A little jolt in the arm
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we won this game, 4-3, we'd still have felt good,
but it would have been scratch and claw. We put up eight runs
Monday night. Galarraga gets a grand slam. Some guys got some
clutch hits for us. That's what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves fell behind in the third, 2-0. Atlanta got one in the
fourth and tied it in the top of the sixth. The Padres went ahead
in their half on a solo home run by former Red Sox Jim Leyritz. But
then it was San Diego that fell apart. Atlanta re-tied it at 3 on a
homer by Javy Lopez leading off the seventh. When Andruw Jones
followed with a single, that was it for Padres starter Joey
Hamilton, and on came a San Diego bullpen that had been living on
borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Myers, who started the year with the Blue Jays, sandwiched
two outs around a wild pitch. But then he gave up a run-scoring
single to Ozzie Guillen to put Atlanta ahead, 4-3. An infield
single by Keith Lockhart and a walk to Chipper Jones finished
Myers. Miceli took over and Galarraga slammed a 1-0 pitch into the
seats in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for something in the strike zone,'' said
Galarraga. ``All I wanted to do was get a base hit and drive
somebody in. As soon as I hit it, I knew it was a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt good going to home plate. I know I haven't been
hitting well, but the way they have been pitching me was really
difficult. When you go 0 for 2, 0 for 3, you swing at bad pitches.
I wanted to do something to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of frustration to deal with,'' added
Galarraga. ``I was more patient at the plate. I had two walks and
hit into a double play. But I also hit a home run. I feel much
better. My home run kept the team alive. It will give them more
emotion for tomorrow. I know my family is happy to see me do
something to help us win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres knew Galarraga was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good hitter,'' said Padres manager Bruce Bochy. ``I was
hoping he wouldn't find his stroke. We had two outs. But that home
run was a hit that broke our backs. Miceli was in a situation where
he fell behind and had no place to put him. He (put) a ball where
Galarraga could handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the series continues. The Braves had 12 hits, as their
bats finally woke up. But if they lose Monday night, they go home
with nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series is not over,'' said Andruw Jones. ``We have to go
out and play the same baseball that we played today.''

COYOTES' SCHOENFELD SHAKING UP LINES ALREADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The linesmen assigned by the NHL for the Coyotes'
season-opening 4-1 loss to the Ottawa Senators on Sunday were Baron
Parker and Shane Heyer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``mad linesman'' in the bench area was Coyotes Coach Jim
Schoenfeld, who mixed and matched lines like a crazed chemist
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   But only because he needed to light a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld started the game with Cliff Ronning centering captain
Keith Tkachuk and Rick Tocchet on the No. 1 line, with Jeremy
Roenick centering Greg Adams and Shane Doan on the second line, and
Juha Ylonen centering Bob Corkum and Dallas Drake on the third
line.
</P>
<P>
   By the 14-minute mark of the second period, the Coyotes were
trailing, 3-0, and Roenick was up with Tkachuk and Tocchet. Drake
also took some shifts with Tkachuk and Roenick, while Tocchet was
matched with Adams and Ronning on the No. 2 line. Drake, in fact,
took shifts with all three lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were having a difficult time with some of our
players handling Ottawa's speed,'' Schoenfeld said. ``So we changed
the lines accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to generate some more offensive opportunities,
and, unfortunately, it didn't pay off. We were really fumbling the
puck. I don't know if it was nerves or the fact it was the first
game . . . we were running with the ball before we caught it.
Obviously, you do that and they're going to get a turnover and cash
it on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, no doubt, stemmed from Tkachuk's prolonged
preseason holdout and his appearance in only one preseason game,
which didn't allow Schoenfeld opportunity to get a good feeling for
the makeup of his lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who are now 0-4-1 in their last five against the
Senators, did appear tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with cob webs on us. That's a good hockey club,
too, and they spanked us pretty good,'' Tocchet said. ``I think we
were all a little bit jittery every time we touched the puck. When
it was 1-0, I think we panicked a little bit. Even when it's 2-0,
you have to stick to the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drake-Roenick-Tkachuk combination finally paid dividends
when Roenick scored the first goal of the season on an assist from
Drake at 9:14 of the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld also mixed up his defensive combinations, starting
the game with Teppo Numminen and Jyrki Lumme paired together, Keith
Carney with Oleg Tverdovsky, and Bryan Helmer with Gerald Diduck.
By the midway point of the second period, Numminen was with
Tverdovsky and Lumme with Carney.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells what kind of game it was and how things were
going,'' Numminen said. ``You have to make changes to get something
going.'' &QL;

COYOTES BOOED _ AND EARN IT  
 LOOK BAD IN LOSING 1ST GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Keith Tkachuk wasn't the only Coyote to get booed
Sunday night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The entire team got an earful from the crowd during it's
bellyflop of a season opener against the Ottawa Senators. And it
probably should have been worse. The final score, a 4-1 rout,
certainly could have been.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, it was the first game. So what if it showed?
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second game this fall for Tkachuk, the Coyotes'
captain, who missed most of training camp because of a
controversial holdout. Like his only preseason appearance, he was
booed lustily when he was introduced and almost every time he
touched the puck.
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't getting the puck swiped or watching it slide
between their skates, the majority of his teammates got the same
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Senators pooped on the party, streaking to a
4-0 lead and making everyone among the 15,812 quickly forget about
all the opening night pomp. The sparklers, the fireworks, the
spotlight, the pre-game introductions didn't matter for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like this on Thursday against Colorado, the score's
going to be 10-1,'' Coyotes right wing Dallas Drake said.
</P>
<P>
   Senators goalie Damian Rhodes looked in mid-season form,
stopping 22 shots. His supporting cast played mostly error-free
hockey as Ottawa opened the season 2-0 for the first time in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators also are now 4-0-1 in their past five games against
the Coyotes, who dropped to 8-9-3 in season openers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were all a little bit jittery,'' Phoenix forward
Rick Tocchet said. ``We all had a tough time handling the puck. We
all kind of panicked a little bit. Even when it's 2-0, you've got
to stick to the game plan, but it just seemed like everything went
to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Jeremy Roenick prevented Rhodes from pinning a shutout on
the Coyotes, as he scored the club's only goal midway through the
final period, thanks to a diving effort by Drake that got him the
puck. But that was about the only highlight for the men in white.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game was even halfway through, the Coyotes were
halfway in the tank. Ottawa breezed to a 3-0 lead seven minutes
into the second period, and no remedy seemed to be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Dackell, filling in for the injured Daniel Alfredsson on
Ottawa's No. 1 line, started the deluge at 9:06 of the first period
by snaring his second goal of the young season with a finishing
tap-in of Sean McEachern's backhanded pass through the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes thought they tied it in the second, but Tocchet's
would-be goal in close on Rhodes was waived off after a review.
Less than a minute later, Radek Bonk rifled a rising slap shot from
the right circle to make it 2-0 for the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gardiner then came up with what might have been the play
of the night. The third-year pro threw a crushing backcheck on
defenseman Jyrki Lumme, knocking away the puck behind the Phoenix
net. Roenick slithered in to corral it, but Gardiner swiped it away
with a flick of his blade, and shoved it past an unsuspecting
Nikolai Khabibulin, who never saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough game,'' said Tkachuk, who fanned on an open net
early in the game. ``I'm discouraged and I'm disappointed, but it's
not the end of the world. We've got 81 games left to play. We just
went away from the game plan and they took it to us.''

GENDER LESS OF A FACTOR IN '98 RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The political tidal wave dubbed the ``Year of the Woman'' that
swept California in the 1992 elections is hardly creating a ripple
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While Barbara Boxer maintains her support from Democratic women,
moderate Republican women as well as Democratic men appear to be
rejecting the senator's re-election bid. Abortion, a hot button
that even two years ago was still uppermost in many minds, does not
seem to be helping pro-choice Boxer _ even though her opponent,
Matt Fong, has said Roe vs. Wade was ``wrongly decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gray Davis has been hoping to
boost his campaign for governor by attracting Republican women with
his clearly pro-choice credentials. But polls indicate he is not
having much luck, either. A Field Poll released last week showed
that just 15 percent of Republican women support Davis over his
Republican challenger, Dan Lungren _ not the landslide once
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, so many women have achieved higher levels of
office. ... Gender doesn't play such a role in the decision. The
debate focuses more on issues,'' said Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman
for EMILY's List, one of the nation's powerhouse money-raisers for
Democratic pro-choice female candidates like Boxer. ``With two
women senators, 13 women in the congressional delegation and five
women running for statewide office ... if there was a novelty to
it, it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Field Polls revealed some startling numbers about
the issues _ and how potent a force female voters will be _ in the
drama of this year's California races.
</P>
<P>
   While California voters consider Boxer to be the stronger
candidate on the majority of issues they care most about _
education, jobs and economy, guns, abortion, environment, health
care and strong leadership _ they still give Fong a 4-point lead,
the Field Poll showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Males have this 5-to-3 negative view of Barbara Boxer,'' said
Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo, a difference he calls
``striking.'' Because men have a historically higher propensity to
vote, DiCamillo notes that, at least in the U.S. Senate race, the
gender gap ``is working in the other direction _ against Boxer. ...
This time around, men are asserting their will and affecting the
outcome to a greater extent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, the polls also suggest evidence of a new
perspective among voters _ men and women alike.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion did not rank among the top five issues of concern to
voters in recent Field Polls, ``and in the Los Angeles Times poll,
it didn't rank in the top 20,'' noted Dan Schnur, the Republican
consultant working to elect both Lungren and Fong. ``There's a
certain number of voters on both sides of the issue who vote only
because of that issue. But it's a relatively small number.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Schnur argue that Democrats, particularly
Boxer, have simply overplayed certain issues to female voters _ and
the female card as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, Barbara Boxer was the chromosome candidate,'' said
Schnur. ``Now the voters have spent six years watching her in
office, and they've come to realize that _ while demographics are
important _ they're not all that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Boxer's agenda. I supported her last time. But being a
woman is just not enough anymore,'' said Elahe Enssani, a Bay Area
civil engineer who runs her own Bay Area high-tech firm and teaches
at San Francisco State University. The activist Democrat said she
will probably vote for Fong this time around _ even though she does
not agree with him on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all bought into the `Year of the Woman,' but she hasn't
been a strong enough figure in the Senate ... and she seems too
much of a partisan,'' said Enssani.
</P>
<P>
   That view disturbs many who are actively working to have more
women _ and women's issues _ in the forefront of politics. Some
suggest that the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal may be
having its effects on voters _ particularly on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this state, I don't believe there's a gender backlash. It's
a backlash and a dissatisfaction about politics in general,'' said
Marie C. Wilson, president of the White House Project, a
nonpartisan public awareness campaign dedicated to drafting more
female candidates for top elected positions. ``Women are fed up
with the political process ... and when women get upset, women
(candidates) are more likely to be the victims than men.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said that, because elected female officials like Boxer
are still relatively few in number, they are ``held to a higher
standard'' by voters _ and, unlike male candidates who are seen as
vigorous advocates, women are often seen as ``shrill and pushy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me at every level,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   But some political insiders say that female voters, who have
often put strong emphasis on gender in both issues and candidates,
are now considering a wider palette.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that we use (abortion) as a litmus test is an insult,
quite frankly,'' said Bobbie Lungren _ wife of the Republican
candidate _ who is traveling statewide to speak to women's groups.
``We do women a disservice when they say we're a one-issue group.''
</P>
<P>
   While noting that her husband is against abortion, Lungren said
that female voters will choose their candidate based on critical
issues like public safety, education and job creation.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason, said Sharon Davis, wife of Gray Davis and an
activist in groups like the National Women's Political Caucus, that
Democrats are emphasizing women in this year's get-out-the-vote
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their vote will be very important to us,'' she said, noting
that polls show that her husband is considered the stronger
candidate not only for voters favoring a pro-choice stance but also
on the issues most important to female voters _ education, health
care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the findings of other surveys, Democratic pollster
Paul Maslin, who works for Davis, said his research indicates that,
while this year may not be a replay of the ``Year of the Woman,''
``the gender gap is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he insisted, female voters are ``having a big impact.
They have been our prime target, and it's paid off,'' said Maslin.
``The vast majority of the progress we've made is with women voters
... and I don't see (Republicans) making inroads there.''

NAMING PLACES AFTER OTHER PLACES IS A BAD IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, Vt. _ I was born in Woodstock, but not this one. This
is the Woodstock after which my Woodstock in Illinois was named. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Notice: No ``Who cares?'' comments will be tolerated.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure why anyone thought it was a good idea to change the
name of my hometown from Centerville _ a perfectly serviceable and
geographically descriptive name _ to Woodstock. But I now regret
that it was done. And I think there may be a good lesson here about
the dangers of naming one thing after another. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the two places or persons sharing the same
name almost never bear anything but the faintest resemblance to
each other. And yet people are always comparing them. It's
ridiculous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when I grew up in Woodstock, Ill., barely a week
ever went by without someone describing how settlers from
Woodstock, Vt., came to Centerville and got its name changed to
Woodstock because, like its Vermont counterpart, Woodstock, Ill.,
has a central business district built around a park. We called the
whole thing The Square, there being four equally long streets on
each side of a park, complete with bandstand and war monument. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clear understanding was that if locals ever ventured east to
Woodstock, Vt., they would discover a square green park downtown
surrounded by businesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's simply not true. The green here is no square part at
all but, rather, an oblong stretch that seems for all the world to
be at one end of downtown, not smack in the middle. And the
business district isn't a square here anyway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock, Ill., square is, in fact, so vastly superior to
the Woodstock, Vt., green that the wonder is the Vermont Woodstock
didn't simply empty out 150 or so years ago as pioneers got abroad
their moose-drawn Conestoga wagons and headed west to Illinois. (I
suppose it explains the scarcity of moose in northern Illinois even
to this day.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For reasons I'll never grasp, there must have been folks here
who were so used to the stretchy-shaped green that they believed
they actually preferred it to the much more sensible Square of my
home town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty more about Woodstock, Vt., that doesn't resemble
Woodstock, Ill., including a nearby and pretty nice hill called
Mount Tom, which in Vermont, where things are generally more dainty
and quaint than elsewhere, qualifies as a mountain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock, Ill., has nothing close to a mountain. I lived most
of my boyhood near the top of South Street hill, which was high
enough to serve as the starting point for the annual Soap Box Derby
races. But South Street hill is to a mountain what Bill Clinton is
to a celibate monk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So in 150-plus years, Woodstock, Ill., and Woodstock, Vt., have
gone their separate ways. Which is exactly what people should _ but
too often don't _ expect to happen when one place or person gets
named after another. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever known a man who has a Jr., II, III or IV stuck at
the end of his name to be the spit and image of the previous person
with that name? No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is New York anything like York or New Jersey like Jersey? Not at
all. Was ``Rocky XIV'' as good as ``Rocky''? Ha! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So let's swear off naming things after other things. Here's a
good way to remember the rule: Sequels Aren't Equals, Especially if
Preceded by Prequels. Think about that while I wander around here
in the wrong Woodstock in search of my roots _ or at least someone
who might remember a 1951 trip made here by my late father, uh,
Bill Tammeus. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Anemic Congress taking it's political ticks and
tricks to lethargic voters
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton may yet pull an education-policy rabbit out of
the empty-hat 105th Congress, but either way, the 105th will soon
and mercifully relieve us of itself, to go home and seek license
from the voters to act out again next year. It is a dismal
prospect, which voters, if the current soundings prove right, will
ratify in perhaps historically small numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Though of course it would be in the voters' interests to come
alive instead, it will be hard to berate the electorate if it takes
a dive. This has not been a Congress to entice citizens into
supposing there is any connection between politics and their actual
lives.
</P>
<P>
   With the majority exuberantly skinny-dipping in the shallow
waters of sex scandal, the 105th has shunned great themes and good
works in favor of pursuing petty grudges and doctrinal trivia.
</P>
<P>
   There was a classic moment of sorts as the gavel was descending.
The nomination of Dr. Jane E. Henney to lead the Food and Drug
Administration had been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee. Henney is a former top official of
the agency and currently heads the University of New Mexico Medical
Center. She has broad support from medical associations and from
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Henney's nomination seemed a done deal until Sen. Don Nickles,
with his usual pious clowning, invoked personal privilege to block
her nomination. Nickles fears Henney might one day regulate tobacco
and let Americans have access to the RU-486 abortion pill Europeans
have used for years. That is, she may not practice politically
correct right-wing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the GOP leadership happily indulges even
unilateral showboating for the tobacco and anti-abortion lobbies.
This has been a Congress atwitch with such political ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has denied the nation able ambassadors
by killing nominations over ancient political tiffs. One appointee
has been barred just because he is homosexual, although Luxembourg,
his intended posting, has said it couldn't care less. Judicial
nominees have been backlogged by senators who suspect legal
radicalism lurking in self-evident and proven moderates. A
potential surgeon general was denied for his support of sex
education and contraception. (What year is it?)
</P>
<P>
   And so on. And in the course, Congress _ bee-busy picking
personal and ideological nits _ shunned proffers to contain tobacco
use, clean up toxic campaign funding, stop HMO abuses and square
Social Security away for the future. It is the hope of Republican
leadership, these days arch conservative, to build at the polls
this fall, with partisan activists on alert and middle ground
voters opting out, a new Congress that won't even think about such
things.
</P>
<P>
   Politics can matter for the better, as when, in a rare spot of
functioning bipartisanship, Congress and White House in 1996
overhauled welfare, set up a balanced budget, updated
telecommunications law, increased the minimum wage. But politics
can matter by omission, too, to which the last two years stand in
dour witness.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, politics counts. Your choice.

 &HT;    NEW GENDER GAP EMERGING IN TECH EDUCATION, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Wednesday, Oct. 14.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Technology has become the new ``boys' club'' in
America's public schools, says a study that recommends renewed
efforts to provide girls with an equal education.
</P>
<P>
   The study released Wednesday, a sequel to the landmark 1992
report ``How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' noted that gaps in math
and science achievement have narrowed for girls in the past six
years, only to be replaced by an emerging gap in the use of
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 29 percent of boys took computer science
courses in 1994, compared to 24 percent of girls. More
significantly, the boys were more likely to learn computer
applications while the girls were concentrated in data entry
courses _ ``the 1990s version of typing,'' said Janice Weinman,
executive director of the American Association of University Women
(AAUW).
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is now the new boys' club in our nation's public
schools,'' added Weinman, whose organization's educational
foundation commissioned both the new study, ``Gender Gaps: Where
Schools Still Fail Our Children,'' and the 1992 report.
</P>
<P>
   With school districts having invested millions of dollars in
wiring schools for computer technology since 1992, ``a discouraging
new gap is emerging,'' threatening to make women ``bystanders in
the technological 21st century,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do girls make up a smaller percentage of students in
computer science courses, but they also use computers less often
outside of school, it said. And they encounter fewer powerful,
active female role models in computer games and software, it added.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended more research to develop technology
programs that are ``challenging and equitable and ... encourage
both girls and boys to see themselves as imaginative and
collaborative 'power users' of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended that schools do more to encourage girls to
take science and math courses, even to the point of making some of
them mandatory for all students.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found evidence that school-to-work programs,
launched by some school districts since 1992 to give students a
taste of ``real world'' careers, have had ``limited success'' in
steering girls into non-traditionally female occupations. Such
career preparation programs ``often fail to live up to their
promise,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the new report found that girls have made
significant progress in academic achievement since 1992 and
``probably receive a fairer education today than in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some significant strides in leveling the learning
and playing fields for girls,'' said Maggie Ford, president of the
AAUW Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the gender gap in physics has narrowed
dramatically. In 1990, 27 percent of boys took physics, compared to
17 percent of girls. In 1994, it was 28 percent of boys and 22
percent of girls.
</P>
<P>
   But while girls outnumber boys in most advanced placement
classes, especially in English and foreign languages, they continue
to trail in such courses as chemistry and calculus, major
predictors of success in college.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the profound demographic changes under way in the
country, the report also alerted policy-makers to the prospect of
more pronounced gaps in the future based on racial, ethnic,
economic and regional differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic population, projected to reach 59 million by 2030,
poses a special dilemma because of its unusually high dropout rate,
which has hovered at about 30 percent. Although Hispanics value
education, the report noted, they value family even more and are
willing to forgo an education in order to help their family
economically.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended government efforts to discourage Hispanic
girls from dropping out of school. ``It is crucial that girls in
this population receive an education that doesn't limit them to
unskilled, subsistence and seasonal or contingent jobs,'' it said.

 &HT;    ``Forty makes me need a nap,'' Stone jokes. ``No, I think it's
wonderful. I really like it. It's the best time so far. It's nice
to be done being a girl.
 &HT;    ``I feel like I've had several incarnations,'' she says. ``When
I see photos of myself, I see three separate women: one up to
`Basic Instinct,' one from `Basic Instinct' up to a year ago and
the one I am now.
 &HT;    ``I think I look so different. I look smaller, more vulnerable
and more fragile, but also more pure.''
 &HT;    Could it be that marriage _ earlier this year, to San Francisco
Chronicle publisher Phil Bronstein _ suits her well?
 &HT;    ``It's a chicken-and-egg thing,'' she says during a freewheeling
conversation at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. ``I took a
year off, and I spent that year with my family and friends. I spent
time with myself to see how I really felt about my life.
 &HT;    ``I probably wouldn't have met Phil if I hadn't taken the time
off,'' she adds, ``and now Phil is a big part of the changes in
me.''
 &HT;    That change is visible onscreen as well. In her latest film,
``The Mighty,'' Stone drastically dims her starpower to play a
supporting role as Gwen Dillon, the concerned, working-class mother
of a brilliant but physically challenged teen son named Kevin
(Kieran Culkin).
 &HT;    Kevin and fellow outcast Maxwell (Elden Henson), a huge kid
who's mentally slow and emotionally troubled by a dark past, become
pals and form a symbiotic relationship: Kevin's got the brains and
the sharp tongue, while Maxwell provides the brawn.
 &HT;    Even as they deal with reality _ pressures at school, assorted
bullies and disturbing family issues _ the boys enjoy flights of
fancy during which they pretend that they're noble knights saving
damsels in distress and vanquishing evildoers.
 &HT;    ``There was no way this movie was going to get made unless
somebody attached themselves to it,'' says Stone, whose company,
Chaos Productions, executive-produced the film.
 &HT;    Part of Stone's interest in the film, which opens in limited
release on Oct. 16, then around the country a week later, stemmed
from her own formative years growing up in Meadville, Pa.
 &HT;    ``When I was in elementary school I skipped a grade,'' she
recalls. ``They did a Mensa program at my school, where they took
some of us and we had class in the cafeteria for half the day,
separate from everybody else.
 &HT;    ``That made us all geeks, of course,'' she says. ``When I was in
high school, I went half a day to college and half a day to high
school. So once again I was separated out.''
 &HT;    And, like Kevin and Maxwell, Stone endured the taunts of her
peers.
 &HT;    ``Kids are vicious about everything,'' Stone says with an edge
to her voice. ``Kids are vicious about `You're tall,' `You're fat,'
`You're short.' They can be really awful.
 &HT;    ``That's what I think is so special about `The Mighty,''' she
adds. ``It respects kids and it respects their intelligence, their
wisdom and depth.
 &HT;    ``I'm not at all against the goofball teen movies. I just don't
think that's enough nurturing for the spirit of a teen-ager.''
 &HT;    Dressed down in a baggy gray sweater, with hardly any makeup on,
Stone is nonetheless a stunner, every inch the movie star next
door. The presence of a burly bodyguard and a hovering personal
publicist only heightens the effect.
 &HT;    Stone does not, however, look 40. It's laughable that Warner
Bros. deemed her too old to star opposite Mel Gibson in
``Conspiracy Theory'' (1997).
 &HT;    The studio instead opted for Julia Roberts, then 30 years old,
and ``Conspiracy Theory'' went on to a modest-at-best theatrical
run.
 &HT;    ``My thought is that Mel got what he deserved,'' Stone says in a
venomous tone, a sly smile hardly concealing her disgust.
 &HT;    It's a characteristic reaction from an actress who has used her
stardom as a license to speak her mind, even when it may ruffle
feathers in the power offices of Hollywood. In fact, especially
when it may ruffle those feathers.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I don't give a sh-t,'' she says offhandedly, her blue eyes
open wide. ``There are a lot of people in the business that I like
and respect, but I never believe at the end of the day that they'll
be there if I have a problem.
 &HT;    ``There are a couple of people I've met through the business who
are my real friends now,'' she adds. ``But the people who are
producing a movie I'm on ... no. After they call `Wrap,' they don't
give a sh-t.
 &HT;    ``It's OK with me now,'' the actress hastens to add. ``I can
have a congenial, wonderful, fun, exciting time with these people
at work. I made a decision that I'm going to go to work and I'm
going to love the people I work with.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I won't like them all, but I'll love them. That makes it
easier.''
 &HT;    As soon as Stone completes her promotional duties for ``The
Mighty,'' she'll hightail it back to the San Francisco apartment
she shares with her husband. She'll also continue her fund-raising
efforts on behalf of charitable causes, most notably AMFAR, the
American Foundation for AIDS Research.
 &HT;    And turning 40 hasn't slowed her career down any. This is a busy
year for Stone, whose film ``Sphere'' opened _ and quickly closed _
in January. She also is currently on screen, or at least on the
soundtrack, in the animated release ``Antz.'' The actress, who
provides the voice of Princess Bala, calls the film ``really
charming and funny and cute.''
 &HT;    Stone will next turn up in director Sidney Lumet's
long-completed remake of John Cassavetes' 1980 drama, ``Gloria.''
The film, in which Stone plays the gun-moll role originally essayed
by ``Mighty'' co-star Gena Rowlands, should be released in early
1999.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Stone is reading scripts, relaxing with her
husband and pondering her future. She wants her next role to be
exactly right, one that meshes with her third-time's-the-charm
post-40 identity.
 &HT;    In other words, no ``Basic Instinct 2.''
 &HT;    ``I turned it down,'' she says of a recent offer to reprise her
role as ``Instinct's'' mantrap bisexual murderess. ``I don't
believe it's timely, but the people who want to make it obviously
think it is.
 &HT;    ``The conquest of that character just doesn't thrill me now.''

BRYAN ADAMS, SINGING FOR AN AUDIENCE OF ONE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of singer Bryan Adams. 
 By BONNIE SIEGLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If you think Bryan Adams is going to pander, if you expect his
work to be user-friendly, if you want him to take your expectations
into account ... forget it.
 &HT;    This, after all, is a guy who wanted to call his second album,
``Bryan Adams Hasn't Heard of You Either.''
 &HT;    And surely Adams has earned some slack. He got his first record
contract at age 18, and that second album _ retitled, at the record
company's insistence, ``You Want It _ You Got It'' _ set him on the
road to fame. ``Cuts Like a Knife'' (1983) was his breakthrough
album, spawning the top-10 single ``Straight From The Heart.''
 &HT;    Since then he was won awards in Japan, Australia, Austria and
Ireland _ ``I think I have a little following everywhere,'' he says
_ to go along with a shelf of American Grammys and Canadian Junos.
His name is listed in ``The Guinness World Book of Records'' for
the longest-standing No. 1 single in British music, 16 weeks for
``Everything I Do, I Do It For You.''
 &HT;    Not that he's counting.
 &HT;    ``I could care less how any of my music is received,'' Adams
says. ``I don't care what people think of my music. I mean, this is
my 10th album. If I was going to worry about what people thought of
me, it's kind of late in the game for that.
 &HT;    ``I'm not much bothered by appealing to a certain age group or
record-buying public,'' he adds. ``I don't think anybody can really
gear their music toward any age bracket. That's ridiculous. I
really make music for myself.''
 &HT;    So, to judge by the title tune from his latest album, ``On A Day
Like Today,'' Adams is feeling upbeat, with a cheerier, less-gritty
tone to his voice than usual.
 &HT;    ``I think it's the kind of mood I'm in right now,'' the
38-year-old singer says, munching on some potato chips ``for
nutrition.'' ``I had no premeditated plans with this song _ it's
just what came out.
 &HT;    ``The whole theme of the album is about breaking out a little
bit,'' he continues. ``In fact, there's a single called `Get Away'
_ getting away from ho-hum, everyday life. A lot of coming to terms
with daily banter in this album. I think this one has some of my
best work on it.''
 &HT;    That far, at least, the album reflects its creator.
 &HT;    ``I just like the idea of not being constricted,'' Adams says.
``I like the idea of being a bit of a free bird and free spirit.
Most of my family are very free-spirited people, so I think the
theme works for me.''
 &HT;    That joy in freedom is a natural result of the singer's roving
youth. His father was a member of the Canadian foreign service, and
the family moved regularly.
 &HT;    ``I lived in Israel for a year,'' he recalls. ``At an early age,
I was introduced to the drug scene, to war, to influences you never
forget. Those early years kind of formed my spirit.''
 &HT;    One thing was constant, though: He got kicked out of school
everywhere in the world, he says, for offenses ranging from lobbing
a soccer ball through the headmaster's window to skipping class.
 &HT;    ``I was completely incorrigible,'' he admits with a laugh. ``If
I liked the teacher, I'd go to class. I'm the same way today. If I
get the feeling that someone doesn't give a sh-t, then I'm just not
interested.''
 &HT;    Adams dropped out of school in the 12th grade and got his first
full-time job, as a dishwasher.
 &HT;    ``That was a big milestone in my life,'' he says. ``It just
showed me how much I hated working in a kitchen, so I wanted to get
out of that.''
 &HT;    He stuck with it for a year, however, until he'd saved $1,000 to
buy his first guitar, a Fender Stratocaster.
 &HT;    ``I still have that guitar today,'' he says, ``and won't ever
give it away.''
 &HT;    Despite the fact that his father, a former opera singer,
considered rock-'n'-roll the worst noise in the world, Adams
decided to take a shot at a musical career. But, though he's sold
more than 55 million albums worldwide, he insists that he never
lusted after wealth or fame.
 &HT;    ``I think what really drives me is the idea of writing songs,''
he says. ``It takes me a long time to get things together.
Normally, my track record for putting out albums is pretty slow.''
 &HT;    Adams hasn't always been a critical darling. His last couple of
albums _ ``I Do It For You'' and ``Have You Ever Really Loved A
Woman'' _ have caused some reviewers to say he's lost his edge.
 &HT;    ``Let them,'' he says. ``I don't really strive for global
success. I just get on with making the records, and if one catches
the ear of somebody and goes the distance, then it's great.''
 &HT;    He's contributed to the soundtracks of two films _ ``Robin Hood:
Prince of Thieves'' (1991) and ``Don Juan DeMarco'' (1995) _ and
says he'd like to do more.
 &HT;    ``I really like writing for film,'' he says, ``so I'll probably
do more of that in the future.''
 &HT;    Indeed, he's already written a song titled ``Cloud 9'' for
``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' a romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant that's
due out on Valentine's Day.
 &HT;    Adams denies any interest in politics, but has long donated
time, effort and money to various causes. Recently, he joined Eric
Clapton, Mark Knopfler and other singers for a compilation album,
``Man To Woman,'' which promotes breast-cancer awareness.
 &HT;    ``Men of note sing for a good cause,'' he says. ``I've done
things for good causes before.''
 &HT;    That doesn't always mean singing, either. Adams shares the
screen in his video for ``On A Day Like Today'' with a big, gray
elephant, a nod to his involvement with the Tennessee-based
Elephant Sanctuary.
 &HT;    ``I thought putting him in the video would give them some
publicity,'' he says. ``I think they can use every donation they
can get. So I guess I am an animal-rights activist in some way.
 &HT;    ``I've been a vegetarian for 10 years,'' he adds. ``Morally, I
like the idea, plus I feel so much better. After reading the book
`Fit For Life,' it changed my philosophy toward life and food.''
 &HT;    His involvement in charity work _ he's also done work for
Amnesty International, Save the Whales and, during the days of
apartheid, a concert in support of the then-jailed South African
leader Nelson Mandela _ is all part of Adams' quest to find
balance.
 &HT;    ``Practicality doesn't drive my life,'' the singer says. ``It's
more discipline that keeps me going. I think I'm a very disciplined
person, and a goal-oriented one, too. I like to challenge myself
and get things done. If I say I'm going to put an album out this
year, then I'll move a mountain to get it done.''
 &HT;    In this case, he's skipping the traditional tour to promote the
album. Time in the studio is more important to him right now than
commercial pragmatism.
 &HT;    ``I'm just going to sit this one out until I see what the record
does,'' he says. ``I'm actually starting to record another album,
and I don't want to stoke up the fire just to have it rained on.''

<P>
   GLOBAL-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ At the crisis-wracked annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank _
the institutions built 53 years ago to create global stability out
of the wreckage of World War II _ the 21st century village was
termed the ``new international financial architecture.'' President
Clinton insisted said it would be designed ``to tame the pattern of
boom-bust on an international scale.'' Unfortunately, the
groundbreaking ceremony is years away. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the House votes to
impeach Clinton, the matter goes to the Senate, which must decide,
by a two-thirds majority, whether to convict him and, thus remove
him from office. So the Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new
order of disruptive force into the Senate contests. Voters, even
those who support Clinton, expect their political leaders,
Republican or Democratic, to renounce Clinton's behavior and
morals, and candidates have been doing that. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCE-MERGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ As banks, brokerage firms and
insurance companies combine into huge new conglomerates, and with
legislation wending through Congress to make such mergers even
easier, there is increasing concern about the amount of personal
financial and medical data that can be collected under one roof. By
Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ The world watched tens of thousands of
Communists and their allies march on the Kremlin last week,
demanding the removal of Boris Yeltsin and his lackeys, and a
telegenic protest it was. What it wasn't was a good gauge of
Russian discontent. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLTALK-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Monica Lewinsky poured her
heart out to Linda Tripp, she was clearly looking for girl talk.
Girl talk runs deep. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   HALLOWEEN-LEWINSKY-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's not easy being Monica
_ even for one night. The nation's major mask makers have taken a
pass on Monica Lewinsky masks this Halloween, worried about
possible lawsuits over the use of her likeness. So revelers will
have to improvise with wigs and berets, and many plan to do so.
Party stores and costume makers report that this season's
best-selling spooking gear is all about Ms. Lewinsky, President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Linda Tripp and even Kenneth
Starr. By Mike Allen.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REVIEW (Shanghai) _ So many of China's neighbors in Asia
are mired in financial wreckage that economists and international
traders fear that China may be the last and heftiest domino getting
ready to fall. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   BIZTALK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Wall Street loves jargon, which makes
its business sound mysterious and important and serves as a sort of
secret handshake. By Leslie Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   GEOPOLITICAL-CORRECTNESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ If there is a
worldwide canard about political correctness, it is that it's an
American disease. Geopolitically speaking, though, that is wildly
incorrect. Every country has its own strain. By Donald G. McNeil
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-SEXISM-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ A first-person look at
sexist attitudes toward women in South Africa, where sexism may be
even more pervasive than official racism once was. Remarks by
President Nelson Mandela suggest he is no exception. By Suzanne
Daley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Partisan rancor is not
always so bad for the national soul. The Founding Fathers accepted
its inevitability, and it has always had a role in U.S. history. By

 &HT;    NEW GENDER GAP EMERGING IN TECH EDUCATION, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Wednesday, Oct. 14.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Technology has become the new ``boys' club'' in
America's public schools, says a study that recommends renewed
efforts to provide girls with an equal education.
</P>
<P>
   The study released Wednesday, a sequel to the landmark 1992
report ``How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' noted that gaps in math
and science achievement have narrowed for girls in the past six
years, only to be replaced by an emerging gap in the use of
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 29 percent of boys took computer science
courses in 1994, compared to 24 percent of girls. More
significantly, the boys were more likely to learn computer
applications while the girls were concentrated in data entry
courses _ ``the 1990s version of typing,'' said Janice Weinman,
executive director of the American Association of University Women
(AAUW).
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is now the new boys' club in our nation's public
schools,'' added Weinman, whose organization's educational
foundation commissioned both the new study, ``Gender Gaps: Where
Schools Still Fail Our Children,'' and the 1992 report.
</P>
<P>
   With school districts having invested millions of dollars in
wiring schools for computer technology since 1992, ``a discouraging
new gap is emerging,'' threatening to make women ``bystanders in
the technological 21st century,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do girls make up a smaller percentage of students in
computer science courses, but they also use computers less often
outside of school, it said. And they encounter fewer powerful,
active female role models in computer games and software, it added.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended more research to develop technology
programs that are ``challenging and equitable and ... encourage
both girls and boys to see themselves as imaginative and
collaborative 'power users' of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended that schools do more to encourage girls to
take science and math courses, even to the point of making some of
them mandatory for all students.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found evidence that school-to-work programs,
launched by some school districts since 1992 to give students a
taste of ``real world'' careers, have had ``limited success'' in
steering girls into non-traditionally female occupations. Such
career preparation programs ``often fail to live up to their
promise,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the new report found that girls have made
significant progress in academic achievement since 1992 and
``probably receive a fairer education today than in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some significant strides in leveling the learning
and playing fields for girls,'' said Maggie Ford, president of the
AAUW Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the gender gap in physics has narrowed
dramatically. In 1990, 27 percent of boys took physics, compared to
17 percent of girls. In 1994, it was 28 percent of boys and 22
percent of girls.
</P>
<P>
   But while girls outnumber boys in most advanced placement
classes, especially in English and foreign languages, they continue
to trail in such courses as chemistry and calculus, major
predictors of success in college.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the profound demographic changes under way in the
country, the report also alerted policy-makers to the prospect of
more pronounced gaps in the future based on racial, ethnic,
economic and regional differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic population, projected to reach 59 million by 2030,
poses a special dilemma because of its unusually high dropout rate,
which has hovered at about 30 percent. Although Hispanics value
education, the report noted, they value family even more and are
willing to forgo an education in order to help their family
economically.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended government efforts to discourage Hispanic
girls from dropping out of school. ``It is crucial that girls in
this population receive an education that doesn't limit them to
unskilled, subsistence and seasonal or contingent jobs,'' it said.

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Some queens are born, some are made and some ... well, some
thrust queenliness upon themselves.
 &HT;    Take Dana Owens, a young girl who grew up in a family of police
officers in middle-class Irvington, N.J., in the 1960s. She didn't
necessarily envision herself as a future rap diva, she just wanted
a new name.
 &HT;    ``It was a custom for kids in my Jersey neighborhood to take on
a new name,'' she says. ``For some reason, we were never satisfied
with what our parents gave us.''
 &HT;    Leafing through a Muslim book of names, the 8-year-old Dana
stumbled onto the name ``Latifah.''
 &HT;    ``The description said `delicate and sensitive on the inside,'''
says the notoriously tough-as-nails Queen Latifah. ``That's me.''
 &HT;    As for ``Queen,'' she says, that was easier.
 &HT;    ``You might have noticed that I'm African-American,'' she says.
``I also wanted to be a rapper. I chose the Queen part because I
didn't want to be MC Latifah.''
 &HT;    As it turns out, Latifah has a realm wider than many queens have
boasted.
 &HT;    For example, there's her new film, ``Living Out Loud,'' opening
Oct. 23. She plays a sultry jazz singer who counsels a recently
divorced Holly Hunter. Latifah also appears in ``The Bone
Collector,'' a Denzel Washington thriller due next year.
 &HT;    On the music front, she recently released a rap CD called
``Order in the Court,'' and an album of jazz standards from
``Living Out Loud'' will follow.
 &HT;    As if that weren't enough, she's working on an autobiography
that will be released in 1999.
 &HT;    All this, in what Latifah calls a transition period.
 &HT;    ``I'm kind of figuring out what I'm going to do over the next
five years,'' she explains. ``The only thing I know for sure is
that I want to make a lot more movies. I mean good movies. I could
make movies until the day I die.
 &HT;    ``But let me add that I'm not removing myself from music,'' she
says. ``That's never going to happen.''
 &HT;    ``Living Out Loud'' casts the rap queen as a jazz singer, which
Latifah says wasn't so hard a gap to bridge.
 &HT;    ``People say, `Oh, it's such a stretch,''' she says, ``but not
necessarily. I've always been a person who knew about all kinds of
music growing up, so jazz wasn't really that new to me. I remember
my father played jazz records when I was a little girl.''
 &HT;    Latifah had no trouble identifying with the film's theme of
loneliness. Her brother, who was a police officer, died in a 1992
motorcycle accident.
 &HT;    ``It was the worst time in my life,'' she recalls, ``because I
was lonely and lost. To be lonely is one thing. Then to feel lost
is like, `Oh, God, where the hell do I go from here?'''
 &HT;    She smiles sadly.
 &HT;    ``The road back is the most fun part,'' she says, ``because
there is a path that you find to save yourself. It's the road to
healing. When you find it, it's like a light that just shines on
you.
 &HT;    ``I found it on the day when I said, `I'm tired of being unhappy
and being alone and being afraid.'''
 &HT;    Time, patience and prayer turned her life around, Latifah says.
 &HT;    ``I had to remember who I am and how it used to be,'' she says.
``I had to remember how strong and outgoing and fearless I was. I
started saying, `Damn, this sad person is not who I really am! Who
is this new person who is so lost? How can we get rid of this
person?'
 &HT;    ``And I had to just recognize certain things and traits that
could put me back in the same situation,'' she concludes. ``Once
you get through some of that, you start to find your way back.''
 &HT;    There were roadblocks, however. Two years ago, her BMW was
stolen at gunpoint in Harlem, in front of a Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Latifah's friend Shawn Moon was shot in the stomach, and nearly
died in her arms.
 &HT;    ``When Shawn got shot, he was trying so hard to stay alive,''
she recalls. ``I knew I had to take control. I didn't wait for an
ambulance. I hailed a car to get him to the hospital quickly. In
that car, breathing was the big issue for him. I had to talk him
out of giving up.''
 &HT;    The source of her strength, Latifah says, has always been her
police-officer father.
 &HT;    ``He told my brother and I that basically we could do
anything,'' she says. ``My father was a Vietnam vet and police
officer. He was very handsome, and my mother was very beautiful. I
think I got my strength from them, because on a daily basis I would
say, `Look at my parents.''
 &HT;    Very young, her talent as a performer became evident.
 &HT;    ``I grew up in a house full of hams,'' she recalls. ``I would
just watch TV and imitate accents. I was this weird kid who would
speak Jamaican one day and Spanish the next.
 &HT;    ``I would imitate commercials and walk around going, `Hi, I'm
Ruta Lenska.' Remember that old commercial? My aunts would always
wake me up when I was sleeping and go, `We're so sorry, but Dana,
come here, girl, and do the Ruta Lenska commercial.'''
 &HT;    At 17, Latifah decided to take her shot at music.
 &HT;    ``I said, `If I can make it happen within a year, I'll stick
with it,''' she says.
 &HT;    It happened. Her debut album, ``All Hail the Queen'' (1989),
sold more than a million copies and was nominated for a Grammy
Award. ``Black Reign'' (1994), which won a Grammy, made her the
first female solo rap artist to achieve gold-record status.
 &HT;    The next year, Latifah branched out, founding Flavor Unit
Records, which now represents rap artists such as LL Cool J,
Outkast and N.E.X.T.
 &HT;    Still itching for new worlds to conquer, the rapper won critical
acclaim as a lesbian bank robber in ``Set It Off'' (1996). Since
then, she has also appeared in ``Hoodlum'' (1997), ``Sphere''
(1998) and the television series ``Living Single.''
 &HT;    She doesn't discourage comparisons with Will Smith.
 &HT;    ``Will was actually one of the reasons I did the TV show,'' she
recalls, laughing. ``My partner was in the hallway watching `The
Fresh Prince' on TV, and she was like, `Damn, if Will Smith can do
this TV show, maybe we can get a show.'''
 &HT;    These days, though, television takes a back seat to movies.
 &HT;    ``The problem is that there are a few black actresses in my age
group,'' Latifah says, ``and we're always competing for the same
roles. Most of all I want people to be able to see my name on a
marquee of a film or on a poster and know that movie is good just
because my name is on it.''
 &HT;    To Latifah, this is the secret of her legendary toughness.
 &HT;    ``I would like them to say that Queen Latifah tried to fight the
good fight the whole way,'' she says. ``And that I stayed in touch
with who I was. I didn't sell out, I didn't lose myself. I didn't
become someone else just for money or just for a career or any of
that stuff. I stayed me. I learned. I grew.''
 &HT;    So just how tough is she?
 &HT;    ``I am tender _ I think people know it,'' Latifah says. ``My
fans don't think I'm too tough. That is the downside.
 &HT;    ``A few guys have tried to feel my butt in clubs and have
realized that I'm a little tougher than what they thought,'' she
says, laughing. ``I just grab their hands, give them a look and
say, `Honey, we don't go there.'''

THE NOT-SO-SECRET LIFE OF PETER GALLAGHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of Peter Gallagher with Mitch Rouse and Brad
Whitford in a scene from ``The Secret Lives of Men.'' 
 By STEPHEN COLE  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Gallagher has a 16 handicap in golf and a sex handicap in
acting.
</P>
<P>
   So far in his career, which first broke the surface in ``Sex,
Lies and Videotape'' (1989), the dimpled, blue-eyed actor has
specialized in playing handsome, fallible heroes _ the leaky
dreamboats who always drag the girl down with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've played a lot of callow, insensitive types,'' the
40ish actor concedes, relaxing on a stool in a bar in Pasadena,
Calif., minutes after doing a press conference for his new ABC
sitcom, ``The Secret Lives of Men.'' Hanging around the edges are
his co-stars in the series, Mitch Rouse and Brad Whitford.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sex and Lies' gave me visibility,'' Gallagher says, swigging
from a glass of ginger ale, ``and perhaps an industry pigeonhole.
But, you know, the parts I've taken, I'd like to think they're
about good writing and not about image.''
</P>
<P>
   Those parts have included roles in ``While You Were Sleeping''
(1995) and Robert Altman's ``The Player'' (1992) and ``Short Cuts''
(1993), but he admits that he agreed to play a divorced,
golf-with-the-boys-on-Saturday regular guy in a television sitcom
in a conscious attempt to lighten his movie image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can get trapped playing certain kinds of roles,
and the idea of playing comedy _ good comedy _ has always appealed
to me,'' says the native of Armonk, N.Y., who was trained in the
classics and performed on Broadway in such shows as ``A Doll's
Life'' and ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of doing a TV sitcom didn't bother me at all,'' he
says. ``If you're committed as an actor to look for good writing,
and the best writing you've encountered in a long time is a sitcom,
you do it without thinking twice.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude led the married, bicoastal father of two to sign
on for a comedy that ABC liked so much that it added the show to
its Wednesday lineup _ one of its biggest nights of the week _
alongside proven hits ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' and ``The Drew Carey
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher is happy to have a desirable time slot, but hastens to
add that he doesn't know much about the business end of television,
and doesn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned in movies not to believe anything you hear and only
half of what you see,'' he says. ``So much is out of the actor's,
or sometimes even the director's and producer's control. One big
executive loses his job, and a project that everyone was so high on
is suddenly headed for the trash heap.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gallagher says he's content playing Michael, an
honorable businessman and dad who suddenly finds himself in the
unpleasant business of divorce, with only the golf-buddy
friendships of fellow divorcees Phil (Whitford) and Andy (Rouse) to
keep him sane.
</P>
<P>
   The three live in apartments in Manhattan. Their wives got the
kids, the houses and most of the money. Instead of enjoying
home-cooked meals, they meet almost nightly at Bocelli's, a cozy
Italian eatery where the owner, Kate (Christine Dunford), provides
their sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The setup may sound depressing, but Gallagher insists that it's
a barrel of laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most fun I've had in a long time,'' the actor
says. ``What a joy it is to come to work and literally have fun all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitford, a big-screen veteran of ``The Client'' (1994) and
``Red Corner'' (1998), agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weird thing is, you're having fun with the torment of
people's lives,'' he says. ``There's a real depth to this show.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse, best known for ``The Truth About Cats &AMP; Dogs'' (1996),
says that the show could work only as comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be too heavy,'' he says. ``It just wouldn't work if
it was a drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Gallagher whirls on his fellow actor, seething with
mock outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing?'' he demands. ``This is a drama, you
dummy!''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse does a Kramerlike shiver and slaps his hand over his
mouth, which prompts his co-stars into a fit of giggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' Gallagher says, smiling. ``Fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rewarding aspect of ``Secret Lives,'' Gallagher adds, is
the use of a golf course as a regular setting for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing golf for 10 years,'' he explains, ``and I
never appreciated until this series what a great dramatic
possibility the sport really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf absolutely, fundamentally keeps you honest,'' he says.
``It humbles you. You might think you know a person, then you play
golf with him and see how he reacts to adversity and to his own
limitations, or see how some people cheat when they're scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, golf provides a framework for the male bonding
that drives the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cliche is women talk about their problems and men
don't,'' he says. ``But whatever demons haunt you in real life come
out, barking and full-out, on the golf course. When you hit a poor
shot, you're naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Gallagher interact with Whitford and Rouse suggests
that the three, who didn't know each other before filming, have
already developed the joshing, lightning-quick rapport of old
college roomies.
</P>
<P>
   That quality, Gallagher says, is more important than being able
to master the quick verbal ping pong of a television sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm aware of the so-called `sitcom rhythm' on TV, it's
inevitably on badly written comedies where the actors do nothing
but exchange wisecracks,'' he says. ``Funny on TV should be like
being funny on stage, or in real life for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Except there's a laugh track,'' Whitford adds.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher gives him a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a laugh track,'' he says. ``Those were other
golfers behind the bushes, laughing at everything we said.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world's finance ministers and bankers argued
and strategized here last week about the most virulent outbreak of
economic turmoil in half a century, it often seemed as if they were
watching a spectacular fire, viewed from the safety of a
well-catered picnic just across the river.
</P>
<P>
   While nibbling on fresh shrimp and sushi, the leaders of the
global economy marveled at how high the flames were soaring, and
how quickly they leapt from house to house. But mostly, they talked
about what an amazing global economic village they planned to build
some day on the charred landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It will be magnificent: Big buildings equipped with
computer-controlled sprinkler systems that kick into action at the
first whiff of smoke. A protective shield will descend on nearby
structures to keep them from going up in flames, too. There will be
new safety rules: Kindly leave your combustible hedge funds, your
insolvent banks, and your crony capitalists at the door.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that was missing was a plan for putting the fire
out.
</P>
<P>
   At the crisis-wracked annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank _ the institutions created 53
years ago to assure global stability after World War II _ the
21st-century village was termed the ``new international financial
architecture.'' President Clinton insisted it would be designed
``to tame the pattern of boom-bust on an international scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the groundbreaking ceremony is years away. And
with 20 million people in East Asia falling back into poverty this
year, the IMF cutting its estimates for world growth by more than
half, Muscovites taking to the streets and the dollar taking a
mysterious 25 percent plunge in two days, it seemed odd that the
overseers of the global economy were more comfortable talking about
how to prevent the next crisis than how to survive this one.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't exactly help when IMF managing director Michel
Camdessus tried to sound reassuring by declaring, ``We are not in
1928.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that everyone wants to talk about
long-term solutions. New financial architectures sound neat and
well-planned, a system as thoroughly modern as trading stocks on
the Internet. Unfortunately, solving the immediate crisis is far
messier _ for it involves navigating a global economic landscape no
one has mapped, complicated by political failures no one could have
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the economic problem is a classic panic: Fear has
overwhelmed greed. The Asian crisis caused investors around the
world to pull back. But Russia's economic collapse last summer
signaled that countries really can default _ and there is not much
their creditors can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, banks and investors have been unwilling to take the
normal risks that are a necessary part of keeping the world running
smoothly. Suddenly they see trouble everywhere, and they are simply
refusing to lend or invest in countries to which, only 18 months
ago, they were willing to funnel money at astoundingly low interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that money has poured out of emerging markets like
Southeast Asia and Latin America and fled to safe havens, chiefly
United States Treasury bonds. The resulting shortage of credit is
strangling economies around the world, and threatening to afflict
the American economy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve and no stranger to odd things that
happen when a herd mentality takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   The new architecture everyone is talking about is supposed to
quell this kind of flight for the exits _ first by setting up a
system of global smoke detectors that would sound whenever a
country was courting financial trouble, and then by setting up a
system of common rules so investors would know that bad debt
problems, if they arise, would be dealt with sensibly.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking is that if all nations and their biggest
corporations are required to reveal far more data to investors,
people might think twice about how much money they pour in. And
building some common legal standards for dealing with bad debts,
bankruptcies and defaults could prevent a wild stampede for the
exits as soon as a crisis breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   But creating these systems takes time. It took America and
Europe most of this century to figure out how to regulate the
markets _ and it is still a work in progress, as the near-collapse
of a giant hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, proved just a
few weeks ago. Getting nations new to market capitalism to embrace
these rules could take decades. But the crisis is now.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary times, the process of restoring confidence _ a
psychological feat as much as an economic one _ and persuading
people to put their money to work again would be hard enough. But
these days it is made even harder by something that markets and
investors hate _ political uncertainty, as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   The financial ministers here were treated to the extraordinary
experience of debating the future of the world economy face-to-face
with a president who was in the opening phase of what promises to
be a long impeachment inquiry. ``You might find that the leader of
the world's biggest economy,'' one European finance minister said,
``could spend more time figuring out ways to save the world economy
if he was not also trying to save his job.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-GLOBAL-ECON-REVIEW-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: his job.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Europe has its own distractions: a change of government in
Germany and a preoccupation with monetary union, a process that
could be undermined if a world recession sets in. Japan was here to
reassure the world _ again _ that after seven years of dithering,
it finally understands that its fast-sinking banking system is
sucking down its neighbors as well.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and he responds in a
tone of I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it. Add to this the first big
investment-house collapse in China, more anti-Chinese riots in
Indonesia, and a fraying, nuclear-equipped Russia that can't decide
whether failed capitalism is better or worse than failed communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times of uncertainty, when you have a global crisis, you
need one or two powers with the vision and the reach to act
globally,'' said Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist in Asia for
Deutsche Bank. ``And yet every day, you see evidence that everyone
is preoccupied _ either not interested, or interested and unable to
move.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some steps that many here thought would help. Clinton
repeated his call for a global movement to promote growth, chiefly
by cutting interest rates. He was talking largely about Europe, but
Germany spent the week resisting; it is traditionally preoccupied
by inflation, even though the threat to the world these days is
deflation. In private, several officials said, Clinton was fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans, the least affected so far by the chaos, remain
unconvinced that things are as bad as everyone says: The Swiss
finance minister, Kaspar Villiger, complained that the problem was
in everyone's heads, and that ``many speakers tend to overdramatize
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had another idea: Change the rules of the IMF so it can
provide aid to some fundamentally healthy countries like Brazil
BEFORE the tornado strikes, in hopes that this will lessen the
chances that investors will panic and pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the scope of Clinton's ideas left other countries
underwhelmed, and wondering whether the president, distracted and
weakened, has the power to do what he insists the United States
must do: Lead the way out of the crisis. His two speeches to the
finance ministers lacked any proposals that involved spending
American taxpayers' money, because he was still arguing with
Congress over coughing up $18 billion that the United States has
already committed to the nearly broke IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Congress and the IMF has frozen other
action. For example, Rubin is debating whether to use billions of
dollars under his control as an American contribution to a pool of
money to shore up Brazil. But Congress was outraged when that money
was tapped for Mexico in 1995 (it has since been repaid) and the
White House is in no mood to anger anyone on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States is hardly the only country where domestic
politics make it hard to turn the Titanic away from the icebergs.
Japan's opposition fears that the government will use billions of
taxpayer dollars to bail out its biggest banks, without firing the
managers who created the mess, or assuring that the shareholders
lose their investment. And the banks would rather go under slowly
than commit ritual suicide.
</P>
<P>
   With the world's second-largest economy remaining frozen, the
rest of the world is reluctant to lend the banks more money, though
there were signs last week that a logjam in the fragmented
Parliament might be breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Russians, who have told the IMF how little
they think of its economic reform plans, while a new government
prints money to pay off pensioners and the military. But Russia is
running out of real money, and a senior IMF official notes that
Russia is essentially blackmailing the West by saying that without
IMF aid, political chaos could reign.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the political battles that are compounding the
world's economic troubles are far more prosaic _ like rewriting
bankruptcy laws. Still, they offer a glimpse of why that new
international financial architecture could run into some building
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand is a good example. This year borrowers there simply
stopped paying their debts. But because Thailand has no effective
bankruptcy law, Thai companies can delay efforts to liquidate
reorganize them. Essentially, they can hold their lenders at bay
for years, while, magically, whatever value is left in their
companies gets drained away. Because their money is unrecoverable,
Thai banks have stopped lending and the world has stopped lending
to Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
   So the IMF, as part of its aid package, is requiring Thailand to
rewrite its bankruptcy laws on the Western model. But there's a
hitch: Many of the legislators are the country's most powerful
businessmen. They are resisting, complaining that foreign
businesses are snatching up Thailand at fire-sale prices. Which, of
course, is exactly what a few savvy American and European companies
are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's called capitalism, and it's a lot more fun in up markets
than in down markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who is running for
re-election, went to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other
morning to accept an award from mass-transit advocates. But the
reporters who had gathered there showed little interest in the
shiny train car at the senator's back. Instead, they repeatedly
asked him how he would vote on an impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not going to make any comment with respect to that
subject matter,'' D'Amato responded. ``I am not just a citizen. I
am a citizen-senator who may be called upon to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato is something else as well: a candidate in what may
be the tightest Senate race in the nation. And variations of his
elliptical response can be heard in Senate races around the
country, where both Republicans and Democrats are encountering
similar questions. All of which suggests that after the House voted
Thursday to authorize an impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races
for the U.S. Senate have become, beyond what they already were, the
electoral equivalent of jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes to impeach Clinton, the matter goes to the
Senate, which must decide by a two-thirds majority whether to
convict him and, thus, remove him from office. As a result, the
Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new disruptive force
into the Senate contests.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, even those who support Clinton, expect their political
leaders, Republican or Democratic, to renounce Clinton's behavior,
and candidates have been doing that. But impeachment is another
matter; most polls show the nation is against it. The danger for
Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility,
the debate may move beyond the president's behavior _ about which
there is little disagreement _ to the more problematic issue of
whether he should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the strategists involved in the races, there is
little guidance on how to handle the impeachment issue. Advisers to
candidates of both parties said in interviews last week that they
were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or should do on
the issue to gain the advantage _ or guard against harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell how this one is going to go,'' said Mike Russell,
a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.
``This is a very surreal environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 are held by Democrats and 16
by Republicans, who now hold 55 seats in all. Republicans would
have to win 28 of the 34 races to produce the 67 votes necessary
for conviction, assuming such a vote were to go along party lines.
Only an electoral catastrophe for the Democrats, which seems almost
unthinkable, could produce such a huge loss.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political
Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said that so far, at least, none
of the Senate candidates has made an explicit appeal for votes
based on how they would vote on a presidential jury. But she and
others are wondering if this may be about to change.
</P>
<P>
   This is difficult ground to measure. One of the central
questions of this political year has been how Clinton's dealings
with Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For a long time,
politicians assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a
rebuke to Clinton, just as many Republicans did in November 1974,
three months after President Richard M. Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But now some analysts wonder if the partisan fight in Congress
last week might have the opposite effect among some Democrats.
``That's the problem,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of an
independent political newsletter in Washington. ``It's not that we
don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where the general
public stands on impeachment. The problem is that we don't know
where the electorate stands on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as
they cast their ballots in a Senate race is, in the words of Stuart
Stevens, a Republican consultant, ``a double bank-shot.'' Such
strategies, he said, tend to work only with a small number of
single-minded or sophisticated voters.
</P>
<P>
   Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking is
that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race,
state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of
the candidates and the composition of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to
their advantage, it would be in states with a Democratic edge or
with sizable numbers of black voters, who overwhelmingly support
the president. In contests like those, it might well prove to be in
the interest of a Democratic candidate to, as one consultant put
it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in
which the candidate denounces the president's behavior but solemnly
pledges to vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could
prove effective. ``This is an issue where there is a huge
disconnect between the elites and the public,'' said Fred Yang, a
Democratic consultant with clients in Wisconsin and the Carolinas.
That kind of Democratic strategy might emerge in California, New
York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas. By
contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be
less likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Republican consultants are telling their
candidates to stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of
impeachment. The last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate
elections into a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House might think from the overall public numbers
that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election,''
said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who is working in Senate races
this year. ``Republicans certainly aren't going to let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-SENATE-IMPEACH-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
WASHINGTON: that happen.'' &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some hints of how things might play out could be seen last week,
and there was probably no better place to watch it than New York.
Clinton is so popular that the Democratic candidate for governor,
Peter Vallone, whose campaign is in serious trouble, released a
commercial denouncing impeachment. In the Senate race, which
features two of the nation's most politically perceptive
politicians, D'Amato sidestepped impeachment questions while his
opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer, announced that he opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato responded to questions about Clinton with the language
that Republican consultants have been suggesting to their
candidates. ``When and if that matter comes to the Senate, I will
decide on the facts that are presented to me at that time,''
D'Amato said. ``It would be very premature for me to suggest any
course of action without it being referred. Because, indeed, we may
be called upon to act as a jury of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is
conducting the impeachment investigation, virtually embraced the
issue. In a live telecast of the hearings, he said the president
deserved a lesser punishment, such as censure or reprimand. And
Schumer plans to campaign in New York on Monday with Clinton at his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seemed to suggest last
week that impeachment will grow as an issue. ``Senator D'Amato
claims he does not want to share his opinion with the people of New
York,'' Morris said. ``And if he doesn't have an opinion, he's the
only New Yorker who doesn't have an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television
commercial, Morris responded: ``We don't talk about what we're
going to do. I wouldn't rule it in and I wouldn't rule it out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The world watched tens of thousands of Communists and
their allies march on the Kremlin last week, demanding the removal
of President Boris Yeltsin and his lackeys, and a telegenic protest
it was. What it wasn't was a good gauge of Russian discontent. For
that, you had to go 5,300 miles and six time zones east, to the
Siberian city of Yakutsk.
</P>
<P>
   Yakutsk has 250,000 people, no money and more hardship than
Moscow could dream of. And there, at the appointed hour of 10 a.m.,
in the town square across from the requisite statue of Lenin,
perhaps 40 people showed up to unfurl a few red banners and stamp
their feet against the cold. By 11 the square was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in Yakutsk was far more common across Russia on
Wednesday than was the mob of marchers in that television broadcast
from Moscow. There is a lesson there. Since Russia's feral brand of
capitalism started crumbling Aug. 17, bringing down the banking
system, foreign trade, the ruble and most of a government with it,
everybody has been waiting for the moment when the population cries
``Enough!'' and takes matters into its own anarchic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it ain't going to happen _ not anytime soon, anyway.
Russia, the cradle and exporter of global revolution, turns out to
be not much of a consumer. It clings to the here-and-now with a
vengeance _ maybe out of habit, almost certainly out of fear that
stirring the pot will only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesians exploded into riots and looting under similar
economic circumstances a year ago. Russians complain, then conclude
their harangues with the national motto, ``Shto dyelat?''_ ``What
is to be done?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it is beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem, I think, is in the mentality,'' said Andrei
Gnatiuk, who heads a political consulting firm involved in election
campaigns across Russia. ``People have to understand that they're
the masters of their own fates. Socialism greatly perverted us. We
became used to being guaranteed a piece of bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Masha Lipman, an editor and political analyst in Moscow for the
weekly news magazine Itogi, agrees. In 75 years of Communist rule,
people traded freedom for an assured, if sometimes bleak,
existence. She says that smothered the democratic notion that
individuals working together can change the social order.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that history backs them up: The Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991 mostly of its own weight, not out of any
collective national action. Yeltsin enjoyed popular support at the
time, but he was a catalyst of change, not the agent.
</P>
<P>
   In neither of the succeeding crises _ not the parliament's
attempt to seize power from Yeltsin amid hyperinflation in 1993 nor
the current collapse _ have ordinary Russians been much more than
interested spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that, of course, may well be due to the quality of the
alternative. The Communist Party has never shed its reputation for
the sort of rigidity and wrongheadedness, let alone cruelty, that
contributed to the Soviet Union's downfall, and its leaders today
are uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Bolsheviks were Yeltsin's major foes in 1993 and again last
week. Many major newspapers saw the turnout on Wednesday _ less
than a third of even modest projections _ as a major setback for
the Communist Party, which had seemed on the upswing with its
return to power in key parts of Yeltsin's government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not simply the Communists. Russians have yet to swarm
to any of the strongmen seeking to fill the vacuum left by
Yeltsin's declining fortunes _ not to Moscow's authoritarian mayor,
Yuri Luzhkov, or to the former general who iron-handedly runs the
huge Krasnoyarsk region of central Russia, Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   One popular notion is that the country is exhausted _ by the
bloodletting during the civil war after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution; by the millions of deaths in World War II; by Stalin's
mass killings; by the wrenching changes that followed the end of
Communist rule in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that view, the conviction in the early 1990s that democracy
and capitalism would rescue Russia from a worse fate has more or
less been extinguished. Still, nothing has replaced it that is
attractive enough to spur people to plunge along yet another
uncharted course. The devil they know is better than the one behind
the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are angry, yes; but people are also tired,'' said
Sergei Markov, a well-known political analyst here. ``And people
are afraid of bad government much less than they're afraid of
chaos. They're prepared to have any kind of bad government more
than instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of those theories probably has some merit. Historians might
argue as well that Russia has never experienced a truly democratic
society, even now; that it was excluded from the Renaissance and
its critical links to Western political and social philosophy; that
top-down leadership, rather than bottom up, is the rule when it
comes to ruling Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may be true. But amid the general gloom over the
Russian psyche, Gnatiuk has another explanation, one that he says
is actually supported by empirical data.
</P>
<P>
   Gnatiuk says that Russians are better off than they let on, and
that they are simply not in the mood to revolt. He cites polling
data from his own consulting firm. It concludes that most Russians
believe their lives have improved in recent years, but that they
also believe the lives of their neighbors have gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   It is the media _ especially the Western media, now available
throughout Russia _ that have convinced them the nation is a lost
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always giving some sort of bad news that people
somewhere are eating dogs because of hunger, or eating cows and now
eating the feed and so forth,'' Gnatiuk said. ``Everyone thinks,
`The country will go out on the street and on strike because
everybody's living badly, but why should I go out on the street? I
have a TV and a refrigerator. I work; my parents have a pension.
But those who are doing badly will go out.'''

   1. INTERNET KILLED THE VIDEO STAR Clinton's impeachment, if and
when it comes, will not herald a crisis of Constitution but a
crisis of media. Brilliant exploitation of television may have won
this president his office, but he must blame his downfall on an
inability to resist the impact of another, new medium : the
Internet. By Douglas Rushkoff. 1,000 words. (N/A Great Britain and
Australia.) 2. CONCRETE : THE KEY TO CONSTRUCTION Concrete, both
bane and boon to the urban landscape, was perfected to an art form
by the builders of ancient Rome. But the recipe - cement, additives
and water - was lost for centuries with the fall of the empire and
only rediscovered several hundred years ago. Legions of scientists
have been fine-tuning the product ever since and today there are
scores of variations. One can carry the weight of a car on a
surface the size of a fingernail. By Dr. Erwin Lausch. From GEO
magazine. 2,300 words. (English translation available.)

FREUD UP AGAINST THE WALL Some people wanted an exhibit that said
Freud was wrong, that he was a bad person, that people should have
the moral courage to condemn him - but that's not how the new Freud
show at the Library of Congress is. Actually, it used to be that a
curator had an exhibit criticized after it opened. Now the
complaints come early and relentlessly, and shape what gets shown
and how. The Freud show is a sad case in point. By Margaret Talbot.

BARBARA KINGSOLVER AT THE BARRICADES Barbara Kingsolver's big new
book, ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' is a tragic family saga set in the
Congo just as that republic is winning independence from Belgium.
But it also has a more subversive intent : to expose America's role
in the Congo of the '60s. As she puts it, ``If I were to write a
non-fiction book about the brief blossoming and destruction of the
independence of the Congo, and what the CIA had to do with it, then
probably all 85 people who are interested in the subject could read
it.'' Instead she wrote a novel with family, culture and an exotic
locale. By Sarah Kerr. From The New York Times Magazine.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Monica Lewinsky poured her heart out to Linda Tripp, she
was clearly looking for girl talk.
</P>
<P>
   Girl talk runs deep. It begins in the sandbox, when girls are
asked which boy they want to select and boys are asked which insect
they want to dissect. Encouraged to dissect romantic possibilities,
women soon find themselves analyzing relationships to whomever will
listen. They will confide in a pet, a plant, a passing mirror, an
embittered Pentagon bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   Men are less inclined toward such revelations and also more
likely to be congratulated for making them. Compare the political
sensation of the year, with its miles of tape, to the year's
literary sensation, ``Birthday Letters,'' a slim volume written by
Ted Hughes about his dead wife, Sylvia Plath. The man kept quiet
about his feelings for 35 years, then published 88 poems _ that's
an average of 2.51 poems per year _ and the collection was hailed
as an eloquent emotional outpouring.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a depressed obsessive poet laureate is more likely to
get good reviews than a depressed obsessive intern, but the double
standards here go beyond career choice. In 1989 Hughes wrote to
Plath's biographer that he preferred the rumors fueled by his
silence to being ``goaded into vomiting up every detail of my life
with Sylvia.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, men are taught at a young age that talking about
emotional life is akin to vomiting, as Ms. Lewinsky learned when
she sought to confide in a male friend, Dennis Lytton. He changed
the subject and later said: ``It was kind of shocking. I didn't
want to get into it further.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's other publishing sensation of the year, ``Bridget
Jones' Diary'' by Helen Fielding, gives us a woman who spends five
times as much time analyzing relationships as having them. The
novel's structure mirrors that of ``Pride and Prejudice,'' in which
Darcy disappears for chapters on end while the women discuss him.
The ratio of relationship analysis to time spent with actual guy,
just in terms of pure pages, may not approach Ms. Lewinsky's but is
heartbreaking still.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not macho to yammer on about matters of love, unless
of course you're yammering about your sexual prowess. Booklist
praised Dennis Rodman for his ``unabashed honesty'' in describing
his exploits in ``Bad As I Wanna Be.'' But chatting about a woman's
sexual escapades, a woman's romantic feelings or even their own
feelings can make men squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Within their own friendships too, men may have a threshold for
just how many feelings they can stand, as Paul Theroux learned when
he kept telling his mentor V.S. Naipaul his most honest thoughts
and Naipaul stopped speaking to him. Since he could not destroy a
friendship that was already destroyed, Theroux felt liberated to
write ``Sir Vidia's Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than talking about feelings is writing them down. Claire
Bloom did, and her ex-husband, Philip Roth, retaliated by turning
her into a vindictive fictional character in his next novel. Joyce
Maynard did too, and her book shows that her relationship with J.D.
Salinger was obviously doomed. If you're as major a fan of girl
talk as Ms. Maynard is, it's not a good idea to fall in love with a
hermit.
</P>
<P>
   But girl talk is usually more private than a tell-all book. It
has secretly taken place for centuries. Shakespeare knew about girl
talk, and used female collusion as a plot device in ``All's Well
That Ends Well.'' These days the chatter continues on the phone, at
the Ritz-Carlton or over martinis in best-sellers like ``Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl talk has guidelines. You don't steal a man you hear about
during girl talk. You don't repeat secrets told during girl talk.
And you definitely don't tape it. Violating the code of women can
have disastrous results, as when Scarlett O'Hara throws herself at
her friend Melanie's husband in ``Gone With the Wind.'' Just at the
moment you realize who your real friends are, the woman who trusted
you may die a saintly death and leave behind a dull guy and a
lifetime of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, the cynical sacrifice of girl talk to scandal
politics was first perpetrated by Lynn Armandt, who snapped a
picture of her friend Donna Rice sitting on Gary Hart's lap. She
later sold her confidences and photos to People magazine. Ms. Rice
got to ruin a political career and then was offered modeling
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp's tapings constitute the ultimate betrayal of the
code of women. She was supposed to provide compassion, empathy and
dieting tips; she provided grand jury testimony. You simply don't
want to be on your deathbed or even on a runway in Milan, modeling
the latest ``Roma Outsize'' stylings, wondering if you should have
confided in a more reliable girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Immunity is nice, but it's not friendship.

<P>
   Imagine you are being treated for cancer, a fact known to your
Travelers' insurance agent from your medical tests and insurance
forms. Imagine also that you are applying for a mortgage from, say,
Citibank, where you've banked for years and which has just merged
with Travelers Group. Despite your excellent credit rating, your
mortgage is denied by Citibank for reasons that are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose you've just inherited lots of money from a relative's
life insurance policy and you put the money into your Fleet Bank
account. Pretty soon you get a call from a representative of Quick
&AMP; Reilly, a brokerage firm you have never heard of but which is
owned by Fleet. The broker is equipped with surprisingly detailed
knowledge of your financial situation _ along with a few ideas
about how to invest your windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Both situations may be hypothetical but they aren't so
far-fetched, according to a growing number of bankers, lawmakers,
banking regulators and consumer advocates worried about the
potential dark side of the mergers sweeping the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   As banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies combine into
huge new conglomerates, and with legislation before Congress to
make such mergers even easier, there is increasing concern about
the amount of personal financial and medical data that can be
collected under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this privacy debate has centered mainly on the use of
patients' medical records, especially by health maintenance
organizations. But a new twist has been added as banks have
expanded into businesses like securities and insurance sales, both
of which involve the collection of a wide range of personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Citicorp and Travelers Group completed their $50
billion merger, creating the world's largest financial services
conglomerate, with 70 million customers. The new company,
Citigroup, has access to a wealth of customer information,
including mutual fund accounts, health claims on insurance
policies, and credit card, mortgage and car loan balances. Many
consumer advocates are worried that such sensitive data can easily
be transferred from one part of the company to another and possibly
be disclosed to outside parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for banks to realize the challenge they
face in the privacy area is something new, different and more
difficult than what they've dealt with before,'' said Acting
Comptroller of the Currency Julie Williams. ``It's in their
self-interest to recognize privacy as a customer concern and deal
with it successfully or they may be subject to more restrictive
controls on the ability to use this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationsbank, which is acquiring BankAmerica Corp., has already
run into trouble with customer privacy. The company recently paid
nearly $40 million to settle a class-action suit and end a
government investigation after more than 18,000 customers, many of
them elderly, were sold complex derivative securities that were far
too risky for them. Nationsbank's brokerage arm had used the bank's
customer list to target people to approach, many of whom mistakenly
believed that the derivatives were safe and insured. As a result,
Nationsbank has imposed new limits on the use of private data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to a banker used to be like going to confession or
seeing a psychiatrist _ we thought the information was protected,''
said Edmund Mierzwinski, executive director of the U.S. Public
Interest Group, a nonprofit pro-consumer organization. ``But that's
no longer the case. These mergers are creating bigger data bases
with more power.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services companies argue that the ability to swap data
between one arm and another is a driving force behind many mergers.
Banks want to broaden their ability to ``cross-market'' credit
cards to checking deposit customers or sell stocks and bonds to
holders of car loans. But bankers say they must be careful to
balance this desire to sell new products against the need to
maintain the trust of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned,'' said Edward Yingling, executive
director for government relations at the American Bankers
Association. ``The key question is, what is the proper balance
between appropriate and valuable cross-marketing and invasions of
privacy? No one believes medical records should be used for
cross-marketing in ways that would be invasive. It's more difficult
when financial information can be used to show our customers that
other products might be very good for them. That's what everyone
has to wrestle with.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows bank customers to sign ``opt out'' forms,
preventing one part of a bank from giving personal information to
another. The Comptroller's office has found, however, that few
banks highlight this option. ``Most bank customers can't ever
recall seeing anything like this,'' Ms. Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its merger application to the Federal Reserve Board,
Citigroup made a ``Global Privacy Promise,'' which would ``provide
customers the right to prevent Citigroup from sharing customer
information with others, including affiliates, for cross-marketing
purposes.'' Customers will also be given opt-out provisions and
Travelers has pledged that it will not share the medical or health
information of its insurance customers ``for marketing purposes.''
Consumer advocates like Mierzwinski say such protections should be
a matter of law, and not established case by case.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., has been leading a push in
Congress for greater financial privacy restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hardly any safeguards out there,'' Dodd told the
Senate Banking Committee last month. ``As each year goes by, the
vulnerability of the people we represent becomes more exposed. The
longer we delay, we are exposing millions to unfair access by
people who should not have access.''

NO MONICA MASKS FOR HALLOWEEN, SO IMPROVISATION WILL BE NECESSARY

<P>
   It's not easy being Monica _ even for one night. The nation's
major mask makers have taken a pass on Monica Lewinsky this
Halloween, worried about possible lawsuits over the use of her
likeness. So revelers will have to improvise with wigs and berets,
and many plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Party stores and costume makers report that this season's
best-selling spooking gear is all about Ms. Lewinsky, President
Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Abracadabra in New York City sells Clinton masks with Pinocchio
noses (available for several years). Halloween Adventure, another
New York shop, offers masks of the Clintons with Titanic life
preservers. In Washington, Backstage Inc. got some practice for
Halloween recently when a bar held a Linda Tripp look-alike
contest. ``They bought blonde wigs and took black Magic Markers to
the roots,'' said Sandra Duraes, the manager.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Monica masks has been a disappointment to some,
but the mask companies may have been wise to steer clear. An aide
(yes, an aide) to Ms. Lewinsky said no one had asked permission to
license a Monica mask, but that if anyone did, Ms. Lewinsky would
refuse. The aide said Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers are looking for ways
to crack down on entrepreneurs who have used her picture on
cookies, T-shirts and postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the full Monica, like slipping past a Secret Service
agent, takes creativity. At Morris Costumes in Charlotte, N.C.,
clerks are cutting the red ribbons out of their Snow White wigs.
``Bada-boom, bada-bing _ you've got Monica Lewinsky,'' said C.
Ashley Coolik, an enterprising sales associate.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Inc. in New York's Flatiron District, recommends adapting
its ``Witchy Woman'' mask. Abracadabra offers a Monica wig, a beret
and a wig-beret combo. Annie's Costumes and Magic, in Plantation,
Fla., offers a blue dress. ``The big Halloween dilemma is where to
put the stain,'' said assistant manager Jerry Sturdevant. Various
``intern kits'' also are for sale. At the chain of Spirit Halloween
Superstores, the package costs $14.99 and includes a hat, a pearl
necklace and an ``intern pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Halloween fads of recent years suggest that becoming a popular
costume is a fleeting measure of infamy. Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker,
Saddam Hussein, Lorena Bobbitt and Woody Allen all were hottest
when the news about them was the worst. Thomas Campbell, the
president of Classic Distributing Co. in Audubon, N.J., pointed out
that he still hasn't been able to unload 2,000 O.J. Simpson masks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Santino, a professor of popular culture at Bowling
Green State University, said more than simple notoriety is
involved. ``It's more dangerous _ you've been made a joke,'' he
said. ``This is the people's holiday, and we delight in rubbing
their nose in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the costume business has its decorous few. Frankie Stein,
the owner of Frankie Steinz Costumes in New York, considered
offering a knit dress with a stain but decided it would be tacky.
``We were tempted, but we've seen the light,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others see a windfall. Morris Costumes president Philip
Morris predicts that Clinton will have a Nixon-like shelf-life.
``Ten Halloweens from now, we'll be selling Clinton masks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   James Bradley, the sales manager at Mask Illusions in Chula
Vista, Calif., is already thinking ahead. He has begun working on
next season, calculating that a mask of Starr will be big. ``Ken
Starr's head is shaped like a pear and he has big cheeks and a very
comical smile that he tries to put on,'' Bradley said. For
precedent, he points to the lasting appeal of President Jimmy
Carter's big teeth, and Ross Perot's floppy ears.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the real optimists are the mask dealers who said they
could console themselves about this year's shortage since by this
time next year, no one will be talking about Monica Lewinsky.

   SHANGHAI, China _ Across the river from this city's majestic
waterfront, in an area that was swampland not long ago, a gleaming
collection of skyscrapers is emerging. The most impressive,
ambitiously named the World Financial Center, is scheduled to
become the tallest building in the world when it is completed in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters hope the area, known as Pudong, will become China's
Wall Street, with investment banks and other financial institutions
alongside a stock exchange with state-of-the-art technology that
opened earlier this year. A new airport is under construction in
Pudong; so is a $1 billion General Motors plant that will make
Buick sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the ambitious plans, however, occupancy rates in
Pudong are only around 70 percent. The Shanghai real estate market
has gone bust, after years of boom, and pessimists argue that it
portends a collapse in the spectacularly fast growth that China has
enjoyed since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So many of its neighbors in Asia are mired in financial wreckage
that economists and international traders fear that China may be
the last and heftiest domino.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government-ordered closing of the Guangdong
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp., a big investment company
swamped by debt, heightened concern about the vulnerability of
China's rickety financial system, already burdened by insolvent
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chinese consumers are still spending, construction teams are
still working 24-hour shifts and planners are moving ahead with
hugely ambitious development plans. Despite all the ominous
reminders of the dangers attending the nation's wrenching shift
from a planned economy to a market economy, there is reason for
optimism that the economy will grow in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, China has escaped the worst ravages of Asia's
financial crisis because it is still so far behind the rest of the
world in its efforts to create a modern economy; with a striving
population of 1.2 billion people, it has a per capita income of
only about $350 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Its incomplete economic transition is, oddly enough, something
of a blessing now. For one thing, China's currency is not freely
traded, so speculation isn't a big problem. For another, its main
stock markets are closed to foreign investors and are thus immune
to the large-scale withdrawals of capital that have plagued other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of China's banks are run by the state, and though
they are deeply in debt, the banks face no shareholder pressure to
account for bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still way behind, so they've got a lot of easy
catching up to do,'' said Brewer Stone, head of investment banking
in Asia for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   There is vast potential for improving the efficiency of Chinese
companies, Stone said, as well as for creating new products that
Chinese consumers do not yet have.
</P>
<P>
   Citing one example, Stone pointed to a Chinese company called
Hai'er, which has built a remarkably successful refrigerator and
household appliance business stressing follow-up service. At a time
when multinational companies are scaling back their operations in
Asia, Hai'er is planning a big expansion into the personal computer
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot less bullish on China after what has happened over
the past year,'' Stone said. ``But the bottom line is that China
still has much to do in terms of productivity gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Within China, there is a debate about whether the leadership
will be able to achieve the 8 percent growth rate that they have
promised. With a restructuring of state-owned companies turning
millions of urban workers out in the streets, any serious slowdown
could have potentially disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's leaders say they are planning a $1 trillion public
works program to keep the economy growing at a time when exports to
neighboring Asian countries are falling sharply. Whether or not
they succeed, signs point to enough pent-up demand among China's
consumers to keep things humming for a while.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has made a big bet with its plant in Pudong, and
plans to start assembling sedans there later this year. Although it
is debatable how much demand there will be for an expensive luxury
car in a market where both companies and individuals have limited
spending power, overall car sales are still climbing 4 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And GM is looking for another project to invest in, expecting
the market for small cars to grow even faster than for larger
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at China as an emerging market, although maybe not
as bright as it looked two years ago, it still looks very stable,''
said Larry Zahner, president of General Motors China.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody likes to say, ``I goofed'' _ particularly when the
mistake helped cause the meltdown of stock and bond markets around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Which is part of the reason the public pronouncements about the
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and the
billion-dollar bailout of the hedge fund organized by the Federal
Reserve have been couched in language as arcane as the military
lingo in a Tom Clancy novel. (Another reason is that Wall Street
loves jargon, which makes its business sound mysterious and
important and serves as a sort of secret handshake.)
</P>
<P>
   But for readers whose cereal boxes don't come with Alan
Greenspan decoder rings, the following vocabulary builder may help
impress people at parties _ and perhaps prove handy as the
hedge-fund drama continues to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with hedge fund, which has nothing to do with
shrubs, and little to do with the kind of safety implied by, say,
hedging one's bets.
</P>
<P>
   A hedge fund, of which Long-Term Capital was a large and
prominent example, is a sort of mutual fund for the very rich and
for professional investors like pension funds and college
endowments, all of whom are supposed to be able to watch out for
themselves. That's why hedge funds are not subject to government
oversight (at least not yet). The main thing hedge funds have in
common is that the people running them get to take a chunk of any
profits the fund makes, in addition to an annual management fee;
this tends to encourage them to take big risks.
</P>
<P>
   Practically everyone who has left Wall Street in the past decade
claims to be running a hedge fund, even if they spend most of their
time practicing fly-fishing casts or watching ``The Jerry Springer
Show.'' So hedge funds come in a wide variety of sizes, from a
couple of million dollars to a billion-plus.
</P>
<P>
   But they can have an outsized influence on financial markets
because they can employ leverage, which basically means they make
their bets with borrowed money. Long-Term Capital borrowed about
$20 for every dollar investors put in, which is the kind of
behavior that ultimately sends compulsive bettors to Gamblers
Anonymous. On Wall Street, that lofty level of betting is sometimes
called nosebleed leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street makes it easier to ratchet up bets by creating
derivatives, or contracts whose value is derived from the
performance of something else. Anything else. The direction of
interest rates in Thailand. The number of rainy days in August. The
difference between the current interest rates in Thailand and the
number of rainy days in August, divided by the number of pages in
the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   While some derivatives are commonplace and publicly traded _
like the futures that let farmers lock in the price of corn long
before the crop is harvested _ many are private wagers between two
parties, like barroom bets about which frog will jump the farthest.
That's why such positions can be so hard to unwind, or squirm out
of.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital was supposed to be a market neutral hedge
fund, which means it wasn't supposed to be betting on the overall
direction of the stock or bond market. The fund's actual strategy
was a secret, even to the people who invested in the fund or loaned
it money. Its activities were also hidden from regulators, leading
to complaints that nobody knew what the fund was up to, also known
as lack of transparency.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems Long-Term Capital employed a kind of
computer-driven arbitrage, a word with a variety of meanings on
Wall Street. In this case, it seems to have meant buying stuff for
the wrong price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if toothpaste in your neighborhood usually sells
for about $4 a tube, and you find it in another store for $2, you
would snap up all you could. But you wouldn't necessarily brush
your teeth a lot more; you might sell the tubes on the street and
reap a 100 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this strategy, as Greenspan of the Federal
Reserve pointed out in his testimony to Congress earlier this month
(though not in these words), is that if enough people try to do
this toothpaste trading, either the store will raise the price or
folks on the street will stop buying your toothpaste and go to the
store instead. Either way, the chances of making a killing will
evaporate. Money being a lot easier to move than toothpaste, these
things happen in a flash in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   All this helps explain why Long-Term Capital had to move into
far-flung markets with low liquidity, meaning it's hard to buy and
sell things without pushing prices up or down sharply. Many of the
hedge fund's bets were in notoriously illiquid emerging markets,
which used to be known as Third World countries and are now called
submerging markets by Wall Street traders who have lost a bundle
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Russia may not have had much success as an evil empire, but as
an evil emerging market, it rules. After Moscow defaulted on its
debt in August, spooked investors moved their money to the safest
spot they could think of: long bonds, the 30-year securities sold
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That flight to quality reversed capital flows, so money that had
been streaming into risky markets looking for extra profit poured
instead into places where there was little risk of loss. Investors
bid up the price of Treasuries while dumping everything else, which
shorted out all those high-tech computer models Long-Term Capital
was relying on.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the fund was essentially bought by the banks and
brokerage firms that had loaned it money based mainly on the
perceived intellectual wattage of the fund's managers.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Long-Term Capital fiasco, many investors have
moved, in Greenspan's words, from irrational exuberance to fear.
</P>
<P>
   All of this thanks to what economists call an exogenous event.
Also known as a surprise.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ If there is a worldwide canard
about political correctness, it is that it's an American disease.
Geopolitically speaking, though, that is wildly incorrect. Every
country has its own strain.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese think it bad taste to talk about burakumin, social
outcasts that include leather tanners and slaughterhouse workers.
It recalls ancient prejudices, but there are lands where the
repetition of not-so-old cruelties is what evokes horror: the
mention of ``scientific racism'' in Germany, for example, or the
similar assumptions behind South Africa's ``grand apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   All these linguistic taboos have something in common: they are
meant to take the sting out of confrontations by constantly
ratcheting down the sharpness of the words used. In the United
States, this is the process by which, over decades, ``village
idiot'' ratchets down to ``slow,'' which ratchets down to
``retarded,'' then to ``challenged'' and then all the way down to
``special.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's global culture, some of this kind of thing is
happening all over. Sometimes it is simply a reflection of fashions
emanating from America. In Mexico, for instance, where it is still
common for the common man to call homosexuals ``maricones,'' a deep
insult, the politically correct will say ``gay'' (though the word
is pronounced ``guy'' and means nothing in Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, political correctness isn't just about America's
unspeakable words. It takes taboos to tangle, and taboos tend to be
local. For instance, Japanese newspapers simply avoid mentioning
burakumin and even the occupations they practiced, like butchering
meat. In formal Japanese, no one is blind, bald, fat or ugly. And
while a tall man in a group is ``the tall one,'' a short man is
``the fourth from the left.''
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, by contrast, a short man can be ``petiso'' _
``shorty'' _ and a dark-skinned man ``negro,'' and no offense is
taken. But make an aside about someone's mother and there will be
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With informers around for 20 years under the juntas, discussing
politics in most Latin American countries used to be dangerous,
especially for anyone who let slip socialist catchwords like
``bourgeoisie.'' Now politics can be discussed freely, but one must
disparage politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In France, discussing politics has always been the chief
instrument of torture used at the dinner table. Unrepentant lefties
will excuse a wildcat strike as a ``social movement,'' while
average folks may toe the pan-European line and justify government
austerity measures. Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front
gets 15 percent of the vote, so SOMEBODY must be discussing him,
but the newspapers just don't like to. Liberal journalists say that
ignoring his views will suppress them, but the theory seems thin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Americans are sick of discussing Bill Clinton's
sex life, the French are sick at the idea that Americans discuss it
at all. They assume their presidents fool around _ Francois
Mitterrand's mistress and their daughter attended his funeral _ and
the national ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy never compels a
leader to lie or obstruct justice about sex (not that the French
expect their presidents to be incapable of either).
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, by contrast, have many things that are illegal to
say or do, all related to the Nazi era: one may not deny the
Holocaust or make the Hitler salute. Except for rebellious
skinheads and soccer hooligans, jingoism is out, and outspoken
anti-foreigner sentiment is frowned upon. Still, many privately
blame Turks and Africans for higher crime rates and encourage
tougher immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some concepts protected by political correctness in the United
States don't export at all in most places _ women's rights, for
example. These are rapidly, and sometimes violently, retreating in
much of the Muslim world. And in Mexico, secretarial ads still ask
for ``good-looking young women.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners can't keep up with American changes, and often think
them foolish. Probably the most fashion-policed word anywhere is
that with which Americans refer to their countrymen of African
ancestry. In 50 years, that defining term has shifted from colored
to Negro to black to Afro-American to people of color to
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners may hoot at that, but they too have yielded to subtle
pressure to rename their minorities. Polite euphemisms coined by
19th-century liberals _ ``natives'' in Africa, ``aboriginals'' in
Australia (no doubt to avoid words like ``savages'') _ are now
themselves out of favor. ``Indigenous'' is OK in Australia. It used
to be OK in Mexico, but ``Indios'' is now preferred. (There is no
confusion with people from the Indian Subcontinent; Mexicans call
all of them ``hindus'' _ pronounced ``EEN-doos'' _ even if they're
Pakistani Muslims or Christians.)
</P>
<P>
   An African, by contrast, would never take a cue from the
now-fashionable American invention ``Native American'' because
``natives'' is an old insult. In South Africa, the former
``Bantus'' (an inoffensive word elsewhere in Africa) now run the
country, and non-whites are sometimes called ``the previously
disadvantaged.'' There is also nothing basic about ``black'' _ in
some contexts it refers only to black Africans while in others it
includes mixed-race people and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-GEOPOLITICAL-CORRECTNESS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; JOHANNESBURG: and Indians. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the context of political correctness, in some
ways South Africa resembles America, with blacks and whites
exchanging hostilities across an economic divide. In others, it is
unique. Its constitution, for example, curbs hate speech and
forbids discrimination that is based not just on race and religion
but also on sex, sexual preference, handicap, pregnancy status and
almost every imaginable ground.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because South Africa spent so much of the apartheid era
in isolation, America's political correctness and the backlash
against it arrived simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Take race. Everyone talks about crime, but for whites to dwell
on it too long smacks of racism, because most criminals are black.
Suburban wives complain about their maids, and husbands complain
about labor productivity, but it's all code for ``the blecks.''
White and black liberals strain to ask people of other races to
dinner, but to get caught practicing tokenism is a faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   Given its many races, however, South Africa is also remarkably
rich in racial insults. It has a macho culture where one is
expected to roll with a punch and sensitive types are mocked. In
young, racially mixed groups of friends, people lightheartedly use
words like ``darkie'' and ``hout-kop'' (wood-head) for blacks,
``coolie'' and ``curry-muncher'' for Indians, ``bushie'' (Bushman)
or ``half-naat'' (half-baked) for coloreds and ``whitey'' or
``mlungu'' for whites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, English-speaking whites call uncouth Afrikaner ones
``hairybacks'' or ``rockspiders,'' while Afrikaners call the other
whites ``rooinek'' _ rednecks, as in sunburned British soldiers _
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Russia, where the most discriminated-against
groups are residents of the Caucasus _ Chechnyans, Azerbaijanis,
Georgians and so on. There, unlike elsewhere, Caucasians are
relatively dark skinned _ and to Russians inclined to be
derogatory, this makes them ``chorniye'' or ``blacks'' (except when
this is seen to be insensitive, in which case Caucasians become
``people of Caucasian nationality.'')
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in Russia it's the Caucasians who can be blacks,
but a person of African extraction is never black, except
derogatorily. (A white Russian, of course, is vodka, Kahlua and
cream.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The first clue was right there on
the day our furniture arrived from New York. Though I had spent the
whole day directing traffic _ the couch goes there, the Chinese
piece here _ along about 5 p.m. the foreman approached me with his
clipboard and said ``Where's the boss?''
</P>
<P>
   Drunk with the power of being The New York Times' new
Johannesburg bureau chief, I grinned. ``I'm the boss,'' I said with
glee.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me blankly. Then, he looked annoyed, really
annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said ``I mean the master.''
</P>
<P>
   All he wanted was a signature acknowledging that we had received
our belongings, but mine would not do. Never mind that,
technically, the moving company was working for me, that every box
had my name on it and that my husband's name did not even appear on
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged. ``He's in the back,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready to cover southern Africa, I had shopped for hiking
boots with perhaps more care than needed. In the small ways that
you have of trying to brace for huge life changes, I had spent a
lot of time looking for just the right shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But what I really needed was a Wonderbra.
</P>
<P>
   I had expected snakes, elephants and malaria. I had expected
racism, bug-filled hotel rooms and the heartbreak of watching
children die. But the status of women here, the level of sexism,
astonished me. Some of South Africa's most prominent women,
including Ramphela Mamphele, who runs the University of Cape Town,
argue that sexism is actually a bigger problem in Africa than
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Here a woman is a babe first, last and foremost. The
better-looking she is, the easier life is. At least you get some
attention. No wonder most of the other middle-aged moms dropping
off their darlings at my children's school are in full makeup and
cleavage by 7:20 a.m. (I no longer get out of the car.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, women in many countries, including the United States,
have to deal with terrible sexism. Japanese women are groped on the
subways. Some Muslim countries deny women education and make them
wear virtual tents. But South Africa is in the midst of a social
revolution defined by its emphasis on equality and has the most
liberal constitution in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest, however, that it is somewhat demeaning to hear constant
jokes about women as chatterbox shoppers or wily spendthrifts, and
eyes roll.
</P>
<P>
   I must have brought a half-dozen dinner parties to an
uncomfortable silence before I realized that the indignities of
being a woman here were not up for discussion among any group _
black, white or colored, rich or poor, young or old. A look of,
``Another obnoxious American woman'' ran across their faces, like
the news zipper in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to change in the status of women might be explained
by cultural factors _ whether one grows up as an African, whose
tribal laws treat women as children, or as a Dutch-descended
Afrikaner, whose church teaches that men must rule the home. The
social revolution of the 1960s largely bypassed even South Africans
of English descent. After all, under the international sanctions of
the apartheid era, this country spent decades as an isolated,
pariah state, and didn't even allow television until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank that first week, we found there was no such thing as
a joint checking account. My husband, I was told, could give me
permission to use his account, but it would carry only his name and
he could withdraw that permission at any time without notifying me.
No one there could understand why I found this objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   As I arranged for phones and bought office equipment every
payment form and service contract asked my marital status _ and
often, they wanted my husband to co-sign.
</P>
<P>
   And slowly I came to another realization. I was expected to
wait. Store clerks routinely abandoned helping me when a man walked
into the store looking the least bit anxious. If I approached a man
behind a counter to pay a bill and he was talking to a friend of
his, I could wait 10 minutes for him to take the money. The worst
was in airports. At car rental counters, men positively glower if
they are in a hurry and aren't waited on first.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I finally confronted the female clerk at an Avis
counter who had left me in mid-transaction to help a demanding
Afrikaner male. ``Why did you do that?'' I asked, trying to sound
gentle. ``I'm in a hurry too, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there is not much you can do about these things,'' she
said in a tone that suggested I was unfairly bothering her.
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for a run of humiliations in front of your boss,
who's here on a visit?
</P>
<P>
   First we go to see President Nelson Mandela. The brief courtesy
visit has been incredibly difficult to arrange. But here we are.
Ten minutes of chitchat pass. Mandela leans over to my boss. ``You
know,'' he says to him, pointing at me, ``in my day, if you had a
wife who looked like that, you would be embarrassed. In my day, a
woman needed a little more meat on her bones.''
</P>
<P>
   (Where was that Wonderbra?)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-SAFRICA-SEXISM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: that Wonderbra?) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day was a meeting with the leader of the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom Party, Mangosuthu Buthelezi. My husband, Donald G.
McNeil Jr., who is also a correspondent in the Times bureau, came
along. As we were leaving, I tried to give Buthelezi my card. He
took it without looking and sidled up to Donald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see you have a good Zulu wife who carries your cards for
you.'' he said. Ah, how sweet. They were bonding.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner that evening at the house of Harry and Bridget
Oppenheimer, the country's wealthiest family, the servants were
clearing dessert when Mrs. Oppenheimer stood: `Ladies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else seemed to know _ the ladies were to leave the room
now so the men could smoke cigars and talk politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, but,'' my boss protested, thinking that as a journalist I
shouldn't be missing out on talking politics with some of South
Africa's most powerful executives. ``She's the bureau chief.''
</P>
<P>
   That silence again. I meekly followed the other wives out.
</P>
<P>
   Early on a black woman journalist here complained of the way she
was treated and told me that she was thinking of having new
business cards made up saying she was her paper's bureau chief. She
thought the disdain for her really had to do with being black. But
I could match her slight for slight, and my card said bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   I can't count the number of times I have been asked who is chief
correspondent for The New York Times in South Africa by men who
were holding my business card in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   I've asked women why they put up with all this. Outside a
courtroom recently an attractive young reporter was struggling with
a soda machine. A middle-aged lawyer walked up, stroked the machine
and said. ``Oh, it's just like a woman: You put in money and it
gives you nothing back.'' He wanted applause for this amazing wit.
She laughed obligingly.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how she could stand it, and asked. She agreed the
remark was demeaning, but objecting outright was too much trouble,
she said, and besides, he got the machine to give her the Coke.
``I'm just waiting for guys like that to die out,'' she said. I
marvel at this patience.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I have learned a few tricks for getting by.
One, I can wiggle my way out of almost anything with these few
words. ``I'll have to ask my husband.'' Even got rid of the pushy
neighbor who had an ``emergency'' and wanted to dig our yard up to
find his pipes. ``Of, course,'' he said with great understanding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm leaning on that phrase quite a bit these days. It's
so handy.
</P>
<P>
   And my husband swears that I now wear much tighter shirts.

   A Hefty Charge Against Visa And Mastercard
</P>
<P>
   People who feel deprived of access to what now seems to be an
American right to buy on credit have a friend at the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the government filed an antitrust suit against Visa
and Mastercard, saying the nation's two biggest credit card
networks restrain competition and consumers' choices.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the lawsuit, Attorney General Janet Reno said
rules adopted by Visa and Mastercard for member banks were overly
restrictive, and therefore harmful to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and Mastercard denied the allegations.

   Dispute Over Nerve Gas  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   French experts detected traces of the nerve gas VX on Iraqi
warheads they examined but withheld their findings because they did
not want to damage Baghdad's efforts to have United Nations
economic sanctions lifted, according to several international
weapons specialists.
</P>
<P>
   France, which has major commercial interests in Iraq, officially
denied that it had found VX, or that it sought to help Iraq lift
the sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf war. It asked the U.N.
commission investigating Iraq's weaponry to resolve the dispute.

   AIDS Deaths Drop
</P>
<P>
   The federal government announced that 16,685 people died of AIDS
last year, less than half the number who succumbed in 1996, and a
stunning drop from the more than 43,000 in the peak year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was caused by the use of new drugs that can keep the
deadly disease at bay. But the number of people who annually become
infected by the HIV virus remains steady at about 40,000. So
accompanying the good news is a worry that infected people will be
living longer, giving them more chances to pass infections along.

   Tales From the White House  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The investigations into Clinton administration officials
continued to yield startling tidbits last week.
</P>
<P>
   Two black members of President Clinton's cabinet said they had
to submit urine samples, apparently for drug testing, while two
white cabinet secretaries said they did not, according to testimony
by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner described the conversation while testifying in the
trial of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who had to submit
a sample. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown also gave one.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said drug-testing
policy varied by agency. White House staff members are tested, he
said, but the president is not.

   Imelda Marcos will not be cooling her well-shod heels in jail _

overturned a corruption conviction against her.
</P>
<P>
   Is she off the hook? Not exactly. Other criminal and civil
matters loom, involving the billions that she and her husband,
Ferdinand, who died in 1989, are accused of stealing. And the
United States wants to discuss the small matter of $5 million in
unpaid income taxes from the Marcoses' days in Hawaii. She may be
barefoot yet.

   A Shorter Season  &QL;

   For 51 years and 35,001 games, the National Basketball
Association avoided losing regular-season games to labor strife.
But with the cancellation of the entire preseason and talks going
nowhere, Patrick Ewing and friends will be off the court awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't agree with their proposal,'' said Ewing, the
players association president, after both parties met Thursday.
They meet again Tuesday, which NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik
called the ``drop-dead date'' for canceling part of the season.

   Desperate for cash, Russia has agreed to sell the United States
most of its allotted research time aboard the International Space
Station for $60 million. The deal reduces Russia's role to mostly
that of a builder but not a user of the outpost during its five or
six years of orbital construction.

   NASA is also beefing up its own role. ``Our reliance on Russian

   Probably few executives at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. or
Quorum Health Group ever gave much thought to tiny North Valley
Hospital in Whitefish, Mont. But now few will be likely to forget
it. The government said it had joined a lawsuit filed by a former
North Valley officer, who accused the two hospital companies of
defrauding Medicare through bogus expense claims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed under seal almost six years ago, has already led
to federal investigations. Analysts expect that before it's all

   Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., the co-owner of the San Francisco
49ers, had bigger worries than his team's recent loss to the
Buffalo Bills. DeBartolo pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in
Baton Rouge, La., to failing to report an alleged extortion plot
concocted by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a plea bargain, DeBartolo agreed to provide evidence
that Edwards had demanded $400,000 in cash in exchange for using
his influence to shepherd a DeBartolo riverboat casino project
through the local Gaming Board. He was ordered to pay $1 million in
fines and penalties. Prosecutors have their eye on Edwards.

   A Bit of Lucre From Lucky Dog &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do Larry Hagman from ``Dallas,'' Isabel Sanford from ``The
Jeffersons'' and Joe Lynn Turner from the rock group Deep Purple
have in common?
</P>
<P>
   They are all dogs. At least, they help play dogs in television
commercials for the Lucky Dog Phone Company, the first brand that
AT&AMP;T has created in its 113-year history that does not actually
mention AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good reason for that. Since 1885, AT&AMP;T, the nation's
largest communications company, has built an image based on trust,
reliability, convenience and a sense of community (as in ``Reach
out and touch someone'').
</P>
<P>
   But the Lucky Dog campaign, which supports a new calling service
called 10-10-345, is based on, well, good old greed.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, AT&AMP;T will give away 345 prizes to people who use the
service, plus a $1 million grand prize in January. Its market
research found that people who like to save money with flat-rate
services like Lucky Dog (a dime a minute, a dime to connect) also
like sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The research may also have discovered something else: that a
phone call is a basic consumer product rather than a high-tech way
to improve someone's life. Maybe that is why the AT&AMP;T executive who
invented Lucky Dog used to market Diet Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Hagman is the voice of a bull mastiff, Ms.
Sanford a basset hound and Turner a mutt.

   Hers Was Fact, His Is Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sex in America, at least for the rich and famous, is getting to
be an awfully high-risk activity. No, this isn't about AIDS _ it's
about people simply not being able to shut up about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one, there's the president's dalliance with . . . but
don't worry: the ``M'' word will not appear here.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the high-decibel, high-profile marriage of
Philip Roth and Claire Bloom. After it ended in a blaze of
ugliness, Ms. Bloom blasted into print with a 1996 memoir,
``Leaving a Doll's House'' (Little, Brown &AMP; Co.), in which she
depicts Roth as a control freak with a ``deep and irrepressible
rage'' at the very idea of being married and a ``profound distrust
of the sexual power of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Any thoughts, Roth? Well, nothing explicit. But he DOES happen
to have a new novel out, called ``I Married a Communist.'' And it
DOES involve a failed marriage to an actress named Eve Frame (Hmmm:
all those one-syllable names), who, as it happens, writes a
vindictive memoir about said marriage. And Ms. Frame has a teen-age
daughter who is a source of great friction in the marriage, just as
Ms. Bloom did.
</P>
<P>
   If it's revenge, though, is it also art? Roth, who has an
uncanny way of squeezing an awful lot of his own life into his
fiction, may well have envisioned the book as a sweet riposte, but
whether the work succeeds on a literary level is another matter
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``While such matters may be of passing interest to literary
gossip-mongers,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times,
``they are not transformed, in this case, into plausible or
compelling fiction.'' The novel is ``unfinished and overstuffed,''
she wrote; the characters just ``talk and talk and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gore Vidal should have the last word about this steamy,
all-too-public battlefield. ``It's always best,'' he told a Times
interviewer when Ms. Bloom's memoir appeared, ``to stay out of
other people's divorces.''

<P>
   NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The serene smile Fanny Pedata wore to
her party may well have been an old smile, indeed, a smile left
over from 7 or 8 years ago when she last had control of her facial
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was just the joy of knowing 95 friends and family
members had gathered at a benefit to buy her more time in her own
home. Pedata, 62, for 13 years a secretary at Pratt &AMP; Whitney, has
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis _ commonly called Lou Gehrig's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot move. She cannot breathe unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   But she can think as clearly as she did before ALS took over.
She can communicate. And she does worry about the $4,000 a month it
takes to care for her on her $1,800-a-month income.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she raises her eyebrow,'' explains her son, Dominick
Pedata, of North Palm Beach, ``that means she wants to spell, so we
grab the spelling chart.''
</P>
<P>
   And then she blinks as a family member prompts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We divided the alphabet into four lines,'' adds a daughter,
Connie McCormick. ``We point to the line and then the letter. We
can talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's take at the $25-a-head dinner, dance and silent
auction at the Palm Lakes Estates Recreation Hall in Riviera Beach
was just more than $3,000. The money will buy her another month or
so at home until, inevitably . . .
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably what?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. The family cannot find a nursing home in the area that
will accept an ALS patient who uses a respirator to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was the kind of person who would do anything for
anyone,'' says McCormick, 44. ``She was very active, always
working, always there for others, whether it was family, someone on
her bowling team or giving to the United Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her $1 million health insurance policy ran out in 1993,
Pedata received 24-hour nursing care in her home. When that was
gone, there was no safety net. Fanny Pedata, the bureaucrats seem
to be saying, is somebody else's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the insurance actuaries explain, nobody is supposed to
live for 10 years with ALS.
</P>
<P>
   Pedata's $1,800 disability income disqualifies her for Medicaid,
and misses by half the minimum it takes to watch over her. If her
family ever stops struggling to keep her at home with caretaker
help, she will go to a hospital at, the family points out, an
ungodly cost to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a hospital, too, would bring unspeakable heartbreak to
Pedata, whose only solace is familiar surroundings and people who
know how to comfort her and communicate with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mind is sharp as ever, and she is quite aware of the
hardships of the family and the strain they're under,'' said Karen
Roberts, a Pratt &AMP; Whitney secretary who befriended the family
years ago. ``Unfortunately, there are no agencies to provide
financial assistance to long-term survivors of ALS, and in all
honesty most people do not live long enough to have this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedata's daughter, Annette Appleby, 39, said the strain of
looking after her mother has contributed to several divorces in the
family, her own included.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the insurance runs out, where is this safety net we keep
hearing about?'' said Appleby, a cable company telephone operator.
``Where are the social agencies and charities when we need them
most? There is no financial assistance for home care. When the
United Way comes to my workplace, I'm so angry I say, `Don't even
come near me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, a child-care worker, has kept her mother in her home
for a year at a time, and for lesser periods when caretakers quit.
The strain on a marriage, finances and children cannot be imagined
by outsiders, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have wonderful caretakers now, but in the past, we have had
a big turnover,'' said McCormick. ``Every time there is an
emergency, somebody has to cover or our mother dies.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't get the family started on how the insurance company
went through the $1 million insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the care was there, but $40 an hour for registered
nurses,'' said Appleby, ``when the money would have lasted twice as
long with licensed practical nurses or aides. We're stretching our
money with untrained caretakers that we train.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedata's children, and even her 79-year-old mother, Nina
Kilbane, and her 81-year-old stepfather, Charles, have learned to
feed Fanny through the hole in her stomach, to clean her, change
her bedding and maintain the respirator that keeps her alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As hard as this ordeal is on us,'' said Dominick, ``it's
harder on our mother. It's very distressing to keep going to the
community and asking for money, but we don't know what else to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we could go to the well of public sympathy one more time
by mentioning that anyone who would like to help care for Fanny
Pedata at home could send a check to The Philomena Pedata Benefit
Account at Washington Mutual Bank, 4470 Northlake Blvd., Palm Beach
Gardens, FL 33410.
</P>
<P>
   As for other possible sources of help, I called both the
Muscular Dystrophy Association and the United Way of Palm Beach
County Inc., and explained the family's dilemma. Both agencies said
that many thousands of families in the nation struggle heroically
with invalid care crises.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, director of public affairs for MDA, said that its
services to Pedata have included clinic visits, follow-up care, and
help with equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local program services coordinator is exploring ways for
MDA to assist (with equipment costs for) Mrs. Pedata,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give money to individuals,'' said Scott Baddesch,
United Way executive director. ``(But) we can talk to social
workers who may be able to qualify this family for help either
through the government programs or perhaps a foundation grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, we've got to find a way to keep Fanny Pedata
smiling.

 &HT;    Moderation, exercise help keep hands healthy
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Your hands get an intensive workout. They type
at computers, chop vegetables, play guitars, hammer nails and dig
landscapes. And then they go home and work some more.
</P>
<P>
   When they're exhausted, their owners are painfully aware of
their condition _ through ailments such as repetitive motion
injuries, chronic tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Hands, like any other body part, need preventive care if they're
going to operate at peak performance. Healthy hands are part of a
healthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Early intervention often can prevent small problems from
becoming big ones, experts say. The key is paying attention to how
the hands are being used. After a long day of typing, are you
playing two hours of tennis or gardening for three hours?
</P>
<P>
   If so, stop. Your hands need a rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big misconception is that computers are going to get you,''
said Sharon Guebert, a certified hand therapist with HealthSouth
Hand Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure activities can be a culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask what are they doing at home,'' she said. ``How are they
handling the pots, how long are they playing tennis or spending on
knitting, crocheting or gardening?''
</P>
<P>
   Over-indulging in a favorite hobby can be detrimental to hand
health. So can performing the task incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   Hand therapists say they've seen their share of young baseball
players and gymnasts with repetitive motion injuries. Often, their
problems are related to improper form while participating in a
sport.
</P>
<P>
   What steps can you take to help maintain healthy hands?
</P>
<P>
   First, be aware of how much stress the hands are enduring.
</P>
<P>
   Then, develop the habit of stretching. All hand therapists are
advocates of hand stretches to release the buildup of tension that
occurs from repetitive tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking a short period of time, and it's very important
for overall tissue health,'' said Guebert. ``Every hour, stop what
you're doing and stretch those hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Another preventive measure is using tools designed with the
hands in mind. Ergonomics, the concept of fitting tools to the
body, is the emphasis here.
</P>
<P>
   But also keep in mind that fabulous tools aren't going to help
if they're used improperly, said Paula Davison, a certified hand
therapist with Seton Northwest Hospital's sports medicine program.
</P>
<P>
   As Davison's patients, such as M.W. Bell, work their way back to
hand health, she often recommends tools they can use.
</P>
<P>
   In Bell's case, the most essential item was a new pen. She said
it was the first thing she purchased after leaving the hospital
following a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't hold the old ones,'' said Bell.
</P>
<P>
   With everything from toothbrushes to hammers coming with kinder,
gentler handles these days, Davison has some advice for those
shopping for hand tools _ whether they are for the kitchen or the
workshop. Three things are important: a light weight, padding and
bigger handles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want tools that mash into the palms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davison also notes that ergonomic design doesn't go hand in hand
with price. ``I've seen some very expensive gardening tools that
aren't in the least ergonomic,'' she said. ``They're pretty . . .
but there's no way you could use those for any period of time.''

   `` _ high fly ball to right field _ '' Click.
</P>
<P>
   `` _ everyone will think you just bought it in Paris!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, well, well, what is this? It's bedtime, but I've been
hooked by an infomercial for something called the Infinite Dress.
</P>
<P>
   One dress, oodles of styles. Thirty-four, to be exact. I watch
as smiling models walk up and down a runway, slipping fabric from
shoulder to shoulder, magically revealing nothing more than a
little cleavage in the process. Cocktail wear to poolside wear to
jumpers, all for $59 plus shipping and handling. Intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Tying my own shoelaces is tough enough, but this is an
irrational hour. I call the number and place an order.
</P>
<P>
   About a month later, a thin cardboard box arrives with an
instructional video and booklet and the Infinite Dress itself.
</P>
<P>
   The dress, I soon find, is the octopus of outwear, eight feet of
stretchy black DuPont fabric with two long tails that wrap around
you in dozens of ways. There's Style No. 5, which has a Greek
goddess appeal. And No. 27, a one-shouldered cave woman look. Style
33 (``to be worn with your favorite choker necklace,'' the booklet
says) makes a halter-topped dress with a disco flair.
</P>
<P>
   No time to experiment yet. I stuff the dress and instructions
into my backpack and fly to New York, where I promptly forget about
it until the final day of my visit.
</P>
<P>
   By then it's the last thing clean I have, so by the light of the
painfully dim hotel lamp, I wrap myself in Style No. 28, a backless
V-neck look that requires crossing the tails in back and bringing
them forward to tie at the waist.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sexier look than I'm used to, but this is New York City,
I figure. And I'm going to fashion shows. Everyone will be looking
at the models.
</P>
<P>
   I plan to dart into strange restrooms throughout the day, trying
Style No. 2 or Style No. 17 or Style No. 32, depending on what I
can manage in a tiny stall.
</P>
<P>
   In between pit stops, I will plop my Infinitely Dressed self in
the path of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   MOSS, MELLEN AND MENKES
</P>
<P>
   After the Calvin Klein show, I scoot into the elevator just in
time to stand next to supermodel Kate Moss. I tap her on the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, um,'' I squeak. ``I'm wearing this dress and, uh, what do
you think of it?''
</P>
<P>
   Kate, who was whispering and giggling with a friend, stops
smiling and glances over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' she says, turning back.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, it's this infomercial product,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   I have more luck with fellow fashion editors. I start at the
top, with Suzy Menkes of the International Herald Tribune. She's
the dean of the group, easily recognizable by her trademark There's
Something About Mary flip of bangs. (No funny stuff, though _ she
uses a barrette.)
</P>
<P>
   She squints. ``It looks like a Yohji Yamamoto,'' she says,
invoking a hip Japanese designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from an infomercial,'' I tell her.
</P>
<P>
   She leans forward and says, in that clipped British accent, ``A
what?''
</P>
<P>
   She sends me to Polly Mellen, creative director for Allure
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like one I own, by Helmut Lang!'' says the
ever-enthusiastic Mellen. ``It also looks Japanese! Stand up! Oh, I
never would have said Helmut Lang if you had been standing. Now
that you're standing, I can see what you've done with it. It's
something you're able to get into and turn into an expression of
the moment. I wish it wasn't black _ I'm moving away from black. It
would be great in red or white. I can tell you like to wear strong
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   I back away.
</P>
<P>
   But their musings don't match the response I get on the street.
A cement truck rumbles by. ``Hey hooooooker!'' the driver yells.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker? Shamed, I approach a nun who is leaving the Guardian
Angel Church on 10th Avenue. ``Sister, does this dress make me look
like a tart?'' I ask. ``Well, it would be better if you had a
jacket on, but at least you're covered up,'' she responds.
</P>
<P>
   I thank her, and cross the street, ignoring a passing shout of
``Put it on!''
</P>
<P>
   I wear dirty clothes on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   THE CULPRITS
</P>
<P>
   I wear the dress to meet the couple behind the infomercial,
producers Wendy and Rory Fielding of Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Rory sees the dress _ in Style No. Something I Made Up _ and
smiles. ``I've seen the Infinite Dress, but only on models,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   They give me a little history. The dress was born sometime in
the '70s and had a brief shining moment, even making it on the
cover of Spanish Cosmo. Then it kind of disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago, Rory saw the dress on the Home Shopping
Network and the Fieldings bought the rights. They went to the WXEL
studios with about every model in the Boca-Fort Lauderdale area,
and in two days they filmed a 30-minute infomercial. They picked
Jennilee Harrison _ former star of Dallas and Three's Company _ as
the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   They changed the dress' price from $89 to $59, tested the
infomercial in a few small markets in March and it caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Now the show is running about 300 times a week across the U.S.
And so far, they've had $8 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of fashion and David Copperfield and
Siegfried and Roy,'' Rory Fielding says. ``I knew it would be
fabulous for TV. We're planning a retail launch in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem has been, there's no rack appeal,'' Wendy says.
``You can't put this on a hanger.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course you can't. It's an 8-foot-long dress.
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, mine is wadded up in a file cabinet at work.
Style No. Nothing. The truth is, it makes my butt look big.
</P>
<P>
   But it would make an infinitely comfortable hammock.

 &HT;    Getting gastronomic in The Big Easy
 &HT;    By Dale Rice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Paul Prudhomme. Emeril Lagasse. Susan Spicer.
Frank Brigtsen.
</P>
<P>
   If you recognize three out of four of those names, it's obvious
why you travel to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't, it's time you learned.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz, football, a rich history, the occult, Audubon Zoo, art
galleries, shopping for antiques and the biggest party scene either
side of the Rockies may lure visitors to New Orleans the first
time, but it's the culinary scene that helps bring them back.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there are oysters, shrimp, crawfish, gumbo,
etouffee, po' boys, muffulettas, bread pudding and beignets _ the
foods that New Orleans made famous. (Or should that be the other
way around _ the foods that made New Orleans famous?)
</P>
<P>
   But that's only a beginning, a tiny beginning. New Orleans is
one of the top gastronomic cities in the United States, if not the
world. There may be more high-quality restaurants per square mile
in the French Quarter than anywhere on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's hyperbole, then listen to what the readers
of Conde-Nast Traveler magazine had to say. Those upscale,
well-traveled, insightful readers consistently have named New
Orleans one of the top 10 destinations in the world. And they knew
what they were voting for.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb Loin with Goat Cheese and Zinfandel Sauce at Spicer's
Bayona. Paneed Milk-fed Veal with Fresh Lump Crabmeat Ravioli and
Roasted Red Pepper
</P>
<P>
   Cream Sauce at Lagasse's NOLA. Broiled Gulf Fish with
Crabmeat-Parmesan Crust and Lemon Mousselline at Brigtsen's
Brigtsen's (his restaurant and last name are one and the same).
Roasted Chicken Roulade Tchoupitoulas at Prudhomme's K-Paul's
Louisiana Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   That's New Orleans of the '90s, filled with chefs who are
melding ingredients and techniques to produce awesome dishes. But
they are only one reason _ albeit the first and foremost _ to visit
the city. There are others. So grab a napkin and join us on a
culinary journey through the Big Easy. Restaurants
</P>
<P>
   Cajun. Creole. French. Italian. Southern. Traditional. Avant
garde.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city where cooking styles and traditions get blended
at the pace of a Cuisinart on high speed. Consequently, most
restaurant menus are an eclectic mix of dishes, as chefs frequently
reach to one tradition to start an item and borrow from another to
finish it.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, creativity abounds. And creativity leads to
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Commander's Palace has consistently been ranked by
critics as one of the top 10 restaurants in the country. Others
such as Bayona, Emeril's and Bistro at Maison de Ville are
recognized nationally. Frank Brigtsen was named James Beard Chef of
the South this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's only the tip of the iceberg _ and we're not talking
lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that this is a city where there are more
wonderful restaurants than adjectives to describe them. Candy shops
</P>
<P>
   Truffles the size of tennis balls. Pralines the size of
Frisbees. OK, OK, so that's a little exaggeration. But if you're a
fan of chocolate or pecans, it's difficult to walk by one of
several candy shops in the French Quarter and not be drawn in
almost uncontrollably by the scent and sight of these confectionery
delights.
</P>
<P>
   At Laura's Candies and Creole Gourmet on Conti Street, the
truffles are the size of golf balls. Lined neatly behind the
counter, these candies sport milk and dark chocolate exteriors that
cloak soft, creamy centers in a variety of flavors such as
raspberry, maple and pina colada. Split two of these $15.95-a-pound
treats with a friend (obviously you'll want to sample more than one
flavor) and you'll both be on a chocolate high until dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In the French Market, Evans Creole Candy Factory and Aunt
Sally's Praline Shop must be turning out pralines by the hundreds
every day. At Evans, there are four kinds to choose from _ maple,
chocolate, rum and traditional. (Although it's awfully easy to be
distracted by the incredible turtles, formed of macadamia nuts,
almonds or pecans, at $18.95 a pound.) At Aunt Sally's the pralines
are available in individual boxes _ making the transport home that
much easier. Culinary antiques
</P>
<P>
   Looking for 17th-century glassware? How about 18th-century
silver? Or 19th-century porcelain?
</P>
<P>
   Stroll along Chartres and Royal Streets in the French Quarter or
travel Magazine Street west of the central business district, and
you'll find dozens of fine antique shops with thousands of kitchen
and dining items tucked among the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   But step into Lucullus Culinary Antiques, and it's all there
under one roof _ an entire shop dedicated to the fine art of
dining, antique style. There's everything from a hand-painted Spode
fish platter to an assortment of sterling silver toast racks to a
set of seven, hand-blown Dutch glasses from the 18th century
(priced at $5,500). Cafe du Monde
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the French Market, just across the street from
Jackson Square, there's a cafe where they've been drinking coffee
since the 1860s: Cafe du Monde.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's 3 p.m. or 3 a.m., you can find patrons sipping the
famous chicory-flavored coffee and eating plates of beignets, the
little yeast-type doughnut covered with confectioner's sugar that
may be one of New Orleans' best known foods.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Cafe du Monde is filled with people taking a
break and listening to the jazz musicians playing nearby. In the
middle of the night, it's a stop between bar-hopping and slumber
for many who've obviously imbibed a lot more than coffee as they
made their way along Bourbon Street. Grocery stores
</P>
<P>
   In an age of giant supermarkets with thousands of specialty
foods, people still flock to two small groceries that have been
operating for most of this century on Decatur Street.
</P>
<P>
   Central Grocery &AMP; Deli, founded in 1906, bills itself as the
home of the original muffuletta, that glorious sandwich of cold
cuts, cheese and olive salad on a large roll.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the narrow aisles that are difficult to maneuver,
shoppers line up to order muffulettas (and eat them at the counters
in the rear of the store) and load bags with imported cheese, olive
oil, spices, herbs, pasta and other imported delights you can't
find on the shelves of most mega-markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby at Progress Grocery, a less crowded atmosphere invites
shoppers to grab a muffuletta or browse a wide variety of Cajun and
Creole spice mixtures, as well as imported products from Europe and
the Middle East. And if you need a gift for someone special, why
not pick up an Alligator Bob's smoked alligator stick. It's only
$1.69, and the look on the recipient's face will be worth every
penny. Farmers Market
</P>
<P>
   Opening daily at sunrise, the Farmers Market by mid-morning is
teeming with people, many on their way to the flea market that's
just behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh fruits and vegetables are piled high, while refrigerated
cases hold fresh seafood that you long to take home. (Extra large
Gulf shrimp were priced at $10.95 a pound one day this summer,
while barbecued crawfish tails were just $2.50 a pound. It's hard
to pass a bargain like that.)
</P>
<P>
   While the open-air market is covered, offering some protection
from rain showers or the hot sun, it rapidly becomes sweltering in
summer. But even oppressive heat doesn't deter tourists from coming
there for the spices, sauces, mixes and coffees that also fill the
stands. Cooking schools
</P>
<P>
   Trendy or traditional? Take your pick when it comes to
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   If gumbo, dirty rice and bread pudding are your idea of a great
meal in New Orleans, then there are two cooking schools right up
your alley: Cookin' Cajun Cooking School and New Orleans School of
Cooking.
</P>
<P>
   At Cookin' Cajun, in a downtown mall overlooking the Mississippi
River, 35 to 40 participants packed a small room to watch Susan
Murphy, who laces her instruction with tips and humor, prepare a
Rockefeller sauce for an oyster appetizer, shrimp and okra gumbo
and pecan pie tarts.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same weekend, a few blocks away on the edge of the
warehouse district, Michelle Nugent led nine adults in preparing a
more sophisticated meal in an intimate setting at Spice Inc., the
latest venture of Bayona chef/owner Susan Spicer. Spice Inc. is a
small, upscale market featuring meats, cheese, prepared foods,
baked goods, cooking supplies, including its own line of dried
herbs and spices, and lessons.
</P>
<P>
   At the hands-on Saturday night dinner, which Spice Inc. limits
to 16 participants, students alternately prepared the courses _
Mussels Peasant Style, Salad Greens with Portobello Mushroom, Ancho
Shrimp and Seared Ribeye with Chimichurri Sauce and Creme Renversee
au Caramel _ under Nugent's guidance and then gathered around the
table to savor their work. And it was an effort worth savoring.
Cookbooks
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn in the French Quarter there are souvenir
shops with dozens of cookbooks featuring Creole and Cajun cooking,
along with the well-known (and not-so-well-known) chefs and
restaurants of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But for serious cookbook lovers, the type who appreciate the
musty smell of old paper almost as much as the aroma of garlic, the
French Quarter provides fertile hunting grounds for used culinary
tomes.
</P>
<P>
   At Crescent City, which probably has the largest collection at
300-plus, the books are arranged neatly by subject, just inside the
front door. At two other stores, Dauphine Street Books and the
Librairie Book Shop, the arrangement is less orderly, with
overflowing shelves and stacks of books on the floor. But don't let
the piles deter you; you never know what little gem you might find.
Lagniappe
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of New Orleans, a lagniappe is a little
something extra. In this case it's a special treat _ not for the
visitor _ but for the four-legged family member left at home.
</P>
<P>
   These treats can be found at Three Dog Bakery, an unusual shop
on Royal Street, where you'd swear the refrigerated cases hold
French pastries and other baked goods that you could gobble in a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   But while they look like they're made for the dessert tray,
they're better suited for the dog dish. Carob and other ingredients
merely look like chocolate and other sweets; in reality everything
is canine friendly.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to assuage any guilty feelings about leaving the
pooch behind than to return home with a small sack for the dog and
a big bag of culinary treats for you.

 &HT;    Is this pop-opera phenomenon the next Pavarotti?
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A voice is a color, it's a sensation, it's impossible to
describe.''
</P>
<P>
   So says Andrea Bocelli in his video A Night in Tuscany, the PBS
pledge-drive favorite that has catapulted the 40-year-old Italian
singer to worldwide renown. It's as profound a summation of the
human voice as any poet might utter. But Bocelli should know.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to him, and you swear you've got a direct line to the
angels. The voice is like a richly aged red wine: complex,
mysterious, full of notes of sweetness and sadness. It is not your
typical operatic tenor, an instrument of bravado. It is, in a word,
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A voice is a color . . . '' How ironic, of course: Andrea
Bocelli is blind.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the hottest thing in opera since Messrs. Carreras,
Domingo and Pavarotti topped the charts with their Three Tenors
routine. When Bocelli sings at the newly opened National Car Rental
Center on Tuesday, it will come at a moment when the handsome but
scraggly singer, who looks like a cross between Omar Sharif and Don
Johnson, has all but conquered the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the release of his first CD in his native country five
years ago, Bocelli has posted sales figures associated more with
Madonna and Puff Daddy than Verdi and Puccini, to name two of the
most prominent composers in his repertoire. Romanza, his signature
album of contemporary Italian songs, has sold 2 million copies in
America since it bowed a year ago. ``Which is a pretty outstanding
achievement for an artist who doesn't sing in the English
language,'' says Kevin Gore, a senior vice president at PolyGram,
Bocelli's label.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Since it first aired in December 1997, A Night
in Tuscany has become a PBS blockbuster, a program like those Three
Tenors, John Tesh and Yanni specials that become a cultural
phenomenon. It is duly trotted out each pledge drive _ and the
switchboard automatically lights up. ``In the PBS business, we say
it's a program that has legs,'' explains Jay Lynch, director of
creative services at local PBS affiliate WXEL-Channel 42. ``Every
time we've aired it, it has broken our (pledge) goal.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about it: There's something about Andrea. But what
exactly? By the tenor's admission, his voice is still a work in
progress. ``I think I can do better in every aspect,'' he told The
Washington Post in April as he prepared for his American debut at
the Kennedy Center. ``I am very far from where I want to go. I need
much to study.''
</P>
<P>
   And although he has studied _ with opera great Franco Corelli,
no less _ it's hard to dismiss his point. Bocelli's singing is far
from note perfect: There's a decisive thinness in his upper
register, a tendency to ignore rhythms, a lack of bite when the
words demand it. ``The voice isn't a complete instrument in the
same way of a Pavarotti or a Domingo, and he chooses to sing a lot
of the same repertoire,'' says Malcolm Arnold, a South
Florida-based opera singer and vocal coach. ``I have a problem with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Arnold admits there's another quality to Bocelli, a
quality reinforced by his technical imperfections _ and perhaps by
his blindness, the result of a soccer accident when Bocelli was 12.
``There is a honesty to him that seems to be lacking in typical
tenor gesturing, both vocally and physically,'' Arnold adds. ``What
he does is free from artifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold's point is reiterated by a careful viewing of A Night in
Tuscany, which was filmed in Pisa, a city not far from Bocelli's
pastoral birthplace of Lajatico. When the tenor sings, he rarely
moves. Rather, the music seems to inhabit him in a quiet, measured
way. The closest he comes to gesture is when his face breaks into a
warm smile: He is happy _ and so are you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the reluctant hero is what he is,'' says Crystal Buie, a
Boynton Beach nurse who heads up an international Bocelli fan club.
``He doesn't screw up his face . . . He just stands there and
sings.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what Buie calls ''the whole package'' is the repertoire.
Although Bocelli claims to be an opera singer first and foremost,
he freely embraces popular material. ``Because it's very important
to bring the public to the theater,'' he says in A Night in Tuscany
of his crossover philosophy. ``I think pop music and opera music
are two very different things, but it's difficult to say (which is)
inferior or superior.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti, who in their quest
to achieve global stardom sing just about anything from Sinatra
soliloquies to Lloyd Webber would-be arias _ often quite
atrociously _ Bocelli cultivates a very specific kind of pop song:
the Italian power ballad. It's a music rarely heard in this country
_ the closest you'll come are the overblown anthems of Celine Dion
_ but it finely straddles the line between rock and opera. And it
suits Bocelli's voice like velvet.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, listen to Bocelli's recording of Con Te Partiro, the
hit tune he re-recorded as an Italian-English duet with Sarah
Brightman, Time to Say Goodbye. It's a stretch of unrestrained,
bittersweet melody _ broken by the occasional conversational
refrain _ that builds to enormous climax. If a pop star sang it, it
would sound beyond his or her reach. If an opera star sang it, it
would sound overblown. With Bocelli, it's just right.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing has also played a crucial role in Bocelli's rise. The
first airing of A Night in Tuscany, for example, was timed around
the gift-buying holiday season _ and just when the tenor's albums
were being delivered in bundles to American stores. Bocelli has
also made the usual media rounds, appearing everywhere from The
Rosie O'Donnell Show to the pages of People magazine (in its ``The
50 Most Beautiful People in the World'' issue).
</P>
<P>
   And there are times during the documentary portions of A Night
in Tuscany, when the tenor is shown strolling the beach with his
wife, Enrica, and the elder of his two sons, 3-year-old Amos, or
walking through his parents' vineyard, that Bocelli becomes little
more than an advertisement for the Italian tourist authority. A
viewer is led to believe that one man's voice embraces an entire
Mediterranean lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   But all is forgiven because of the power of that voice _ and the
sincerity behind it. Bocelli is indeed a simple man, a product of a
rural background _ his parents sold farm equipment and bottled
their own wine. He studied music as a child _ piano, flute and
saxophone _ but his real interest was in singing. He went to law
school and practiced for a year as a backup career, but he soon
found he preferred working his way through the Italian piano-bar
circuit, where, despite his classical pedigree, he started as a pop
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli's big break came in 1992 when the Italian rock star
Zucchero auditioned him for a pop-opera collaboration. The part
eventually went to Pavarotti, but Zucchero took notice and invited
Bocelli on tour. Pavarotti also praised him _ and reportedly told
Zucchero, ``You don't need me.''
</P>
<P>
   Television appearances further established Bocelli's reputation
in Italy. And with the release of the single Con Te Partiro, an
international star was born. It wasn't long before Bocelli was
singing for Pope John Paul II _ in a special concert that paired
him with Bob Dylan, of all people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bocelli is contemplating any number of offers, from more
recordings to worldwide touring to operatic roles. So far, he's
done only a handful of productions, including the career-defining
role of Rodolfo in a production of Puccini's La Boheme that was
televised in Italy. ``Overall Bocelli acts the part better than
many a sighted tenor,'' observed Richard Dyer in The Boston Globe.
``And although he is still figuring out how to pace himself through
a full performance, he sings it better than anyone since the young
Jose Carreras 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his visual impairment, it's a subject that Bocelli rarely
discusses. A young victim of glaucoma, he was already losing his
sight before the soccer accident. But even after going permanently
blind, he never let it stand in his way. To this day, he rides
horses and skis. And, of course, he sings wherever there's an
audience waiting to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what colors look like, and I have an idea of the
world,'' he said in a 1997 interview. ``I believe we all have a
destiny that we can perceive. Mine was singing.''
</P>
<P>
   And in making those colors come to life.

 &HT;    Just regular folks
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even if you didn't know anything about
Frank Amanti, you would be able to tell he was a regular customer
at the Smoke Inn cigar store in Tequesta, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the black lacquered sign that dangles above his
personal easy chair in the store's tiny lobby. In gold letters it
reads: ``Casa Don Cheech Club.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Cheech, that's me,'' Amanti says, puffing out a stream of
smoke after a healthy draw of his cigar.
</P>
<P>
   What does a guy have to do to get his own sign in a place like
this?
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta be a steady customer, that's all,'' the retired
Chicago fire chief says, noting he's been just that since the store
opened two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Amanti and about two dozen other regulars _ though only Don
Cheech gets a plaque _ gather every Saturday around noon to sit and
smoke and talk and laugh and argue and smoke some more and devour a
plate of sausage and peppers with a little cup of espresso mixed
with Sambuca. (They bring in their own food.) Owners Jerry Somma
and Abe Debabneh turn on the TV so the guys can watch the
hyperkinetic Emeril Lagasse whip up a dish on the Food Network.
(Fans of the show, they dub themselves The Emeril Club).
</P>
<P>
   But when new customers walk in, Debabneh walks toward them,
shakes their hands and says, ``Come on in! Come on in!'' to break
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always greet them and invite them in. We treat everyone
like they're a regular.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Don Cheech. The reason he keeps coming back? ``It's
the friendliest place I know,'' he says. ``You can come here and
just relax. You can't get therapy like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a ``regular'' _ whether it's at the corner bar, a beauty
parlor, whatever _ takes more than just consistent patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Being a regular means being passionate about the business you
frequent, even if it's only for that favorite item on the menu or
the friendly way one of the workers greets you. To be a regular,
you have to love the place. You have to get to know the nooks and
crannies of the personalities of the people who work there.
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference between being a creature of habit and being
a regular. And you have to surrender a little bit of yourself, too.
How else are they going to find out you like your tuna on rye, not
wheat, without pickles and with a slice of slightly melted cheese?
If you don't brag about the grandkids while they polish your nails
or moan about the Marlins over a cold one, how will anyone know
what to talk about the next time you visit?
</P>
<P>
   The model for the homespun business would, of course, be Cheers,
the TV bar where everybody knows your name. On that show, everyone
sat on their same bar stools, drank the same drinks, behaved just
how you expected them to behave. Even watching Cheers became a
habit. For 11 years, you knew what to expect, knew the rhythm of
the punchlines, the quirks of the characters, the tidy half-hour
resolution. Just watching made you a regular.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it goes in the real world, too.
</P>
<P>
   HOMESPUN ATMOSPHERE BRINGS 'EM TO THE OWL
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is another Cheers,'' says John Loennecker as he
waits for his slice of carrot cake at The Green Owl in Delray
Beach, Fla. ``They all know us and we know all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``us'' he means himself and his wife, Janet. The couple eats
at The Owl, as it's known by locals, at least four times a week.
Sometimes they eat there twice a day. They've been coming to the
Owl since they retired and moved to Delray from Nanuet, N.Y., about
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the turkey burgers and the BLTs,'' he says as he waves
to a couple of other regular customers who are taking their seats
at an adjacent table.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a good sandwich,'' Janet says. ``Not everyone makes
a good sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   The homespun atmosphere hooked the Loenneckers, too. Wedged into
a quaint corner slot of East Atlantic Avenue, The Owl is decorated
in mid-'70s kitsch. Planks of paneling on the walls are adorned
with owl knick-knacks. A layer of thin, unpadded green carpeting
surrounds a horseshoe shaped green Formica counter in the middle of
the eatery that puts customers elbow-to-elbow. And, truth be told,
there is dreadfully ugly owl-themed wallpaper. The joint has the
ambiance of a bachelor uncle's basement apartment that desperately
needs an update.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants me to take down the wallpaper, but I like it''
says Dave Gensman, who co-owns The Owl with his brother John and
family friend Bill Cline. ``I think the paneling makes it homey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owl draws a heavy mix of downtown regulars (city and county
officials are often seen hobnobbing at the counter) and seasonal
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   `THROUGH KIDS, WEDDINGS AND SICKNESSES TOGETHER'
</P>
<P>
   Paula Gibb knows a good hairdresser when she sees one. She's
been seeing the same one since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday, like clockwork, Gibb drops by Shirley
Stillwell's shop, the Powder Puff Beauty Salon in Port Salerno,
south of Stuart, Fla., for a shampoo and set. And once every three
months, she gets a new perm, just like today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy Shirley's personality and I like what she does to my
hair,'' Gibb says.
</P>
<P>
   Time has made them friends. Stillwell's son, Tom, helped Gibb
become the first woman inducted into the Port Salerno Kiwanis Club
about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the years, you go through kids and weddings and
sicknesses together,'' says Gibb, who lives with her husband, Dave,
not far from the shop in the Miles Grant subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gibb, most of Stillwell's customers are older and repeat
visitors _ as many as 98 percent of them are familiar faces, and
many have been coming to the shop since it opened in 1973.
Stillwell, who has been styling hair for 44 years, likes it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think older customers are more loyal than younger
clientele,'' she says. ``Young, working people don't have as much
time for appointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the customers, Stillwell has longtime employees that
add to the shop's stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``One girl's been with me 21 years . . . another's been here 16
years,'' she says. ``I think customers like it when they can come
in and not see a new face every time.''
</P>
<P>
   SON IS NOW WALKING IN FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony, now, now . . . '' Bob Murray says in a gentle tone to
the toddler who has just tipped a chair over in the showroom of
Dixie Shoe Repair, at the corner of Okeechobee Boulevard and South
Dixie Highway in West Palm Beach, Fla. ``C'mon back and pick this
back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray stands with a bemused look on his 69-year-old face, his
hands clenched and perched on the waistband of his polyester
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like his father, he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, Murray used to walk Anthony's father, Stephen
Bonanno, around the store when it was over on Clematis Street.
Murray, who worked downtown, was a customer of Stephen's father,
Bennie Bonanno, back then. The shop has been family owned and
operated since 1963. Murray's been there almost from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen's 34 now and runs the repair shop with his wife, Monica.
His mom, Eva, makes custom sandals and other leather goods in the
showroom. Stephen and Monica's kids, the aforementioned Anthony and
8-year-old daughter Bailey, treat the shop like a home away from
home. So do their mutts, Butch and Cuddles.
</P>
<P>
   The family atmosphere and good service have kept Murray and
other steady customers coming back. Suzette Green of West Palm
Beach has been a Dixie Shoe Repair patron since the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is part of West Palm Beach, along with the orchids
and hibiscus and everything tropical,'' she says. ``It's original
and different and unique and I like that.

 &HT;    Gerado's violin
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some see South Florida as the final stop
on life's long road, the dark end of an alley where people pile up
like dry leaves and old newspapers. But this story could only
happen right here, where all sorts of people come from all sorts of
places, not to die, but to live.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Florida stories, it began in another time, another
place.
</P>
<P>
   Gerado Passavanti left a job undone, a dream unrealized when he
died of pleurisy in 1930, aged 52, in the Bronx. If he had died in
his native Italy, there would most likely be no story to tell. But
he died in America, where fate and immigrants and dreams take a
common highway. Sometimes they all meet on that road and travel
together for a while before going their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   Passavanti was trained in fine arts and engineering at the
University of Naples and came to New York from Italy early in the
century with all the talents his new nation could ask for and all
the dreams a young man could conjure. He helped design a new
torpedo for the U.S. government during the Great War. He loved
opera and art; he was a fine pianist and wood carver.
</P>
<P>
   But his last name ended in a vowel. This bode ill for his
advancement during the Big Red Scare of the 1920s, when America was
petrified of the illusionary socialist fervency of the swarthy
immigrant classes.
</P>
<P>
   So Passavanti found work as a projectionist in a Bronx silent
movie theater and put his dreams on ice. The man who loved music
spent his days in silence. Maybe his son Lucius would realize the
father's hopes. Lucius showed the same talents _ music, art, the
ability to craft beauty from raw materials. He attended Beaux Arts
in New York, as well as the Industrial School of Art, and learned
to run the movie projector during his father's lunch breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Then his father died. Lucius was 17.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Passavanti had been crafting a violin for a friend
named Guaneri. Guaneri had a son named Johnny, who could play piano
and cello and violin brilliantly. You may have heard of the Johnny
Guaneri Quartet, still playing after 50 years, though Johnny died
some years ago. But neither Johnny nor his father ever got the
violin Gerado Passavanti was making.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody did.
</P>
<P>
   When Passavanti died, the pieces of his partially completed
violin went into a box for 68 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lucius, now 85, spent those decades designing fashion jewelry
for big New York merchants like Tiffany's and Coro Vendome. He
played piano, took classical guitar lessons, became a portrait
painter. He was never far from fine art.
</P>
<P>
   The violin in its box was never far from Lucius. He asked New
York violin makers to complete the job, but they said no, don't
have time. When he retired in 1986, he and his wife Rose moved to
Vero Beach, Fla. The violin went under his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Then a few months ago, Lucius was looking at jewelry in a Vero
pawn shop. As usual, he asked yet again about someone to finish his
father's violin. He was given a name, but as usual, things didn't
work out. The man was moving, couldn't help Lucius. But he told
Lucius of a 79-year-old, 10th-generation cabinet maker and crafter
of fine stringed instruments named Zoltan Toth.
</P>
<P>
   Toth lives in Port St. Lucie. Passavanti called him. Toth said
he'd take a look at the box of wood.
</P>
<P>
   You might guess how this ends, only it's not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Toth's father also came to America early in the century, from
Hungary, in 1906. He was the ninth generation of Toths to make
furniture. When his son Zoltan showed much musical talent, his
father sent him back to Budapest to study cello at the Royal
Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Nazis came and next the Stalinists, and Zoltan
returned to the U.S. to play cello in large symphony orchestras
throughout the midwest. That career lasted until one day in his
late 20s when, helping his father in his wood shop, he cut off the
tip of the ring finger on his left hand. End of cello career.
</P>
<P>
   Zoltan became an architect. He built 12 houses for his wife,
Irma, in the coming years. They moved from one creation to the
next. He built all the furniture in all the houses _ tall case
clocks with 17th century English works, TV cabinets, beds, tables,
book shelves to house the art books, a music stand _ all crafted
from glowing fruit woods and dark woods, hand rubbed and oiled. He
took up photography. National Geographic magazine bought his
photos. He and Irma collected 19th century European oil paintings.
His life was rich in art.
</P>
<P>
   But he dearly missed his cello.
</P>
<P>
   Then he designed a medical building for a Cleveland plastic
surgeon. A three-piece band played at the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Zoltan told the surgeon that he once played cello in groups like
that. He held up his left hand to explain why he no longer did. The
surgeon put him in a hospital that week and rebuilt his finger.
</P>
<P>
   Zoltan Toth was back in business. It was 1967. He played with
dance bands and orchestras for 20 years _ Kansas City, Cleveland,
Harry James, Vaughn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled, crafted, played music. Once, he slipped back into
Hungary carrying a beat-up junker of a cello. His passport said he
was a cellist, so the Communist border guards waved him and his
cello through customs. His old teacher in Budapest gave Toth his
heirloom cello, told him to treasure it. Toth was again waved
through customs as he left the country, having switched the junker
and the heirloom.
</P>
<P>
   He built cellos and violins in his garage workshop. When he
moved to Port St. Lucie a decade ago he moved the workshop, too. He
didn't come here to retire. He came to make music.
</P>
<P>
   So he looked at Passavanti's box of violin pieces and said, OK,
let's put it together.
</P>
<P>
   It took a month. He knew the wood was almost 100 years old. He
usually uses 40- or 50-year-old wood in his instruments. The fibers
in old wood have broken down, are ready to express subtle nuances
of tone and resonance. A violin top moves like your diaphragm _ it
expands and contracts. A guitar top is braced differently. It
vibrates more. A violin top has to breathe. A combination of old
wood, the right finish, the right bracing are the secrets to
beautiful violin sound.
</P>
<P>
   The wood looked very good. He polished the spruce top. The grain
looked good, narrow and true. He fit the maple sides and back,
glued, buffed, finished, clamped, glued and braced. It was
difficult because violins are built around frames, or forms. He had
the pieces but he didn't have a form. He had to build a new form to
fit the pieces. He used the fine tools a surgeon would employ to
splice and cut and fit the sides to the back.
</P>
<P>
   The ebony finger board went on, the tuning pegs. Strings.
</P>
<P>
   He has made more than 100 instruments. They are all beautiful to
Zoltan Toth. His cellos sell for more than $10,000. This one looked
as good as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Then he played it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extraordinary,'' says Toth. ``It usually takes a year
of hard playing to begin to break in a violin. The tone was here,
rich. It was responsive. The high registers are so clear. It's
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   He has played violins made by Antonio Stradivari. He has played
violins made by the great Guadagnini family. Many old violins are
priced out of sight because of their rarity, not their tonality, he
says. This violin is superb, in looks and tone.
</P>
<P>
   Toth asked a local violinist, John Enyart, to play the
instrument. Enyart owns a Guadagnini, more than 100 years old and
worth well into six figures. He bought it 40 years ago. His father,
a missionary in South America, procured him his first violin by
trading a mule for the instrument. Enyart has a doctorate in music
from the Conservatory of Cincinnati. He teaches music at Indian
River Community College and plays in local orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   ``This instrument is beyond description,'' he says, ``although I
think stunning is a fit description.''
</P>
<P>
   Toth and Enyart and Passavanti are all assembled among the forms
and bracing and lathes of Toth's workshop. The air virtually moves
as Enyart plays his fingers up and down the neck of the violin. The
deep tones are viola rich, the high notes crystalline in their
clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Toth is dressed in a red-checkered shirt. He is almost 79, but
his legs are those of a young tennis player. His eyes flash bright.
</P>
<P>
   Passavanti is 85, looks decades younger.
</P>
<P>
   They are talking about Harry James, 19th century European
masters, how to spot a fake emerald, how to listen to Bartok. They
speak softly of Italy and Hungary and the Bronx and their children
who grew to be architects and microbiologists.
</P>
<P>
   What a small world it is, they say, their meeting after all
these decades so that Gerado Passavanti's unfinished violin could
come to completion.
</P>
<P>
   There is music in the voices of the old men.
</P>
<P>
   Enyart is off to the side, eyes closed, swaying gently as he
bows the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gerado Passavanti is listening.

 &HT;    New sounds of zydeco keep dancefloors hopping
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Long renowned and crowned as the ``king of
zydeco,'' the late Clifton Chenier might have trouble recognizing
much of the musical legacy that has flourished in his wake. Yes,
the sound is still based on the interplay of -- sprightly accordion
and the metallic scrape of a rubboard. Yes, the music still fills
the country roadhouses and radio airwaves throughout the Creole
communities of Southwest Louisiana (spilling over the border into
pockets of East Texas), making a visitor feel like he has entered
another dimension: Planet Zydeco.
</P>
<P>
   But who is this Beau Jocque character, boasting and toasting
like a rapper, exhorting his fans to ``Check it out, lock it in,
crank it up''? And what about Keith Frank, whose ``What's His
Name'' was inspired by Snoop Dogg and whose transformation of the
theme from an old TV show _ ``Movin' on Up'' from ``The
Jeffersons'' _ has become a signature anthem for both the man and
the music? Then there's Little Brian Terry over in Houston, with
all his hip-hop jive about ``H-town.'' And Chris Ardoin may have a
familiar name _ he's a descendent of Amede Ardoin, Chenier's
predecessor as Creole accordion king _ but his style owes more to
the smooth seduction of Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   And, while we're at it, who turned up the bass so loud that the
floors are throbbing, the walls are shaking and the fillings in
everyone's teeth are rattling?
</P>
<P>
   If he were alive, Chenier might look at the bandstand, and not
understand what's going on. But then he'd turn his eyes to the
packed dance floors and the lines out the door at El Sid O's,
Richard's or any of the other mainstay clubs in the area
surrounding Lafayette, La., and a big smile would cross his face.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains: How much outside influence can
zydeco assimilate and still be zydeco?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a longstanding debate in the zydeco community,'' said
Michael Tisserand, author of the newly published book ``The Kingdom
of Zydeco'' (Arcade, $29.95), an exhaustively researched,
intelligently analyzed and lovingly written guide to this most
vital of regional musics. ``Just yesterday, I was talking to a
couple of musicians who said, flat out, 'That's not zydeco they're
playing' (referring to the younger, rap-oriented generation of
accordionists). Or the debate will be over the single-row (button)
accordion versus the piano-row accordion, and someone will say one
or the other isn't zydeco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people put all the weight on the song, saying this is a
real zydeco song and this isn't, but I put a lot of weight on the
context the music is being made in. Even in the most extreme
examples, like Keith Frank singing the theme song to 'The
Jeffersons,' there are elements that are very zydeco-related. First
of all, it's performed at home, playing to a crowd of black Creoles
at a dancehall. The band is based completely around the accordion
and the rubboard. And it's a dance song.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the terms Cajun and Creole are often used and confused
interchangeably, Tisserand provides a valuable lesson in how
distinct but interrelated the two cultures are. ``When people in
Southwest Louisiana describe themselves as 'black Creole,' they
usually mean that they prefer a way of life that expresses itself
in traditional food, the French language and zydeco,'' he writes.
By contrast, Cajun is Caucasian culture, referring to the refugees
from French-speaking Acadia (what is now Nova Scotia), who settled
in Louisiana. Originating as an ethnic slur, ``Cajun'' occasionally
carries backwoodsy, rednecky connotations.
</P>
<P>
   While the division is as stark as black and white, the
interminglings are such that, as Tisserand writes, ``Arguably the
single most important cultural and musical influence on the Creoles
has been from their neighbors the Cajuns.''
</P>
<P>
   Young blacks increasingly have been buying into zydeco the
further it moves from the traditional French two-steps and waltzes
and the more that it incorporates the attitude and rhythms of
contemporary hip-hop. As Tisserand maintains, the watershed year
for zydeco was 1987, when the music filled the soundtrack of ``The
Big Easy'' and was incorporated by Paul Simon into his
``Graceland'' song cycle. It was also the year Clifton Chenier
died, after more than a decade of heroic performances while his
health was failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope of Chenier's influence may be the only thing that
nearly every zydeco musician can agree on,'' writes Tisserand,
though, these days, such inspiration lies more in Chenier's memory
than in his music. Most of zydeco's younger generation has been
more profoundly influenced by Boozoo Chavis, a Lake Charles peer of
Chenier who came out of musical retirement in the mid-'80s, and
whose return sparked an interest in a simpler, more rhythmic type
of zydeco, played on a button accordion, designed less for displays
of virtuosic sophistication than keeping the dance floor hopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``His comeback was so powerful that he was attracting people who
remembered him from 20 years ago, and then slowly the younger
people started infiltrating those dances,'' Tisserand said. ``Even
though he was a contemporary of Clifton, he had this raw vitality
to his music that turned peoples' ears around.''
</P>
<P>
   As different as the styles may be, the younger accordionists are
operating much in the same manner as Chenier's generation did,
drawing influence from the popular music of the day (in Clifton's
case, Ray Charles and Louis Jordan) and translating it into the
regional dialect of accordion and rubboard. As Brian Terry told
Tisserand, ``Cliff did country into zydeco and blues into zydeco.
Just because I got an accordion and a scrubboard doesn't mean I
can't play hip-hop and rap. You know, music changes every six
months, and you've got to change with the times. How can you draw a
line and say, 'This is going overboard with it'? How can you go
overboard with music?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think zydeco's pretty absorbent,'' said Tisserand, who wrote
the book in part to provide historical background for fans drawn to
``nouveau zydeco.'' ``I never heard anybody criticize Clifton the
way I do hear some in the Creole community criticizing Beau Jocque
or Keith Frank or some of the other younger musicians for
assimilating influences. I think maybe the dividing line is the
older generation's distrust of rap, feeling that it brings a
different kind of influence into the community, and that it is
tainted with urban life and drugs and guns and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it has also revitalized the music in such a manner that
it has lost all the anachronistic mustiness of a museum piece. With
a bitter rivalry for supremacy between Beau Jocque _ Chavis'
protege, then his musical sparring partner and one of the music's
most popular touring acts _ and the younger Keith Frank, who
dominates the Creole roadhouse circuit while remaining virtually
unknown beyond it, the question of succession within this musical
monarchy remains an open question of vital debate.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A kingdom of zydeco, then, is a delicate balance,'' writes
Tisserand. ``A monarchy is ultimately decided by dancers voting
with their feet.''

 &HT;    FinderPop enhances your system
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't have to wait for Apple Computer to update
its operating system to improve your Mac's ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a rival of sorts in development for the Mac, much
of it grass roots. Amateur and professional programmers are coming
up with some wonderful tweaks to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   One good example is a piece of shareware called FinderPop.
Shareware is software you can download and try out without charge
but are expected to pay for if you end up using it.
</P>
<P>
   For $8, FinderPop offers a great improvement on the function of
contextual menus in Apple Computer's latest version of its
operating system, OS 8.
</P>
<P>
   Contextual menus is a feature that lets you access a menu of
commands by just clicking on the screen and holding down the
control button on your keyboard. It's built into OS 8, but Apple
Computer's version gives you only a limited number of commands,
such as move a file to the trash or get information about it.
</P>
<P>
   These commands are only the beginning with FinderPop. For
starters, it simplifies the use of contextual menus by eliminating
the need to hold down the control key. You need only click and hold
down the mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   Do that on the desktop and up comes a useful menu that includes
items called FinderPop, processes and desktop.
</P>
<P>
   FinderPop is a folder in which you can store aliases of your
most frequently used files, folders and programs. Point and
highlight this folder to open it and jump right to any items
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The processes folder holds a list of every active program, which
you can highlight and choose. The desktop folder contains icons for
the hard drive and any floppies inserted. You can highlight and
navigate through them to find and open any file.
</P>
<P>
   You can also see what's inside any folder with FinderPop. Just
click and hold down the mouse pointer over a folder and up pops a
list of its contents. You can then move, copy or delete any item
within a folder.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good Mac program, FinderPop is highly customizable. You
can set the fonts and size of any menus and folders.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a great piece of shareware, please do register and
pay for it if you end up using FinderPop. You'll find it on most of
the big Mac bulletin boards. Among them are MacWorld, Webintosh and
MaCNN.

 &HT;    Salon back in the news with new business model
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the precarious world of online magazines, necessity is
clearly the mother of invention. Just as the smoke cleared from
Salon magazine's Washington fiasco, which culminated in the
resignation of D.C. bureau chief Jonathan Broder and a whole lot of
publicity, Salon was back in the news with a new business model.
For $25 a year, readers can now become members.
</P>
<P>
   The new revenue scheme resembles a PBS pledge drive. For $25,
you'll get discounts on Salon merchandise, including posters, tote
bags and note cards. You'll have access to the members' lounge chat
area, featuring exclusive discussions with Salon staffers and
special guests. You'll also get a Salon T-shirt, a free ticket to
attend the Salon Magazine Book Awards party in New York City and _
get this, you high-minded literary types _ an Octavo CD-ROM
reproduction of John Milton's famous defense of free speech,
``Areopagitica,'' published in 1644. If they mailed you a ``Three
Tenors'' video, you'd swear it was pledge week on your local PBS
station.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's new business model hasn't been tried before. Slate, the
Michael Kinsley-run, Microsoft-owned Web publication charges users
yearly subscription fees in return for access to the vast majority
of its content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still harkens back to the sobering reality of online
content at this point,'' says Jupiter Communications Patrick Keane,
``and that is that most users will not pay for content.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane says most users still won't pay because the Internet is
flush with content, whether its national news organizations or
analytical essays of the type Salon publishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysis and deep content won't ferment into a robust
subscription business, and (Salon) doesn't think so, either,''
Keane says. ``It will be a very small portion of their audience
that will pay to support them. The majority of their revenues will
continue to be advertising. They are admitting to the fact they
can't make it on advertising alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Salon and other online publications that focus on
content are scrambling to avoid the fate of Wired, the mother of
online publications. Parent company Wired Digital was sold to the
Lycos Network.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos began as a search engine at http://www.lycos.com as did
Tripod (http://www.tripod.com), an online community targeting young
adults. Wired Digital includes Hot Wired magazine, Wired News,
Webmonkey (a Web site building tool) and the Hot Bot search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers will remember that not more than five years ago,
Wired.com was on the bleeding edge of Web publishing as one of the
first magazines to hit the Web. IAn influential and much copied
e-zine, Wired was widely regarded as the premier Web innovator.
</P>
<P>
   Wired seems like an ancient relic of the wild days of the
Internet, before ad banners, before Web addresses turned up on
buses and cereal boxes and before the Gap had its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Keane says Wired will continue to be a strong Web brand and have
a loyal following among the technology set. However, most Web
watchers see the company as damaged goods _ a Web innovator that
tried to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   Salon, on the other hand, is still a work in progress, still
attracting loyal readers, some of whom might be induced to buy a
poster or mail in membership dues to help Salon pay the bills.
Piles of banner ads and clever copy just aren't enough anymore.
Just ask HotWired.

 &HT;    Magazine details hackers' chop shop
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is there an electronic equivalent of the old auto chop
shop? The October issue of Yahoo! Internet Life magazine says yes.
It describes how some hackers crack the copy protection on popular
software and then distribute it for free. Such software is called
``warez'' in Internet slang and includes such programs as Microsoft
Office 97. It details how a hacker named Christopher Fazendin
managed to disable the 90-day trial feature on a full version of
Office. In essence, he enabled users to get a copy of the program,
which normally retails for $350, for $4.99.
</P>
<P>
   It's poised to be the next generation of CD-ROM, offering up to
17 gigabytes of storage or enough to hold an entire two-hour movie.
The technology is called DVD, which stands for either digital
versatile disc or digital video disc, depending on the source. You
can read all about it in the November issue of MacWorld. The
magazine discusses in detail the strengths and weaknesses of DVD
and how ready it is for commercial rollout. DVD is what geeks call
cross platform, meaning it works with either Macs or PCs. While for
sale, DVD has several problems. For one, there aren't a lot of
titles yet for it. Mac users face another problem in that there
aren't a lot of manufacturers producing DVD drives for this market.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Two more board games have come to the computer desktop. Hasbro
Interactive has released computer versions of ``Clue'' and ``The
Game of Life.'' While based on the original games, the computer
versions have several new twists. For one, the games are 3-D and
animated. There's also a soundtrack. In ``Life,'' players can now
travel through time. Both games retail for $29.95 and are available
only for PCs with Windows 95 or 98.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are great tools for learning languages. And software
companies are increasingly releasing titles that teach everything
from Spanish to Japanese. The latest is Kids Spanish from Knowledge
Adventure. Designed for ages 6-10, Kids Spanish teaches the
language through games and exercises. Kids learn comprehension,
vocabulary and grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   You can follow the baseball playoffs and World Series on the
Web. The leagues have set up an official site, which tracks news of
the games and other information. You'll find the site at
http://www.worldseries.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Now for something completely different _ and it's not a Monty
Python site. The Money Origami site teaches how to turn a bill into
an origami pair of glasses, bow tie or a ring. Yes, it's totally
useless, but some say it's quite fun. You'll find this site at

 &HT;    It's a wired, wired, wired, wired world
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In just a few years, the Internet has transformed the
wired world into a global village, and communicating with your
neighbors on the Net can be as easy as talking over the back fence
_ no matter how far away that fence is.
</P>
<P>
   With the right software and hardware, your computer turns into
an online videophone that lets you talk to someone long-distance _
just like calling Grandma from the telephone on the kitchen wall _
and see the person at the same time. If all you have is a sound
card and a microphone, you can have an audio chat that boasts
surprisingly good quality. Plunk down $100 for a USB or
parallel-port camera and you're ready for a face-to-face encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The best part is that the call costs nothing, and Net surfers
all over the globe are joining the free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, thousands of participants from more than 25
countries are logged in to the servers handling calls. That doesn't
even count ``lurkers'' _ those who are viewing the server directory
but aren't logged in.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Basque, 39, lives in Listuguj, a village on Canada's Gaspe
coast, near Quebec City. Basque has been computing only since
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by how you could contact the world so
easily,'' Basque said last week. ``I spoke to someone in France
just this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement toward videoconferencing is a natural progression
from e-mail and from Internet Relay Chat, in which a conversation
is typed at the keyboard and both parties see it.
</P>
<P>
   But both e-mail and IRC rely on a growing lexicon of
``emoticons'' and acronyms to convey the meanings provided in
everyday speech by inflection, facial expressions and body
language. With videoconferencing you see the real thing, even if it
sometimes is as jerky as a Hong Kong-made martial arts movie and
the voice doesn't match the movement. Installing a video capture
card (about $60) makes outgoing video smoother, and has the added
benefit of having a plug for a standard camcorder as well as one
for an ``eyeball'' camera sitting atop a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's tough to make a video connection, but the audio
is usually solid. Sending video data takes up a lot of bandwidth
and also is dependent on the speed of the connection and the amount
of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Net congestion becomes a problem (in the future), video
will be the first to go. It's the voice that's important,'' said
Jeff Pulver, owner of Pulver.com, a New York-based Internet
communications consulting firm. Pulver also pointed out that like
it or not, the best video quality available on the Net comes from
commercial sex sites, which have a vested interest in presenting
smooth video.
</P>
<P>
   That profit motive keeps such sites at the cutting edge of video
technology, Pulver said, adding that the companies producing the
free software ``have very little incentive to put resources'' into
the products.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 10
</P>
<P>
   videoconferencing programs available for free on the Net. Most
have application-sharing, whiteboard and standard typed-chat
functions built in. If you don't want to go the video route and
spring for a camera, you don't have to. Most of the programs log in
to a server, and the directory shows which parties are available or
have video sending capability. You can receive video no matter
what.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the most popular free programs are CU-SeeMe,
Microsoft's NetMeeting and VocalTec's Internet Phone 5.
</P>
<P>
   CU-SeeMe is the granddaddy of videoconferencing programs, having
been invented at Cornell University in the 1980s. The latest
version is available for Windows and Macs and will display up to 12
video windows at a time. CU-SeeMe connects to ``reflector'' sites
that list people available for chat.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial version of the program from White Pine Software has
additional features and sells for $99 retail or $69 over the
Internet. White Pine's Web address is http://www.wpine.com.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's NetMeeting will only show two video windows at a
time _ sending and receiving _ but works seamlessly with Windows
95. It's available for free download from http://
</P>
<P>
   microsoft.com, and often comes bundled with Windows 95 or 98.
You may already have it on your machine; look at Program Files for
a separate entry, or it may be under Internet Explorer. There is a
Mac version available at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Phone 5 also is available on the Web at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.vocaltec.com. With IPhone, you have to register the software
before the video portion will work, but the audio works well. Much
like NetMeeting, IPhone logs in to a directory server from which
individual connections are made. IPhone has both Windows and Mac
versions.
</P>
<P>
   If you have someone you call often _ a family member, for
example _ one of the best ways to connect is direct
computer-to-computer, using as a ``phone number'' the IP address
assigned when a computer logs on to an Internet service provider.
If you know the IP address of the person you're calling, click the
``call'' button on whichever videoconference software you're using
and type it in. The call will go straight to the other machine,
bypassing servers and minimizing potential slowdowns. To find the
IP address in Windows, run a built-in program called Winipcfg. On a
Mac, look at the TCP/IP entry under Control Panels.
</P>
<P>
   Videoconferencing may not be perfect, but it has helped bring
the original promise of the Net into sharper focus: The free
exchange of thoughts and ideas without regard to national
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bassel Mohsen, 23, lives in south Lebanon. Mohsen has only been
computing for six months, but one of his first acts was to fire up
NetMeeting. He's now in regular contact with electronic friends in
the United States, Australia and Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen's aim in using videoconferencing was ``to talk to and
meet people from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The village just keeps getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET HOOKED UP
</P>
<P>
   Videoconferencing software can be downloaded free from the
Internet. Some commercial software titles are sold that include
camera and microphone, and most have both Windows and Macintosh
versions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hardware requirements include a sound card ($30-$100) and a
microphone ($6-$50).
</P>
<P>
   _ Optional hardware:
</P>
<P>
   USB or parallel-port color camera ($99-$169). A parallel camera
shares a port with your computer's printer. An A-B switch ($20) is
needed if both stay connected at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Video capture card ($60 and up).
</P>
<P>
   _ Kits are also available:
</P>
<P>
   Big Picture Video Phone (U.S. Robotics, $160, includes capture
card, color camera and software).
</P>
<P>
   Creative Video Blaster ($100, USB color camera, software).
</P>
<P>
   Intel Create &AMP; Share ($130, USB color camera, software).
</P>
<P>
   QuickCam VC ($169, USB or parallel-port color camera, software).
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Supra Video Kit ($175, includes capture card, color
camera and software).

 &HT;    Computer detective snookered by software
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Further Adventures of Ace Warner, Software
Detective:
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. Using trusty Opinel knife, slice away shrink-wrap on a
package titled TuneUp, a Quarterdeck program. The box proclaims it
to be``the sure-fire way to keep your PC up-to-date.'' Online
hardware and software updates, virus protection and more!
</P>
<P>
   6:05 p.m. Unstick shrink-wrap from hand, scrape off on
wastebasket. Open box. Turn box upside down. CD-ROM case falls out.
</P>
<P>
   6:08 p.m. Put CD-ROM in drive, accept all defaults, let program
install while digging manual out of disk case and perusing it.
Program amounts to a $30-a-year subscription; purchase is good for
a year, then you've got to resubscribe. The genre hasn't changed.
Program offers TuneUp AV, an anti-virus program with regular
updates.
</P>
<P>
   6:13 p.m. Installation complete. View ReadMe file, which reveals
TuneUp AV won't find boot-sector viruses on FAT32 disks. Oh well.
So much for TuneUp AV.
</P>
<P>
   6:19 p.m. TuneUp connects to its home base. As expected,
announces there is an update for it. For TuneUp, that is. Suggests
I download it. But of course.
</P>
<P>
   6:23: p.m. Download begins. Takes 10 minutes to get to 5
percent. A big one. Go to Start menu. Select Programs. Select
Accessories. Select Games. Select solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   6:28 p.m. Cards are running lousy. Download has reached 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   7:15 p.m. Drag solitaire window aside to check download
progress. There's a little panel there that says ``Could not
complete download. Try again later.'' What do you mean, could not
complete download? Did the little guy pumping the handle get tired?
Did somebody refuse to work overtime? I never saw a message like
that. ``Connection failed,'' OK, but the connection is fine.
``Download interrupted,'' maybe. But it doesn't say it was
interrupted; it just says it couldn't do it anymore, as in ``Oh,
God, I just can't go on.''
</P>
<P>
   7:30 p.m. TuneUp can find nothing in the way of updates for me
but a lot of minutiae from Microsoft, and a few things I can't
identify. Log off. Get Diet Coke, handful of cookies.
</P>
<P>
   7:40 p.m. Using the Opinel, ravage the shrink-wrap on a package
called Update AnyWare, from GreenTree. Another of the ilk. Another
subscription. This one uses your own browser. Install program.
</P>
<P>
   7:50 p.m. Using Netscape, connect to the Update AnyWare home
page. Get password. It says I need to update my Netscape plug-in. I
say OK.
</P>
<P>
   8:01 p.m. I arrive at a Netscape location. It tells me that I
will find below the name of the Netscape plug-in I need. Below is a
line saying ``The plug-in you need for your plug-in type does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   8:07 p.m. Back to AnyWare. This time agreeing to download a
plug-in simply brings up a download dialog box that indicates it's
not a plug-in I need, but a whole new program. I agree, and the
download lasts for only about 10 rounds of solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   8:28 p.m. Go off-line, install the update. Back online, back to
AnyWare. Unwittingly, I select ``Check Out,'' which checks me out.
Log back in. It tells me I need to update my Netscape plug-in. It
wants me to download the same file I downloaded half an hour ago.
Bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   8:45 p.m. Toss two boxes into the trash. Put feet on desk. Talk
to guinea pigs. Wait to see if mysterious blonde knocks on door. Oh
well. Some days the magic works, some days it doesn't.

 &HT;    It's time for Fed to bite the bullet, cut interest rates
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woman was livid. She called the newspaper repeatedly to talk
to anyone who would listen to her rant about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The vehemence of her outburst seemed peculiar, considering how
tame interest rates are today. In recent weeks, the rates on
business loans, home mortgages and consumer loans have been
drifting lower, leaving millions of Americans in better financial
condition.
</P>
<P>
   So why was this woman so cranky?
</P>
<P>
   Because she is retired and lives on the interest from bank
certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury securities. When interest
rates decline on loans, they also fall on her savings. Recently the
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell below 5 percent for the
first time in the issue's 21-year history. For retirees who
remember getting double-digit yields in 1981, these may seem like
hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may not be easy to think coolly when your income is
falling, people living on fixed incomes are mistaken if they
believe they'd be better off having interest rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   Rates go up in response to growing inflation. They shot up in
the late 1970s and early 1980s because lenders were trying to keep
pace with stunning leaps in wages and prices. Clearly, the economy
is in much better shape today than in 1981, when the prime lending
rate was 21.5 percent and the unemployment rate was nearly 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the prime down to 8.25 percent, the rate of
joblessness has fallen to 4.6 percent. Home mortgages are at the
lowest levels since the 1960s. And the good news for retirees is
they are no longer getting hit with sticker shock every time they
go shopping. In fact, they are seeing many prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   The phone caller refuses to believe that. She is convinced
prices are still shooting up. For medical care and some services,
such as haircuts and dry cleaning, she may be right. But the
evidence is overwhelming most prices are stable or falling. For
example, retail beef prices are at the lowest levels in years. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture reports for Choice, Select and
ungraded cuts of beef, store prices averaged $2.54 per pound during
the first six months of this year, compared with $2.71 per pound
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That price drop is not unusual. This past summer, a gallon of
gasoline fell nearly 18 percent from the summer of 1997, coffee
dropped 11 percent and telephone bills declined 1.1 percent. Many
cars and trucks are being priced at 5 percent below last year's
models. This fall, Georgia Power Co. is seeking permission from the
Public Service Commission to lower rates for electricity; the only
argument is over how much to cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman on the phone was not interested in such data
because she is fixated on only one fact: Her income is declining.
She would rather see the great majority of Americans suffer with
higher mortgage payments, more expensive credit cards and longer
unemployment lines _ so she could feel more secure when she counts
her savings at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Her point of view is selfish but not uncommon. In coming months,
she and others who depend on bank CDs are likely to see further
cuts as the Federal Reserve Board tries to fight global recession
and price deflation. Some savers will be angry, but the Fed must
ignore their complaints. It's time to cut and cut again to keep our
country from joining Asia and Russia in an economic crisis.

 &HT;    Ya-Ya sister seeks keepsakes of mingled tears
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My four sisters and I are very close despite our geographical
distance, and are big fans of Rebecca Wells' book ``Divine Secrets
of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.'' would love to give each a gift featured
in the book, a lachrymatory. It is an old custom in which a small,
glass vial containing tears is worn on a chain. Where might I find
such a thing? _S. Elsea
</P>
<P>
   A: A vial containing mingled tears symbolizes the joy and sorrow
two people have shared. Bill Flenniken of Morrae Laboratory Glass
in Austin makes these vials (cork top, screw top, glass stopper or
completely sealed) to hang on a chain for $12 to $18 each.
Flenniken once sealed samples from 12 oil wells for a client's
family in keepsake vials.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have about a hundred Disney Beanies, most still in plastic
bags. I want to donate these to a group who will give them to
children. _ Jean Schaal
</P>
<P>
   A: Several nonprofit organizations would love this donation: For
example, here in Austin, Arc of the Capital Area, Austin Families,
SafePlace and Bastrop Family Crisis Center (phone: 512-321-7760.
Maybe others with bonus Beanies will follow your lead!
</P>
<P>
   Q: During my dad's recent hospital stay, my mom and I had
various discussions. The subject of the Mary Worth comic strip came
up (how, I do not know!). Mom maintains Mary Worth was originally
known as ``Apple Mary'' and sold apples during the Depression. She
further contends the movie ``Pocketful of Miracles'' (Bette Davis,
Glenn Ford) was based on the ``Apple Mary'' character. Your
mission, Jane, should you choose to accept it, is to verify my
mom's memory and prove to the doubters she knows what she is
talking about! _Diane B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your mother's memory has all the right components. Mary Worth
replaced the Apple Mary strip when its creator, Martha Orr,
retired. But the similarities end with the name. Mary Worth, a King
Features soap-opera comic strip, began in 1934 and centers on the
compassionate widow of Wall Street tycoon Jack Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pocketful of Miracles'' (a remake of the 1933 ``Lady for a
Day'') is the story of Apple Annie, a New York street vendor who is
turned into a Manhattan society matron to fool her daughter's
suitor. The Bette Davis character could have been based on Apple
Mary.

 &HT;    Commentary: A space of his own
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When our oldest son left for college, there was
much debate about which younger sibling would inherit his room.
Little did I suspect it would be my husband who claimed it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's moved out of our bedroom lock, stock and blanket.
He hasn't. But he has planted his flag and staked his claim to our
son's former desk.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, this man has sought a personal work space in our
various households. For 20 years, he has never had it. It doesn't
seem that much to ask, and we did try. He had his dresser top, but
it was too small. He had a nightstand, but it already held a phone
and clock radio. He had the kitchen table, but it was too messy.
We're talking one grumpy Papa Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, he disconsolately shuffled his stack of papers
from one corner to another on his dresser top. His income tax files
were stuffed in the back of kitchen cabinets, crammed between the
blender and the popcorn popper. His favorite family pictures were
tucked into his sock drawer. He had no place for his stamps, his
return address labels or his envelopes. He was a quietly unhappy
man.
</P>
<P>
   By nature, he is extremely well-organized. When we first
married, he had a nook or cranny for everything. His album
collection was alphabetized within each genre and his dresser
drawers were a thing to behold. He said it had something to do with
being able to find a pair of brown socks in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Then the children came along, and his orderly world was turned
upside-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want my own space,'' he'd say occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your side of the bed,'' I'd reassure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have things I need to file,'' he'd say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want one of the bathroom drawers?'' I'd offer
helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I did not fully realize the degree of his angst. I've
never had a place of my own. The desk that holds our computer is
open territory to everyone in the household _ including the dogs,
who curl up under it.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, every available flat surface in our house serves
as ``my desk.'' I do have a filing system, though. School papers
are by the range top, church and volunteer work papers are by the
microwave, mail is on top of the television, and my column writing
is on top of the coffee maker (perhaps in hope something will start
perking).
</P>
<P>
   I don't agonize over this. I figure someday, when all the
children are gone, we'll reclaim our house and fit it to our needs.
I can wait. My husband could not.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the two younger siblings bickered about who would move
what where, my husband took me aside and announced his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without me?'' I whimpered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, dear. I just want the desk.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, he got it. He took all one weekend to move his stuff. In
a happy flurry, he labeled file folders and organized pens,
pencils, stamps, rubber bands and pushpins. He set up a desk lamp,
plugged in his stereo and alphabetized his CD collection. He hung a
montage of photos, cards and messages on the wall in front of the
desk.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, he kept himself busy. I'd peek in and see him quietly
humming to himself as he bent to rearrange the contents of a
drawer. Who knew this would mean so much to him?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he proudly showed me his handiwork, opening drawers
with a flourish, pointing out the intricacies of his filing system,
the pristineness of the desktop itself. I was properly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, he slips off to the back room and does his stuff,
whatever that is. But he does it happily _ in his own space.
</P>
<P>
   The two younger boys will just have to wait. Maybe when they're
40, they can have their own space, too.

 &HT;    Hatred real national crisis facing America
 &HT;    By Bronwyn Turner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ All these special reports on television and talk
of national crisis take me back to my childhood days (never mind
how long ago that was.) When I was 10 years old, growing up in
Austin, we also were in the midst of a national cliffhanger in the
month of October.
</P>
<P>
   The watch words then were not ``high crimes and misdemeanors,''
but ``duck and cover.'' Missile sites under construction had been
discovered in Cuba and nuclear war was a real possibility.
</P>
<P>
   My parents sat down and prepared us and distilled water bottles
would be stored in the hall closet. When we heard the sirens, we
were to go into the bathroom and duck and cover our heads.
</P>
<P>
   At school, drills were held. Our building was located beside an
old rock quarry, with high limestone cliffs forming a giant
backstop to the baseball field. We carried our chairs over our
heads and walked out to those cliffs, the only shelter close enough
to shield us from the effects of a nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, neither the bathroom nor the cliffs would have
been adequate shelter. But perhaps the drills themselves were the
important thing and to keep us watching, waiting and ready.
</P>
<P>
   Today's national crisis seems small in comparison. But maybe we
need to have drills for this crisis also. How we react to all this
brouhaha may be just as important as the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The drill I would suggest is this: watch, wait and be ready for
hatred, for murmuring. May I suggest that hatred is woven all
throughout this matter and rationalized in a most righteous manner.
There is just a surprising amount of venom being vented these days
and ``I hope he dies a painful death from prostate cancer,'' a
caller said in a phone call to a congressman. Lest you think those
kind of calls just come from ``northerners'' in Washington, you
should listen to the ``Sound Off'' column entries that must daily
be edited out of the Lufkin Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   There is also veiled hatred and sarcastic digs at the personal
lives of the people involved in this scandal. There are many bad,
bad jokes.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, this is a complicated issue for Christians, with
matters of forgiveness discussed in the same breath as impeachment
and moral duty. In the face of such complexity, I bow to the wisdom
of someone with experience in such matters and Chuck Colson,
special counsel under President Nixon, became a Christian in the
midst of Watergate. He has special insight on politics and
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we forgive?'' Colson writes in a column in the Wall Street
Journal. ``And is it right for Christians to urge impeachment?
Isn't that a political question?''
</P>
<P>
   Colson, who asked for forgiveness himself, pleaded guilty to
breaking the law. He served time in prison. He is now chairman of
Prison Fellowship Ministries, and is frequently contacted by the
media these days for
</P>
<P>
   comparisons to Watergate. He also has comments about
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the president at his word in his statement of
repentance at his prayer meeting,'' Colson wrote. ``God forgives,
and so should we. All of us fall short of the glory of God; all of
us need to repent; none of us can be
</P>
<P>
   self-righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colson also stresses that ``Christians have no business
avoiding their political responsibility.... One of the unique
contributions of Christian thought to the founding of our
government was the rule of law and that and the idea that no man
can be above it. So it is not un-Christian to insist that justice
be done, that the president be held accountable for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``.... I hope and pray that Mr. Clinton is genuinely repentant,
that he will be restored to his family and that Americans will
forgive him. But that doesn't mean he's entitled to avoid the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   I would not differ from this stance, but would add this warning:
We are not entitled to hate. And there is a great temptation to do
that in this situation, and to rationalize it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this picture (borrowed from a National Broadcasting
Radio program): There is this dog and there are two very important
things to note about it. The first we know, the second we don't.
</P>
<P>
   First, this dog bites. Second, we do not know when.
</P>
<P>
   Hatred is a dog unleashed too often these days. Emotions are
running high; people are criticizing, judging, jabbing at others
and in that atmosphere, this dog is going to bite.
</P>
<P>
   It's just my two bits, but in my opinion, in this crisis, the
drill needs to be to pen that dog up and concentrate on issues and
not personal attack.
</P>
<P>
   To rationalize hatred while campaigning for truth and justice
may be a high crime in itself. We need to be above that.

A PLAY ABOUT GAY JESUS GIVES BLASPHEMY A BAD NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most electric moments in ``Corpus Christi'', Terrence
McNally's play about a gay Jesus, come when you arrive at the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Catholic protesters in white berets recite
Hail Marys into a megaphone. If you approach the police barricade
that pens them in, they ply you with leaflets charging that the
play portrays ``the Blessed Virgin screaming obscenely to St.
Joseph for sexual relations'' (sadly, it doesn't).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the controversy, the entire run at the 299 seat
Manhattan Theatre Club is sold out. Should you manage to lay hands
on a ticket, you have to run a gauntlet of burly security guards
and pass through an airport metal detector to get to your seat.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is disorienting _ part First Amendment vigil,
part X-rated movie. ``Corpus Christi'' became instantaneously
notorious in May, when the New York Post revealed that it depicted
a Jesus who has sex with his apostles. After receiving telephone
calls threatening violence, the Manhattan Theatre Club canceled the
production.
</P>
<P>
   But the play was reinstated a week later amid protests from
nearly every important dramatist in America and many elsewhere.
Since restoring the play, the Manhattan Theatre Club has been
congratulating itself on its fearless defense of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   What a letdown, then, to finally see ``Corpus Christi'' and
encounter neither blasphemy nor artistic courage. On the first
score, the play comes up short. It is not, in fact, a work of
savage (or even mild) anti-clericalism. There's no nudity or sex
onstage, and though the Vatican regards the notion of a noncelibate
gay Jesus as heretical, the playwright's intention is not
sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   McNally's updating of the life of Jesus is much in the spirit of
``Godspell'' _ if slightly more risque. But while there's nothing
very shocking about ``Corpus Christi'', its dramatic and
intellectual thinness is stunning. McNally's real offense is
invoking a great theme and an all-important principle for something
as trite and banal as this.
</P>
<P>
   The play is in essence a gay retelling of the Gospel. Thirteen
male actors perform a variety of parts in a series of sketches. In
the first, Joshua, a.k.a. Jesus, is born in a sleazy East Texas
motel room (the woman screaming for sex is on the other side of a
thin wall). At 1950s-era ``Pontius Pilate High'' in Corpus Christi,
Texas _ the town where McNally grew up _ Joshua is bullied into
playing football and taunted by his peers as a ``faggot.'' An
encounter in the school bathroom leads to an affair with a sinister
classmate named Judas.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Joshua hitchhikes across the desert and has
occasional conversations with his dad, God. He performs miracles
and gathers disciples. One is a doctor, another an actor, another a
male prostitute. They go to gay discos and spread the Word. Joshua
performs a marriage for two of the apostles. After a scrumptious
Last Supper, Judas betrays him with a French kiss. On the cross,
Joshua is mocked as ``King of the Queers.''
</P>
<P>
   The staging and performances are competent, if uninspired. The
real limitations are those of the writer, whose hallmarks are weak
sophomoric humor and a cloying sentimentality. It's a gag line in
this play when someone exclaims ``Jesus H. Christ!'' Joseph opposes
naming his son Jesus, because people will thing he's a Mexican. ``I
hear hammering,'' Jesus tells his mother. ``Of course you do,'' she
says. ``Your father's a carpenter.''
</P>
<P>
   This is silly, and not really funny, but the intent is not to
ridicule. The spirit is rather one of camp reverence. McNally, who
was raised a Catholic, apparently considers himself in sympathy
with the deeper meaning of Christianity, which he boils down to an
injunction to be nice to everybody. His setting is supposed to
teach us that Jesus loves gay people, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone miss the point, one of the apostles appears onstage
to explain it to the audience after the crucifixion. ``If we have
offended, so be it,'' he declares. ``He belongs to us as well as
you.''
</P>
<P>
   This is weak Christian tea. Equally pallid is McNally's
stereotyped portrayal of gay people. Like many of his other plays,
``Corpus Christi'' seems like ethnic PR, in the vein of ``Fiddler
on the Roof'' or the movie ``Moonstruck.'' McNally wants to present
homosexuals to heterosexuals as witty and wonderful. Though his gay
characters aren't always perfect, the overall picture is of a
delightful bunch of fellas. Gay men have flair, taste and humor.
They love Callas and cooking. They are sensitive and deep.
</P>
<P>
   Where McNally fails time and again is by drawing gay people as
types rather than complex characters. Watch the clip from the film
version of ``Frankie and Johnny,'' for which McNally wrote the
screenplay based on his own theater play. Michelle Pfeiffer's gay
next-door neighbor, played by Nathan Lane, is a cut-up, whose jokes
are usually variations of the theme of being a man who likes other
men.
</P>
<P>
   In another McNally play-turned-film, the maudlin soap opera
``Love! Valour! Compassion!,'' Jason Alexander minces around, puts
on women's clothes and continually bursts into show tunes. Watch as
he riffs on those annoying heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Corpus Christi,'' the disciple characters are thinly
sketched versions of familiar cliches: the taciturn hairdresser,
the buff male hustler, the yuppie lawyer. This may be Bethlehem,
but it's still The Birdcage.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on the fact that the play portrays a Christ who has
sex with his disciples, the press has encouraged a misconception
about McNally's work. Most people now assume that ``Corpus
Christi'' is an expression of ACT-UP-style radicalism _ the theater
of queer outrage performed with an NEA grant. But McNally wants to
enlarge the bourgeoisie, not ``epater'' it. ``Corpus Christi,''
like his other plays, is a work of unchallenging, middlebrow
subscription theater on a touchy theme.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's nothing wrong with middlebrow theater if done
well. Neil Simon has his place. But Neil Simon doesn't congratulate
his audience for being brave enough to laugh at his jokes. And Neil
Simon can be funny.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Sharon Stone, Kieran
Culkin and other actors in scenes from ``The Mighty.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Interviewing Sharon Stone these days comes with a built-in
warning _ not to mention a beefy bodyguard and a publicist poised
at her shoulder.
 &HT;    Three hours before Stone showed up for our interview at Beverly
Hills' Four Seasons Hotel her publicist marched into the room,
denied published stories that said Sharon was pregnant and warned,
``If you ask any questions about the pregnancy or her marriage the
interview will end right there. ''
 &HT;    When Sharon eventually showed up she looked gorgeous as always
but seemed something less than exuberant, admitting, ``I'm tired.
I'm fighting a cold. I always get this way when I do publicity
tours.''
 &HT;    Stone's mission was to talk up a storm about ``The Mighty,'' a
film in which she plays the unglamorous mother of a severely
handicapped young son, played by 15-year-old Kieran Culkin, younger
brother of McCauley Culkin.
 &HT;    It's a warm, sad tale about two boys handicapped in different
ways who use their imaginations and fondness for the legend of King
Arthur to forge a remarkable friendship.
 &HT;    The picture _ a hit at Cannes this spring, also stars Gena
Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton and ``X-Files''' Gillian Anderson in
an offbeat role as a loose, boozy broad.
 &HT;    But it's Stone who must sell the picture. She talks slowly and
without much fire, but looks pretty sensational in a gray cashmere
sweater and knee-high blue denim skirt, her blonde hair cut ultra
short _ ``I chopped it all off myself in a wild moment,'' she
explains.
 &HT;    ``Mighty'' director Peter Chelsom (``Hear My Song,'' 1991) says
when Stone read the script and agreed to play the plain-Jane role
he cautioned, ``Are you prepared to come as you are? You don't get
any special lighting or foggy filters for your shots.''
 &HT;    Stone, who also produced the picture, agreed; Chelsom says, ``It
was a commendable, noble ... and very intelligent thing for her to
do.''
 &HT;    The star herself makes light of the fact that Sharon Stone,
reigning Hollywood sex symbol should play a working-class mom. The
sexy image, she insists, is something male journalists have stuck
her with.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't exactly glamorous in `Last Dance,' was I?'' she
challenges, and indeed she did play a death row inmate in that 1996
picture. But it's difficult to forget that she zoomed her way to
the top of Hollywood's must-hire list after her role as the
psychopathic seductress opposite Michael Douglas in ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992).
 &HT;    Making ``The Mighty'' was different: ``I was impaled by the
emotion of this film,'' she says.
 &HT;    There have of course been big changes in her life in the last
year. For starters she got married, last Valentine's Day, to San
Francisco newspaper editor Phil Bronstein which caused her, she
says, to put less emphasis on her career.
 &HT;    It also brought her another home. In addition to the house she
owns in an upscale Los Angeles suburb, she now lives with her
husband in a high-rise apartment in San Francisco. And while Stone
wants to avoid motherhood and marriage topics, she did recount a
scary incident which took place a few weeks ago in the skyscraper
in the city by the bay.
 &HT;    The actress was trapped in an elevator for two hours between the
20th and 21st floors. She used her cell phone to call Bronstein,
who rushed to the building and talked her through the ordeal before
emergency rescue crews smashed their way to her from the adjacent
building and pulled her to safety.
 &HT;    ``The day after the rescue,'' Stone recalls, ``I fell apart when
I realized that the elevator could have crashed to earth and I
would have ended up an oil stain on the concrete. But strangely,
going through something like that brought Phil and I much closer
together. The rescue people were telling me to do one thing that
went against my gut instinct _ and Phil supported me by saying, 'Do
what you think is right.'''
 &HT;    Stone says she has become a regular housefrau and likes nothing
better than to bake up batches of cookies for her husband to take
to the guys on the paper. She's also developed a liking for writing
and has penned several short stories. ``I took a few lessons on how
to use a computer and finally was able to shop for three pairs of
jeans on the Internet. But it's not for me so Phil finally bought
me an old-fashioned typewriter.''
 &HT;    Besides ``The Mighty,'' she also stars opposite Woody Allen as
the voice of the princess in Dreamworks' new hit movie ``Antz.''
 &HT;    ``That was great,'' she says. ``I was able to do the voice-over
work in San Francisco without having to dress up in costume or
spend hours in a makeup chair.''
 &HT;    Her re-marriage and the fact that she hopes to become a mother,
says Stone, helped her weather turning 40 in March. (Her marriage
to producer Michael Greenberg ended after three years in l987.)
 &HT;    ``I often picked the wrong guy,'' she admits. ``I had problems
finding the right man simply because I never considered myself very
lovable. When boys came to my house when I was growing up it was to
see my younger sister Kelly. I was the ugly duckling in our family,
a real geek at high school. I had no sense of myself as a woman.''
 &HT;    But all that has changed since she met the macho Bronstein after
coming to San Francisco to star in this year's science fiction
movie ``Sphere.'' The film flopped but the romance blossomed.
Bronstein, say his friends, is a confident man with a strong sense
of his own identity who doesn't worry about becoming Mr. Sharon
Stone.
 &HT;    And he has certainly changed her perspective. ``I used to be in
love with my job _ and now I'm in love with my life and like my
job,'' says Stone. ``Stardom isn't the fuel of my soul any more.''

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ In the film ``Amadeus,'' composer Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart's patrons complained that his music had ``too many notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Simplify, they said. Take out a few.
</P>
<P>
   But to some students and faculty at the Hudson Valley Community
College, the musical genius has just the right number of notes.
</P>
<P>
   They believe in the Mozart Effect, a recent phenomenon that says
people learn better while listening to the music of Mozart and
others from the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The school has established a Mozart Effect Study Area in a
peaceful room in the campus library, where the soothing strains of
compositions written from approximately 1700 to 1825 play quietly
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   A test run for a few weeks last spring revealed a profound
effect on many students' work performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experiment was actually during final exams,'' said Susan
Blandy, an architecture professor and faculty librarian. ``And the
response was amazing. We had students come back and say they had
never done so well. Now we figure, why wait for final exams?''
</P>
<P>
   Blandy also is president of Troy's Friends of Chamber Music. She
actually experienced the Mozart Effect while studying philosophy in
college. She just didn't realize it while struggling to digest 150
pages of Plato a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting through the first paragraph,'' Blandy said.
``But then a friend suggested I listen to Bach and Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   The college's Mozart study area has room for about 25 people.
</P>
<P>
   Students may play tapes supplied by the school or bring their
own. It makes no difference what piece is playing, Blandy said. Nor
does it matter if the music is written in the major or minor scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the style that's key,'' she said, and its rhythmic,
logical syncopation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozart Effect is based on a study by Don Campbell, who
published a book by the same name. Classical musicians including
flutist James Galway, violinist Pinchas Zukerman and clarinetist
Richard Stoltzman swear by the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The human brain has two sides. The music elicits additional
activity that works to calm the ``chatterbox'' side and work with
the ``listener,'' Blandy said.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that cows give milk easier if classical music is
playing; some maintain the music eases labor and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really no surprise,'' Blandy said. ``Because this is
getting the other side of the brain to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blandy warned to steer clear of more rambunctious composers
like Strauss, Stravinsky and most especially John Philip Souza.
Instead, choose Bach, Hayden, Handel, Vivaldi, Pachelbell or even
early Beethoven _ anything before the Fifth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that helps students study has got to be a positive,''
said John Buono, president of the community college in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Naylor, a freshman majoring in electrical construction
maintenance, said he seeks out the Mozart Effect Study Area because
it is quiet, relaxing and there isn't a lot of disturbing activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is there, but it's just in the background,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Librarian Bob Matthews agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things I noticed was that everything was
calm, quiet and students were really working,'' he said.

<P>
   Despite its magnificent success, America is prone to odd bouts
of declinism. it worries about its economy, even when times are
good; it moans about its politics, even when government is
reasonably small and reasonably efficient.
</P>
<P>
   These days American pessimism is directed toward the impeachment
proceedings against Bill Clinton. The temper of the times, it is
conventionally supposed, is meaner and tawdrier than in the past:
more partisan, less statesmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   For goodness sake, cheer up. Things were a lot nastier in 1868,
during the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had some things in common with Clinton. Like him, he was
a centrist Democrat, a southerner who grew up poor, a president who
faced a Congress dominated by Republican opponents. Like Clinton,
he was possessed of some rhetorical skill; like Clinton, he
neglected to cultivate friends in Congress. Johnson would go off
round the country, attempting to get the upper hand with Congress
by winning the public to his side.
</P>
<P>
   But there the parallels fade: Johnson was far more obnoxious. He
would antagonize key lawmakers needlessly; during one unhappy
meeting, he used Sen. Charles Sumner's hat as a spittoon.
</P>
<P>
   His attitudes to race, even allowing for the temper of the
times, were even worse than Clinton's attitudes to sex. ``This is a
country for white men,'' he said in 1865, ``and by God, as long as
I am president, it shall be a government for white men.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's pessimists complain that the House is rushing to impeach
Clinton without pausing to weigh the consequences for America's
constitutional balance. Back in 1868, the House impeached Johnson
with a haste that makes the current pace seem glacial. One day
Johnson fired his war secretary, an ally of Congress. The next day
a House committee met to consider a resolution of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was but a few moments,'' The New York Times reported, ``ere
it was discovered that the seven Republican members of the
Committee were unanimous in the opinion that Johnson's action of
yesterday was such a palpable violation of the law.'' The committee
adjourned for one hour, time enough for a report to be prepared for
presentation to the full House; two days later, the House approved
it.
</P>
<P>
   Modern life, according to the declinist view, is lamentably
tinged by media sensationalism, which drives politicians to
grandstand before a frenzied populace. The day impeachment
proceedings began in 1868, The New York Times reported that the
galleries of the House were full long before twelve o'clock ...
before one the lobbies and the cloak-rooms overflowed with
ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   The politicians, untroubled by the absence of televised talk
shows, missed no opportunity for grandiloquence. ``This trial has
developed, in the most remarkable manner, the insane love of
speaking among public men... `` complained James Garfield,
congressman and future president. ``We have been wading knee-deep
in words, words, words ... and are but little more than half across
the turbid stream.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, too, partisanship is much decried. But Johnson was
impeached for no other reason than that Congress virulently
despised his politics. True, he had violated a law against firing
Cabinet officials without the Senate's say-so; but this law had
been recently cooked up by Congress to trap him, and was later
ruled unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the firing, the congressional Republicans had been
on Johnson's tail. In January 1867 Congressman James Ashley of Ohio
moved a resolution to impeach, apparently on the theory that every
vice president who had succeeded to the presidency had had a hand
in the death of his predecessor. The House inspected the diary of
John Wilkes Booth, whose assassination of Lincoln had brought
Johnson to power; it noted that 18 pages of the document were
missing, a mysterious fact which fuelled the kind of conspiracy
theories that now infect today's Republican and Democratic fringes.
When the assassination trail led nowhere, the House raked over
Johnson's private financial dealings and bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Set against all this, today's impeachment proceedings look
positively edifying. The Republican majority in Congress has
embarked on an inquiry almost reluctantly, and only after being
confronted with presidential wrongdoing that left little
alternative. No congressman, not even the wackiest firebrand,
suggests that Clinton should be impeached, as Johnson was, simply
because his policies are bad. American democracy, contrary to the
declinist fear, has become more tempered in dealing with partisan
tension than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   This increased maturity, moreover, owes much to Johnson's fate.
After he was impeached in the House, Johnson underwent a chaotic
Senate trial that ultimately resulted in his acquittal. At the
outset, nobody could agree on the most basic ground rules. But, by
the end, one central argument had been resolved. The Senate decided
that it would not impeach Johnson merely because it disagreed with
him, as though it were conducting the sort of no-confidence vote
common in parliamentary systems. It resolved, instead, that
impeachment required proof of specific wrongdoing; and that this
wrongdoing must be serious.
</P>
<P>
   One book on Johnson's impeachment, published in 1992, concludes
with the following judgment. After Johnson's acquittal, the author
writes, it was settled that ``Impeachment would not be a referendum
on the public official's performance in office; instead, it would
be a judicial type of inquiry in which specific charges were made
by the House of Representatives, evidence was received before the
Senate, and the senators would decide whether or not the charges
were proven.''
</P>
<P>
   This verdict is of more than academic interest: Its author is
William Rehnquist, the man who, as America's chief justice, would
preside over a Senate trial of Clinton. It is exceedingly unlikely
that, with Rehnquist standing by, the president's day of judgment
would be allowed to deteriorate into a demeaning witch hunt,
whatever the pessimists' predictions.

FAITH HELPS FLOOD-RAVAGED COMMUNITY REBUILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN GUTIERREZ-MIER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ On the night of Aug. 23, surrounded by
blackness and rising floodwaters, Claudia Coronado clung to a tree,
unable to see her 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Separated during the torrential rain spawned by Tropical Storm
Charley, Coronado could hear her son reply when she yelled out his
name. The moment was a test of her faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the end of the world,'' Coronado said of the
flooding that killed nine people and destroyed 581 homes in the San
Felipe neighborhood in this border city of 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The storm dumped 18 inches of rain, turning a placid creek in
the poor neighborhood into a torrent.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado said the rain began seeping into her home shortly after
midnight. She then decided to move her car to higher ground and
left her mother and child behind.
</P>
<P>
   `I didn't get very far and decided to abandon it and get back
home,'' she said. ``The water was so strong, I had to follow fence
lines in order to fight the current.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coronado described it, she almost made it home but had to
scramble up a tree as floodwaters rose and the current grew
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and son and other relatives were on the roof and we
kept yelling at each other,'' she said. ``I prayed a lot on that
tree and my faith is stronger because of the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Four hours passed before Coronado and her family were rescued
and reunited.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that tumultuous night with a sense of calmness
while sitting in the office of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic
Church, where she was filling out paperwork for federal relief.
</P>
<P>
   Her story isn't unusual, said the Rev. Jose Caracoza, pastor of
the 92-year-old church in the heart of San Felipe neighborhood. The
majority of those left homeless by the raging floodwaters were
members of the parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the floods, there were people who were angry _
even angry at God,'' Caracoza said. ``They asked, `Why me?' There
was a crisis in faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is one of many emotions most victims of disasters
experience, said the Rev. Norm Hein, vice president of chaplaincy
at Lutheran Social Services of the South in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When disaster strikes, reactions vary. You have people that
are angry at God, and those that praise God for sparing their lives
or loved ones,'' he said. ``It's making sense out of the sorrow
that the church and faithful can provide to make sense out of what
seems senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Hein has worked 20 years with Lutheran Disaster Response
Services and assisted disaster victims nationwide. He spent 17 days
last month in Del Rio helping flood-ravaged families.
</P>
<P>
   Since the flood, Caracoza has reassured parishioners that God
was with them that night and encourages them in their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is for them to pick themselves up and continue
walking with the Lord,'' Caracoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado has heeded her priest's advice, but she said her son,
Francisco, remains emotionally scarred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has nightmares and asks why God let this happen,'' said
Coronado, whose home was demolished by the flood. ``I hold him and
tell him it was nature and that God helped us survive.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Alderete home, located two blocks from San Felipe Creek,
scattered nails and fresh sheetrock are evidence that many families
are on their way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Alderetes said most of the progress on their home is due to
the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptist men came out and worked on our house and that helps me
believe God is out there and things will get better,'' said John
Ray Alderete, 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ruben Chairez, pastor of Primera Iglesia Bautista in
San Felipe, helped coordinate a statewide appeal to Hispanic
Baptist Churches calling for volunteers to help rebuild
neighborhood homes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, 92 volunteers from across Texas arrirved to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's important that we show all those affected by
the flood that God cares, regardless of their denomination,''
Chairez said. ``As brothers in Christ we have to give these people
hope.''

THIS YEAR'S HALLOWEEN STYLES WON'T MASK THE TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ With Halloween approaching, it's no surprise that
likenesses of Monica and Bill are hot tickets at costume shops.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers unfortunately couldn't get ahead of the political
ball. President Clinton's admission of an extramarital affair
didn't break early enough for them to mold rubber masks or
coordinate Halloween costumes.
</P>
<P>
   So customers are winging it, snatching up wigs, berets, cigars
and other props. For ``the dress,'' shops suggest the Gap, since
that's where Monica bought the now-infamous blue garment.
</P>
<P>
   Requests are high, too, for Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr
ensembles. But costume-hunters also will have to put together their
own Halloween wardrobe. Suggestions include power suits, with a
stringy blond wig for Linda and a briefcase, stern face and Bible
for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But the foursome aren't the only scary figures to make headlines
this year. Ghouls and gals are aplenty from which trick-or-treaters
can choose. Some to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind behind the bombings of
two American embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Arab garb is a must. And the costumed
trick-or-treater also should utter the words, ``Who, me?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   His likeness is easy to mimic. Think of Moses with a gun. If the
rod and staff can't comfort trick-or-treaters, maybe an Uzi will.
</P>
<P>
   _ Al Sharpton, the omnipresent civil-rights opportunist.
</P>
<P>
   A jury ruled in July that Sharpton and two others had defamed a
New York prosecutor by accusing him of participating in the rape
Tawana Brawley. In the 1987 case, the teen-ager claimed she'd been
kidnapped and raped by white police officers. A grand jury found
Brawley had fabricated her story.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton still won't apologize, now insisting even more loudly
that he's the victim of political persecution. He's shed his
trademark sweat suits and ornate gold jewelry for a business suit
and bullhorns. So his likeness might be difficult to emulate. But
whatever you do, your costume won't be complete without a portable
grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women.
</P>
<P>
   Last month NOW declared Monica and Bill's tryst was ``damaging
to the work place'' but said it wasn't sexual harassment. Hence,
the ``Clinton exception'' Ireland costume. It requires only the
wearing of a placard that reads, ``We won't stand for this behavior
... unless Bill did it.''
</P>
<P>
   To boost NOW's flagging image as they make their claim, perhaps
the other side of the sign should read, ``We are NOT an arm of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Me? I think I'll go as Miss Goody-Two-Shoes. Then, at least, I
won't have to wear a mask.
</P>

MILITARY GEARS UP TO DISPENSE VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Active-duty and retired military people soon will
have access to Viagra, the little blue pill that's helped thousands
of men overcome impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both local military hospitals say guidelines first
must be implemented before Viagra can be offered to patients at
Brooke Army Medical Center and Wilford Hall Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday,'' BAMC
spokesman Craig Martin said. ``It could be a couple of weeks; it
could be a month. We do not know. I don't want people reading your
story and lining up Tuesday morning thinking we have it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 3.5 million men nationwide have obtained prescriptions
since the release of Viagra in April. But the revolutionary drug
has been slow to make its way into military hospitals because it
only recently received funding in the federal budget, which took
effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The pill also can't be dispensed until it first is placed on an
approved pharmacy list, Fort Sam Houston spokesman Phil Reidinger
said. Military doctors have been prescribing Viagra over the past
several months to their patients, who then have purchased the drug
at civilian pharmacies, said Dr. Ed Sabanegh, a lieutenant colonel
and chief of urology at Wilford Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of providing Viagra to active-duty personnel,
reservists and veterans will be an estimated $50 million this
fiscal year, said Virginia Stephanakis, a spokeswoman for the Army
Surgeon General's Office. Stephanakis said she didn't know how many
of the 8 million active-duty personnel, reservists, retirees or
their family members in the Defense Department's medical system
have received prescriptions for Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   There are 573,000 active-duty soldiers, retirees and family
members in BAMC's nine-hospital, 14-state region, which stretches
from Texas to North Dakota and Louisiana to Arizona, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines for dispensing Viagra were issued Aug. 8 by Dr. Sue
Bailey, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Under
those rules, physicians may prescribe Viagra only after deciding
the drug is the best way to treat impotence, Stephanakis said.
Patients will receive just six pills each month.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which has been sold illegally because of high demand,
won't be replaced if patients report their supply has been lost or
stolen. Military pharmacies and their networks won't stock Viagra
because of its cost _ $10 per pill. Instead, doctors will order it.
</P>
<P>
   For men who suffer from impotence, Viagra blocks an enzyme that
breaks down a naturally occurring substance that causes erections,
Sabanegh said. Side effects of the drug may include headaches,
flushing of the face, indigestion, nasal congestion and mild vision
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients being treated for high blood pressure can take the
drug. But those taking nitroglycerine or suffering from severe
heart disease should not take Viagra. The drug isn't guaranteed to
work. And although Viagra widely has been hailed for giving
impotent men a second sex life, at least 69 men known to have taken
the drug have died, U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokesman
Brad Stone said.

   KENNEWICK-MAN (Undated) Kennewick Man is a scientific celebrity,
a cause celebre. The 9,300-year-old skeleton has been dubbed ``the
most significant archaeological find of the decade.'' Prominent
scientists are suing the federal government seeking access to study
him, arguing his bones are ``of major significance for science and
American prehistory.'' Native Americans claim the bones are those
of an ancestor, contending the ``Ancient One'' should be reburied
and is not the property of scientists. The federal lawsuit, which
has pitted scientists against the tribes, will resolve the question
of who gets first dibs on the bones. If Kennewick Man is determined
to be Native American, the tribes' claim may prevail. But the bones
are so ancient that determining ancestry is no simple matter.

KENNEWICK MAN: LEGAL STRATEGY OVERSHADOWS SCIENTIFIC QUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kennewick Man is a scientific celebrity, a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,300-year-old skeleton has been dubbed ``the most
significant archaeological find of the decade.'' Prominent
scientists are suing the federal government seeking access to study
him, arguing his bones are ``of major significance for science and
American prehistory.''
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans claim the bones are those of an ancestor,
contending the ``Ancient One'' should be reburied and is not the
property of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit, which has pitted scientists against the
tribes, will resolve the question of who gets first dibs on the
bones. If Kennewick Man is determined to be Native American, the
tribes' claim may prevail. But the bones are so ancient that
determining ancestry is no simple matter.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the task is the persistent notion that Kennewick
Man's long and narrow skull, among other things, suggests that he
was not Native American. Some have even proposed he may be of
European extraction _ a Caucasian.
</P>
<P>
   If public controversy were a good measure of scientific
significance, Kennewick Man would be one of the more profound
chapters in the history of American archaeology and anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Kennewick Man is in the limelight because of what he represents
in court, not because of what his bones may contribute to science.
Experts not involved in the flap say the discovery is of modest
importance, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just appears to support what scientists have been saying
for years,'' said Donald Grayson, an archaeologist at the
University of Washington and a highly regarded expert on
prehistoric America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this will change our view of Native American
ancestry,'' said David Meltzer, an archaeologist and professor of
anthropology at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ``The fact
that Kennewick Man doesn't look to some like a Native American
(skeletal type) doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The distant ancestors of modern Native Americans probably varied
a great deal more than we know, he said, so it would be wrong to
conclude skeletal differences imply a distinctly different lineage
or race.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennewick Man, whose bones were found two years ago after
they washed out of a bank along the Columbia River in southeastern
Washington, may prompt changes in law, if not science. The bones
have sparked a legal battle that has highlighted ambiguities in the
federal law that governs how ancient remains are handled.
</P>
<P>
   The law is the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act of 1990. It gives tribes a lot of say over Native
American skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began in July 1996 when two young men watching a
hydroplane race on the Columbia River noticed a skull in the water.
They notified law enforcement, and the coroner was contacted.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner called a local private archaeologist and occasional
forensic anthropologist, James Chatters, to have a look. Chatters
said at first he thought the bones might be those of a 200-year-old
white settler, because of Caucasoid skeletal features.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day, a closer look at the pelvis using a CT scan
showed it contained a stone spear point _ a Native American style
known as a Cascade point that was used 4,500 to 9,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Chatters' critics say, local tribes should have
been notified. Chatters said he assumed such notification would be
handled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which had jurisdiction
over the site.
</P>
<P>
   But the corps heard about the discovery only after it was
reported by the media and someone from the Confederated Tribes of
the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Pendleton, Ore., called to
complain that they hadn't been informed, said Dutch Meier,
spokesman for the Army Corps in Walla Walla.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, a custody battle erupted between the Umatillas and
Chatters, eventually drawing in other tribes and scientists, and
culminating in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Portland on behalf of
eight scientists in the field of archaeology and paleoanthropology
against the Army Corps. The corps had taken custody of the bones
from Chatters and planned to honor the Umatillas' request to
repatriate the bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to block the transfer,'' said Doug Owsley, a physical
anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution and one of the eight
scientists suing to gain access to the bones. ``It was clear they
were going to take the skeleton and bury it at an unknown
location.''
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, the scientists argue that the corps is
inappropriately denying them access to the bones and
misinterpreting the law. A key part of their claim is the argument
that the skeleton is of exceptional value to science.
</P>
<P>
   That legal strategem, along with Chatters' use of the misleading
word ``Caucasoid,'' helped set the stage for the weird saga of
Kennewick Man.
</P>
<P>
   Many accounts of Kennewick Man have suggested this is a
discovery so significant it could force scientists to rewrite their
theories about how humans first came to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an article in The New Yorker magazine June 16,
1997, criticized the government for ``withholding Kennewick Man,
who might turn out to be the most significant archaeological find
of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Such accounts are based on the notion that he's significantly
different from Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very different,'' Chatters said of the ancient
skeleton. The Richland archaeologist has retreated from earlier
claims he and his colleagues made about the skeleton appearing
Caucasian, but he's not backing down from the claim that Kennewick
Man is unique.
</P>
<P>
   If the radiocarbon tests done on a finger bone are accurate and
represent the rest of the bones, Kennewick Man is indeed the oldest
and most complete prehistoric skeleton ever found in the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the bones are rare doesn't make them
scientifically unique. There are a half-dozen or more such ancient
remains found in North America, and there's no credible evidence
yet to suggest the Kennewick Man discovery will not fit in with
those finds.
</P>
<P>
   What little we know about Kennewick Man, says the UW's Grayson,
indicates he was a descendant of one of those groups of prehistoric
Asians who migrated to this continent via today's Bering Strait at
least 13,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeological, genetic and linguistic studies support that
theory. What's debatable is if some people came earlier, how many
migrations took place and whether they traveled by coast-hugging
boats as well as by foot.
</P>
<P>
   A site that may revolutionize our understanding of how the
Americas were peopled is in Monte Verde, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Leading archaeologists, including Grayson and Meltzer, have
studied the site and confirmed evidence indicating people lived
there at least 12,500 years ago _ 1,300 years before the heretofore
earliest-known human presence in America, found in Clovis, N.M.
There is also preliminary evidence in Chile hinting at human
habitation as early as 33,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really cool,'' Meltzer said. By itself, he said, this
doesn't alter the conventional Bering Strait theory about how the
Americas were peopled. But it does seem to push the time of entry
back dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Finding 9,300-year-old Kennewick Man, by comparison, doesn't
lead scientists to rethink current theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting and useful, but perhaps not that
significant,'' Grayson said. What's really at stake in Kennewick
Man, he said, is the legal interpretation of the federal law
governing ancient remains.
</P>
<P>
   What may be at stake as well, he said, is the working
relationship between scientists and the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a real cooperative relationship,'' said Adeline
Fredin, director of history and archaeology for the Confederated
Tribes of the Colville Reservation. But the fight over Kennewick
Man has hurt that, Fredin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeologists have been digging up our ancestors' remains for
years, and the bones get put in boxes that get left in the back
rooms of museums,'' said Jeff Van Pelt, cultural resources director
for the Umatillas. ``We're not anti-science. We just want a say in
what happens to our ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act was
passed to address such concerns and has so far forced the
repatriation of tens of thousands of human remains back to tribes.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to a skeleton so ancient it may not be
definitively linked to any modern Native American tribe? The
scientists say the law is vague on that point and needs to be
clarified.
</P>
<P>
   The Umatillas have claimed Kennewick Man as an ancestor because
the bones were found on territory they ceded to the federal
government in a treaty. The group of scientists challenged the
claim, contending only intensive study could establish what, if
any, link exists to modern Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a paradox. The Umatillas don't want their ancestor's bones
desecrated by intensive study. The scientists say they need the
studies to determine if it's really their ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate John Jelderks, the Portland judge handling the
lawsuit, has ordered non-invasive tests _ at least for the first
phase _ to be done by an independent scientist at the UW's Burke
Museum of Natural History aimed at determining if Kennewick Man was
Native American. The remains are to be transferred to Seattle later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his own assessment of the skull, Chatters boosted the
Caucasian notion earlier this year when he released a facial bust
of Kennewick Man that many said looked like a white European,
resembling the lead character on the television series ``Star Trek:
The Next Generation,'' Capt. Jean-Luc Picard.
</P>
<P>
   Because nearly all the evidence so far points to Asia as the
ancestral home of the first Americans, it certainly would be
significant if Kennewick Man turned out to be a wayward European.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rule it out,'' contended the Smithsonian's Owsley,
one of the eight scientists suing to gain access to Kennewick Man.
Until further tests are done, he said, it would be premature to
dismiss that as a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the scientists, members of a California-based
pagan religion called the Asatru Folk Assembly have staked a claim
on Kennewick Man. They contend the remains are evidence that
ancient Vikings arrived in America first, before the Asian
ancestors of modern Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But another of the scientists suing for access to the bones, D.
Gentry Steele of Texas A&AMP;M University, believes Kennewick Man is
more likely to be Asian than Caucasian. What little is known about
the bones corresponds to what Steele and his colleagues in physical
anthropology have been reporting from studies of the other ancient
skeletal remains found throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be another sample confirming the hypothesis we
established in 1992,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steele's hypothesis, in a nutshell, is that some of the first
Americans emigrated from ancient southern Asia. The dominant theory
has been that the migrations came from prehistoric northern Asian
populations.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem a fine point, but it's a distinction that
probably helped cause the adversarial mess that now surrounds
Kennewick Man.
</P>
<P>
   The term physical anthropologists have used in the past to
describe a southern Asian skeletal type is ``Caucasoid.'' Northern
Asians are ``Mongoloid.''
</P>
<P>
   The southern Asians had a more European look to their skulls,
with a longer braincase and narrower face. The northern Asians had
a rounder face with a shorter braincase, much like the skulls of
many modern Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennewick Man's skull was different, more like the southern
Asian type than the modern Native American type, and so it was
initially described as a Caucasoid. But that doesn't mean white
man, Steele said, adding that he tries not to use such terms any
more because they are misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Even Owsley agreed, when pressed, that it is a bit far-fetched
to claim Kennewick Man is an ancient European. It's a notion that
persists not so much because of the evidence as because of the lack
of it, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used the word `Caucasian,''' Chatters contended. He
said the media misinterpreted his use of the word ``Caucasoid,''
which led to the mistaken impression that he was claiming to have
found an ancient white man.
</P>
<P>
   Chatters may have been careful not to say ``Caucasian'' when he
said the skull appeared ``Caucasoid,'' but he also didn't emphasize
the distinction. And two of his colleagues on Kennewick Man didn't
think there was any distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine MacMillan, an anthropologist at Central Washington
University, and Grover Krantz, an anthropologist at Washington
State University well-known for his work on studies of ``Bigfoot,''
or sasquatch, were both consulted by Chatters and asked to provide
their professional opinions on the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Both MacMillan and Krantz judged the remains to be Caucasian.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz went further, arguing that this meant a modern Native
American had no more of a claim ``to this skeleton than it would if
an early Chinese expedition had left one of its members here.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the tribes were concerned, the scientists were pushing
this extraordinary claim simply because it negated the law that
would have applied if the remains had been judged Native American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked with Jim (Chatters) for years,'' said the
Colvilles' Fredin. ``He has always been very professional and
precise. We had a very cooperative relationship up until this. ...
He saw an opportunity for fame, and he just made a lot of
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of scientists and other tribal members agreed with
Fredin and said the dispute over Kennewick Man could have been
avoided if the tribes had been promptly notified and allowed to
participate in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Chatters doesn't think so. He said the Colvilles at first
enthusiastically endorsed all sorts of studies and tests of
Kennewick Man to identify his family tree. As recently as April,
the Colvilles said they favored DNA testing aimed at determining if
the remains are Native American.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Umatillas took umbrage, Chatters said, all the
tribes fell in line _ against him and any form of scientific
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to insult these guys,'' he said. ``Working with
them is like walking through a minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it should be, said the Umatillas' Van Pelt.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists, few non-Native Americans for that matter, appear
to understand what it's like to have had generations of ancestors
and buried artifacts dug up and carried off to museums in the name
of science, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just information and data to us,'' Van Pelt said.
``These are our ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Umatillas believe that knowledge comes not only from
scientific study, but also from adherence to cultural and religious
traditions, he said. Van Pelt and other tribal members have been
working with young people to teach them respect for those
traditions, which includes respect for their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists need to remember that science is not necessarily an
end unto itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach our young people to walk in balance with the land and
within our traditional ways,'' Van Pelt said. Perhaps scientists
need to learn more about striking such balances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to have the remains go to the Burke, because we've
had a good relationship there,'' Van Pelt said. Some testing of
Kennewick Man is inevitable, he said, and can be accepted so long
as the rights of Native Americans are considered along with the
needs of science.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian's Owsley said he hopes there will be room for
collaboration after resolution of the Kennewick Man case.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``is well-intentioned legislation,'' Owsley said. But
the regulations are unclear when it comes to ancient remains, he
said, and such disputes will continue until the law is corrected.

INFERTILITY RESEARCHERS FOCUS ON AGING EGGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all the advances in fertility treatments,
one grim fact remains: Women's eggs begin a sharp decline in
viability after age 35, and by age 45 few can conceive their own
biological children.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians like George Lee at the California Pacific Medical
Center in San Francisco see it all the time. And they gently steer
their older patients _ who make up a large portion of those seeking
fertility treatments _ to consider using someone else's eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most women still insist on trying at least a few times
to use their own eggs before turning to egg donation and bearing a
child that is not genetically related, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire to reproduce with our own genetic material is very
strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While egg donation remains the best option for older women,
emerging techniques could provide better answers to the problem of
aging eggs. They also hold hope for younger women faced with cancer
treatments or premature menopause that may leave them infertile
before they've had a chance to have children.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing eggs, freezing some or all of the ovaries and even
transferring genetic information from old eggs into new egg cells
are the subject of research reported last week at the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine's meeting in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although no major breakthroughs were revealed, a New York team
created a stir with its announcement that it was attempting to
create a pregnancy with an artificial egg, using an older woman's
genetic material transplanted into a young egg cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, this has the potential of allowing these women
to have a unique form of egg donation, where she gets to keep her
chromosomes and just gets the young egg,'' said Jamie A. Grifo,
chief of reproductive endocrinology at New York University Medical
Center, where the experiments are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   With no success so far, that technology remains a distant
possibility. Closer at hand are the freezing techniques, which are
starting to be used with young women facing cancer diagnoses who
want to preserve their ability to have children.
</P>
<P>
   Although sperm has been frozen for years, and frozen embryos are
now used routinely in infertility treatments, freezing delicate
human eggs has bedeviled scientists.
</P>
<P>
   If freezing became workable, healthy women approaching their
35th birthday who want to delay child-bearing could ``bank'' their
eggs for future use. It could eliminate the wrenching custody
battles over frozen embryos, and ease the concerns of some couples
who have religious objections to creating fertilized embryos,
freezing them and discarding the ones that aren't needed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, teams around the world have been working on the
technology. The first birth from a frozen egg was reported in
Australia in 1986. In the 10 years following only a handful of
other clinics were able to do the same, always after hundreds of
tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with all these technologies (is that) if you can
try 500 times and you get one success, that's not something that is
clinically viable,'' said Kutluk Oktay, director of reproductive
endocrinology and infertility at New York Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Still, laboratories around the United States and the world are
reporting scattered victories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers from the Florida Institute for Reproductive
Medicine of the Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville, Fla., said
they had some success with keeping eggs at a higher temperature
before freezing. One woman implanted with embryos from the
procedure has given birth to twins, another is in her third
trimester with twins and a third has a single pregnancy now in the
first trimester, they reported.
</P>
<P>
   _ A group from the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and
Science of Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., won a
prize from the society for a technique using a freezing solution
containing much less salt. They had a 90 percent success rate with
mouse eggs, and in a small sample of 10 human eggs achieved a 100
percent success rate. Of the human eggs, 70 percent were fertilized
and developed to at least a four-cell embryonic stage, although
they did not report any pregnancy attempts.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Korean team said they revisited an old process using a
biological anti-freeze to get 65 percent to 85 percent of the eggs
to survive thawing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, scientists at last week's meeting said they wanted to see
more results from multiple laboratories before declaring techniques
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need confirmation,'' Oktay said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential technology involves freezing some or all of
women's ovaries, which contain many thousands of eggs in their
immature state. Wrapped in the protective tissue, those eggs better
survive the freezing process. But scientists still haven't
perfected ways of maturing them in the laboratory to the point
where they can be fertilized and create an embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Oktay reported this week that he had implanted previously frozen
human ovarian tissue into mice and was able to get the ovaries to
ripen and give off mature eggs.
</P>
<P>
   If the concept proves workable, the tissue wouldn't have to be
reimplanted in the same place in the body. In fact, scientists said
the idea would be to insert the ovarian tissue under the skin, wait
for the body to ripen the eggs, and then harvest them easily for
in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   In Scientists believe much of the problem isn't with the nucleus
of the cell, which houses most of the genetic material, but with
the machinery around it. By transferring the nucleus into a fresher
cell from a younger woman, scientists hope they can avoid many
problems of aging eggs. At least two teams, one at Cornell Medical
Center in New York and another at NYU Medical Center, are working
on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NYU's Grifo said he will know this week if a
44-year-old woman who was implanted with two embryos created with
the artificial eggs became pregnant. An earlier attempt with one
embryo and a 47-year-old woman failed. His group has permission
from the university's medical ethics board to try the procedure
with three more patients.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the resulting children would actually have two
mothers. The vast majority of the maternal genetic material would
come from the older woman, but there are a small number of genes,
called the mitochondrial DNA, that are part of the younger egg cell
and would also be passed on to the offspring.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Oprah Winfrey in
``Beloved'' are available. 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's one of the richest entertainers in history. A force of
nature whose fortune Forbes magazine estimates at $675 million.
There is little doubt Oprah Winfrey will become America's first
black billionaire.
 &HT;    Now she wants the world to take a long hard look at slavery, not
from the outside as Steven Spielberg did in last year's
unsuccessful ``Amistad,'' but from the inside _ the inside of Sethe
the slave in Toni Morrison's story ``Beloved'' (Plume, 1994).
 &HT;    ``It was doing this movie that took me to the reality behind the
words of _ (she starts to sing) _ 'Before I'll be a slave, I'll be
buried in my grave.'''
 &HT;    Moments before, she had bounced into a hotel in Chicago, looking
drop-dead gorgeous. On the current cover of Vogue she looks like a
high fashion model, dressed completely in brown, accented by a
razzle-dazzle gold watch and a pair of spectacular diamond
earrings.
 &HT;    Born to unmarried teenagers in Mississippi, Winfrey never
struggled for anything so much in life as to make ``Beloved'' into
a movie. She spent 10 years trying to bring the story to the
screen, discovering in the process, she says, ``the real meaning of
life.''
 &HT;    Somehow in the story of Sethe who kills her infant daughter to
save her from slavery, Winfrey sees herself. ``I felt when I read
this book, that I was Sethe and that Sethe was me,'' she said,
``and that we were all connected somehow. I was stunned and
overwhelmed and couldn't even articulate what I was feeling.''
 &HT;    She's seen the completed movie many times but every time it has
the same effect on her. ``I need a lobotomy after it,'' she laughs.
``I am just hysterical, crying every time like I'd never been in
the movie, like I hadn't lived it for 10 years. I couldn't believe
my own emotion.''
 &HT;    There were days when she was so upset that director Jonathan
Demme had to give her the day off. ``I was crying and crying and
crying,'' she said. ``Finally Jonathan said, 'We're gonna turn the
camera around on Danny (Danny Glover who plays slave Paul D) and
just let you cry it out. And we'll come back tomorrow and shoot
you.'''
 &HT;    Making the film, she insists, changed her focus on life. She was
tired. She has palatial homes: on the lake in Chicago, on a
160-acre spread in Indiana, on an 85-acre ranch in Telluride Colo.
So who needs the grind of a daily TV show?
 &HT;    ``After 'Beloved' I thought, who wants to be sitting everyday
working on a talk show? I was gonna free myself. But getting to the
realization of what slavery was, I thought, how dare I think tired?
I come from a people who had no shoes, I come from a people who did
not know which way north was, who didn't have milk for their
children. So how dare I with all my square footage and all my Prada
shoes think that I'm tired and need a rest?''
 &HT;    All her life the 44-year-old Winfrey has been a dreamer, always
knowing there was more in store for her than poverty and a
dysfunctional family. ``I remember sitting on the linoleum floor in
Milwaukee when I was 10 watching the Oscars. I never missed that
show and Sydney Poitier won for ``Lilies of the Field.'' And then
something clicked in me that said, 'A colored man did that. I can
too.'''
 &HT;    But even when she started in broadcasting at a small radio
station in Nashville, Tenn., she could not possibly have imagined
reaching icon status.
 &HT;    ``What's it like to be an icon?'' she mocks in a singsong voice.
``I didn't even know what an icon was till a couple of years ago.
Because your perception of yourself is not based on what other
people think of you. Like that Vogue cover. I know I spent two days
working with them on it. But that's not how I see myself.''
 &HT;    The best part of it all, Winfrey says, is when she feels
genuinely loved and appreciated by her audience.
 &HT;    ``Growing up I wanted to be Diana Ross. And you know you're
always looking at other people, thinking, if I could just be that,
or if I could have her hair. And then one day a woman in Midland,
Texas, wrote me a letter saying, 'Watching you be yourself every
day makes me want to be more of myself.'
 &HT;    ``I think I want that on my tombstone.''

THE CASUES MARITAL INFIDELITY AND ITS EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTNOU  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Infidelity and sex. Always tantalizing subjects,
they have gone beyond the bedroom, tabloids and talk shows to the
national news arena, thanks to the never-ending saga of Bill
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is infidelity? And can those marriages be saved?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say spouses can be unfaithful even when there is no
extramarital sex. Or just a little. In fact, say experts, you don't
even have to touch or be touched.
</P>
<P>
   It is the secrecy, the inherent lying, that defines an affair.
If in doubt, ask yourself: Would my spouse be upset if he or she
knew I was ``seeing'' this other person? If the answer is yes, say
experts, then you are being unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   To marriage counselors, sex therapists, relationship experts and
psychologists, this admission of secrecy is the big ``Ah-ha!
Gotcha!''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the wronged spouse is more upset by the notion of a
double life and the betrayal of trust than the sex itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex for sex's sake is not a violation of the main
relationship,'' said Ellyn Bader, a counselor at the Couples
Institute in Menlo Park, Calif. ``To me, infidelity exists when
there's lying and sneaking around. That's the unfaithful part.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the number of trysts doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time is an affair,'' said Mary Lamia, a Kentfield, Calif.,
psychologist who does couples therapy. ``An affair is any action
that diverts from the fidelity and loyalty in a marriage. It is a
breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be one time or 100 times.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, then. Who or what is to blame for this affair?
</P>
<P>
   Is an affair a reflection of lowly moral character, of someone
who is weak and cowardly, arrogant and self-centered ... an utterly
loathsome, duplicitous, thrill-seeking hedonistic jerk?
</P>
<P>
   Or is the affair a symptom of a troubled marriage, a pathetic
shell of a relationship where needs go unmet, communication is
nonexistent, and resentment and boredom have replaced love?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, say experts, is a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   People have affairs for all sorts of reasons. There's the allure
of something forbidden. The thrill of taking risks and getting away
with it. The need to be attractive.
</P>
<P>
   They do it for power and they do it for revenge. They do it out
of boredom and they do it out of loneliness. They do it for fun and
sexual adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, monogamy is tough for anyone, say counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monogamy is really hard,'' said Sara Alexander, a San
Francisco couples counselor. ``It's not just a relationship issue
or a character issue. It's an existential issue. Our hearts and
bodies are not monogamous people.''
</P>
<P>
   When marriage was invented, about 2,500 years ago, ``most people
had the courtesy of dying young, before they got bored,'' said
Marty Klein, a Palo Alto, Calif., marriage counselor and sex
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surviving spouse was then free to have another sexual
experience in another marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, throughout history, said Klein, polygamy was an accepted
practice in many societies. He said marital tensions about fidelity
arise today because monogamy, though imposed by societal
conventions, is not natural.
</P>
<P>
   No marriage is perfect or trouble-free. But in a marriage with
avowed monogamy, an affair is proof that at least one spouse has
serious dissatisfactions, and that the couple is not talking
honestly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Extramarital sex is the smoke. But where there is smoke, experts
say, there's fire.
</P>
<P>
   Gender differences play a role in the motives and rationales,
experts say. Women are more likely to have an affair if they are
dissatisfied with their marriage. They are usually looking to fill
an emotional need, and are therefore more likely to get emotionally
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Men, on the other hand, tend to compartmentalize their lives.
They're more capable of having sex just for sex's sake, without any
emotional attachment. And they can have sex with another woman even
if they are happy in their marriage and they love their wife.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the longer the affair, the more romantic and
emotionally involved the cheating spouse becomes, the harder it is
to mend the marriage, said David Sitzer, a psychologist at Family
Services Mid Peninsula, a counseling agency in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to saving the marriage, he and other counselors said,
is to talk, talk, talk.
</P>
<P>
   Couples must also have a heartfelt desire to work it out.
</P>
<P>
   To the pros, professional counseling is a must. Yet only a small
percentage of couples with infidelity problems go to a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey by the American Association for Marriage and
Family Therapy, in Washington D.C., infidelity is second only to
physical violence in the harm it does to the wronged spouse's
mental health. Infidelity even topped drug and alcohol abuse by a
family member, and financial problems, as a cause of marital
distress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, only 45 percent of those surveyed said they would suggest
professional help if a friend asked for advice about coping with an
unfaithful spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area therapists say their key job is to get each spouse to
open up, to be honest with their spouse _ and with themselves _
about their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   This is harder than it sounds. People don't want to hurt their
spouse's feelings with the truth. They fear their spouse's anger,
abandonment or rejection. Sometimes, they don't even know what
they're feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, said counselors, this inability to be forthright with
their spouse drove them to somebody else. But now, with the
marriage in crisis, it is often easier to open up, said counselors.
</P>
<P>
   An affair that has been exposed ``is a turning point in a
marriage,'' said Jack Morin, a San Francisco psychologist and
author of ``The Erotic Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shakes things up,'' he added. ``The disenchantments are
suddenly out on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, an affair doesn't have to be a marital disaster, said
Pete Roussos, a counselor in San Jose, Calif. ``It can be a real
opportunity to reveal what isn't being said,'' and for couples to
communicate what they want, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With honesty, the trust that has been damaged is sometimes
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough for the straying spouse to pledge ``it will
never happen again,'' counselors said. Both spouses must believe
and want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you return to monogamy out of choice, it's different than
when you stay in monogamy out of fear,'' said Marcia Perlstein, a
Berkeley, Calif., family counselor.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are times, said Alexander, when the pain doesn't
go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes helping people,'' she said, ``means helping people
separate.''

`THE MIGHTY' CASTS SHARON STONE IN NEW ROLE AS MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's a scene in ``The Mighty'' when Sharon
Stone is told her crippled son's health is deteriorating. She walks
over to a coffee machine in the hospital, murmurs something about
getting hot chocolate, then breaks down in a rage against the
machine as it slops liquid over a cup, slamming and kicking it
until tears spill from her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That scene was hard, said Stone, but not as hard as the one
where Elden Henson _ one of the two teenaged stars of the movie _
runs barefoot across the snow to catch up with an ambulance, only
to be told by Stone that there's nothing he can do to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get to the emotional depth of that scene without
being sentimental,'' said Stone. ``Eldon actually helped me. He was
very patient and supportive and loving, standing there in the snow.
... It was so cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the role of a middle-aged mother in a movie rated PG-13
breaks new ground for Stone, star of ``Basic Instinct,'' ``Quick
and the Dead,'' ``Sphere,'' and ``Casino,'' for which she received
an Academy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mighty,'' which is based on Rodman philbrick's book,
``Freak the Mighty,'' is her best film so far, said Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm growing each time. I don't take a part unless I
feel I will grow from it,'' she said. ``And I think people see
that. I think people are sure now that I'm an actor who's an artist
and not a celebrity who's a sensationalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone provides a distinctive voice to the animated film
``Antz,'' which made $16.8 million in its opening weekend (Oct.
2-4). Her next step was ``The Mighty.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miramax sent her the script, Stone agreed to co-produce the
movie through her Chaos Productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the project was very good, but a film starring two kids
... unless someone attached themselves to it, it probably wouldn't
get made,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was already talking about the film at Cannes in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Miramax told me I could play a mom, after many people
told me that was a complete impossibility, I jumped at the
chance,'' she said, adding, ``Not having children of my own, I had
no comprehension of the savage, wild, uncontrollable thing that
happens to you when your child is in danger. It made life difficult
for everybody, but it made life great when I got to see the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's co-stars on ``The Mighty'' said she didn't made life
difficult at all. Kieran Culkin, 15, who plays Stone's son, said,
``Sharon told me not to try to act like my whole body is
handicapped. She said, `Make this foot handicapped and nothing
else.' And when I did that, it made it a lot easier, because my
foot and whole body moved easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Henson, 20, said, ``Sharon dispelled all my inhibitions and fear
that I was feeling because she was `Sharon Stone.' She grabbed my
hand and said, `You can do this, this is your scene, don't worry
about me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stone returned the compliment, saying, ``Elden Henson is a
wonderful actor, very developed as an artist. He was very helpful
to me in the hospital scene, which was much more of an
improvisational scene. It's hard for a young actor in an
improvisational scene with the other actors going crazy. I'm very
proud of both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone is also proud of the final product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is much better than I imagined it could be,'' she
said. ``Who wouldn't be happy to see this movie _ to see it as a
family, the closeness it would inspire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mighty'' has some parallels to John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice
and Men'' _ a friendship formed between brute strength and
smartness _ but ``The Mighty'' goes beyond that, said Stone, into a
world of teenagers caught up in dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what really drew me to it. It doesn't condescend to
teenagers. It inspires teenagers,'' said Stone. ``It lets them know
you can be compassionate. It says the right things, building this
strong sense of the young boys' struggle.''

IN SEARCH OF `BIGFOOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For $50, Tim Ford will tell you all about the
Bigfoot he saw earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   He'll explain how on Saturday night, when he was roasting
marshmallows at a campsite in Northern California, he heard a loud
rustling in some nearby bushes, and that's when it all started.
</P>
<P>
   Ford shined his flashlight and spotted an ``enormous furry
creature, 9-feet tall, with huge yellow eyes, and with arms that
were hanging way past its knees,'' he told Fish and Game Lt. Don
Jacobs. Even from a distance, there was ``a pungent, sickening
odor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the night continued, Ford could hear ``screams'' from
the ``man-beast.'' The next morning, footprints were discovered
that were ``20 inches long and 6 inches wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 22, of Redding, Calif., was joined by James Harmon, of
Reno, Nevada, and three other unidentified friends. They were on a
hunting trip, camping near Mud Springs, located south of a small
settlement called Wildwood in national forest west of Redding. Ford
told me that he is now charging $50 per session to describe what
happened because it is otherwise ``a complete waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what's weird about this story? Wait, don't answer that.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, I surveyed this specific area, and many
years ago spent a fair amount of time here when one of my best
friends lived in nearby Platina, population 150 (including dogs).
And once I was assigned by former San Francisco Examiner publisher
Will Hearst to spend six weeks afield, looking for Bigfoot,
scrambling in some of the most remote places in North America,
selecting them only after months of research and interviews with
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Now get this: We found footprints in snow that were 17 inches
long, 6 inches wide. For a brief moment, exactly where we thought
we might see a Bigfoot, the scientist among us spotted the backside
of a large, brown, hairy creature, about a mile distant, high on
the opposite side of a canyon.
</P>
<P>
   In one terrifying moment while staking out a spring, the only
water source in a 5-mile radius, I heard something approaching in
the brush, a one-two, one-two step, a biped, not a bear. And at
night, we heard this strange thumping noise, as if Bigfoot was
thumping a hollow log with a stick, calling for a mate, always in
five rhythmic thumps.
</P>
<P>
   When we found the 17-inch footprints, Hearst got worried and
became extremely nervous about what I might write. When I checked
in at the office, he came up to me and said, ``You didn't actually
find the thing did you?''
</P>
<P>
   Heh, heh. Now for the rest of the story, as some may remember:
</P>
<P>
   The 17-inch footprints were actually boot prints of a 6-foot
man, prints that had melted out in the snow, which we determined by
measuring the stride length between the prints.
</P>
<P>
   That large hairy creature was stalked, then spotted again, and
it turned out to be a large black bear but one with brown fur.
</P>
<P>
   At the stakeout of the spring, the Bigfoot walking in the brush
turned out to be an expedition partner, who after two hours of
waiting, decided on his own to scramble on a game trail to the
spring, trying to flush out anything toward my hiding spot, and in
the process, practically scared the whiskers off me.
</P>
<P>
   And that strange thumping noise? It is the mating call of a blue
grouse in deep forest wilderness, and it really does sound like
someone thumping on a hollow log.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, there is this one area where we found nothing but where
we figured a Bigfoot could live undetected for generations. I've
often thought about this region, and remember how two 80-year-old
Hupa Indians told me that if I wanted to see Bigfoot, this would be
the place.
</P>
<P>
   But it is nowhere near Mud Springs, the spot Ford pinpointed as
the site of his Bigfoot encounter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long, twisty drive to reach Mud Springs, but it is
accessible by anybody in a car. This region is just above the
transition zone where valley oaks give way to conifers, with a few
small streams and springs sprinkled amid an area that has been
extensively logged. The summer heat and lack of water make it
difficult for many species, and hence, wildlife is not as abundant
as in other habitats. It is the natural beauty in spring and fall,
lack of people, and nearby little-known Chanchelulla Wilderness
that inspires most to visit.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bigfoot episode was first reported, the first thing I
noticed was how ``perfect'' the story was, that is, it had
everything: a sighting, detailed description, footprints in the
dirt, pungent odor, frightening shrieks at night. I can't think of
another account that had all the elements; most have just one or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife expert Paul Wertz of the DFG agree that it seemed ``too
perfect'' and that it ``conjures up the idea of somebody who has
done a lot of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the DFG ``denied any involvement.'' After all,
Wertz said with a laugh, ``Our Bigfoot suit is at the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   But he mentioned that even if only one of the thousands of
reported Bigfoot incidents is true, then Bigfoot is real, it's out
there, and like many, he knows of conservative, conventional folks
who swear they have had a Bigfoot experience.
</P>
<P>
   The best research on Bigfoot was conducted in China, where a
team of 30 scientists set out to document more than two dozen
reports of Yeti, as it is known there, that occurred over a
five-year span. After six months, the scientists found their
Bigfoot all right, and he was real, not imaginary. Their Bigfoot
turned out to be a wild man, a truly undeveloped man who had lived
like an animal for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me tell you what happened when I was out researching
this story. I never saw Bigfoot, but one night there were these
bright lights, and I looked up and saw this spaceship land in a
meadow, then these beautiful space aliens walked out and invited me
in.
</P>
<P>
   For $50 I'll tell you what the spaceship looked like, for $100
I'll tell you about the beautiful space aliens, for $500 I'll tell
you about the inside of the spaceship, and for $1,000, whether it
was good or not.

CAROLINA'S LANE GROUNDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Carolina Panthers' running game started
slowly and went downhill from there, finally grinding to a halt in
the fourth quarter, in which the Panthers ran the ball just five
times for minus-3 yards in yesterday's 27-20 loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough day for Fred Lane, Carolina's workhorse back. But
not because he was getting beaten up by Cowboys defenders. Instead,
Lane, who has accounted for 78 percent of the Panthers' carries and
77 percent of their rushing yards this year, missed the team flight
from Charlotte, N.C. on Saturday and was held out of the game by
coach Dom Capers.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's replacement, Anthony Johnson, managed just 28 yards on 16
attempts, a 1.8 yards-per-carry average, and the Panthers' longest
running play of the day went for a mere 4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just told me I wasn't going to start,'' Lane said after
spending the afternoon kneeling by himself on the Texas Stadium
sideline, ``but I kind of figured I wasn't going to play at all.
I've been around here awhile, and my mama didn't raise no dummy,
you know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   He meant that he knew from the moment he arrived at Charlotte's
Douglas International Airport and was told the Panthers' charter
flight had already boarded that he wouldn't see the light of day
against the Cowboys. Still, being the competitor he is, Lane
decided to give it a shot, running out to the tarmac and hoping
Capers would let him on.
</P>
<P>
   But with his team winless, Capers wasn't exactly in the mood to
be forgiving, so the plane took off without Lane with several
players on board chanting, ``Fred-dy! Fred-dy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was frustrating,'' Lane said. ``But it just happened.
Everyone has missed a plane. I'm not the first one and I won't be
the last.''

TV DELAY: TECH START UP IN AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if they held a football game and no one knew when to show
up?
</P>
<P>
   That remains the case for Saturday's Texas Tech-Colorado contest
in Boulder, Colo., which has no assigned kickoff time and was not
included on the list of Big 12 telecasts announced yesterday by
league officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen, Big 12 associate commissioner, said he expects the
game to be played at 12:30 p.m. as a syndicated telecast on
KXTX/Channel 39. But league officials must confer today with
representatives from ABC before announcing a starting time.
</P>
<P>
   Questions arose yesterday when ABC selected the Kansas
State-Oklahoma State game as its 2:30 p.m. telecast, thereby
relegating the Tech-Colorado game into the league's syndicated TV
window. Normal starting time for syndicated telecasts is 11:30
a.m., or 10:30 a.m. Mountain Time in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp objected, saying his
school had an agreement with Big 12 officials that no game could
start before 11:30 a.m. in the city where it is played.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the contest back one hour, to a 12:30 p.m. start in
Texas, would force the conclusion to overlap with the ABC game.
ABC's contract calls for exclusivity on Big 12 telecasts in the
2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. window, a point league officials must
clarify today before setting a kickoff time between No. 22 Tech
(6-0, 3-0) and No. 19 Colorado (5-1, 2-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to ask Colorado to play at 10:30
\RMountain\S,'' Allen said. ``What we're trying to do is get things
ironed out with ABC and make sure we're all on the same page'' to
permit the overlap in Big 12 telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he is ``so confident'' the Tech-Colorado game will be
a 12:30 p.m. telecast that league officials have not contacted
other schools about a fallback option. If the Tech-Colorado game
goes untelevised, each school would lose $72,500 in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the part that bothers Tech coach Spike Dykes, who
has grown weary of seeing the kickoff time listed as TBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they let us know before Friday what the game time is,
so we can make some travel plans,'' Dykes said. ``TBA is just
wearing me out.'' Extra points Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl
officials confirmed yesterday that the Jan. 1 game will be a 10
a.m. telecast on the Fox Network. The game, which will match a Big
12 team against a Southeastern Conference opponent, will kick off
at 10:08 a.m. and will be the first of six bowls televised on New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes, on breaking into The Associated Press rankings at No. 22:
``I'm glad we're ranked, but you can't go to the bank and borrow a
bunch of money on it. That shouldn't be a concern of this team at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M jumped from No. 18 to No. 10 in the AP poll on the
strength of its 28-21 upset of Nebraska, marking the Aggies'
highest ranking since the team was No. 8 before a 14-7 loss to
Texas Tech in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Texas quarterback Major Applewhite, who threw for a career-high
293 yards in the Longhorns' 34-3 rout of Oklahoma, improved to 17th
nationally in passing efficiency (146 points). Applewhite is one
spot below a fellow freshman, Georgia's Quincy Carter (146.6), and
one ahead of Cade McNown (145.7), UCLA's Heisman Trophy candidate.

DEION REFUSES TO LET VICTORY SLIP FROM COWBOYS' GRASP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ ``I didn't find God, God found me,'' Deion
Sanders said softly yesterday at Texas Stadium. Thankfully for the
Cowboys, so did Carolina's Steve Beuerlein when it mattered most,
</P>
<P>
   If it's the power of prayer, as Deion suggests, then maybe we
should all join hands and take a knee.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' interception of Beuerlein's desperation pass late in
the fourth quarter helped the Cowboys seal a 27-20 victory that was
on the cusp of slipping through their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Until his huge interception late in the game, it had been a
relatively uneventful afternoon for Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   He'd done his usual playing to the crowd. He'd pointed to the
heavens, giving glory to God while being sure that all eyes were on
No. 21. He'd played offensive decoy. He'd strutted. He'd done the
``Do-rag Boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd also been basically a nonfactor in the game, missing a
tackle that allowed Carolina to break a big play and fair-catching
several punts.
</P>
<P>
   Mama Beuerlein didn't raise any stupid children. Son Steve
hasn't stuck around in the NFL all these years by throwing in the
direction of the game's best cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Until he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is like Michael Jordan,'' Cowboys defensive
coordinator Dave Campo said of Sanders. ``He can make a play at any
time. You attack him enough times, he's going to hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurt you bad.
</P>
<P>
   The play wasn't designed to go to Sanders' man, but a frantic
Beuerlein, facing a third-and-13 situation from the Cowboys' 44
with the clock ticking down to the two-minute warning, was chased
left out of the pocket by the Cowboys' pass rush. He spotted
wideout Mark Carrier, working on Sanders, breaking to the left
sideline near the 30-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was keying the inside receiver,'' Sanders said. ``They'd
been hurting us all day with that inside guy running straight up
the field and I was trying to make a play on him and my man
\RCarrier\S ran an out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a tremendous pass rush on that play. That forced the
quarterback to get out there and throw the ball to me because I
don't think I was the go-to guy on that play, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a cardinal rule: Quarterbacks try not to make a habit of
making Deion the go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a great play but you expect that,'' said Beuerlein,
getting the start because No. 1 quarterback Kerry Collins walked
into head coach Dom Capers' office at mid-week and confessed that
his heart wasn't into the game. ``He's going to make a great play
every game. I knew I had to throw it outside, I just didn't get it
far enough out.''
</P>
<P>
   There may not be a ``far enough out'' when Sanders is defending,
even for a red-hot Beuerlein, who started the fourth quarter having
completed 16 of 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many plays as they made on us at the end of the game, they
had to go back to Deion, and it cost them,'' Campo said. ``We were
overloaded \Ron the opposite side\S and there was no way they were
going over there. That's something you can do when you're ahead
that you can't do when it's even-steven all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't go near him until late in the game. Then they made
two throws \Ron Sanders' side\S and on the third one, he picked it.
If he had that same set of conditions 10 times, he might put seven
of them in the end zone. When he touches the ball and he's got a
lot of open field like that, he's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   He has become perhaps the Cowboys' most dangerous weapon, a
potent threat with his ability to return an interception or a punt,
or contribute offensively.
</P>
<P>
   A bold correspondent might even venture to say that Sanders has
been the Cowboys' clear-cut MVP for the season's first six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me involved in that,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
pleaded, ``but you'd be a smart guy if you said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can measure what he has meant to our team,''
Gailey said. ``The guy has created a sense of excitement and
resolve that we're going to find a way to win, somehow, some way.''
</P>
<P>
   By hook, crook or answered prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a tremendous inspiration,'' Campo said. ``He's
always been one of the catalysts of the team, not so much from a
vocal standpoint but from a confidence standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling real at peace with himself right now. He's
feeling really good about himself and when he's in that mode,
that's his playmaking mode. He's got that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know Deion. He's never shy about sharing it with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough for what the Lord has done for me,'' Deion
said. ``I figure now some of you guys are saying this Jesus thing
must be pretty good, the way Deion's playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into God's game, and he'll get into yours. That's
where I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   Shake your head all you want, nonbelievers, but when the Cowboys
had to have a play yesterday, there stood Deion.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it, he looked pretty divine at the time.

EMMITT OF OLD SILENCES CRITICS FOR ONE MORE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As he dressed after the Cowboys' 27-20 victory,
Emmitt Smith's mind said to hurry, but his body said no.
</P>
<P>
   His legs, the ones he's used to run for more than 11,000 yards
in his pro career, lifted oh-so-slowly into his baby-blue slacks.
His arms slipped tenderly into his blue-plaid sportcoat.
</P>
<P>
   At the adjoining locker, Cowboys teammate Dexter Coakley made a
teasing remark about Smith moving so slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went through what I just went through, you'd be moving
slow, too,'' Smith shot back.
</P>
<P>
   He meant the game. I think.
</P>
<P>
   He meant the afternoon, and the 112 yards he rushed for, and the
touchdown he scored and the strained hip that finally forced him to
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   At least I think that's what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   But for a while here, who knew? Who knew what to think about
Emmitt Smith?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' media guide this season tried to carve Smith's
niche into immortality. ``In eight seasons,'' it read, ``Emmitt
Smith has become one of the all-time great running backs in NFL
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's resume, to be sure, is golden. As the Cowboys rose to
reborn prominence in the 1990s, Smith supplied the horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   But what the media guide left out were the questions. The
questions about how his production had been dropping off for two
seasons. The questions about the Sunday afternoons, some of them
big Sunday afternoons, when Smith supposedly bruised a rib,
strained a groin, battled the flu or succumbed to a witch's brew of
other ills and checked himself out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   His own greatness was mocking him. It wasn't the same Emmitt
Smith. But on a 6-10 team that underachieved notoriously, who
really knew?
</P>
<P>
   Against the Carolina Panthers yesterday, Smith ran like a ghost
of Emmitts past. At times, despite an early fumble, he burst
through gaps to split would-be defenders. In the open field, he
cocked his shoulder and took on tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   The 112 yards marked his first back-to-back 100-yard rushing
games since December of the 1995 season. That factoid spoke
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a story to write now,'' Smith said, as the air
around his locker suddenly turned chilly.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a story, however, all season. Smith's 529 yards and
his rejuvenation _ my word, certainly not his _ have been a Cowboys
highlight in this 4-2 season.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Smith knew, he says, staring at the insinuator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to answer those questions because they don't
require an answer,'' he said, when asked simply what made this
season so different than last. ``I'm just playing the game of
football the way I've played it for the past eight seasons.
Whatever happens from there just happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're charting Cowboys history, however, you have to have
circled the August day in 1996, when Smith signed a new contract
worth $42 million over eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, until these past two weeks, Smith had not had
back-to-back 100-yard rushing days. Since that day, Smith had
averaged less than 4 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, too, Smith, ever the running artist, was leaving
incomplete canvases all over the NFL schedule. He checked out of
the critical San Francisco game last season with a groin injury
after only seven carries. Nursing a bruised shoulder, he had only
two rushing attempts in a December game against the Panthers. In
Cincinnati, fighting the flu, he took a break to go to the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The former head coach, let me point out here, never said a word
about any of this. Barry Switzer wasn't about to tell Emmitt Smith
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Chan Gailey took a different approach with the 29-year-old
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same guy I saw last year, when he was healthy and
when things were going well,'' Gailey said, assessing the 1998
model Emmitt.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey had to have heard, of course, what people were saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't listen to what anybody said,'' the coach replied
yesterday. ``I watched the tape. I saw all I needed to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the Cowboys did sign Chris Warren. The free-agent
running back came from the Seattle Seahawks for a reported $2
million over three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, the handwriting _ in this case, the set of footprints
_ was on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a coincidence Smith, with the former Pro Bowl back Warren
waiting to spell him, suddenly seems to regained his running zip?
</P>
<P>
   Smith bristles at that kind of question. He doesn't want to
compare anything that happened last season or any other season, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in the past is in the past,'' he said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   He says he sees things from ``a different perspective'' than the
Emmitt-is-done skeptics do.
</P>
<P>
   No, he isn't done, if these first five games are any indication.
With a new coach, a new offense, a mostly new offensive line, and a
symbolic new stand-in waiting in the wings, Emmitt Smith has been
running like a star again.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right. There is a story to write.

Cowboys barely hold on, skin the 'Cats 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Considering his team's dismal finish in 1997 and
their up-and-down start to 1998, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey is not
about to turn his nose up at any victory.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, he was pleased to see the Cowboys reach their
goal of gaining back-to-back wins in yesterday's 27-20 victory
against the Carolina Panthers before 64,181 fans at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (4-2), who had followed their first two victories
this season with losses, strung together two victories for the
first time since topping Arizona and Washington last November.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey hardly sported a victorious smile in the locker room
after what could be termed a fragmented performance from the
Cowboys. Turnovers and breakdowns in the secondary offset
outstanding efforts from the offense and run defense, nearly
turning what should have been a blowout into a nail-biter.
</P>
<P>
   After leading 27-14 in the fourth quarter, the Cowboys didn't
secure their first-ever victory against the winless Panthers until
former Cowboys quarterback Steve Beuerlein's last-chance pass fell
incomplete in the end zone in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been one to complain about winning,'' Gailey said.
``But in this game, we had to overcome a lot of self-imposed
adversity. Two wins in a row was real good. But it wasn't
dominating by any shape or form. We've got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys guard Nate Newton was in full agreement, saying the
victory was tempered by the team's inconsistent play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the win, but weren't consistent,'' Newton said. ``We
didn't finish it. We've got to get better as the game goes on. We
didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistent play was evident not only in the Cowboys' pass
defense, which allowed Beuerlein to hit on his first 12 passes en
route to completing 22 of 32 passes for 286 yards and three
touchdowns, but also in the play of the Cowboys' stars.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith topped 100 yards for the
second consecutive week, rushing 21 times for 112 yards a
touchdown. But it was his second-quarter fumble that helped the
Panthers take a 14-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Beuerlein, who lit an emotional firestorm in the hapless
Panthers (0-5) after replacing starter Kerry Collins in the middle
of the week, capitalized by connecting on the second of his two
touchdown passes to Panthers receiver Raghib Ismail, this one
against Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Jason Garrett, who moved to 3-1 as a starter
in place of injured star Troy Aikman, was 14-of-22 for 287 yards
and two touchdowns. However, it was his fourth-quarter fumble that
allowed the Panthers to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After Garrett's fumble with 6:34 left in the game, Beuerlein
made the game interesting with a 3-yard touchdown pass to William
Floyd. An interception by Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders ended
the next drive, and time ran out on the last.
</P>
<P>
   In between the two fumbles, however, the Cowboys scored 24
consecutive points between the second and fourth quarters. Garrett,
smartly mixing in deep passes to receivers Michael Irvin and Ernie
Mills against the Panthers run-conscious defense, completed nine
passes for 18 yards or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who caught only one pass last week, finished with six
receptions for 146 yards, while Mills caught five passes for 110,
including an 18-yard touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``They isolate guys a lot,'' Garrett said of the deep-ball game
plan. ``When we run the ball it makes them commit and open up the
passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   The only area in which the Cowboys were strong from beginning to
end was the run defense, which limited Panthers running back
Anthony Johnson to 28 yards on 16 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' pass defense, helped by a Panthers fumble and an
improving pass rush, played better in the second half. Beuerlein
was 12-of-13 for 160 yards and two touchdowns in the first half and
completed 19 of his first 22 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' play on defense was the continuation of a
season-long trend. They have allowed just three touchdowns after
intermission in six games, including one yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys linebacker Dexter Coakley said it was just a matter of
surviving the early emotion from the Panthers and Beuerlein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was important to come out fired up in the second
half,'' Coakley said. ``We knew they would rally around Steve. We
just had to follow the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite not registering a clean knockout as a team, the Cowboys
also took solace in the fact that the victory kept them on track in
their quest to becoming ``a good team.'' And with the Chicago Bears
(1-5) up next Sunday before Aikman returns from his fractured
collarbone against Philadelphia (1-5), the Cowboys have a chance to
add to the string of victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the road to doing becoming a good team,'' Gailey
said. ``But we haven't proved anything yet. It doesn't matter until
you do it.''

WETTELAND PLANNING ON ELBOW SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Rangers right-hander John Wetteland, who has avoided
injuries to his throwing shoulder and elbow during most of his
major-league career, expects to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his
right elbow within the next few weeks, the two-time All-Star said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been bothering me all year,'' the Rangers' closer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin could not be reached for
comment on the nature or seriousness of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's news to me,'' Rangers trainer Danny Wheat said of
Wetteland's plans for surgery. ``I'm supposed to get in touch with
him the first part of this week. Maybe he's speculating that he'll
need surgery. We do know this much: He does have a \Rbone\S spur in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland indicated he plans to undergo surgery after he and his
wife, Michele, return home to New Mexico with their 2-year-old
daughters, twins Addie and Katie. Wetteland also was unclear
regarding the doctor who would perform the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who went 3-1 with a 2.03 earned-run average,
established a Rangers' single-season record with 42 saves during
1998. His earned-run average ranked as the third-best among
American League relief pitchers, and opponents' .203 batting
average ranked as the fourth-lowest among league relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's three stints on the disabled list since 1992 did not
involve his throwing arm. Strains of the groin muscle and right
hamstring forced Wetteland to the disabled list during the 1996 and
'94 seasons, respectively. Wetteland also went on the disabled list
during 1993 after fracturing the big toe on his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who during the 1999 season will earn $5.75 million,
likely will be ready for spring training after surgery barring any
unforeseen setbacks.

STYLE POINTS DIDN'T MATTER IN THIS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Doctors and house cats bury their mistakes. But
few teams in today's NFL have such a luxury, and until yesterday,
the Cowboys certainly weren't considered among league exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a 27-20 victory over Carolina, and with it, the notion
that the Cowboys threw dirt on attempted self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas big plays were randomly mixed with big blunders _ one
seemed to constantly nullify the other. Second-guessing was
rampant, starting with Chan Gailey on play-calling and clock
management. Jerry Jones spent far too much time wandering around
the bench area. Rocket Ismail spent far too much time wandering
behind the Cowboys' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina used a backup quarterback after the starter complained
last week of heart problems _ Kerry Collins admitted he lacked one.
Carolina used a backup running back because starter Fred Lane
missed the team flight. Injuries cost Carolina its two best
offensive linemen. The Panthers had no running game yesterday and a
defense that was torched for 428 yards of balanced Dallas offense.
Plus, the visitors were yellow flagged repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   All that negative stuff normally adds up to road destruction.
But instead, there was the always gallant Steve Beuerlein, firing
for the end zone as time ran out. Only that incompletion finally
sealed the deal for Dallas, and frankly, delivered justice to Jason
Garrett, Emmitt Smith, Ernie Mills, the offensive line, Greg Ellis,
Leon Lett ... well, there were many who got what they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty, however, in achieving it, left much to be
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been one to complain too much about wins,''
deadpanned Gailey, who actually seemed somewhat amused over media
questions in the postgame locker room. It probably had something to
do with this victory being graded on style points. Based on August
expectations, any ol' win would do for Dallas, now ranked among the
NFL's surprises with a 4-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   But defensive coordinator Dave Campo was not so jovial. His
group suffered from big-play skid marks, and frankly, had far too
many problems with Beuerlein and an assortment of Panther offensive
backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good we won the game,'' snapped Campo, growing weary of
what-went-wrong questions. ``I think Beuerlein is one heck of a
quarterback, too,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Campo did admit, however, that the big-play blues are starting
to concern. And this was after Gailey made a rare admission that
the performance of cornerback Kevin Smith had become worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Besides the defense being burned and two
offensive fumbles leading to 14 Carolina points, special teams also
ran off the road at times. Like being completely fooled on a fake
punt, then being saved by a referee's questionable flag on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that mattered in the end was we found a way to
win,'' said Gailey. ``We had to overcome some self-imposed
adversity, and once we had done that, the game appeared to be put
away. Instead, we're fighting our butts off right up until the
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   As the head coach who also calls offensive plays, Gailey is
subject to the double whammy of scrunity. How the overall team
performs come with his territory, as does his decisions on
down-distance-situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offensive confusion at the end of the second half
was dumped in Gailey's lap, and he said, ``Hit me. I deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the up-and-down nature of play-calling was never more
graphic than at a critical point early in the third quarter. With
Dallas trailing, 14-10, a timely sack was registered by Ellis, the
rookie defensive end who is starting to emerge. When William Floyd
fumbled on the next play, the Cowboys took over at the Panthers'
2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on Emmitt, who, by the way, continues to run like a guy
trying to outrun last season's dismal performance. Smith got a yard
on first down, but with the ball at the 1, Gailey did the
unthinkable. He had Garrett trying to pass, except Kevin Greene was
there for the sack and a 5-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Had Gailey gone nuts?
</P>
<P>
   But on third-and-goal from the 6, here came a perfect call _
meaning, it worked perfectly. Garrett got the shovel pass to Chris
Warren, who barreled up the middle and into the end zone. Again,
what was Gailey thinking?
</P>
<P>
   On the failed pass attempt, he said, ``Last week, we hammered
Emmitt up the middle out of the same formation. I thought they'd be
hanging all over Emmitt. They weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   On the successful shovel pass, he said, ``Last week, out of that
same formation, we put Deion \RSanders\S in motion and got the ball
to him. We did it this time, thinking they'd be all over Deion.
About six of them were.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy come, easy go. And although winning wasn't exactly easy,
it's the only thing that ultimately mattered.

COWBOYS VICTORY A LESSON IN FILM REVIEW
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It must have been like watching a sandlot
football game to the average fan, what with Jason Garrett slinging
rainbows all over Texas Stadium on Sunday. But there was a method
to defeating the Carolina Panthers, a method that gave the Cowboys
two 100-yard receivers in the same game for the first time in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin had six receptions for 146 yards and Ernie Mills
had five for 110 and one touchdown in the Cowboys' 27-20 victory
against the Panthers. Most of their receptions came as they beat
the Carolina cornerbacks' one-on-one coverage to run down perfectly
thrown deep passes from Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing how well \RGarrett\S threw the ball today _ not
amazing because I didn't think he could do it, but that anybody
could be that accurate,'' coach Chan Gailey said as he headed for
his locker Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to unleash the Irvin-Mills duo had come during practice
and film-room sessions last week.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers cornerbacks Doug Evans (who was limited by a hand
injury), Eric Davis and Rod Smith are very aggressive in man-to-man
coverage, Cowboys coaches noticed on film. The Cowboys figured they
would take advantage of the Panthers aggressiveness by letting
Irvin, Mills and Billy Davis (one catch, 23 yards) make mid-route
adjustments to get deep on Panthers defenders, who like to sit on
shorter routes.
</P>
<P>
   On most occasions, all Garrett (14-of-22, 287 yards, 2 TDs) had
to do was keep the safety from providing deep help by freezing him
with a look or a pump fake. Then, Irvin said, ``we had to make
plays on the outside.'' They did. The Cowboys converted nine passes
of 18 yards or longer, including a 38-yarder to Mills and a
42-yarder to Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we could run some 12-yard outs, and when Carolina
would bump us we'd convert it to a streak route,'' Cowboys
quarterback coach Buddy Geis said. ``The good thing is that Chan
lets the quarterback and the wide receiver have that kind of
flexibility. A lot of (coaches) won't do that because they don't
want to throw that many deep balls. But we did and executed very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gailey: ``I don't claim to be the smartest guy in the
world. But when it works I'm not going to change a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was sweet for Mills. He'd played for the Panthers last
year, but coaches there didn't think enough of his talents to use
him (he was inactive for six games in 1997), and team management
did not re-sign him in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   He repaid the Panthers by totaling a career-high in yards
Sunday. He made the game's prettiest play, bending backward as if
he were doing the limbo to catch an 18-yard touchdown pass in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The play: 84 Semi Go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fade route and I probably made it more difficult than
it needed to be,'' Mills said. ``I picked the ball up late, made a
run for it and concentrated to make the catch.''  &LR; tagtop:Kevin

A TOAST FOR TEXAS FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something crazy happened Saturday night. I fell asleep in Texas
and woke up in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This had to be Florida, didn't it? Where else would you find
cover-to-cover stories about triumphs by the local college football
teams throughout the Sunday newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   Not your run-of-the-mill victories, either. We're talking about
high-profile wins. The stuff that lifts spirits, turns around
programs and shifts the focus of Monday-morning office chats from
the NFL to the college game.
</P>
<P>
   Check it out: One school knocked off the defending national
champs, ending their 19-game winning streak. Another unleashed its
Heisman Trophy candidate and scored its most lopsided victory
against its archrival in 28 years. A third school continued its
best start since Gerald Ford roamed the Oval Office, improving to
6-0 and forcing its way into the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Florida State and Miami?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Texas A&AMP;M, Texas and Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in Baylor's comeback victory against Kansas and the four
Texas-based members of the Big 12 swept conference games in the
same weekend for the first time in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Add in TCU, pacesetter in the Western Athletic Conference's
Mountain Division, and you've got four teams from the Lone Star
State receiving Top 25 votes yesterday. Those four are a combined
19-4, with No. 10 A&AMP;M (5-1, 2-0 Big 12) holding its loftiest perch
in The Associated Press poll since 1995 and No. 22 Tech (6-0, 3-0)
already qualified as a postseason participant.
</P>
<P>
   For a state that has been starved for college football success
in recent seasons, Saturday's results provided the biggest one-day
infusion of positive feedback in more than a decade. Especially the
victories by A&AMP;M, Tech and Texas, which all but limited the list of
title contenders in the Big 12 South Division to those three teams.
</P>
<P>
   String enough days like this together and a funny thing might
happen. Texas, the state with the nation's deepest pool of high
school football talent, could rival Florida as the breeding ground
of NCAA football powers.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen overnight. But coaches realize the potential
significance of Oct. 10, 1998, when A&AMP;M led the parade by knocking
off Nebraska, 28-21, and Texas followed with a 34-3 rout of
Oklahoma before Tech capped the evening with a 24-17 victory
against Oklahoma State. All in front of network or cable television
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great day for college football in Texas,'' said Texas
coach Mack Brown. ``We would all like to bring a national
championship to Texas. But the first step is convincing enough of
these young guys to stay here, regardless of which school they
choose, and play. A day like Saturday helps. As we all get better,
we're all better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach Spike Dykes concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're connected to those other \RTexas\S teams. So, if we're
not playing those guys, I'm rooting for them,'' Dykes said. ``And
we haven't had a day like this in a long, long time. I think it's
neat to see that what goes around, comes around. We're always
fielding questions about how weak the Big 12 South is in relation
to the North. Maybe this helps in a deal like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to weekend victories by A&AMP;M and Baylor, South teams hold
a 6-4 lead over their North counterparts in Big 12 crossover games
this season. It's not a statistic that would raise an eyebrow in
Florida. But in Texas, it makes for an encouraging start.

SMITH FINDS NO RESPITE AT CORNERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The heel feels fine, Cowboys cornerback Kevin
Smith said. That's not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   So what is?
</P>
<P>
   After Raghib Ismail beat him for a touchdown pass, Smith tried
to put it all in perspective after the Cowboys' 27-20 victory. A
consistent Steve Beuerlein plus increasing pressure will equal the
occasional coverage lapse, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that going into the game, I want to be aggressive, but
I can't be as aggressive as I want to be,'' Smith said. ``I just
have to deal with it. The key is not to give up and just don't give
up a touchdown. \RBeuerlein\S was finding his receivers today.''
</P>
<P>
   Beuerlein, who had his way most of the day against the Dallas
secondary, was 22-of-32 for 286 yards and three touchdowns. A long
gain on a Smith pass-interference call in the fourth quarter was
voided because of offsetting penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo said that even though Smith
again took his lumps, this is not the time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, his biggest problem is that teams go after him
all the time because of what's going on, and because Deion Sanders
is on the other side,'' Campo said. ``This is all something that
has been created and we have to keep him out of those situations as
much as possible.''
Aikman checkup
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said he will probably get
another X-ray for his broken left collarbone today.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has been throwing without much pain. But he said it
``hurts a little bit,'' when he takes the snap from center.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on his collarbone Oct. 5 did not show much improvement
from the original injury he suffered against the Denver Broncos
Sept. 13. He has said he probably won't return until the club's
Nov. 2 game against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   But a favorable examination could lead to Aikman suiting up as
the emergency quarterback against the Chicago Bears next weekend.
Adams grades out well
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Flozell Adams said he felt good about making his first
career start on the Cowboys offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did better than the average rookie,'' said Adams, who got
the start at right guard when Everett McIver went down to a knee
injury last week. ``I picked up everything they tried to throw at
me. I was ready for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Hudson Houck had the best view of Adams'
battles with the interior of the Panthers defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flo did not have any penalties and there were no mental
breakdowns,'' Houck said. ``He wasn't intimidated by the situation
or by the people we were playing against.''
</P>
<P>
   Said veteran right tackle Erik Williams: ``Flo showed great
poise. He's going to be a great player in this league.''
The one that got away
</P>
<P>
   On his best day since taking over for Troy Aikman, Jason
Garrett's most memorable play nearly turned out to be his worst.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-1 at the Carolina 16-yard line, Garrett sneaked for
would-be first-down yardage. But after he went down, the ball
popped out of the pile and bounced toward the Cowboys' sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers cornerback Rod Smith recovered and ran 35 yards to the
Cowboys' 43-yard line. Three plays later, Steve Beuerlein completed
a 3-yard touchdown pass to William Floyd that cut the Cowboys' lead
to 27-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locking the ball down is one of the things I'm supposed to
do,'' Garrett explained. ``I saw a crease to the left and felt like
I had the ball locked down. It hit a helmet or a knee and that
dislodged it.''
Mathis comes up big
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys reserve cornerback Kevin Mathis made the most of his
limited time on the field with a team-record tying two fumble
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who plays in nickel situations, sparked the Cowboys to
their first lead of the game when he jumped on a fumble by Panthers
fullback William Floyd on the first drive of the third quarter. The
Cowboys turned it into a 6-yard touchdown pass from Jason Garrett
to Chris Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis' second recovery late in the third quarter led to a
38-yard field goal, giving the Cowboys a 27-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Several Cowboys have recovered two fumbles in a game, the last
time was when Broderick Thomas did it against the Eagles in 1996.
On the defensive
</P>
<P>
   It was a strong showing by the Dallas defense. The run defense
held Carolina to just 29 rushing yards, a 1.3-yard-per-carry
average. A pass rush keyed by rookie Greg Ellis sacked Steve
Beuerlein three times. ``We made some mistakes, but once we lit the
light under the defensive line, we started getting to the
quarterback,'' Ellis said.
Big plays
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense produced several big gainers and big plays,
including a 32-yard run from Emmitt Smith and Jason Garrett passes
of 42 yards to Ernie Mills and 38 yards to Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   But the day's best catch was 18 yards on a spectacular touchdown
reception by Mills on a fade route in the corner of the end zone.
``Jason made the throw where the defensive back couldn't get it and
only I could,'' Mills said.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin had 146 yards receiving and Ernie Mills had 110,
giving the Cowboys two 100-yard receivers in the same
regular-season game for the first time since Irvin and Jay Novacek
did it on Sept. 12, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's six receptions moved him into a tie for 10th place in
the NFL all-time receiving list for career catches. He now has 699
receptions, the same as former Redskins wideout Gary Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's victory was the Cowboys' first over the Panthers.
Carolina had won the teams' first two meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hennings' block of the extra point on the Panthers final
touchdown was the first for the Cowboys since Jim Jeffcoat blocked
one against the New York Giants on Dec. 16, 1989.

HEY! HERE'S A HERO UNDER SECOND BASE!
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were setting out to find a stand-up guy, a role model, a
person you could point to and say to your kids, ``There, that's how
you should handle a difficult situation,'' the world of
professional sports would not be the first place you'd look.
</P>
<P>
   Today's millionaire sports stars seem to spend more time
whining, complaining and offering up alibis than they spend playing
the games that make them rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Any time some hot-shot athlete makes a mistake, in sport or in
life, it is always somebody else's fault. The athlete had a lousy
childhood, or he was treated unfairly by management, or his
self-esteem was damaged by unappreciative sports fans. If he drops
a ball, he says the sun got in his eyes. If he gets busted for
drugs or beating up his wife, he says the media blew the incident
out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   The alibi poster child for big-time sports these days is boxer
Mike Tyson, who bit off part of an opponent's ear because the
referee let the opponent get away with head-butting and who
recently snarled curses at licensing officials because the world
gives him no respect.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes' role model could well be the president of the
United States, who apparently believes he had a right to lie under
oath in a sexual harassment lawsuit because the plaintiff's lawyers
were mean to him.
</P>
<P>
   So. It surprised absolutely no one when a player for the New
York Yankees initially tried to duck the blame for a spectacular
foul-up that led to his team's 4-1 loss to the Cleveland Indians in
Game 2 of baseball's American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed by reporters after the game, second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch refused to accept responsibility for the damage done to
the Yankees when he opted to argue with an umpire rather than chase
down the ball after it hit a Cleveland runner in the back. While
Knoblauch popped his bubble gum and hollered at the ump _ with the
ball lying just a few feet away _ another Cleveland runner was
circling the bases and scoring the go-ahead run in the top of the
12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said he didn't know where the ball was _ which was
probably true, since he didn't bother to look for it.
</P>
<P>
   No news here. Just another bratty ballplayer acting like a
world-class jerk.
</P>
<P>
   But wait.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Knoblauch spent some time later that night
watching TV replays of his breathtaking blunder and finally
realized what most of the world had already known: His mistake was
inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, a 30-year-old Houston native who was a baseball star
at Texas A&AMP;M in the late 1980s, met with reporters the next day.
Here's part of what he said, as quoted by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up ... I should have went and gotten the ball,
regardless of what the umpire's call was.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch faced the music. And then some:
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to apologize to my teammates and my manager and all the
Yankees fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you believe it? He apologized. To his teammates, to his
manager, to ``all the Yankees fans.''
</P>
<P>
   When did you ever hear a sports star apologize to the fans _ to
the people who ultimately pay his mind-boggling salary?
</P>
<P>
   One other occasion comes to mind. When slugger Mark McGwire
failed to advance to the finals in the home-run derby at the 1998
All-Star Game, he apologized to the fans for disappointing them.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of humility and graciousness was typical of McGwire
throughout the season _ as it was for the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa,
who competed with McGwire for the title of home-run king. McGwire
and Sosa were hounded by the public and by the media, day in and
day out, week after week, month after month _ and they handled
every moment with dignity and class.
</P>
<P>
   If we were looking for role models in the world of sports, we
found two of them in McGwire and Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   And now we add to the list Chuck Knoblauch, a stout-hearted
Texan who swallowed his pride and accepted responsibility for
letting down his team and its fans.
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose the president has been following the baseball
playoffs?

1,200-YEAR-OLD TEMPLE OFFERS ORDER, OASIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATSUMOTO, Japan _ Tucked into an unspoiled forest near the
Japan Alps in the central part of the country, Gofukuji Temple is a
retreat so natural in its beauty that it seems to have sprouted out
of the wilderness that surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   With its simple wood-beam construction, thatched roof, and
weathered stone steps that ripple down the side of Mount Hachibuse,
the Buddhist temple was built to blend into its habitat, and
throughout its 1,200-year history it has offered worshipers a
bridge to nature and its contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Gofukuji is like traveling back in time, past a pair of
bulls that represent beasts carrying scriptures from China that
fell to their knees at this site in 756. Today, it is easy to
forget that there is a bustling, modern downtown of 200,000 people
just 20 minutes' drive away. Perhaps that is why so many harried
city dwellers come here when they need some peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are syncretic in their spirituality, mixing the
indigenous Shinto religion with the imported faiths of Buddhism,
Confucianism, and Christianity. Shinto grew out of the belief that
every natural form, rocks, trees, water, had a deity, or ``kami.''
Even today, in a nation that prides itself on its modernity and
high technology, animism and awe for the simplicity of nature still
guide many in their spiritual beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The coexistence of traditional and modern values in Japan is
obvious in the man who runs Gofukuji, Syuyu Otani, 49. Locals see
nothing contradictory about him, but foreign visitors are usually
surprised to learn that the chain-smoking, sake-drinking,
meat-eating, married jazz aficionado is a monk.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, Otani was burning wooden tablets inscribed
with petitions as an offering. In another room, women in kimonos
were making a different sort of offering, but one aimed at
achieving the same peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gofukuji is home to an annual ceremony by tea masters of the
region, and one day last month, visitors paid $22 apiece to serve
or be served tea.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese art of ``chado,'' or ``the way of tea,'' is a
highly stylized ritual that dates back to the eighth century, when
Buddhist monks used tea to stimulate meditation. Earlier still, tea
was introduced from China as a medicine, and tea dumplings were
offered to ancestors at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   By the 14th century, tea had become a refined pastime for the
nobility, who used expensive teacups to show off power and wealth.
The ceremony required tremendous discipline, and became part of
every samurai's training. In the late 1500s, history's most famous
tea master, Sen-no Rikkyu, refined it into a simple aesthetic,
using utensils that resembled nature.
</P>
<P>
   Tea teacher Michiko Arai, 60, says the ancient rite remains a
living art because it provides order and an oasis from worries _
something especially needed during the worst recession since World
War II. ``Japan is in a very tough situation now, politically and
economically, and tea gives people calmness and peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, the kneeling server whips powdered green tea in
hot water, turns the cup so its design faces the guest, and
presents the tea with a bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In modern times,'' said Arai, the tea teacher, ``even though
we have a tight budget, we can create simple food and simple
beauty.''

PARIS, TEXAS, ADDING COWBOY HAT TO ITS VERSION OF FRENCH TOWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, Texas _ The French would ignite with anger if someone
dared cover their beloved Eiffel Tower with a giant, brightly
colored chapeau; but here in the northeast corner of Texas, it will
be a matter of civic pride when a glossy red cowboy hat is
carefully affixed atop the town's 65-foot Eiffel Tower model.
</P>
<P>
   In this Oklahoma-Arkansas corner of the state, folks are a
little more liberal with their tower. As in their namesake city,
Parisians here are proud of their tower, pleased with the work the
local Boiler Maker's Union did welding it together two years ago.
But they do not hold it in the same reverence as the French do
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other sights here. Legendary cattleman John
Chisum is buried here. And at Evergreen Cemetery, there is the
renowned Babcock Monument, a 12-foot statue of Jesus wearing cowboy
boots.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris, Texas, Eiffel Tower is much smaller than the
original, too. Here, kids can climb on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hat will give us a distinction,'' said hat creator Daon
Wall. ``We won't just have a little Eiffel Tower; we'll have one
with a hat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lamar County Chamber of Commerce uses the Eiffel Tower as
part of its logo. Its tower has a red hat tilted on top. Wall said
he and Gary Vest, director of the chamber, often joked about
putting a hat on the replica, which stands near the town's civic
center, and Vest even contacted outside vendors to see if it could
be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called the people who built Big Tex for the State Fair,''
Vest said. ``They said, yes, they could build one out of
fiberglass. It would cost us $26,000 and that didn't cover the
installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Wall knew he could build one, but his concrete
pipe business kept him too busy. But when he recently sold his
company and retired, he suddenly had the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Paris Iron and Metal and asked them if they wanted
to be a part of it,'' he said of the hat project. ``They said they
would provide the metal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanting a deep, sleek coat of paint for the hat, Wall contacted
folks at Lone Star Collision Center and asked if they could provide
a good automotive paint job. The company said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Shurtleff-Gaharan, a metal fabrication contractor, rolled the
1/8-inch steel crown; Wall took the three-sixteenth-inch steel brim
back to his old company, now CSR-Wall, and rolled it.
</P>
<P>
   The hat stands 4 1/2 feet tall and has a brim that is 10 feet in
diameter. The hat is now on a flatbed trailer where Wall is putting
on the finishing touches, including a 6-inch-wide band that will be
painted white. When the hat is painted, local veterinarian Don
Riddle will add a 16-inch brass feather he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I went to was ready to pitch in,'' Wall said.
``Everyone I asked said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall estimates that he has spent more than a month working on
the project. He began by taking a Stetson hat and ``scaling it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just blew up the scale and started,'' he said. ``I'll have
it to the paint shop soon, and we're planning to put it up Oct.
19.''
</P>
<P>
   Vest said he has been in contact with some people from France,
and at first they were a little upset at the notion of covering the
Texas tower with a cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've kind of warmed up to the idea, now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Paris, Texas, was formed in 1845, but there is no
documentation to show exactly how it got its name. References to
the area as ``Paris'' go back to as early as 1841.
</P>
<P>
   Historians are certain, however, that this Paris was named for
Paris, France. The cities now have a sister-city relationship.

WHAT'S COLLEGE FOR, ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time not too long ago when going to college meant
four years of sampling the myriad intellectual riches of academia,
from literature to music, from history to astronomy. Today's
students don't have time for such luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Now students go to college in a hurry to learn the skills that
will land them a job. A good job. Discovering, say, Ovid or Freud
is mere distraction. It's economics that count _ personal
economics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three-quarters of all graduates are in fields such as
accounting, business, nursing, education, and computer science,
each a vocation of sorts. That's a far cry from 1938 or even 1968,
when pursuit of knowledge was more generalized, and half of all
degrees awarded were in the arts or sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Taking an even longer view: In 1900, 70 percent of all college
graduates came from liberal arts colleges. Now, about 5 percent do.
</P>
<P>
   That the image of liberal arts has declined can be seen in the
experience of the former North Adams State College. Last year, the
school changed its name to the Massachusetts College of Liberal
Arts. Freshman applications dropped 22 percent. School officials
blamed the name change.
</P>
<P>
   And Smith College, one of the nation's most prestigious liberal
arts colleges, this month announced an ambitious program called
``Praxis,'' translated from the Greek as practical learning, in
which every junior or senior who wants a paid internship in a field
related to their study will be provided one. In other words, the
education alone was seen as not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a certain group of students, the undergraduate years are
clearly pre-professional,'' says Richard Breneman, dean of the
School of Education at the University of Virginia, and author of
``Liberal Arts Colleges: Thriving, Surviving or Endangered?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know when they start college, they will go on to graduate
school, to law school, medical school, or business school. And for
those students, liberal arts is a luxury they can afford. ... But
if those kids did not go on to law school, they might be less
inclined to settle for the pure liberal arts. For the undergraduate
whose degree might be a terminal degree, those students feel,
rightly or wrongly, that they need professional training as
undergraduates.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, a ``huge shift'' in course offerings has
occurred in the last 25 years. ``In an ideal world, you would like
to see a higher percentage of arts and science degrees than one in
four.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem facing liberal arts colleges, says Robert
Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education
at the University of Pennsylvania, is that they are places where
people study for four years. ``The market in higher education is
increasingly filled with students who want to go a course or two at
a time, and work as they go. In fact, the market is growing in
every area except where the liberal arts specialize.''
</P>
<P>
   In developing the internship program, Smith officials were
looking at the next 25 years and decided on this program over other
options such as altering the curriculum and offering ``accounting
and other applied programs,'' says Ruth Simmons, Smith's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal arts colleges have tended to define themselves as
institutions of full-time sequestered study and there is a view
that that is not really relevant for the world of work,'' Simmons
says. ``We are saying that is not true, but this is one way to
reassure students and their parents that, if they take a liberal
arts degree, this will ensure they will have the skills to enter
the work world.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Not surprisingly, the increasingly popular view that liberal
arts degrees are a $100,000-plus extravagance is disputed by
college presidents like Simmons as well as liberal arts graduates
and faculty. But now they have a powerful ally, one that may
surprise some critics of a liberal education.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study shows that heads of companies favor graduates
from liberal arts institutions because they can generally
communicate well, think quickly, are good at solving problems, and
enjoy learning new things. But often the Human Resources
departments that screen resumes would prefer to see transcripts
that boast courses in accounting, rather than the Russian novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to produce men and women who can get a good job and
hold it, and grow beyond it, what we need is certainly far more
than a system using colleges as a farm team for business,'' says
Jeffrey D. Wallin, president of the American Academy for Liberal
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Says Thomas Aceto, president of the renamed Massachusetts
College of Liberal Arts, ``A lot of blue-collar parents don't
understand, for example, that 60 percent of the CEOs of Fortune 500
companies have bachelor degrees from liberal arts colleges.'' The
school _ known for its business and education programs _ will
continue, he said, to try to create a small, public, liberal arts
college with high admissions standards and low tuition bills _ and
hope the drop in applications was a temporary phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a national poll by DYG Inc. found that parents and high
school students viewed higher education as a critical component in
preparing for a good job and high earning potential, but neither
group had a good understanding of a liberal arts education.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hersh is the president of Hobart and William Smith
Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., and the man who ordered the poll to
confirm his suspicions that the idea of a liberal arts education
had lost its allure. ``What is it in the larger culture that has
caused us to no longer believe in a liberal education,'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it, certainly, is the need to get a job, and the gnawing
feeling that majoring in classics might not be marketable. But some
of it, Hersh says, is ``the malling of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a mass consumer society that can get anything one wants
wholesale, on the cheap. People have confused brand recognition and
big-name football with the quality of a handcrafted education. But
whenever anyone talks about excellence, it is small classes,
professors who teach, lots of feedback, things that harken back to
Socratic dialogue. Will we lose it before we can get back to it?''
</P>
<P>
   Some might consider too much of it already gone.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a 1996 study by the National Association of Scholars
that reviewed US News &AMP; World Report's top 25 research universities
and top 25 liberal arts colleges and found that the core curriculum
_ once considered the backbone of a strong liberal arts education _
is a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, there was an average of 9.9 mandatory courses in those
institutions. In 1964, the number had dropped to 6.4, and by 1993,
there was an average of 2.5 mandatory courses. In the same time,
the average number of undergraduate courses not requiring
prerequisites jumped from 23 in 1914, to 127 in 1964, to 582 in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prevalent unwillingness to set priorities within the
general education programs, together with the growing
disinclination to insist on rigorous standards for completing them,
suggest that undergraduate general education has become
substantially devalued as an institutional objective,'' the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the odd moment in your senior year, by all means
take the `Sociology of the Soap Opera,' but it is worthwhile for
anyone to read Shakespeare for insight into the permanent human
condition _ love, death, betrayal are all there,'' says Glenn
Ricketts, spokesman for the National Association of Scholars. ``You
can still get an excellent education at most of those schools, but
it will not be due to any of their ideas about what you should
do.''

THE CLINTON CONUNDRUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an editorial titled ``Just Go,'' the trans-Atlantic journal
The Economist asked, with characteristic brusqueness: ``Is the
leader of the world's most powerful country to be allowed a lower
standard of behavior, just because he sits in the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   It is the question that vexes even some of President Clinton's
most ardent defenders, as they contort themselves into claiming
that he didn't technically lie when he evaded lawyers' questions
about his contact with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His defenders can't admit that Clinton committed any legal
violation because, in that case, to excuse him would place the
president in a different position from average Americans, who
presumably must pay for their crimes. And the merest hint of
sovereign immunity is deeply antithetical to the American spirit,
going back to the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But comparing Clinton with the average American _ or even to
those in ``any other walk of public life,'' as ``The Economist''
did, is creating a false parallel. Clinton's alleged crime came in
defense against a politically inspired lawsuit, was investigated
under procedures applied only to presidents or their aides, was
exposed using methods discouraged by the Justice Department, and
was presented for legal disposition even though it would not, under
normal circumstances, have justified an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the president is in this predicament precisely because
he is president. No one should feel obliged to punish him on the
grounds that others are suffering for identical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the president did not break the law, or
even that he should not be impeached for it. But if the independent
counsel investigation has made anything clear, it is this: The
president stands at a unique intersection of law and politics, and
any standard used to judge him must, by its very nature, be
special.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and the public gird for the impeachment inquiry
launched last week, they would do well to consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Would the Paula Jones case have been filed were Clinton not
president?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allegedly propositioned Jones on May 8, 1991, when the
White House was only a gleam in the Arkansas governor's eye. She
didn't sue for three years, filing her sexual harassment case on
May 6, 1994, 15 months after President Clinton took office. She
came forward at a press conference organized by Cliff Jackson, a
conservative agitator who had made a career of exposing Clinton's
alleged financial and sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Would the Jones case have been settled, were Clinton not
president?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Jones's lawyers thought they had a deal: For
enduring the alleged harassment by Clinton four years earlier,
Jones, who earned $19,000 a year, would receive $700,000 plus a
statement of support from the president. Jones, however, refused
the deal, reportedly insisting she wanted a full apology in which
the president would admit exposing himself to her. Frustrated, and
believing they had negotiated a fair deal, her lawyers quit. Within
days, they were replaced by a legal team financed by the
conservative Rutherford Institute. The lawyers and the institute
alike were ardent opponents of the president, particularly because
of his stance on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   While accepting donations from Clinton opponents around the
country, the Rutherford Institute financed hundreds of thousands of
dollars of litigation expenses, including a nationwide hunt for
other women who had had sexual encounters with Clinton. Last April,
the Jones case was thrown out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, lawyers in this type of civil litigation work for a
percentage of the award; like Jones's original lawyers, they quit
if the client refuses a huge settlement in favor of a costly, risky
litigation campaign that, even with its best outcome, was unlikely
to yield any more money than the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Would Clinton have answered questions about his alleged
relationship with Lewinsky were he not president?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the time that Jones's lawyers deposed the president, there
was little legal significance, one way or the other, to the
president's relationship with Lewinsky. It was clearly consensual,
and thus had only a tangential relationship to Jones's allegation
of sexual harassment. A defendant who is not president could admit
to the affair with few, if any, legal ramifications. Were the
defendant truly resistant to admitting the affair _ for example,
for fear of hurting others _ he could refuse to answer, and would
likely prompt a further hearing into whether to compel him to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Clinton was in a deeper bind. Admitting an affair
might have no legal ramifications, but it would have devastating
political consequences. Refusing to answer might win him some
sympathy from right-to-privacy types, but to the vast majority of
Americans, it would be seen as an admission of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Would Clinton's alleged perjury have been investigated were he
not president?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Generally, questions about the accuracy of testimony in ongoing
civil cases are referred to the trial court for investigation and
possible civil sanctions _ without a criminal probe. In Clinton's
case, the questions probably would have remained unanswered until
the case was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, federal prosecutors almost never bother to investigate
allegations of perjury in civil cases. What few cases get brought
generally deal with lying that is ``material'' to the claim _ in
this case, lying that relates to the central question at hand,
Clinton's alleged harassment of Jones, not a stray channel of
inquiry such as Clinton's relationships with other women.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Would Clinton's alleged perjury have been exposed were he not
president?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Normally, criminal investigations are limited by common-sense
considerations weighing the seriousness of the alleged crime
against the cost of the probe. Kenneth W. Starr, as an independent
counsel empowered under a law applying only to members of the
executive branch, expended virtually limitless resources. He also
chose not to follow Justice Department guidelines that discourage
such hardball tactics as forcing the testimony of a suspect's close
family members except in extremely important cases.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Justice Department generally does not call suspects
themselves before the grand jury, for reasons including fear of
unreasonable inquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in such a case, any defense lawyer would advise his or
her client to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. But as president, Clinton was under intense
pressure not to use the legal protections available to any average
American or, for that matter, any other public figure. He knew his
videotaped testimony, conducted under oath, would become his
statement to the country on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules require that grand jury testimony be kept secret
up to the point when a witness is about to testify at criminal
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But those rules, like so many others, didn't apply to Clinton _
solely because he was president.

WHAT DISCLOSURE IS OWED BY CELLUCCI TO THE VOTERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In politics, a pledge can be more dangerous to the
candidate who takes it than it is for the candidate who refuses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one knows that better than former President Bush, who
made his famous ``Read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge campaigning
against Michael Dukakis, only to end up agreeing to one of the
largest tax increases in history.
</P>
<P>
   And in this year's race for governor of Massachusetts, nobody
should know that better than Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, who has
had problems with his own tax pledge, and apparently with his own
personal loan pledges.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci's no new tax pledge, a continuation of his
predecessor, William F. Weld's, promise, sounds attractive to the
electorate, it is also a costly pledge for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   With an obvious need of money to pay the state's bills, the
state's borrowing cap, set at $900 million by the Weld-Cellucci
administration, was raised by Cellucci to $1 billion. Even with
that increase, the state still exceeded this $1 billion cap by $233
million.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would have been better if, rather than have the state
go deeper in debt, Cellucci had advocated a modest tax increase. In
difficult economic times, some economists argue that a minimal tax
increase may be more fiscally responsible than significantly
increasing the state's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci boasts about his $1 billion tax cut, and barely
mentions the state's record debt of $13.9 billion, which he helped
to set.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's problems with debt are not only on the state level,
but on a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 report by the Globe, Cellucci owed $750,000,
with nearly $70,000 of it on his credit cards. Cellucci explained
his debt by saying he had given up his law practice while he still
had education expenses, home improvement costs, and other expenses.
Thus, he said, he had to borrow money and exercise credit. But, he
added, he never missed a loan or credit card payment, and his
assets exceed his liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people found that level of personal debt troubling;
Cellucci has since refused to elaborate on how he ended up so far
in the red, repeatedly rejecting requests for interviews on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Cellucci said at a State House press conference that he
detailed his financial situation in required filings with the State
Ethics Commission, as well as released his state and federal income
tax returns for each of his years in office. During the last four
years, the Globe reported, Cellucci or his real estate business
sold property to reduce some of his personal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a lot of questions remained unanswered about the size of his
debt, despite the fact that Cellucci and his wife declared for the
past four years an average adjusted gross annual income of
$184,175, and a gross annual income of nearly $100,000 a year in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As earlier reported, Cellucci still owes more than $100,000 for
a bank loan obtained without any collateral. And, according to the
1996 Globe report, Cellucci was paying nearly $5,000 a month merely
to cover the interest on his accumulated debt _ an amount
approaching his own annual salary from the state, after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's debt issues have not been raised by his opponent,
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, but there are supporters, as
well as members of the media, who feel Cellucci has a public
obligation to clear up questions, and remove any doubts, about
possible conflicts of interests.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the banks from which he's borrowed money, for example,
also come under the state's banking regulations. Some critics ask
whether the Cellucci administration can truly be an independent
regulator of the same banks that probably could have sent him into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci can end lingering questions by disclosing the full
terms of his agreements with the banks that hold his loans and
credit card debts.
</P>
<P>
   Some people could argue that a personal debt, regardless of the
amount, should remain a private matter. But the fact that
Cellucci's debts were filed with the State Ethics Commission has,
in effect, placed them in the public arena. One reason for the
filing is to determine whether there are any public issues that
need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Cellucci has been prompt about paying his loans and
credit card debts. But some critics may ask whether he stuck to his
original payment plan, or whether it was renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Cellucci's debts become a big issue in the remaining
weeks of this campaign remains to be seen. But the fact that
Cellucci had filed some information on his loans with the ethics
commission has made the issue fair game for Harshbarger and his
running-mate, Warren Tolman, if they choose to raise it.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to be interviewed on the issue, Cellucci may be
creating new suspicions. The best way to assure voters he has
nothing to hide is to fully disclose his loan arrangements and
answer questions from his opponent and the media. If his opponent
had the same debt, Cellucci might well be the first to argue that
the public has a right to know.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR MONDAY OCT. 12 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   None of the papers share the same lead.
</P>
<P>
   USAT goes with the imminence of NATO air strikes against
Slobodan Milosevic's forces in Kosovo, a story everybody else runs
inside. The NYT goes with the opening on Tuesday of the FBI's
national DNA database, which is also on the USAT front. And the LAT
lead is the National Institutes of Health's plans to dramatically
shorten the government approval process for drugs, which could mean
much faster access to new medicines, a story on nobody else's
front.
</P>
<P>
   The WP lead is the paper's latest poll results indicating that
in the wake of last week's vote to start an impeachment
investigation, public support for the Republican-held Congress and
Republican congressional candidates has dropped considerably, most
of all among likely voters and independents. The poll also
indicates that support for Democratic congressional candidates is
up. The poll also finds that Clinton, now with a 67 percent
approval rating, is currently more popular than before last week's
vote. The WP says the numbers offer hope to Democrats of avoiding
Clinton's impeachment in favor of some lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   USAT reports that NATO officials are scheduled to meet Monday in
Brussels to approve an order that gives allied military commanders
the authority to order air strikes against Serbian forces. This
means apparently, that air strikes could come as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, says the paper, in a last-ditch attempt to avert
bombing, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is still holding talks with
Milosevic. The UN demands Holbrooke is pressing, says USAT, include
the withdrawal of Milosevic's forces and allowing humanitarian aid
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One issue making the talks sticky, says the WSJ, is how to keep
the Albanian separatists from taking advantage of any NATO show of
force.
</P>
<P>
   The despair of the Albanian civilians Milosevic's troops have
targeted is everywhere in USAT's on-the-ground front section
``cover story.'' A woman refugee gives reporter Jack Kelley a lock
of hair she says she took from the head of her 18-month-old
godchild, slain in a massacre by Serbs last week. ``Please give it
to Mr. Clinton,'' she tells him. ``Maybe he'll decide to save the
Albanian people.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of the incubator mythology of the Gulf War, one hopes
that USAT checked this story out before repeating it, but if so,
heaven help us.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI DNA database, the Times explains, is actually a
computerized organization of the 50 databases set up by the states.
The new system holds the promise of reducing rape and other crimes
by catching criminals earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT does an excellent job of canvassing the issues raised by
the database, which include: What types of offenders should be
required to give samples? Should mass screening be allowed? The
story points out that the established and quite successful DNA
system in Britain has opted for a wide range of criminal samples as
well as mass screening. It is undeniably curious though, that when
the paper turns to explaining how DNA can be used forensically, the
discussion is completely generic and never mentions the most famous
unchallenged DNA identification ever: that of President Clinton via
the Monica dress stain.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT front details a concrete consequence of California Gov.
Pete Wilson's decision last year to block funding for the state bar
association: No one is disciplining the state's negligent or
dishonest lawyers. The California state bar now has, says the
paper, a backlog of 6,556 unresolved complaints against attorneys.
Before the funding shutdown, the bar's L.A. office had 40
prosecutors. Now it has four.
</P>
<P>
   Readers howled in protest when this column stated last week that
Ken Starr would have been a violator of a bill working its way
through Congress that criminalizes making obscenities available on
the Internet. The readers are absolutely right: It's Congress that
is the distributor of the obscenities of the criminal referral.
Starr is the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The papers have consistently savaged President Clinton's
Lewinsky stance of apologizing without admitting. But isn't that
what's going on in the following ``Editor's Note'' from Sunday's
WP? ``The Sunday, Sept. 20, 'Rugrats' comic strip's depiction of
Jewish worshippers and use of the Kaddish were inappropriate and
should not have appeared in The Washington Post. We have expressed
our strong disapproval to Nickelodeon, which produces the comic,
and Creators Syndicate, which distributes it. Our comics screening
process failed in this instance, and we apologize to our readers
who were offended.''
</P>
<P>
   Note the Clintonesque use of ``inappropriate'' without ever
saying what was wrong with the strip. And what, pray tell, does the
paper's ``comics screening process'' screen for?

GINGRICH, LOTT PINCH PENNIES ON POOR YOUNG WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; No sex scandal today. Instead: a real crime.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress was preoccupied with the details of an
impeachment inquiry that could preoccupy it well into next year,
its leaders were playing penny-wise games with President Clinton
over the first serious attempt in a generation to tackle one of the
prime causes of poverty and chronic unemployment _ high school
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   What was at issue was the extent to which Newt Gingrich and
Trent Lott would renege on an earlier commitment to the 500,000
young people who leave high school every year, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a sweeping change in the country's jerry-built
job-training maze earlier this year _ putting nearly all the scores
of individual federal programs under one roof as direct aid to the
states _ $1 billion was authorized for each of the next four years
to go after the toughest customers of them all. On the way out of
town, however, Gingrich and Lott were playing games with outgoing
White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles over whether the actual
amount would be $150 million or $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's House, which can always find millions for another
Clinton probe, came up with zero. Indeed, for just the documented
amount of military spending pork that goes to Lott's Mississippi
and Gingrich's Georgia district, the full billion would have been
no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The shame here is that Labor Secretary Alexis Herman has fixed
on an idea that everybody in the manpower field knows works. The
idea, oversimplified, is to work through local initiatives around
the country that saturate targeted communities with employment and
training services. In classic, ``Third Way'' fashion, however, the
idea is NOT to set up a program from here and spread money around
broadly defined metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Herman's idea is to use federal money on local efforts,
targeted like lasers on truly distressed communities where the
young people in trouble are concentrated, and further strengthen
them.
</P>
<P>
   With very little notice, the Labor Department under Herman's
predecessor, Bob Reich, began pilot projects two years ago in Los
Angeles, Houston, and Chicago. It is now completing the start-up
process in three more places _ Boston, New York City's famously
challenging South Bronx, and rural Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, as everywhere, the targeted neighborhoods of Roxbury
and South Boston are meant to be saturated, meaning that services
are available to every single jobless kid (aged 16-24) the managers
can find. And by linking up all the existing human services
operations, as well as business's Private Industry Council, the
probation officers and juvenile justice workers and even the
housing authority, the idea is that every dropout snared in this
net becomes the responsibility of adults who know him or her
personally.
</P>
<P>
   To absolutely no one's surprise, this kind of intensive
involvement with kids works. With whatever new money Gingrich and
Lott end up providing, Herman will be able to travel the country
finding more locally based gems to empower. As also fits Third Way
thinking _ activist but decentralized and intolerant of failure _
each initiative will run on a contract after which it will be
expected to be self-sustaining with local and business support.
</P>
<P>
   Herman was able to get all this going by pouncing on the
flip-side of the debate on Clinton's stalled effort to get special
authority to negotiate trade expansion treaties.
</P>
<P>
   As President Kennedy recognized 36 years ago when he began the
modern era of liberalization, Herman believes one of the
obligations of government is to assist those who are going to be
adversely affected in a global economy, where jobs can move almost
as fast as money.
</P>
<P>
   To make her case this year, Herman had a killer statistic. The
roughly half-million young people who drop out for good each year
just happen to match the 500,000 technology jobs going begging in
the US, and about to be filled under special legislative authority
by imported talent, thanks to our still-underperforming schools.
</P>
<P>
   But there is, of course, much more information that ties
education level to economic success. The national jobless rate may
remain below five percent, but it is above 20 percent among
16-to-24-year-old dropouts, and above 10 percent for young people
with only a high school diploma. In dollars, the equation is
simple: For working dropouts, average earnings are $15,000; for
high school grads only, $22,000; with some college, $25,000; with a
college diploma, $38,000; and with an advanced degree, $61,000.
</P>
<P>
   And, for good measure, this from the Justice Department: two out
of three male state prison inmates are dropouts; and some 30
percent of black males aged 20-29, and eight percent of whites are
either in the clink or on probation or parole.
</P>
<P>
   Case closed. As Herman told me recently, this is either a
permanent drag on our society and economy or a potentially large
tax base. Maybe during the TV time-outs of the impeachment
hearings, Gingrich and Lott can do a little better next year.

HARSHBARGER'S FAULTY CAMPAIGN ASIDE, HE CAN STILL WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every campaign has its low point. This week, Scott Harshbarger's
gubernatorial campaign reached its nadir.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the debate Monday night, although that was widely
viewed as a defeat for Harshbarger. And it wasn't just the new
Opinion Dynamics Corp. poll (conducted for Mass Insight, a Boston
business group, prior to the debate) showing Harshbarger trailing
Paul Cellucci by eight percentage points. And it wasn't just the
belated endorsements of ranking Democrats, whose support under
normal circumstances would have long since been tendered.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than that. This week, a consensus began to form
among the political cognoscenti that Harshbarger's campaign had no
strategy or purpose beyond the candidate's ambition to move up the
political ladder. No one, except for a few Republican consultants,
said this publicly, of course. But privately the assessments were
scathing.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for high public office need three ``stories'' to make
their campaigns comprehensible. They need a ``personal'' story that
gives voters a sense of who they are. They need a ``political''
story that shows voters that they can win and accomplish at least
some of what they propose. And they need a ``policy'' story that
gives voters a road map of what actions they would likely take, if
elected. Harshbarger's campaign lacks these three stories.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the Boston Phoenix what ``one thing he wishes more
people knew about him,'' Harshbarger's response bordered on the
unintelligible. ``I mean, I think that, you know, I think this has
been the great challenge of this _ and, and probably the great
challenge _ and, and an appropriate _ and a recognition of what
running for governor is. I think people know _ the people really
want to know who you are. If there's one thing, I'd like people to
know where I came from.'' He comes from Pennsylvania. He needs a
better personal story than that.
</P>
<P>
   His political story isn't much better. Harshbarger's
fund-raising has lagged behind Cellucci's despite minimal primary
opposition. The belated endorsements this week by Ira Jackson,
Chris Gabrieli, House Speaker Thomas Finneran, and the
Massachusetts congressional delegation only served to underscore
doubts about the depth of Harshbarger's political support. And
Harshbarger's first wave of general election television advertising
seemed almost generic; your double-talking opponent goes here.
Veteran politicians know a good campaign when they see one.
Harshbarger's campaign strikes most professionals as disorganized
and amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a policy story is the most surprising missing
element of his campaign. Harshbarger has known for a long time that
he would be the Democratic nominee. He has had more than enough
time to make a substantial case for his candidacy. He has had more
than enough time to hone a serious critique of Cellucci's
stewardship. So far, however, he has not really moved beyond
sloganeering (``Labors agenda is my agenda'') and not very smart
sloganeering at that.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rule of thumb in politics that attorneys general make
terrible gubernatorial candidates. It is the opinion of most
Democrats that Harshbarger has to date been a terrible
gubernatorial candidate. Having watched his campaign squander so
many opportunities and so much time, many Democratic operatives
wonder if his candidacy can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. Harshbarger is still capable of defeating
Cellucci. Both the Mass Insight poll and the most recent Boston
Globe poll show Cellucci garnering roughly 45 percent of the likely
electorate. That's below where incumbent governors on the road to
re-election usually are at this stage of the campaign. Cellucci's
colleagues in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, and Texas are all
running well north of 50 percent in their reelection campaigns.
They're certain to be reelected in November. Cellucci is not.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that Massachusetts is the most Democratic state
in the nation, giving Harshbarger a significant homefield
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Cellucci is vulnerable to intelligent attack. There is
a palpable sense that the combined Weld-Cellucci administration has
run out of gas. And there is a widespread perception among voters
that Cellucci is not nearly as good a politician as his
predecessor. Those are two lines of attack that will fall on
receptive ears. Harshbarger needs only to retool and simplify his
campaign messages to regain the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as former state Senate President Kevin Harrington said
this week, if Harshbarger wins in November, he and state Senate
President Tom Birmingham will control the political agenda for the
next four years. If Cellucci wins, he and House Speaker Finneran
will control the agenda for the next four years. Those are two very
different agendas. Democratic interest groups that prefer
Birmingham to Finneran have a real stake in electing Harshbarger.
For these reasons alone, the gubernatorial race remains too close
to call.

COLON CANCER'S MISSED OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Sapna Syngal leans over 59-year-old Andres Hernandez, who is
curled on his side in the darkened procedure room. ``How are you
doing, Mr. Hernandez?'' she asks. ``Fine,'' he mumbles through a
medication-induced haze.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, only two or three times during the 25-minute
procedure does Hernandez grimace with discomfort, even though
Syngal has pushed a flexible probe tipped with camera, light
source, and tiny instruments deep into his belly.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the upper end of Hernandez' colon, Syngal reverses
direction. As she slowly withdraws the probe, she examines each of
the 35 inches of its glistening pink surface on a large color TV
monitor. This ``fantastic voyage'' pays off; she finds two small
polyps _ precursors of potential malignancies _ and painlessly
snips them off.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Syngal sharply reduced the chances that
Hernandez will be one of the 1.3 million Americans destined to
suffer colorectal cancer in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Colonoscopy is undoubtedly the most dreaded common diagnostic
test. Who doesn't squirm at the very idea of it? But no other
procedure can actually prevent a major cancer as well as detect it,
with near-100 percent accuracy, at a stage almost guaranteed to be
curable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should die of colon cancer, and nobody should be afraid
to ask their doctor about screening,'' says Dr. Peter McNally of
Evans Army Hospital in Colorado Springs, a spokesman for the
American College of Gastroenterology, which is meeting in Boston.
``It's better to be embarrassed and submit to screening tests than
to die of colon cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim that every last colon cancer death can be prevented
may be an overstatement. Some cases occur at younger ages, when
annual screening is only recommended for individuals who are are at
high risk because they have a strong family history of the disease,
previous colon polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease. Think of New
York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry, 36, who underwent colon
cancer surgery this month, or Jay Monahan, the NBC legal
commentator and husband of ``Today Show'' host Katie Couric, who
died of colon cancer this year at age 42.
</P>
<P>
   But the general point is valid for the vast majority of people.
In combination with a few other simpler and cheaper screening
tests, colonoscopy has the potential to slash the number of deaths
from colorectal cancer by at least half, according to a recent
panel convened by the American Gastroenterological Association.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big deal, considering that cancer of the colon and
rectum kills 56,500 Americans a year _ more than breast cancer
(27,100) or prostate cancer (39,200). Only lung cancer kills more
(160,100). And both sexes are affected equally, with incidence
rates climbing sharply after age 50.
</P>
<P>
   For its enormous impact, colorectal cancer gets
disproportionately little attention. ``Colon cancer has gotten a
lot less press than breast or prostate cancer, maybe because people
are uncomfortable talking about it,'' Syngal says. ``There are a
lot of misperceptions. Women think it's a man's disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, few people appreciate how much they can do to
prevent colon cancer or nab it when it's curable. No other major
cancer is so amenable to such preemption &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental message is that we need to screen more
people,'' says Dr. Robert Mayer of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston, a leading colon cancer treatment specialist.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the potential of annual screening, beginning at
age 50, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   _Three of every four large-bowel cancers occur in people with no
known risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   _The average age at diagnosis is 67. But the disease almost
always grows slowly, with pre-malignant polyps typically arising
five to 10 years before cancer is diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   _By age 50, 30 percent of individuals have precancerous growths
called adenomas in their lower intestines, a rate that rises to 50
percent by age 65.
</P>
<P>
   All this presents both a challenge and an opportunity to catch
most colorectal cancers well before they have penetrated the bowel
wall and spread to nearby lymph nodes or organs, such as the liver.
Once this has happened, the chances of being alive five years after
the diagnosis drop sharply _ to about 70 percent if lymph nodes are
affected, less than 10 percent with more distant spread.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms, experts say, don't provide enough warning. As the
American Cancer Society has said for years, blood in the stool,
abdominal pain, or change in bowel habits are warning signs of
colorectal cancer. But most bowel cancers cause no symptoms until
they're beyond _ sometimes well beyond _ the early, curable stage.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened with Darryl Strawberry, whose colon tumor
was painful and walnut-sized when it was removed. On Friday, his
doctors announced the cancer had spread to one lymph node,
necessitating chemotherapy and lowering his long-term survival odds
to about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, most patients wait until they have symptoms,''
says Dr. Robert Kurtz, chief of gastroenterology at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. ``The best chance
of finding an early-stage colon cancer is through regular screening
of patients who are asymptomatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Screening for bowel cancer is fairly straightforward, but fairly
few people in the cancer-prone years undergo it _ or are even
offered it by their physicians. The US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention recently reported that only 26 percent of Americans
over age 50 have been tested for blood in their stool within the
past three years _ the first-line screening test.
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 percent had had a colonoscopy within the past five
years, the CDC found. Rates of both were lower among women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get primary care physicians to think about colon
cancer screening, and we have to get patients to ask for it,''
Kurtz says.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to ask for, if you're over 50 and of ``average
risk,'' meaning there's been no colorectal cancer or precancerous
polyp among first-degree relatives (sibling, parent, or child), no
personal history of polyps, and you do not suffer from inflammatory
bowel disease. (Those with any of these risk factors should get the
same tests, but earlier and more frequently.)
</P>
<P>
   First, get an annual fecal occult blood test, a simple way to
determine if there is any trace of blood in the stool, which might
indicate the presence of a precancerous polyp or an early
malignancy. The test, which costs only $10 to $15, consists of a
set of cards on which to smear a small sample from three successive
bowel movements; a laboratory determines if there's any blood
present.
</P>
<P>
   The test isn't perfect. It fails to detect polyps if they don't
happen to be bleeding at the time the test is done, and it can
falsely indicate the presence of blood. ``If you screen 100 people,
you typically would get about four positives,'' says Ronald
Schoengold of SmithKline Diagnostics, which makes the widely used
Hemoccult tests. ``Of those, two are likely to have either a large
polyp or a cancer, and two would be considered false positives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, done annually, the occult blood test is likely to pick
up a problem at an early stage. Using the test could reduce colon
cancer deaths by 33 percent, the Gastroentological Association
panel estimated. For every 100,000 people screened, that would mean
1,330 fewer deaths.
</P>
<P>
   To pick up polyps missed by the occult blood test, experts
recommend a procedure called flexible sigmoidoscopy every five
years. This is similar to colonoscopy, but it reaches only the
lower third of the large intestine; the theory is that if polyps
are found there, they might also be present further up.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmoidoscopy is a doctor's-office procedure costing $80 to $100
(compared to $300 to $1,000 for colonoscopy), and it doesn't
require heavy sedation or as rigorous a purge of the entire bowel
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Combining annual occult blood testing and every-five-years
sigmoidoscopy could cut the yearly incidence of colon cancer from
4,988 cases to 1,901 cases for every 100,000 individuals screened,
and prevent 1,609 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   When an occult blood test is positive or a sigmoidoscopy finds
precancerous polyps, that's a signal to do a complete colonoscopy.
A routine sigmoidoscopy exam is what brought Hernandez, a Mission
Hill resident, to the Brigham and Women's Hospital last week for
colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Although relatively expensive, colonoscopy is the only proven
way to prevent colon cancer and catch it early. Studies show it
costs about $25,000 for each year of life saved, compared to
$30,000 for mammograms to detect early breast cancer. Recognizing
the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy and other colorectal cancer
screening, Medicare began paying for it this year. Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care, New England's largest HMO, pays for it whenever
doctors think it's necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colon cancer screening is more expensive than mammography, but
it's a lot more effective,'' Syngal says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the discomfort, both doctors and patients say it's almost
always less than people anticipate. (The worst part, many say, is
the need to restrict food and to take powerful laxatives the day
before.)
</P>
<P>
   Ask Andres Hernandez. ``It didn't hurt,'' he says. ``It's like a
stomach full of gas.''

ARE MORE BOY BABIES BORN, OR GIRLS??
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Are more boy babies born, or more girls?
</P>
<P>
   E.B., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Boys have the edge at the start. But nature has a feminine
preference from then on.
</P>
<P>
   There are approximately 105 boys born for every 100 girls. There
is little regional variation in that ratio around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive biologists aren't sure why more males are
conceived, but some believe it has to do with how much the sperm
for each gender weighs. The sperm that will create a female carries
one X chromosome. The `male' sperm has a Y.
</P>
<P>
   Think of that Y as an X that's missing a leg. That leg has a
tiny but real weight. So the sperm that will make a male is
lighter. Scientists think that may help the male sperm swim faster,
or use less energy and last longer, as millions of sperm compete to
be the one that will fertilize the egg.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ``guys'' get to the egg first, how do any females get
conceived? Dr. Machelle Seibel, of the Faulkner Center for
Reproductive Medicine, says what matters most isn't how fast the
sperm gets to the finish line. It's more an issue of when the egg
gets there to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   The egg is viable for about 18 hours after it is released from
its follicle in the ovary. If the introduction of sperm takes place
before that 18 hour window begins, the sperm that get to the
fallopian tube first find no egg. They get there too soon. But if
ovulation occurs several hours afterward, the steady, heavier,
slower female sperm have time to catch up and even the odds.
</P>
<P>
   From fertilization on, however, the chances of surviving are
better if you're female. Dr. Selwyn Oskowitz of the Boston In Vitro
Fertilization Clinic, says more male fetuses die during pregnancy.
``For some reason we don't understand, males are not as strong or
viable.''
</P>
<P>
   After birth, more male children die of illness than females, and
by puberty, the population is gender neutral. And women live longer
than men, too, by two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Moral issues aside, since humans and chimpanzees are so
genetically similar, can human sperm impregnate a chimp's egg?
</P>
<P>
   R.U., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer from some of the most renowned scientists in the
field is a unqualified ``maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Biggers, professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical
School, says, ``No one knows because I don't think anyone has
tried.'' Such research, he explains, is fraught with moral and even
legal risks. And almost no one will fund it.
</P>
<P>
   As to the biochemical question, Biggers says human sperm can
probably get through the outer ``shell,'' the zona pelucida, of a
chimp's egg. The three-layered zona surrounds the cell membrane of
the egg and has receptors on it, like tiny locks. The head of the
sperm has proteins that are like specially-shaped keys. The keys
and locks of each species are designed so they only fit each other.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi of the University of Hawaii ran a series
of experiments to develop a test of the viability of human sperm by
seeing if it would bind with the zona receptors of other species.
He didn't try chimps, but he says human sperm did bind with the
eggs of gibbons, another primate. The experiment was terminated
before the sperm made it into the egg cell.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't think the human-chimp combination would work.
``Human sperm is very choosy about its partner,'' Yanagimachi says.
</P>
<P>
   If the sperm-egg binding process is so species-specific, how do
you explain hybrids, like mules bred from horses and donkeys?
Biggers explains that sometimes when species are similar enough,
the proteins in the sperm of one species will fit the zona pelucida
receptors in the other. ``They're not absolutely precise,'' he
says. ``This may be built into the system to encourage evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   When the key and lock do fit, it triggers the sperm to release
enzymes that dissolve the zona in that one spot. The sperm then
passes through and enters the egg. That triggers the zona to close
all its receptors to any other sperm.
</P>
<P>
   But then the big question arises. Would the chromosomes from the
human sperm match those in the nucleus of the chimp egg closely
enough so they can fuse, forming new cells and a new organism? The
answer, said several renowned geneticists, is, ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hybrids have been bred from animals that are further apart
genetically than humans and chimpanzees. But until somebody
actually dares to try this one, no one will be able to say whether
nature can abide a human-zee.
</P>

daughter. ``My mother-in-law had just been arrested by the Serbian
Police. We had to leave.'' Now Gashi's family of six lives in an

crying together on the 10-by-10-foot square of floor that has

LORD OF THE DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born on the Trans-Siberian Express. Could there be any more
dramatic start to a life? And it only became more so. Rudolf
Nureyev, born on that train in 1938, was theatrical onstage and
off, projecting such a huge image in the theater that people
meeting him out of it were often surprised at how slight he was. A
5-foot, 8-inch wisp, he willed himself into looking larger. Before
him, Soviet male dancers performed with their heels barely off the
floor. Nureyev rose to a very high demi-pointe, heels as high as
they could get without his standing on the tips of his toes. He
made himself seem taller _ and also more elegant, competing with
the ballerinas he partnered instead of deferring to them, goading
even Margot Fonteyn to ever-greater heights, until theirs became
the most legendary partnership in the history of dance. Nureyev,
who died in 1993, was not just the most famous dancer since
Nijinsky; like Nijinsky, he loudly asserted the importance of the
male in an art form dominated by the female.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that by now there would be nothing more to say about
the career of the first of the modern era's dancer-defectors. Not
so. The nervy Nureyev filled his autobiography _ written, with
help, when he was just 24 _ with misleading information that made
for a more interesting story. Most subsequent books have been heavy
on hagiography and luscious photographs. Diane Solway's new
``Nureyev: His Life'' comes as corrective and amplification. A New
York journalist, Solway also wrote the 1994 ``A Dance Against Time:
The Brief Brilliant Life of a Joffrey Dancer,'' about a less famous
dancer, Edward Stierle, who, like Nureyev, died of AIDS. She spent
five years on what is the fullest Nureyev biography to date,
conducting interviews in seven languages, gaining access to
previously classified Soviet documents that explain the dancer's
KGB-provoked 1961 defection, quoting skeptical and even scathing
reviews along with the raves.
</P>
<P>
   Her labor was worth it. This is an engrossing book; even at 550
pages (without notes and index), it doesn't begin to lag until very
near the end. Solway digs beneath the superficialities _ Nureyev's
late start, his flamboyant temperament, his rootless career _ and
explains his compulsion to dance virtually until he dropped dead.
</P>
<P>
   Her account of his early life is moving without being
melodramatic. To his first day of kindergarten, Nureyev wore his
sister's coat and no shoes, because his family was too poor to
afford them. The child grew into a man who owned half a dozen homes
and a trio of islands off Italy's Amalfi coast. By then he could
afford not only shoes, but his own desalination plant.
</P>
<P>
   Solway has the luxury of space to tell us about Nureyev actually
living with a London dance critic who reviewed his performances,
about his great romance with Danish dancer Erik Bruhn, about his
nasty anti-Semitic remarks, and the controversy he caused in the
gay community by never publicly announcing he had AIDS. The one
thing you could always count on with Nureyev was that he'd stir
things up.
</P>
<P>
   However storied his career, it also had great disappointments.
The greatest was being shunned by George Balanchine, whom he
idolized: Balanchine, though, was vehemently against stars, and
Nureyev was the brightest of them all. Balanchine encouraged team
spirit and loyalty; Nureyev was a loner who wandered the world.
While he dabbled in modern dance and new works, and in the few
Balanchine ballets that came his way, it was in the 19th-century
classics _ ``Giselle,'' ``Swan Lake,'' ``Le Corsaire'' _ that he
shone. In his prime, Nureyev routinely received half-hour standing
ovations for making those warhorses thrilling. Solway explains how
he did it: ``In calling attention to the difficulty of a step, he
telegraphed not only his own excitement at carrying it off but the
notion that dancing itself was a risky business.''
</P>
<P>
   His contribution to the art was not only his own dancing, but
sparking that of others, starting with Fonteyn, the Royal Ballet's
prima, and continuing with the Royal's men. Before Nureyev landed
with this company that came closest to giving him a permanent home,
its gentlemen were too gentle. Nureyev gave them a jump-start. As
director of the Paris Opera Ballet, a hidebound and hierarchical
enterprise when he arrived, Nureyev restored the company to the
position of preeminence it still holds. It was Parisian dancing
that first inspired Russian ballet; Nureyev returned the favor.
Just as he'd broken the rules in Russia _ refusing to wear the
traditional puffy breeches he called ``lampshades'' over his
tights, cutting out unintelligible mime _ he scandalized Parisians
by quickly promoting young talent over Paris Opera dancers he felt
were past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   His rent-a-company attitude provoked resentment from troupes who
felt he'd made them into living scenery, pushed to the back so he
could monopolize center stage. He'd regularly leave ballerinas in
the lurch: When displeased, he'd offer his partner a single finger
for support rather than his whole hand. ``Nureyev, Leave Canadian
Ballet Alone'' was the headline on a 1975 article by Canadian
critic John Fraser. Boston Ballet was among the troupes he
``honored'' in the 1980s, and its dancers were often demoralized at
serving as his backdrop. But in his staging of ``Don Quixote'' for
the company, Nureyev roused Boston to give some of its best-ever
performances. In a revival of the ballet after his death, the
dancers looked comatose by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   What is Nureyev's legacy? His efforts at original choreography,
acting in films, and conducting orchestras weren't notably
successful. He wasn't a meticulous dance technician like
Baryshnikov. He was, however, a workaholic who was obsessed with
details down to the last stitch on a costume. He certainly brought
ballet out of the realm of the connoisseur and into the wider
world, appearing on the covers of weekly news magazines and
whipping up his fans in rock-star style. He helped popularize
ballet, but perhaps not permanently. In America, balletomania has
been on the decline since Nureyev's glory years.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy man obsessed with avoiding taxes, he left an estate
worth millions to two dance foundations Solway criticizes for
failing to make the kind of ``bold artistic statement'' that their
creator was famous for. ``Rather than honor Nureyev's
forward-looking spirit,'' she writes, ``perhaps through major
commissions to new choreographers, the American foundation chose in
1997 to underwrite a Bolshoi Ballet production of the full-length
version of `Le Corsaire' by the Boston Ballet,'' a production that
proved one of the worst 19th-century revivals in the company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, weakened by AIDS, Nureyev was as pathetic as
the sad clown Petrouchka. It was painful to watch him hobble
through works he'd once commanded. He refused not only to give up
dancing, but also to give up the most challenging works in the
repertory. When, at age 50, Nureyev was finally invited to dance
with the New York City Ballet _ not by Balanchine but by his
successor, Peter Martins _ he was cast in the relatively placid
``Orpheus'' when the part he'd longed for was the far more
demanding ``Apollo.'' Solway has a perceptive explanation for this,
too. Nureyev, she reminds us, was always more interested in what he
couldn't do than what he could.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biography is a dubious treasure for fiction writers. Besieged by
the world around them, they are presumed to eschew it in favor of
the imagination _ preferring the province of artistic license to
the more earthly, lead-footed realm we think of as fact. The
fiction writer (says the purists' theory) utilizes reality only in
order to transcend it. Thus we are not supposed to care that Emma
Bovary was modeled after Flaubert's mistress, or that Bellow
extrapolated his tragic poet Humboldt from Delmore Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, especially, are not supposed to care, or even notice:
Calling attention to fact in the midst of fiction is considered
gossip, or at least bad form; and it usually does the novel or
story little literary service to trace its biographical origins. If
the writer has done his or her job correctly, making silk from a
sow's ear, then it won't much matter what the barnyard critter was
to begin with. But when the fiction produced is merely roman a
clef, transparent to the point of its own demise, reality itself
has been the culprit _ invading, often destroying, the harder work
of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Roth has made great mischief over the years insinuating
his alter ego into his fiction, bestowing Nathan Zuckerman with a
Rothian self-consciousness, turning reviewers into pretzels over
whether or not the stories therein are actually ``true.'' He has
brilliantly inserted details of his own life (the Halcion-induced
breakdown of the protagonist of ``Operation Shylock,'' for
instance) into his novels, making use of what he knows firsthand to
infuse the fiction with depth and awareness _ a kind of
post-Joycean articulation of consciousness. When Roth does this act
of literary camouflage well, nobody does it better; line for line,
there is scarcely a smarter writer in America.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not done it well in ``I Married a Communist,'' which
has a valuable center marred by wooden and neglected character
development _ and by, one must assume, personal invective, since
the villainess at its center so closely resembles the actress
Claire Bloom, Roth's partner of some two decades. Their acrimonious
split a few years ago was followed by Bloom's pathos-ridden 1996
memoir, ``Leaving a Doll's House,'' which detailed Roth's emotional
control over her and his cold insistence that she toss out her
teenage daughter to make room for him and his writerly ways. But
Roth didn't suffer nearly so badly in Bloom's kiss-and-purge
account as he does here, by his own hand. The ghastly look-alikes
in ``I Married a Communist'' _ a failed, hollow actress named Eve
Frame and her pathologically selfish daughter, Sylphid _ so
overwhelm the novel that its larger plot seems like mere
scaffolding by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Which is partly to say that there are actually two stories going
on in this novel; the larger, which engages Roth's full-throttle
intelligence, involves the ruin of a radio actor during the
anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s. Ira Ringold is a giant of
a man, a Newark kid from a troubled family who grew up under the
care of his older brother to be 6-foot-6, deep-voiced, and
passionately committed to whatever cause got to him first. The
brother, Murray, escaped their past by heading for the light of
knowledge; when he became a high school English teacher, he found
art to believe in and kids to save on the way up. Ira, his wounds
less sublimated and his brawn more imposing, became a ditch-digger
and a rabble-rouser _ what he didn't learn in school, he got at the
knee of the party-line leftists he met in the Army during World War
II. He took that instruction to a factory line in Chicago, then to
the streets, possessing the class roots, the timbre, and the
rhetoric to organize the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   And what a Bolshevik he was! Roth has infused ``I Married a
Communist'' with the heart and soul of the Old Left; from the
Communist Party's internecine struggles after the war to the
tragicomic passions of adoring the proletariat, the novel possesses
a historical authenticity resonant with authority. Discovered by a
radio producer while fund-raising for the union (with that bulk, he
did a mean Abe Lincoln imitation), Ira eventually makes his way
into radio _ becoming a mouthpiece, as it were, for a soon-targeted
liberal show called ``The Free and the Brave.'' Rube turned radio
star, he is no match for the urbane, thrice-divorced Eve Frame, who
finds in Ira the requisite brute she so longs to tame. Once
ensconced in her New York salon on West 11th Street _ a place of
high life and high manners _ Ira becomes the reluctant witness to
Eve's hysterical inadequacies: her self-hating anti-Semitism, her
unhealthy attachment to her daughter, a wanting of character that
will ultimately be her, and his, undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ira's rise and fall is relayed some 40 years later
by Murray Ringold to his former student, Roth's Zuckerman; a chance
meeting near Zuckerman's isolated home in Western Massachusetts has
reunited them for a few days. So the narration of the novel is
shared between them: Murray remembering his younger brother's
wrenching story, Zuckerman reflecting on the man who, for a while,
became one of his mentors as the young Zuckerman formed a life.
This joint retelling authenticates the story as well as enhancing
it: A good liberal who believed in Shakespeare instead of ideology,
Murray is an eminently sane and reliable narrator; writer
Zuckerman, who was only a young bit player in Ira's complicated
life, gets to filter the tale through his usual bittersweet
sensibility. Like Swede Levov's angry brother in ``American
Pastoral,'' Murray only wanted to save his sibling from himself.
And as with the plummet from grace that belonged to ``American
Pastoral,'' the real miscreant at the center of this novel turns
out to be the force of history.
</P>
<P>
   That ``I Married a Communist'' forms another piece of a loosely
woven intellectual series (along with ``Sabbath's Theatre'' and
``American Pastoral'') is confirmed by a sentence play buried in
all three books; here, it's about Ira's need to change the world.
The cruel backfire of that need, personal and universal, with all
its attendant yearnings, isn't revealed until the novel's final
pages, which are of such depth and eloquent wisdom they almost make
up for the book's failings. But Roth should have known to leave out
his own merciless insights about betrayal, at least so far as they
result in making Eve and Sylphid caricatured demons whose misdoings
don't work with the rest of the story. They're tacked on like some
larger-than-life shadows of hobgoblins; as with Ira's Stalinist
rages, the indictment of them vacillates between shrill and dull.
``I Married a Communist'' shouldn't have to suffer so much because
of this mother-daughter duo, but it does. If Roth had put half that
misguided passion into his other characters _ particularly Ira, but
also a few inspired walk-ons _ he might have had the book he (or at
least we) desired.
</P>
<P>
   Scavengers of Roth's personal life will find much here to dine
on; literary Rothians, too, will delight in certain highlights _ a
visit to a taxidermist, a wonderful screed by an English Lit mentor
of Zuckerman's, a shimmeringly intelligent evocation of
Shakespeare. I was left feeling forlorn: missing the triumphant
brilliance of Roth, especially in those gorgeous final pages, when
Zuckerman leaves behind the cruel bargains of life, and turns his
sights toward unblemished skies.

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``The X Files''  &LR; _ The big screen didn't enlarge
the scope of one of television's best series. Instead of creating
spook-ier bits of paranoia and alien alienation, this feature was
like a 48-minute episode stretched out. We expected more and got
less.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``W. &LR;  &UR; C. Fields Collection'' &LR;  _ I hate to sound like an old
fogy, but these Fields films are some of the best comedies on
video. ``It's a Gift,'' ``You Can't Cheat an Honest Man,'' and
``Million Dollar Legs'' form a triumverate of classic cinema. The
latter, co-written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, features Fields as the
president of Klopstokia, and includes visual and verbal gags at
their best. (By the way, this 1932 release has nothing in common
with the dismal 1939 Betty Grable film with the same title.)

OPRAH, WITH FEELING

 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody wanted to see ``Beloved,'' Toni Morrison's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, turned into a movie. Not the literary
establishment, not Hollywood, not Morrison herself. She couldn't
see how her dense, elliptical novel about the devastating effects
of slavery could be turned into a stream of film images that would
do justice to her dark, primal hymn to survival. Nobody saw
``Beloved'' as a movie except Oprah Winfrey. Now, 10 years after
Winfrey read the book in a single day, was shattered by it, and
talked Morrison into letting her buy the film rights, ``Beloved''
opens Friday. The deep-running film is part ghost story, part love
story. Winfrey plays its central figure, Sethe, driven by mother
love and haunted love.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy birth for Winfrey, who calls the film her
baby. And it won't be an easy sell. But Winfrey, born in
Mississippi, didn't come out of a Milwaukee-ghetto childhood and a
Nashville adolescence to become the queen of TV talk shows on easy.
She got where she is because of her penchant for getting down in
the emotional trenches and empathizing. Her strength is the
strength of the heart, compelling respect in a time of ever-lower
standards because the dignity, sincerity, and genuineness of her
open emotionalism never are cheap or exploitative. They are the
real thing, and people sense it.
</P>
<P>
   Her emotions are so real, she recalls as she stretches out on a
sofa in a Boston hotel, that she almost disqualified herself from
playing the iron-willed former slave trying to reconstruct her life
in Cincinnati after the Civil War, across the Ohio River from
Kentucky, where she had been a defiant _ and brutalized _ slave.
``That was my biggest challenge,'' Winfrey says. ``To be quite
honest with you, that's what Toni Morrison had said to (director)
Jonthan Demme. Her exact words were `Oprah Winfrey is emotional.
Sethe is not.' Many days, Jonathan would come up to me and say,
`You told me you were going to open yourself up and let Sethe
through. Instead, you're feeling sympathy for her.'''
</P>
<P>
   But feeling, Winfrey knew instinctively, she says, was going to
be her key to the role and her key to moving audiences. ``I wanted
people to feel what I felt when I put down the book after reading
it. I felt a sense of devastation. I felt numbed by the experience.
I felt a raw kind of aching inside myself, and I wanted to explain
what that was. I wanted people to know what slavery was, not
academically, but as felt knowledge. And then to feel the grace and
wonder of this woman who could open herself to love again despite
what she had gone through on that hollow dark path.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm trying to say `I want to make a difference'
without saying `I want to make a difference,' 'cause everybody says
they want to make a difference. Everybody who ever accepts an MTV
award says they wrote that song because they wanted to make a
difference. I see people on the Fashion Awards. They wanted to make
a difference. So I realize it sounds trite, but it comes from a
pure place, it really does.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time I was like feeling I had not even the right to
try because I was overweight, this 200-pound woman. Sethe wouldn't
have been overweight. People weren't in that period. Having access
to the, you know, good life, was not as available as you think.
People ate healthier. They grew their own food. There was no junk
food. I learned what it takes just to go to the pump and draw the
water, go to the garden and pick the greens, clean the greens, take
the salt block and chip the salt from the block, churn the butter.
I mean, by the time you go through all that, it is exhausting just
getting one meal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey says she struggled at first when she acted in ``The
Color Purple'' and ``Native Son,'' her two other big-screen films,
the former bringing her an Academy Award nomination for another
strong woman facing white overlords. ``I always think everybody's
better than I am because they do it for a living,'' she says. ``I
was very insecure on this although I had done the work, the
preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparation included a simulated escape along the
Underground Railway. ``How do you know which way to go in the
middle of the night, barefoot? When you don't know which way north
is? I wanted to experience that. I was taken into the woods,
blindfolded, in Maryland, and they had some people doing what I
call Underground improv. Finally, I hit that psychological chord,
that shock wave in my body. There was a line one of the guys used,
he didn't even know he did this for me, when I said, `I'm a free
woman. If I can just get my papers, I think I can explain.' And he
said, `You don't think nothing, gal. You don't think nothing
because you belong to me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That connected to me like nothing else had. I just started
crying hysterically, but I went, `That's it!' Well, that's what it
is, you know. Your life is not your own. I can tell you this now.
Nobody wants to experience that kind of pain. Sethe knew that any
time she came home from the fields, she could find her children
gone _ sold from her. She knew that any time the master got upset
with someone, thst person could be beaten or sold. Sethe knew that
to the man who owned her she was an animal, that her own children
really weren't hers to love. She knew that to send her children
back to this was a hopeless living death. What does life mean if
you don't belong to yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   As filming proceeded in the summer of 1997, pressure grew.
Winfrey was due back in Chicago to resume her talk show. Phone
lines began heating up. While she stalled by having celebrities
like Jay Leno and Diane Sawyer stand in for her, she finally got a
sense of what the interior life of a slave was like by calling upon
real slaves. Long a collector of slave memorabilia she keeps on her
Indiana farm to keep her in touch with her roots, Winfrey says she
hung on the walls of her film-set trailer actual slave ledgers,
listing slaves as plantation property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have bills of sale, I have ledgers that contain the names of
slaves along with the mules, the cattle, the furniture, how many
plows, how many wagons, how many sheep, how much silverware, how
many bowls, how many cups. You would have `Little Sarah, $700, 4
years old,' or `Big John, $1,100, 37 years old.' I have one list
with 77 names and another with 42 names. I would sit in my trailer
and I would light candles and have a little display, call it an
altar if you wish, with the ledgers. I would call out the names
before I would do a scene. I would say, `Now I'm doing the milk
scene, and this is for you, Little Sarah.'''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey's face clouds over when she recalls the most painful
aspect of playing Sethe _ watching makeup artists place prosthetic
lash scars on her bare back every day. ``I cried every time,''
Winfrey says. ``Even when they were just trying to test it, to find
the right set of prosthetics, and, um, then and every other time,
I'd get sick. Nauseous, nauseous. Sick, diarrhea, throwing up,
sick, sick. One day I was so sick, Jonathan came and told me I
could go home. I was determined I would not have them talking about
me getting sick over the tree (gruesome nickname for the network of
scars).''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Winfrey says, she was moved to make the film because
she believes in the healing power of art. ``Art takes your breath
away and gives you new breath. A new way of thinking. It deepens
you. Still, if I had had my book club back in 1988, when I bought
the rights, I might just have said, `Go ahead, read the book!'''
Not that Winfrey won't go on making films. Mostly, she'll produce
them, in large part for TV. She bought rights to another Morrison
novel, ``Paradise,'' jokes that the leading character is Hispanic
and she wouldn't be able to bring it off as an actress. She might,
however, play a character in Zora Neale Hurston's ``Their Eyes Were
Watching God.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronting life, confronting herself, and accepting both,
Winfrey says, are what people react to on her show. ``I got this
great letter from a lady one day,'' Winfrey says. ``She says
`Watching you be yourself makes me want to be myself.' That is the
greatest thing that anybody has said to me because life is about
how to become more yourself. I think what people see in me is my
willingness to be myself. Yet I feel I don't stand alone. I have a
sense that my life is bigger than my own. Stuff still abides with
me, and the spirits of all those names I called in the trailer and
those whose names I don't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey takes a deep breath at the prospect of going back to
Chicago to shoot three shows the next day. But, she says, she has
come through a period of turmoil with new energy and resolve. She
had been vacillating about continuing her TV show. But recently she
signed a contract through 2002. She will, she says, take what
comes. ``During the filming, coming to a felt knowledge of what I
had come from and the price that had been paid for me to get here
and be Oprah Winfrey in the 1980s and '90s, all that had cost is
what made me say I can't quit. I didn't do this by myself. I
thought of Margaret Garner, the real-life model for Sethe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of all the people she knew, all those people who
would never have imagined this life. You know, having enough food
in the house and going to Cincinnati and having the ice wagon come
by to have an ice block to keep the food cold was their idea of
luxury. Then I think of my life and I think, well, I don't know
what tired is compared to what they had done. I mean, I just feel
like it gets better. I never saw all this when I was a girl sitting
on the linoleum in my mother's apartment in Milwaukee and my beacon
was Sidney Poitier,'' says the multimillionaire philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I was 10 years old the night he won the Academy
Award. I was in complete awe. Capital A, capital W, capital E.
Because a colored man first of all arrived in a limousine. Then he
won. I thought, wow, I could do that. Was it naive, was it
arrogance? I don't know, but it spoke to the possibility. I see
that God can dream a bigger dream for me than I can hold in my
imagination. And so I'll let the universe do my dreaming for me,
just open myself up to the possibilities, to know what Sethe didn't
know, and that is that tomorrow can be a better day, Miss Scarlett.
Now I just say I'm open, I'm open. Ready to receive whatever the
future has to bring. I'm open.''

THE UNBRIDGEABLE GULF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LIKE NEVER BEFORE 
By Ehud Havazelet. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 268 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this second collection of graceful stories (his first was
``What Is It Then Between Us?''), Ehud Havazelet turns to the most
deeply worn theme in 20th-century American writing: the gulf
between immigrants and their American-born and acculturated
children. That he makes this estrangement so fresh and vivid, that
he handles it mostly without cliches, is a tribute to his sure
command of narrative, character, and convincing emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Havazelet's 10 stories concern the immigrant Birnbaum family,
Max and Ruth, of Queens, N.Y., who are Polish Jews, and their two
children, David and Rachel. Max _ Maxim _ is a teacher in a Hebrew
school, the son of a rabbi who brought his family to America after
World War II. It is not clear how the family lived through the war,
though one gripping story set in the past, ``Lyon,'' reveals that
the father sent his family from Cracow to France while flight was
still possible for Jews. Sixteen-year-old Maxim and his older
brother Rachmil, part of a Jewish underground, collect money in the
south of France in 1943 to support Jews in hiding. A hideaway
apartment is betrayed, and while Maxim escapes, thanks to his
perfect French and false papers, Rachmil does not.
</P>
<P>
   That violent sundering of family is the background of the other
sundering that takes up most of the book, between Max Birnbaum and
his son in America. Max and Ruth are proud of their two children
and have high hopes for them. But both are independent,
high-spirited children of the '60s, freely indulging in pot and
sex, and they reject their parents' religious strictures and
assumptions about what is required for a worthy life.
</P>
<P>
   David, to his parents' enormous pride, graduates from
architecture school, while Rachel becomes a bohemian artisan who
cleans stained-glass windows. She has a succession of good-time
boyfriends who seem to be a lot of fun, though maybe not so good
for her, and definitely not the sort her parents would choose for
her. The one most fully developed, in the story entitled ``Leah,''
is Alex, a pill-popping, dope-dealing, hard-drinking Romanian cab
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rachel is pretty unorthodox, the only son is the bigger
disappointment: David marries a Gentile girl, Maura, lives a bit
recklessly, and winds up losing his marriage and his job. Later he
moves to Oregon (where the author teaches, at Oregon State
University), remarries, becomes a landscaper, and breaks contact
with his parents and past.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-grinding fault between Max and David is the tragic axis
of the book. It would have been easy to make Max an obnoxious,
overbearing table-pounder and David an innocent American boy just
trying to be free. But it's not so simple; in Havazelet's skillful
hands, we see everyone's side of things. Max cannot understand
David's giving up his architecture career and totally rejecting his
Jewishness. Max's bafflement and disappointment has a quiet cast.
From childhood, David is a hot-tempered, combative volcano, filled
with rage toward his parents, his first wife, his own poor luck.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these stories appeared in literary magazines and could
stand alone, but together they form a nuanced portrait of love and
misunderstanding across a chasm no one in life quite bridges.
</P>
<P>
   One story, simply called ``Ruth's Story,'' is told from the
mother's point of view, as she endures a fatal illness. It is one
of the most harrowing and beautiful renderings of a death by
disease, and the end of a long marriage, that I have read. It is
detailed, but graphic only in emotional terms. In ``Leah'' (the
only first-person narrative), Rachel tells of her pious cousin, who
wants only to marry and have a nice family. The tale of Leah's
successive disastrous attempts at marriage would be worthy of Issac
Bashevis Singer; the story's artful subplot is that Rachel, the
supercilious and pitying narrator, is doing no better with her own
free-form and unconventional alliances.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the stories focus on Max and David. In ``The Street
You Live On,'' David's first wife, Maura, is visited at their
apartment on 108th Street in Manhattan by a detective who tells her
that a woman had been murdered in the building next door, in an
apartment whose window is visible from the Birnbaums' window. Maura
is disturbed that she heard nothing, knew nothing, and even more so
by David's casual reaction: ``It's scary,'' he tells her. ``It's
upsetting. ... But we have to look at the statistics. Maybe two
thousand people on this block, right? And one of them gets unlucky.
That's terrible. But New York isn't even one of the most violent
cities. ... This is the city. You're going to run across things.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't sit right with Maura, even so, and the demonstration
of terrible things going on that one does not know about takes a
painful, personal turn.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pillar of Fire,'' David drives off in a rage after a final
parting with Maura, who has found a gentler partner. At a highway
rest stop, two wandering teenage girls hitch a ride with him, and
the three of them end up on a grassy hillside when Drew, the oldest
girl, insists on stopping to look for Halley's Comet. Just as
Rachel's pity for Leah is ironic, so is David's compassion for Drew
and Angie, who at least are able to hope for a sign.
</P>
<P>
   Max's visit to David and his new wife, in the story that gives
the book its title, brings the conflict between them to a
crescendo. In his savage attack on his father, David's sarcastic
summation of his own life suggests that the bitterness he feels is
not all a matter of rage and resistance to his father's
expectations. Max is not the only disappointed one.
</P>
<P>
   In the last-but-one story, ```To Live in Tiflis in the
Springtime,''' David returns to New York for the unveiling of Max's
headstone. He meets Rachel's new boyfriend, Tim, who is some sort
of insurance man (except for Maura, the goyim in this book are an
unappealing lot). Brother and sister talk about their parents, and
it becomes clear that they will be reconciled more to their spirits
than they could ever have been to them as living mother and father.
``I wish I could have told them some things, too,'' David tells
Rachel wistfully. ``I'd apologize, maybe. I don't know. Say I was
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Havazelet's delicate and lyrical voice is beguiling and
consistent. His treatment of his characters is tender but not
cheaply affectionate. A few are familiar fiction-workshop types:
fast-talking wild child Drew could be a character out of Frederick
Barthelme; Alex the Romanian is a caricature of a parent's
nightmare boyfriend. Though he keeps his point of view fairly well
hidden, it is not difficult to see in Havazelet's world that those
who make their own rules and scorn the pieties and verities of an
older time, place, and generation make for themselves a bitter
drink.
</P>
<P>
   In the delightful last story, ``Eight Rabbis on the Roof,''
Max's father and an odd collection of ghosts come to gather the
widower in. While the old rabbi sits at the kitchen table reading
the newspaper, the ghosts raid the refrigerator. Max threatens to
call the police before he begins to understand what is going on.
For both generations, then, the father's spirit wins in the end. In
a book full of hard and bitter moments, this sweet liftoff
concludes a collection full of finely chiseled edges, painful
divisions, and halting, hard-won renewals.

 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the musical world so fragmented among its many rigid
elements, it's notable that three black women in their 20s and 30s
have made their presence felt with CDs that with a mixture of power
and elegance tear down those barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, Angelique Kidjo, and Audra MacDonald will all be on
best-of-the-year lists in their respective genres at the end of
1998 because, ironic-ally, of their skill and courage in taking
those genres to exciting new places. Is there any connection to
their race, age, and gender? Maybe not, but perhaps their playing
the role of traditional outsider has given them the perspective to
see what's wrong with the insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' (Ruffhouse) didn't exactly
come out of nowhere, but the CD by the 23-year-old once and perhaps
future Fugee is the most surprising of the three, with its stunning
mixture of hip-hop, R&AMP;B, reggae, rap, black gospel music,
hard-hitting politics, and an attack on the machismo and misogyny
of many of her rap brothers. It's Aretha meets Angela with nods to
Queen Latifah and Erykah Badu. She literally embodies a marriage of
rap and reggae, since she's about to have a second child with Bob
Marley's son, Rohan.
</P>
<P>
   Hill _ who produced, arranged, and wrote the music _ is still an
unabashed hip-hop artist, but her use of live musicians and her
experimentation with other forms could make people who dismissed
rap as musical graffiti think again while leading members of her
audience out of a self-inflicted ghetto-ization. On ``To Zion,''
for example, Hill combines Carlos Santana's flamenco-ish guitar, a
gospel chorus, a reggae melody, and a march-inflected beat in a
song that is primarily an ode to her first child, but also serves
as a search for a spiritual Eden.
</P>
<P>
   But along with that Badu-like search for spiritual fulfillment
are tough, look-back-in-anger raps at Hill's ``Miseducation,''
which is composed mostly of misogyny and materialism. The songs are
punctuated by a classroom in which children are being led to
examine their attitudes. ``We don't get `in love,' do we?'' the
teacher asks of the black male students in the class. Similarly,
Hill asks of the Ice Cubes of the world, ``Music is supposed to
inspire, so how come we aren't getting no higher?''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Hill's lyrics aren't terribly sophisticated, and some
are xeno-phobic _ ``Look at where you be in hair weaves like
Europeans/-Fake nails done by Koreans.'' For the most part, though,
this is a very strong, articulate performance. Hill wants a world
without boundaries, where women are free from men interested only
in ``that thing,'' men whom she describes as ``need to take care of
their three and four kids men ... Money-taking, heart-breaking now
you wonder why women hate men/-The sneaky silent men the
domestic-violence men/-The quick to shoot the semen stop acting
like boys and be men.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a ``My Back Pages'' feeling to a lot of Hill's
reminiscences, which may sound like a stretch, but that song by Bob
Dylan was the precursor to the barrier-breaking ``Subterranean
Homesick Blues,'' which has been called the first rap song. In
composing such a rich debut album, Hill is already well on her way
to breaking barriers of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Angelique Kidjo has been a top draw on the world music circuit,
so ``Oremi'' (Island) comes from the opposite direction. As Hill
expands her musical vocabulary from the limitations of hip-hop,
Kidjo incorporates hip-hop into the rolling beauty of her African
melodies.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first of a projected trilogy of Kidjo's in which she
traces the black musical diaspora. ``Oremi'' is concerned with
American soul and funk while future CDs will search South America.
It works both ways _ Kidjo reminds us of the African roots of that
music, but she traces her own roots and development in being
influenced by everyone from James Brown to, who knows, Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
   She gets further than Hill, though, at arriving at a promised
land of mix-and-match beauty. Just as Cassandra Wilson, whose voice
graces ``Never Know,'' brought jazz singing into a new era by
looking to the music of Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell, and, yes, the
Monkees, Kidjo gives voice to a spellbinding version of Jimi
Hendrix's ``Voodoo Child'' to open the CD. The spell isn't broken
until the last song, the unfortunately syrupy ``No Worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Kidjo brings in Wilson for scat, Kelly Price for
soul, and Branford Marsalis for sax. Together with a hip-hop or
trip-hop beat, Kidjo and friends establish a soundtrack for walking
down the street in Manhattan or staring out onto a South African
vista. (The CD was recorded in both places.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Hill, Kidjo never loses herself in the eclecticism of her
musical choices. Kidjo's assertively joyful voice as well as her
energetic but clean arrangements is full of the confidence of a
woman sure of her place in the world personally, politically, and
artistically. Kidjo brings it all back home to Africa, but you
don't have to speak the language to know that ``Oremi'' puts her
squarely at the head of the world music class.
</P>
<P>
   Her recent appearance at the Somerville Theatre was reportedly
even more transcendent than the CD. The blurb on the CD claims
``From deep within the African spirit emerges a potent global music
for the new world.'' Kidjo makes you believe that's all more than
record-label hype.
</P>
<P>
   Audra McDonald comes to her chosen world, musical theater, from
a completely different direction, a classical music training. And
what training. At 28, McDonald's soaring soprano has won her Tony
awards for ``Carousel,'' ``Master Class,'' and ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald won those Tonys as supporting actress, but ``Way Back
to Paradise'' (Nonesuch) announces that she's a leading lady _
quite possibly the leading lady in musical theater. Combining the
strength of her Juilliard-trained voice with the elan of a Broadway
star (not to mention her movie-star beauty), McDonald has a
presence that even Zoe Caldwell had to strain to match in ``Master
Class.''
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't enough, add the virtue of extreme generosity to
McDonald's resume. Most Broadway artists would line their first CD
with the ``hits'' that got them there, and McDonald already has an
impressive output on compilations and soundtracks featuring the
music of Richard Rodgers, Leonard Bernstein, George Gershwin, and
the Flaherty-Ahrens songs for Sarah on ``Ragtime.'' Instead,
McDonald has filled her CD with the next generation of
musical-theater songwriters _ Michael John LaChiusa, Ricky Ian
Gordon, Adam Guettel, Jason Robert Brown, and Jenny Giering.
</P>
<P>
   The CD doesn't quite make the case for their looming greatness
as much as it does for McDonald's. But if there aren't any
traditional show stoppers, ``Way Back to Paradise'' grows more
impressive with each listening. These are songs of cool waftings
rather than hot flashes. They also, like the songs of Kidjo and
Hill, speak to personal liberation and political compassion.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald bursts out of the starting gates with the optimism of
Gordon's rich, warm setting of Langston Hughes: ``To fling my arms
wide/-In some place of the sun/-To whirl and to dance .../While
night comes on gently/Dark like me.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald sounds something like fellow opera/Broadway singer Dawn
Upshaw, who joins her on ``Way Back to Paradise,'' only McDonald's
voice has more body. ``Way Back to Paradise'' is from ``Marie
Christine,'' LaChiusa's resetting of ``Medea,'' in which McDonald
is scheduled to star next year. She could be Lauryn Hill's sister
in singing: ``But there is a way back to paradise ... Study all
men/-Learn what they lack/-Sweeten and stroke/-Before you attack.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa's music is the most dramatic of his contemporaries' on
the CD and gives McDonald the best stretching exercises, but she
also brings striking dignity to Gordon's settings of Hughes and
James Agee and a swirl of Sondheim-like passion in ``Parade,''
Brown and Alfred Uhry's upcoming musical based on the Leo Frank
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   If McDonald has a weakness, it's that she doesn't seem to be
totally relaxed. At the recent season opener at Carnegie Hall on
PBS, Brian Stokes Mitchell, her ``Ragtime'' co-star, and Frederica
von Stade seemed to be having a ball onstage while McDonald was all
work. That translates to her sometimes overpowering a lyric the way
that US Open champion Lindsay Davenport can sometimes overpower a
tennis ball. They're still the champs, but if they add more finesse
no one will touch them.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McDonald is competing. When you listen to McDonald,
Kidjo, and Hill, you realize that the real winner is music for
having three such advocates who can take all kinds of musical
forms, and all kinds of audiences, to places they've never been.

WHEN TO CONSIDER PAYING OFF A SMALL MORTGAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Some time in the not-too-distant future I will need to decide
if I want to invest my severance pay or use it to pay off my
mortgage. The mortgage balance is about $60,000, and the severance
pay is about the same. It would be nice to use this money for other
things, including investments, but what would I be giving up in
additional earnings on the $60,000 and tax deductions by paying the
mortgage? The monthly payment is currently $726, with $314 going to
principal and $412 to interest. The mortgage has a variable rate,
currently 8.25 percent and probably due to decline later this year.
It's a 15-year mortgage with 10 years to go.
</P>
<P>
   R.K., Harrisburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Mathematically it's fairly easy to work out. You are paying
about $4,900 annually in interest on this mortgage, and you reap a
$1,372 tax benefit, so the mortgage costs you about $3,528 a year
at this point. (I say about because the cost declines each month as
the mortgage amortizes.) If you were to invest $60,000 in a
fixed-income mutual fund such as one invested in
government-guaranteed mortgage securities, you might expect a yield
of about 6.5 percent, or $3,900. But this, of course, would be
taxable, so the actual yield to you would be $2,808. Thus, at least
on paper, you would be $720 a year ahead of the game by prepaying
the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But let's look at another option. Suppose you were to refinance
the mortgage, this time obtaining a fixed interest rate, which
we'll estimate at 6.5 percent. In that event, your initial interest
cost would be about $3,900, and the tax benefit would be $1,092,
giving you a first-year mortgage cost of $2,808 -- exactly the same
as the after-tax yield on that mutual fund investment.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention your overall financial situation, or how you
came to get the severance package. If you are between jobs or
embarking on a new career, it would seem to me that having a
$60,000 nest egg would do a lot to give you a sense of financial
security. Overall, I think I would go with the investment program
and the idea of refinancing the mortgage. But I would also build a
cautious investment portfolio, relying heavily on fixed-income
securities, designed to insure that the financial security remains.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If I understand the procedure correctly, I simply do not
understand the fairness of the tax procedures that relate to mutual
funds. If you buy a mutual fund position for $5,000 and you gain
$1,000, you pay taxes on that $1,000. If you then lose $1,000 the
next year, you are back to $5,000, but you cannot deduct the $1,000
loss. If you have to pay taxes year by year, why can't you deduct
your losses year by year?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The procedure is a little more complicated than you describe
it, but, for many investors, it's no less galling. The easiest way
to view the tax rules that apply to mutual funds is to understand
that the results would be the same as if you were dealing with your
own portfolio of common stocks. The rules require that income such
as dividends and interest payments, net of expenses, be distributed
to the owners of the investments. They also require that the net of
all realized capital gains and capital losses also be distributed.
But, just as with common stocks that you hold for many years, there
is no taxable event if the fund manager simply hangs on to a stock
which has appreciated -- tax liability is triggered only when the
investment is sold. Therefore, your example may not be quite on
point. If you buy $5,000 worth of shares in a mutual fund, and the
value of your position grows to $6,000, you will face tax bills
only for the portions of the gain -- income and realized capital
gains -- which has been distributed to the owners. While it's not
impossible for distributions to equal or exceed the total return,
it's also not particularly common.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when a mutual fund loses money? If the net of all
capital gains and capital losses is negative, the fund not only
need make no distribution, but it can carry that paper loss
forwards into further years, and will not have to make a capital
gains distribution until the loss that has been carried forward is
wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Thus you can see that mutual fund investors do get some benefit
from realized portfolio losses, but not necessarily at the time
they are realized. The investor who has a paper mutual fund loss on
paper and wants to realize it for tax purposes must sell the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to your example. The investor begins with a $5,000
investment and receives a $1,000 taxable distribution. Suppose the
investor has directed that the distributions be reinvested in the
fund. The effect is that the investor's tax basis increases from
$5,000 to $6,000. Now suppose in the following year the value of
the position falls to $5,000. The investor can then sell, realizing
a capital loss of $1,000 which can be used to reduce his or her tax
liability. Thus while the $1,000 distribution was taxable in the
first year, the investor can recoup the tax by selling before the
end of the second year.
</P>
<P>
   The unpleasant reality of the mutual fund business is that
managers and funds are usually evaluated according to their total
returns, and those bottom lines are much more critical to the
managers than the tax consequences of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of funds whose objective includes managing
the portfolio so as to minimize the tax effect on the owners, the
best known of which are probably the Vanguard ``Tax-Managed''
funds.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other ways to make some pretty good judgments
about whether funds are likely to deliver unwelcome tax bills to
their owners. One is to look for funds with low turnover rates,
which is to say funds which do relatively little trading of their
portfolio positions. A turnover of less than 50 percent is
generally considered fairly low, and many index funds usually trade
only about 5 percent to 10 percent of their portfolios annually,
with the effect of keeping capital gains distributions to low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing you can look for, in the funds' annual reports or
in the Morningstar Mutual Funds reports, is the potential capital
gains exposure. This figure, measured as a percentage of the assets
of the fund, reflects what percentage of the net asset value would
be distributed as capital gains in the (extremely unlikely) event
that the entire portfolio were liquidated. Of those two measures,
turnover rate is more important, since it reflects the investment
discipline of the managers. A low potential capital gains exposure
figure may simply reflect a fund which has not done particularly
well with its investments, and a high one might simply mean that
the managers have held a large portion of their investments for
many years and are following a long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 78,single, and retired in 1985. I don't live lavishly,
but find I am dipping into my principal at the rate of $5,000 to
$7,000 annually. The only money I have is $485,000 invested in
Fidelity Spartan Tax-Free Municipal Income fund, which yields me
about $2,000 a month. I have other income from Social Security and
an annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Until retirement I looked for growth, but since then I have
looked for as little risk as possible. My point of view is to put
money away and forget about it. Can I do anything with my money to
give me more income, less risk, and with liquidity in case I need
to ``dip''?
</P>
<P>
   (I have check writing with Fidelity.) Obviously I don't want any
diminution of my monthly income, and I'm not particularly worried
about growth. I have a will, and the money will eventually go to
relatives, a charity, and friends. Perhaps I shouldn't even worry
about dipping into it.
</P>
<P>
   W.B., Miami
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your last thought was one of my first: If you simply left the
money where it is and made withdrawals at a rate of $30,000 a year,
the pool would last you more than 28 years, which would take you
well past the century mark.
</P>
<P>
   I have two suggestions. The first is to consider moving the bulk
of your money to a single-state fund such as Fidelity's Spartan
Florida Municipal Income fund. Although it has a lower stated yield
than your current fund -- 4 percent -- the Fidelity Insight
newsletter reports that this yield is the equivalent of a 5.6
percent return for taxpayers in the 28 percent federal tax bracket
and the highest Florida bracket. I suggest you analyze your tax
situation to determine whether you might not profit from such a
move on an after-tax basis.
</P>
<P>
   Second, you might also find that you would profit on an
after-tax basis by moving a bit of your money into a taxable
investment such as Fidelity Intermediate Government Income fund.
This would offer a similar risk level to your current holding, and
it may be that after taxes you would do better by moving some of
the money to such a fund.
</P>
<P>
   But as I said at the outset, nothing horrible is going to happen
if you do nothing.

! 1/2 ``Holy Man''  A wasted opportunity for sharp social satire.
When Eddie Murphy's blissful guru smiles his way onto a home
shopping network and turns out to be a dynamite pitchman, the idea
of shopping as a religious experience seems ready for skewering.
But the film loses contact with Murphy, veering instead into dull
hand-wringing over the state of TV exec Jeff Goldblum's soul and
his prefab romance with Kelly Preston. (PG)

!! &UR; 1/2 ``One Tough Cop''  &LR; This could have been Stephen Baldwin's
breakthrough movie. He looks and sounds right as the tough New York
street cop on whose story the film is based. But gritty
authenticity is undermined by a cliched screenplay that insists on
turning desperate lives into romantic melodrama. (R)

his camera, and invites us to share the voyeurism. The buxom

   SCI-NOBEL-MEDICINE (Undated) _ Three Americans won the Nobel
Prize in Medicine for their work on how the common air pollutant
nitric oxide acts as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular
system. Their research led to a method of initiating penis erection
and indirectly to the development of the Viagra anti-impotency
drug. The three were Robert Furchgott, 82, of New York; Ferid

   SCI-PLACEBO (Undated) _ Scientists are uncovering a host of
biological mechanisms that can turn a thought, belief or desire
into an agent of change in cells, tissues and organs. They are
exploring the spooky fact that much of human perception is based
not on information flowing into the brain from the outside world
but what the brain, based on previous experience, expects to happen
next. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1950 words)

   SCI-PLACEBO-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Though some people respond more
strongly to placebos than others do, it seems that everyone
responds at some time or other. And doctors seem to play a large
role in the degree of that response. ``The thing that trumps
everything is the enthusiastic physician,'' said Dr. Dan Molerman
of the University of Michigan. (380 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-METEOR-STORM (Undated) _ Periodically for at least 1,000
years, a spectacular rain of meteors _ spawned by a passing comet _
has lighted up the sky, inspiring fear, wonder and admiration. The
Leonid meteor storm, which shot hundreds of thousands of blazing
streaks across the heavens 33 years ago, is nearly due to hit the

United States, the Leonid storm on Nov. 17 is expected to begin at
2:43 p.m. EST, and is likely to last for only an hour or so. For
the United States, therefore, the entire show will be during
daylight hours and will be invisible, unless any unusually bright
bolides or exploding fireballs flash through the daytime sky. (440

   SCI-ANIMALS-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ A new computer study intended
to show how predators choose their prey is just one of an
increasing number of such faux creatures being shaped, colored, and

   SCI-NASA-MEMORIES (Undated) _ As the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration marks the 40th anniversary of its founding on
Oct. 1, 1958, aspects of the occasion are more archeological than
astronautical. Or so it sometimes seems on the back roads and in
the weeds along the shore of Cape Canaveral, Fla., where the ruins

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Calcium is fast emerging as the
nutrient of the decade, a substance with such diverse roles in the
body that virtually no major organ system escapes its influence. As
the most abundant mineral in the body, calcium has long been
recognized as vital to the formation and maintenance of strong
bones and teeth. But bones, rather than serving as the final
destination of calcium, are in a sense, just a starting point. They
continuously release the mineral into the system where new research
suggests it may play a central role in controlling blood pressure
and easing premenstrual syndrome. In addition, new studies indicate
that unused dietary calcium may help to prevent colon cancer. By

   SCI-HEALTH-PAIN (Undated) _ For decades, doctors have worried
that they might be disciplined, or even face criminal prosecution,
for aggressive use of morphine and other narcotics to control pain.
Now, some advocates are trying to swing the pendulum in the other
direction, by pressing authorities to punish doctors for not using
pain medicine aggressively enough. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. (1150

   SCI-HEALTH-KAVA (Undated) _ The prospect of inner peace with no
strings attached has tempted hundreds of thousands to try kava, an
herbal product derived from the roots of a shrub grown in Hawaii,
Fiji, Vanuatu and other Pacific islands. There have been no
scientific studies of kava in human beings in the United States,
but still, $15 million a year was spent on it in 1996, and twice
that much in 1997, according to the Nutrition Business Journal,
which projects sales of almost $50 million this year. By Denise
Grady. (1300 words)

   SCI-PREJUDICE-TEST (Undated) _ Ask people if they harbor
negative attitudes toward blacks, women, or the elderly, and the
response is likely to be a chorus of denials. But give those same
people a simple test designed to tap unconscious beliefs, two
psychologists say, and the results often tell a different story.

   SCI-HEALTH-PRO&AMP;CON (Undated) _ Pro/con: Should women pace during
labor?
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-VIAGRA (Undated) _ Viagra may have another down side,
this one among the female partners of the men taking it. More and
more older women are suffering from frequent, urgent, burning
urination _ usually found among women half their age and sometimes
called honeymoon cystitis, say three doctors who noticed the
condition among their patients in Covington, Ga. (200 words)

<P>
   With graphic.

<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-REVERSE (Undated) _ Exercising in reverse has now
shifted into high gear because of the popularity of machines like
elliptical trainers, stair climbers and spinning bikes that allow
exercisers to move backward and forward. Despite the increased
popularity of the reverse workout, fitness experts question whether
exercising backward is safe and effective or just another fitness
fad. Many suspect that it is the latter. (660 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-CHLAMYDIA (Undated) _ It is a finding sure to dismay
parents everywhere: the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia has
become so common among teen-age girls in some parts of the U.S.
that doctors have begun to recommend that sexually active girls be
tested for it twice a year, instead of once a year, as called for
by current medical guidelines. By Denise Grady. (1100 words)
</P>

END OF COEXISTENCE SEEN FOR DOCTORS, ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Chiropractors may have been the immediate target of
last week's stinging critiques in The New England Journal of
Medicine, but it's the broader empire of alternative medicine that
the journal and its allies in mainstream medicine really are after.
</P>
<P>
   Such a campaign would not have been surprising even as recently
as the early 1990s, when mainstream and alternative medicines were
openly at war. But this comes in what has seemed to be the era of
detente, one in which even the labels were softened to signal that
``complementary'' practitioners would now practice side by side
with their brethren in the temples of traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's articles, however, make clear that the cease-fire
itself has ceased as the prestigious journal, for the second time
in a month, has attacked alternative medicine for allegedly failing
to back its claims of healing power.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the intense reaction to those articles suggests
that rather than embracing the nascent alliance between mainstream
and alternative approaches, many medical doctors had bottled up
their grievances and were waiting for the right moment to vent
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been giving alternative medicine a free ride,'' says Dr.
Marcia Angell, the New England Journal's executive editor. Doctors
``were leaning over backwards not to alienate their patients. But I
don't think they'll alienate them by leveling with them, by telling
them the truth that there's very little scientific proof that
supports alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have an obligation to treat their patients as
grown-ups, not as children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James S. Gordon, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist who runs the
Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington, views what the journal
and its supporters are doing through a markedly different lens:
``They seem to see themselves functioning not as scientists in the
truest sense of the word, but as guardians of orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of science is the history of comings and goings of
different kinds of orthodoxy,'' adds Gordon, former chairman of the
advisory council to the Office of Alternative Medicine at the
National Institutes of Health. ``I think this is a kind of protest
by some of the less thoughtful and less critical members of the
orthodoxy.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand today's standoff between alternative and
mainstream medicines, it is critical to understand the history of
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust was the watchword for most of that history. Many
medical doctors saw alternative healers as peddling an unproven
art, one that unfairly raised patients' hopes and raided their
pocketbooks. Many alternative therapists, meanwhile, saw medical
doctors as promoting toxic and expensive conventional treatments
and as unwilling to consider remedies used for centuries in other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Patients were caught in the middle. Signaling frustration over
mainstream medicine's inability to cure their ailments and ease
their pain, many quietly sought treatment from herbalists,
acupuncturists, and other practitioners whose very titles made
clear they were offering very different options. The extent of that
disaffection became apparent in 1993, when The New England Journal
published a study showing that Americans were seeking treatment
more often from unconventional healers than from pediatricians,
internists, and other primary-care doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been a slow building of bridges. You can
see it in the way spiritual healers now practice in such bastions
of traditional medicine as Massachusetts General Hospital. You can
hear it when oncologists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
consult with patients not only about chemotherapy but about ``qi
gong,'' a Chinese system of breathing and exercise. Most of all,
you can count it in the way more and more managed care companies,
responding to patient pressure, are paying for chiropractic and
other alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has bought into the new alliance, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation of State Medical Boards last year urged its
members not just to look at conventional medicine in rooting out
fraud but also to investigate alternative healers. Many private
doctors were complaining, too, although generally in private for
fear of alienating their patients. And last month The New England
Journal, arguably the world's most influential medical publication,
wrote that many alternative remedies reflect ``a reversion to
irrational approaches to medical practice.'' Last week it published
a study suggesting that visiting a chiropractor was only marginally
more likely to relieve lower back pain than was reading a $1
booklet on the ailment's causes and cures.
</P>
<P>
   Such responses, sometimes strident, stem partly from legitimate
concerns by doctors over the lack of evidence that alternative
treatments work. With chiropractors, for instance, the authors of
last week's study found that, among 321 adults with low back pain,
spinal manipulation offered the same relief as a common form of
physical therapy, and both were only marginally successful at
easing symptoms. A second report found that chiropractic care
provided no benefit for children with mild or moderate asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing bona fide scientific methods applied to
evaluating therapies, many of which are basically the placebo
effect, and those methods are demonstrating that it is indeed the
placebo effect,'' says Dr. Tom Delbanco, chief of general medicine
at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a coauthor of the 1993
study on the migration from mainstream medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the backlash by medical doctors is explained by
self-interest. Feeling squeezed by managed care, some medical
doctors worry that more of those dollars are going to alternative
therapists and, as Delbanco notes, ``we are beginning to see a
battle for the dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of journalistic competition, in this
case between The New England Journal and its archrival, the Journal
of the American Medical Association. Some close observers say The
New England Journal's recent focus on alternative medicine was
motivated in part by a desire to upstage JAMA, which announced
plans a year ago to make alternative medicine the centerpiece of an
issue due next month.
</P>
<P>
   New England Journal executive editor Angell denies that, saying,
``we didn't solicit these manuscripts (on alternative medicine). We
happened to get these studies; they all came in within a couple of
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George D. Lundberg, editor of JAMA, declined to comment on
The New England Journal's timing. He applauds his competitor's
focus on alternative medicine as ``helpful in understanding
procedures when they are being evaluated by scientific methods,''
but he wonders ``whether they are helpful in the dialogue between''
of mainstream and complementary medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever motivated them, The New England Journal critiques of
alternative medicine are almost certain to continue, if only
because they have brought into the open simmering issues within the
medical community. Angell, for instance, says the recent articles
generated what may be a record response in letters, and the recent
studies on alternative treatments are ``the tip of the iceberg ...
Finally the scientific community is beginning to mobilize
themselves and conduct rigorous studies on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative medicine is sure to fight back, as chiropractors did
last week in challenging the methods and results of the back pain
study. Nontraditional healers also are questioning whether
physicians trained in Western medicine are competent to judge
treatments that derive from dramatically different traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John M. Eisenberg, head of the US Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research, is trying to use the studies it funds on
medical quality to carve out a middle ground. ``The alternative
medicine group has to recognize that there are rules of evidence we
use in science that establish what ought to be done for patients,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, the traditional scientific community has to
understand that there are outcomes and processes of care that
patients value. We are starting to be able to measure those in
terms of what the patient sees as important rather than what
laboratory tests show.''

 &HT;    REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING
 &HT;    It's easier to move a PC if you've saved your boxes
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I once calculated that _ in my long life _ I have purchased 18
lawn mowers, 12 refrigerators and six leaf blowers. I have moved
more often than a con man on the lam. I should get a discount at
the rent-a-truck place.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned a lot by moving so often. For one thing, I've
learned that if you drop a futon down the stairs, it is best just
to let it go. Grabbing a speeding futon can be briefly interesting
but highly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Since I have lived with and around computers since before IBM
introduced the original IBM Personal Computer in 1981, I have also
acquired a fair to middlin' knowledge of how to move a personal
computer. Moving a PC has gotten easier over the years. When I
started with them, a computer's hard disk was as sensitive as a
teenager going through puberty. The slightest jolt could send your
hard disk to computer heaven.
</P>
<P>
   PCs and their hard disks are less sensitive these days, but
moving any electronic gear is still a delicate task. Since most of
us will end up moving a computer one of these days, let me offer
you some tips based on too much experience.
</P>
<P>
   Husted's first rule of PC moving is to save all boxes. Those
boxes with Styrofoam inserts can't be beat for moving computers,
monitors and printers. I know it's tempting to throw all the
packing material away. But they're customized just for your
equipment. It is the perfect way to move.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about hard disk drives, but there's another kind of
drive in your computer: a floppy disk drive. Cut a piece of
cardboard (the kind cleaners use when they fold shirts) and insert
it into the floppy disk drive. That'll keep the magnetic head of
the floppy drive from banging around. Make sure you leave a tab on
the outside of the cardboard so it is easy to remove.
</P>
<P>
   If you're moving from Atlanta to Oregon, you'll need to take
more care than if the PC is going across town. For really long
moves, you have to spend some time worrying about the accessory
cards inside your computer. These cards can become loose in their
slots _ even through they're secured with a screw. If that happens,
your computer will malfunction when you turn it on at the new
location. And in a few cases, the loose card can actually
permanently damage your computer by creating a short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to attack this problem. You can wait until
you arrive at the new location and remove and then reseat each of
these cards. Or, you can remove the cards before moving (making
sure to pack them in the anti-static pouches that they came in).
For most folks, it makes more sense to leave the cards in the
machine and reseat them when you arrive.
</P>
<P>
   If at all possible, try not to move your PC in the moving van or
a closed truck, especially in the hot summer. The extreme heat can
hurt the machine, and the ride also is much more harsh. The best
way to move a computer is to pack it away in the box and then to
carry the box inside your car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, unless you are a whiz at assembling and reassembling
computer systems, it's a real time saver to mark all the
connections using stick-on labels. That way, you won't have to
puzzle around with, say, the sound card trying to figure which of
the identical jacks is used for your speakers.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, the short course in moving a computer. If you follow
these tips (and if you can avoid grabbing a speeding futon) you'll
soon be up and running again.

SENATE DEMOCRATS FEAR `FILIBUSTER-PROOF' GOP MAJORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since Republicans took control of the Senate
four years ago, the filibuster has been the favorite weapon
deployed by Democrats to kill GOP legislation. Even the threat of a
filibuster, often made by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has forced
Republicans to negotiate with Democrats on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in what some Democrats consider a nightmare scenario,
Republicans are growing increasingly hopeful of winning an
additional five Senate seats in the Nov. 3 elections to reach the
60-vote plateau, providing a potential ``filibuster-proof''
majority that would give the GOP enormous power to control the
agenda. It would also increase chances that the GOP could muster
the two-thirds majority needed to oust President Clinton from
office, should the House impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the focus is on the filibuster, long a
parliamentary survival tool, typically for the party in the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   As employed by Kennedy and other Democrats, the filibuster ``is
our insurance policy,'' Senate minority leader Thomas Daschle said
in an interview. ``If we lose that, we have nothing.'' He said
Democrats are concerned about ``the implications of being
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are extraordinarily strong words from one of the nation's
top Democrats, especially as Congress is pondering the possible
impeachment of Clinton. Indeed, part of the Democratic strategy to
win some Senate seats is to issue stark warnings about the impact
of electing such a large Republican majority. But Daschle said the
concerns are real and not just campaign spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the biggest bonanza for the far-right in this
century,'' Daschle said, reeling off a list of bills that
Republicans would be able to pass affecting the environment,
abortion rights, school prayer, and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now control the Senate by a 55-45 margin. While
Daschle thinks Democrats will do better than expected, he said, ``I
acknowledge we could be below 40.'' In fact, Daschle has said
Democrats could wind up with anywhere from 38 to 46 seats after the
election, meaning he sees the prospect that Republicans could pick
up as many as seven seats for a 62-38 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, playing down the idea they would run roughshod over
Democrats, acknowledge that a filibuster-proof majority would
enable them to pass a handful of key bills, but they said the
possible impact has been exaggerated. Even if Republicans were able
to avoid a filibuster and pass their bills, Clinton could still
veto them, leaving the GOP scrambling for the 67 votes necessary to
override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American system of government allows relatively few
dramatic shifts,'' said Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican. ``I
think there would be a shift, but it would be slow and gradual. Is
the world suddenly going to be different if we have 60 seats in the
Senate? No, because we still have Bill Clinton in the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gramm hopes to work with Clinton on a bill that would
permit people to put Social Security money into certain long-term
investments. In Gramm's view, the best outcome would be to pick up
enough Republican seats to pass his bill and win Clinton's support
to avoid a veto.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Republicans said a 60-seat majority would enable
them to win prompt passage of what critics call a partial-birth
abortion ban and have enough votes to override a presidential veto.
Republicans would probably pass legislation enabling parents to use
vouchers to send their children to private schools, prompting
another veto showdown that the GOP might win. Republicans also
would have enough votes to win passage of other key bills that have
been killed by Democrats, including a new missile defense plan,
product liability overhaul, and a balanced budget amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope to pick up open seats in Ohio and Kentucky and
believe they have shot at unseating Democrats such as Barbara Boxer
of California, Harry Reid of Nevada, Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois, Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings of South Carolina, and Patty
Murray of Washington. Democrats, meanwhile, hold out hopes they can
pick up the seats of Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Lauch
Faircloth of North Carolina, and the open Indiana seat.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of these Senate races also could have a major impact
on whether Clinton is ousted from office. If Clinton is impeached
by the House, it would take a two-thirds vote by the Senate _ 67
votes if all 100 senators are present _ to convict and oust the
president. That almost certainly means some Democratic votes would
be required to convict Clinton in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where Republicans have a 228-206 margin, the GOP
hopes to pick up at least a dozen seats. But such a gain would not
have the same legislative impact as in the Senate, mainly because
filibusters are not allowed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans now hold a majority in the Senate, they do not
always control it. This year, Democrats killed eight bills by
filibuster and numerous others with the threat of a filibuster.
Perhaps no one has been more effective at this strategy than
Kennedy, who has used the threat of a filibuster to kill
legislation he perceived as antiunion, such as compensation time
and company-run unions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kennedy ``has as much to do with frustrating the
far right as anybody in Washington,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant result of a larger Republican
majority would be that Clinton's veto power would become more
important than ever. With Republicans able to end filibusters at
will, many more GOP-authored bills are likely to reach the
president's desk and be subject to a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton took office in 1993, he has vetoed 23 bills,
according to Senate records. Republicans succeeded only twice in
overriding the vetoes, passing a securities overhaul bill in 1995
and erasing a set of Clinton line-item vetoes in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the addition of even a few seats in the Senate might help
Republicans override Clinton's vetoes on some major issues. For
example, Republicans in October 1997 picked up considerable
Democratic support for overriding Clinton's veto of a bill that
would ban partial-birth abortions. Now Republicans need just three
additional votes to override another veto of the legislation, which
they might get after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Republican effort to provide vouchers that would
enable poor children to go to private schools in the District of
Columbia, vetoed by Clinton earlier this year, might be successful
with a larger Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Still, key Republicans said the impact of a larger GOP presence
in the Senate might be exaggerated. Senator John McCain, the
Arizona Republican, stressed in an interview that the GOP is not a
``monolithic conference'' that will automatically vote together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you will see a profound impact,'' McCain said.
``You have people who are from different parts of the country,
different agenda in the Republican Party. Even when the Democrats
had 60 or more votes, they were unable to railroad the Senate
because they had Southern Democrats who were very conservative. In
this case, we have more liberal members in our caucus from the
Northeast and in some cases the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two of McCain's top pieces of legislation _ tobacco
regulation and campaign finance overhaul _ could be harmed by a
larger Republican takeover. Both measures were backed mostly by
Democrats and killed by Republican filibusters. A larger Republican
majority might make it even more difficult, if not impossible, to
pass the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing that he wants more Republicans elected, McCain
said: ``I don't think it is the nirvana that some Republicans think
it is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kruger National Park, South Africa's largest and most
prestigious game reserve, is denying that its entire lion
population may die following the discovery that bovine tuberculosis
(TB) has spilled over from buffaloes into the big cats.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Dr. Johan Krige, deputy director of the country's
department of agriculture, claimed lions ``are dying like flies''
in the southern stretches of the vast reserve, sending shivers
through the tourism industry and dismaying the conservation world.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been suggested that bovine TB has spilled into rare
species such as the white rhino, threatening them with extinction,
and that even some humans might be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   These claims have been dismissed as ``hysteria'' by a Kruger
park scientist, Dr. Leo Braack, and other naturalists. But Braack
admits that the 2,000-strong lion population appears to be
dwindling in those areas of the 12,000 square mile park where
bovine TB was endemic in buffaloes, and that lions tested
positively for TB. He also said lions appeared to die far more
quickly from the disease than buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   As the scientist spoke, park rangers in helicopters had already
begun a cull of 600 buffalo in an attempt to assess the extent of
TB infection. Lions were also being darted and tested, after an
earlier sampling found about 90 per cent of them TB-positive.
</P>
<P>
   But Braack emphasised that the dart tests showed only that the
lions have come into contact with the disease, not that they are
dying from it. Like buffaloes, lions must undergo post-mortem
tissue tests for proof that the TB is life-threatening, but there
are 10 times more buffaloes than lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation does not merit killing lions,'' he said in
exasperation, adding that over-reaction was putting unreasonable
pressure on the park to ``go in shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say complacency is part of the problem. Professor Nic
Kriek, of Pretoria University's veterinary department, warned that
time was running out, and South African newspaper reports claim
that Kruger park authorities may soon have to kill all infected
animals to stamp out the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruger park, a major reservoir of rare and threatened
species, now faces bans on transferring animals to other reserves
both in South Africa and abroad, with a disastrous impact on its
own revenues and on world-wide conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts appear to agree that bovine TB presents almost no risk
to tourists. The government's main concern is that its national
cattle herd will be infected by bovine TB, precipitating an
international ban on South African meat and dairy products similar
to that imposed on Britain after the ``mad cow'' debacle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruger park's buffaloes were originally infected by domestic
cattle in the 1950s and 1960s. While the domestic herd has been
cleansed, the government is worried that the disease is now so
rampant in wild buffaloes that the infection may boomerang. Such
fears led to new fencing around the park last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the crisis is confined to the Kruger reserve. The famous
Hluhluwe-Umfolozi game reserve in KwaZulu Natal admitted two months
ago that its lions were infected with TB. Even tourists had
complained that the big cats looked unwell, but vets believed that
inbreeding was to blame until a chance test for TB revealed a
grimmer picture.
</P>
<P>
   The lions are believed to have become infected by eating
contaminated buffaloes, although TB has also been found in kudus,
baboons, cheetahs and leopards. Concern about overspill infections
into other species has grown since it was revealed that the leopard
which killed a Kruger park ranger in a rare recent attack had been
infected with TB. The leopard is believed to have attacked in
desperation because it was too weak to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing grazing-land or water, as well as eating infected flesh,
can spread the disease. Kruger park officials are trying to
establish a TB-free buffalo herd, believing that this would help to
stamp the disease out among other species which prey on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is serious, but it is hard to gauge just how
serious, because there is just too little data,'' said Dr. Bruce
Davidson, director of the South African Wildlife and Environment
Society. No one could predict how many lions might die before they
build resistance to what, for them, is a new disease.

<P>
   Kruger National Park, South Africa's largest and most
prestigious game reserve, is denying that its entire lion
population may die following the discovery that bovine tuberculosis
(TB) has spilled over from buffaloes into the big cats.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Dr. Johan Krige, deputy director of the country's
department of agriculture, claimed lions ``are dying like flies''
in the southern stretches of the vast reserve, sending shivers
through the tourism industry and dismaying the conservation world.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been suggested that bovine TB has spilled into rare
species such as the white rhino, threatening them with extinction,
and that even some humans might be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   These claims have been dismissed as ``hysteria'' by a Kruger
park scientist, Dr. Leo Braack, and other naturalists. But Braack
admits that the 2,000-strong lion population appears to be
dwindling in those areas of the 12,000 square mile park where
bovine TB was endemic in buffaloes, and that lions tested
positively for TB. He also said lions appeared to die far more
quickly from the disease than buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   As the scientist spoke, park rangers in helicopters had already
begun a cull of 600 buffalo in an attempt to assess the extent of
TB infection. Lions were also being darted and tested, after an
earlier sampling found about 90 per cent of them TB-positive.
</P>
<P>
   But Braack emphasised that the dart tests showed only that the
lions have come into contact with the disease, not that they are
dying from it. Like buffaloes, lions must undergo post-mortem
tissue tests for proof that the TB is life-threatening, but there
are 10 times more buffaloes than lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation does not merit killing lions,'' he said in
exasperation, adding that over-reaction was putting unreasonable
pressure on the park to ``go in shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say complacency is part of the problem. Professor Nic
Kriek, of Pretoria University's veterinary department, warned that
time was running out, and South African newspaper reports claim
that Kruger park authorities may soon have to kill all infected
animals to stamp out the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruger park, a major reservoir of rare and threatened
species, now faces bans on transferring animals to other reserves
both in South Africa and abroad, with a disastrous impact on its
own revenues and on world-wide conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts appear to agree that bovine TB presents almost no risk
to tourists. The government's main concern is that its national
cattle herd will be infected by bovine TB, precipitating an
international ban on South African meat and dairy products similar
to that imposed on Britain after the ``mad cow'' debacle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruger park's buffaloes were originally infected by domestic
cattle in the 1950s and 1960s. While the domestic herd has been
cleansed, the government is worried that the disease is now so
rampant in wild buffaloes that the infection may boomerang. Such
fears led to new fencing around the park last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the crisis is confined to the Kruger reserve. The famous
Hluhluwe-Umfolozi game reserve in KwaZulu Natal admitted two months
ago that its lions were infected with TB. Even tourists had
complained that the big cats looked unwell, but vets believed that
inbreeding was to blame until a chance test for TB revealed a
grimmer picture.
</P>
<P>
   The lions are believed to have become infected by eating
contaminated buffaloes, although TB has also been found in kudus,
baboons, cheetahs and leopards. Concern about overspill infections
into other species has grown since it was revealed that the leopard
which killed a Kruger park ranger in a rare recent attack had been
infected with TB. The leopard is believed to have attacked in
desperation because it was too weak to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing grazing-land or water, as well as eating infected flesh,
can spread the disease. Kruger park officials are trying to
establish a TB-free buffalo herd, believing that this would help to
stamp the disease out among other species which prey on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is serious, but it is hard to gauge just how
serious, because there is just too little data,'' said Dr. Bruce
Davidson, director of the South African Wildlife and Environment
Society. No one could predict how many lions might die before they
build resistance to what, for them, is a new disease.

`JUDAS' CONCERT CD CAPTURES HISTORIC DYLAN MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Judas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you.'' Pause. ``You're a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   In all of rock 'n' roll, there is no more famous confrontation
between performer and fan than this: A lone, unknown, and very
angry Englishman calls Bob Dylan ``Judas'' just before the end of a
show at the Manchester Free Trade Hall on May 17, 1966 _ and Dylan
responds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the confrontation (and the show itself) became
something of a legend. Bootlegged several times over the years, it
was simply called ``the Royal Albert Hall show,'' after the London
venue where it was thought to have been recorded, or ``the Judas
show'' because of the heckler's famous phrase. And it came to be
seen as perhaps the ultimate Dylan artifact: the exact moment his
desire to create electric rock music ran into the brick wall of
angry folk purists, who saw such music as blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now it's here _ officially and gloriously. Tuesday will
finally see Columbia Records release ``Live 1966: The `Royal Albert
Hall' Concert _ The Bootleg Series Vol. 4.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all here _ 45 minutes of acoustic solo Dylan and then, on
disc two, the troubled second set, during which he and the Hawks
(who would, with a different drummer, go on to become the Band)
throw down well-nigh perfect electric rock 'n' roll as a large
section of the crowd grows ever angrier and more vocal.
</P>
<P>
   It is every bit as magnificent as the legend that has preceeded
it for the past 32 years. By the time of the 1966 world tour, Dylan
was both the king of the folk movement and a pop star, and he was
turning out amazing material at an amazing pace. In 1964 and 1965
alone he'd released three masterpieces, ``Another Side of Bob
Dylan,'' ``Bringing It All Back Home'' and ``Highway 61
Revisited.'' Perhaps his greatest work, ``Blonde on Blonde'' came
out the same month he played this show.
</P>
<P>
   He was remaking himself quicker than anyone else in popular
music, and with the chart success of ``Like a Rolling Stone'' (from
``Highway 61''), he had outraged many of those who had annointed
him as nearly a mythological figure.
</P>
<P>
   This show, then, stands as the point where one of the 20th
century's greatest artists both embraces and confronts his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The first set is seven songs, beginning with ``She Belongs to
Me,'' highlighted by a long, stunning ``Desolation Row'' and capped
by ``Mr. Tambourine Man.'' The response is rapturous: Dylan
performs these songs with a quicksilver quality, almost a
recklessness, savoring them, coloring them with vocal phrases and
harmonica licks not found on the recorded versions. At the end of
the first 45 minutes, he's everyone's hero.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the electric set, and those who hate Dylan's electric
sound start booing and yelling almost from the outset. And instead
of just plowing through the material, he actually lets them have
their say, pausing for long moments between songs as people holler
out of the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   It's confrontational, yes, but the music more than backs it up:
With Garth Hudson's carnival organ and Robbie Robertson's twangy
blues/country guitar, the eight songs _ from the obscure ``Tell Me,
Momma'' to classics ``Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues'' and ``Ballad of
a Thin Man'' _ are funky, raucous rock 'n' roll. Dylan is clearly
reveling in denouncing the naysayers' expectations, and in this
loud, raw sound _ he's totally in the moment, totally in control.
It's some of the best live rock music you'll ever hear.
</P>
<P>
   The famous face-off comes near the end, just before ``Like a
Rolling Stone,'' which Dylan and the band dive into with a singular
fury. They're taking the crowd's anger and throwing it back at
them, daring them to find fault with this music, and then the
song's over and they're gone. There is no encore because, really,
what could be said after that? Dylan and the Hawks were changing
the face of popular music, and they knew it, and knew they were up
to the task. This is the power of this show, and why even all these
years later it's every bit as exciting as you may have heard.

   This is the first week of an expanded Science Times, with an
extra seven columns of space devoted to health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NOBEL-MEDICINE (Undated) _ Three Americans won the Nobel
Prize in Medicine for their work on how the common air pollutant
nitric oxide acts as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular
system. Their research led to a method of initiating penis erection
and indirectly to the development of the Viagra anti-impotency
drug. The three were New York-based Robert Furchgott, 82, Ferid
Murad, 62, of Houston and Louis Ignarro, 57, of Los Angeles. By
Lawrence K. Altman. (1500 words)

<P>
   SCI-PLACEBO (Undated) _ Scientists are uncovering a host of
biological mechanisms that can turn a thought, belief or desire
into an agent of change in cells, tissues and organs. They are
exploring the spooky fact that much of human perception is based
not on information flowing into the brain from the outside world
but what the brain, based on previous experience, expects to happen
next. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1950 words)

   SCI-PLACEBO-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Though some people respond more
strongly to placebos than others do, it seems that everyone
responds at some time or other. And doctors seem to play a large
role in the degree of that response. ``The thing that trumps
everything is the enthusiastic physician,'' said Dr. Dan Molerman
of the University of Michigan. (380 words)

   SCI-METEOR-STORM (Undated) _ Periodically for at least the last
1,000 years, a spectacular rain of meteors _ spawned by a passing
comet _ has lighted up the sky, inspiring fear, wonder and
admiration. The Leonid meteor storm, which shot hundreds of
thousands of blazing streaks across the heavens 33 years ago, is
nearly due to hit the earth again, and this time space scientists

the United States, therefore, the entire show will be during
daylight hours and will be invisible, unless any unusually bright
bolides or exploding fireballs flash through the daytime sky. (440

   SCI-ANIMALS-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ A new computer study intended
to show how predators choose their prey is just one of an
increasing number of such faux creatures being shaped, colored, and
directed on the computer screen as researchers attempt to ask a
wide array of questions about what makes real animals respond to
other animals the way that they do. This one shows which moths the

the weeds along the shore of Cape Canaveral, Fla., where the ruins

nutrient of the decade, a substance with such diverse roles in the
body that virtually no major organ system escapes its influence. As
the most abundant mineral in the body, calcium has long been
recognized as vital to the formation and maintenance of strong
bones and teeth. But bones, rather than serving as the final
destination of calcium, are in a sense, just a starting point. They
continuously release the mineral into the system where new research
suggests it may play a central role in controlling blood pressure
and easing premenstrual syndrome. In addition, new studies indicate
that unused dietary calcium may help to prevent colon cancer. By

that they might be disciplined, or even face criminal prosecution,
for aggressive use of morphine and other narcotics to control pain.
Now, some advocates are trying to swing the pendulum in the other
direction, by pressing authorities to punish doctors for not using
pain medicine aggressively enough. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. (1150

   SCI-HEALTH-KAVA (Undated) _ The prospect of inner peace with no
strings attached has tempted hundreds of thousands to try kava, an
herbal product derived from the roots of a shrub grown in Hawaii,
Fiji, Vanuatu and other Pacific islands. There have been no
scientific studies of kava in human beings in the United States,
but still, $15 million a year was spent on it in 1996, and twice

psychologists say, and the results often tell a different story.

   SCI-HEALTH-VIAGRA (Undated) _ Viagra may have another down side,
this one among the female partners of the men taking it. More and
more older women are suffering from frequent, urgent, burning
urination _ usually found among women half their age and sometimes
called honeymoon cystitis, say three doctors who noticed the
condition among their patients in Covington, Ga. (200 words)

   SCI-FITNESS-REVERSE (Undated) _ Exercising in reverse has now
shifted into high gear because of the popularity of machines like
elliptical trainers, stair climbers and Spinning bikes that allow
exercisers to move backward and forward. Despite the increased
popularity of the reverse workout, fitness experts question whether
exercising backward is safe and effective or just another fitness
fad. Many suspect that it is the latter. (660 words)

<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-CHLAMYDIA (Undated) _ It is a finding sure to dismay
parents everywhere: the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia has
become so common among teen-age girls in some parts of the U.S.
that doctors have begun to recommend that sexually active girls be
tested for it twice a year, instead of once a year, as called for
by current medical guidelines. By Denise Grady. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOCS-PEER-REVIEW (Undated) _ How well do doctors follow
directions? Not very well, apparently, when it comes to a standard
practice followed by medical journals. A new study shows that
physicians often neglect to read the instructions sent to them when
they provide peer review for journals. (280 words)

<P>
   ROME -- On Friday a frail, trembling 78-year-old will celebrate
his 20th anniversary as one of the world's last absolute monarchs.
He will do so without pomp and without festivities, working hard to
finish a long-awaited encyclical, and contemplating a new
millennium which he hopes to usher in personally with a list of mea
culpas for his tiny state's actions during the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   He will have the satisfaction of knowing that he has occupied
the throne of St Peter's for longer than anyone else this century,
and the painful awareness that, whatever his state of health, he
has no choice but to remain there, a lonely figure at the head of a
church which he has changed profoundly, and at the end of an era on
which he has left an indelible mark.
</P>
<P>
   Karol Jozef Wojtyla -- Pope John Paul II -- has an enviable
number of records to his name. The first Polish pope; the first
non-Italian to head the Catholic Church in 456 years; the first
pope to have dirtied his hands with factory work; the most
travelled pope. He has created more saints than any of his modern
predecessors, and issued more letters and encyclicals.
</P>
<P>
   He has met more foreign heads of state and government and has
arguably had more influence in changing the course of world events
than any of his predecessors since the great popes of the
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   He has also alienated more liberal Catholics than any other
pontiff before him, sticking rigidly to conservative dogma and
refusing to give any ground to late 20th-century changes of mores.
And he has appointed almost 90 per cent of the cardinals who will
be called upon to elect his successor, making it likely that his
rigid principles will be carried forward into the next millennium
by a new pope in his own likeness.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the town of Wadowice in 1920, Karol Wojtyla grew up in a
devout Catholic household, his faith instilled by a mother on whom
he doted -- a fact, perhaps, which explains his almost obsessive
devotion to the Virgin Mary. She died when he was 9 years old. He
played football and wrote poetry and acted in plays, contemplating
a life in the arts rather than in the church.
</P>
<P>
   But during the rigors of Nazi-occupied wartime Poland, this
employee of the German-owned Solvay chemicals plant opted for a
secret training for the priesthood under Krakow's Archbishop Adam
Sapieha. He was ordained in 1946 and, after an unremarkable few
years keeping out of the way of trouble with his country's
Communist rulers, he was consecrated as a bishop in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The man who, as pope, was to see the fall of communism, was
looked upon kindly by the Polish regime, which viewed him as a
malleable priest and backed him for the job of Archbishop of Krakow
in 1964. They soon realized their mistake: the new bishop threw his
weight behind student protests in 1968 and riots against food price
increases in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Wojtyla was a distant outsider to replace John Paul I
when the consistory of cardinals met to elect a new pope in the
Sistine Chapel in 1978. The choice of a pontiff from behind the
Iron Curtain at a time when the first small cracks were appearing
in the communist fortress grew in significance, however, when
Ronald Reagan entered the White House in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Vatican and Washington elicited solid
international support for the burgeoning Solidarity labor union
movement in Poland, while a strong hunch in Rome that the Kremlin's
rising star, Mikhail Gorbachev, might prove a boon helped to temper
hostility between the US and Moscow during the second half of the
1980s. In December 1989, the pope and Gorbachev came face to face
in an emotional meeting in the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   If John Paul II has been a ground-breaker politically, he has
been reactionary as far as the tenets of the Catholic church go. He
has refused to budge an inch from an outright ban on artificial
birth control, deigning last year only to recommend that priests
grant absolution for contraception users who repent in the
confessional and promise not to do it again. Abortion remains
anathema; divorcees have no hope of a second church wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's determination to restrict the priesthood to men -- he
wielded his infallibility on this topic in November 1995 -- was so
great that he was prepared to accept a cooling-off in ecumenical
progress with the Anglican Church rather than abandon it. And to
make sure that no wrong-thinking Catholic academics or philosophers
should propound anything contrary to Vatican orthodoxy, he
threatened them over the summer by adjusting canon law so that any
wavering could lead to excommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of these conservative stances rarely pay much attention
to his vindications of workers' rights, or his harsh words against
the inequalities of extreme capitalism, which he described as on a
par with the extremes of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Shot and near-fatally wounded in 1981, and operated on at
various times since then for a tumor, a rumbling appendix and a
broken hip, John Paul approaches his 20th anniversary with chronic
Parkinson's disease which has slurred his speech and made his
movements painful. Nothing daunted, the Pope made his 85th foreign
trip, for a controversial beatification, to Croatia a week ago. A
massive and demanding encyclical, Fides et Ratio (Faith and Reason)
will be issued any day.
</P>
<P>
   In it, John Paul will beg for an end to the modern minimalist
approach to problems, urging superficial end-of-millennium mankind
to return to the simplest, but most profound, questions posed by
philosophy. He will suggest they shift their attention from
phenomena to fundamentals through interaction between philosophy
and faith.
</P>
<P>
   The work, say Vatican commentators, is likely to be John Paul's
final word to the church of the new millennium, a millennium he may
never himself see. Though tired, ill, and eternally on his last
legs, the pope has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   His 20th anniversary will be marked by a mass in St Peter's next
Sunday, but there is nothing more on the official agenda. The
jubilee, on the other hand, will be a 15-month jamboree of the kind
that the pope loves.
</P>
<P>
   With a twinkle in his pained eyes each time the year 2000 is
mentioned, John Paul has made it clear that he firmly intends to
stick around for that date.

   A. Many of the explanations offered for the sharp pain runners
feel during hard breathing, usually on the right side, involve
muscle stress or spasms in or near the diaphragm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably doing something in a rhythmic, repetitive
fashion that is stressing one or more muscles,'' said Dr. Everett
Murdock of California State University at Long Beach. ``The
solution is to develop techniques to break up that stressful
rhythm,'' he wrote in ``Be Your Own Running Coach,'' a book in
preparation with Susan Sudbury.
</P>
<P>
   He urges runners to try several techniques including changing
breathing patterns by breathing slower and deeper and forcefully
exhaling through pursed lips. Other suggestions involve changing
running position by leaning forward, backward or sideways,
stretching before running, having the stomach as empty as possible
before running and changing the foot they land on when exhaling.
</P>
<P>
   A more direct explanation and remedy come from South African
sports scientist and running expert, Dr. Tim Noakes of the
University of Cape Town. His idea, presented in ``Running
Injuries'' (Oxford University Press), is that the rhythm of running
causes bouncing of the liver, stretching the ligaments that link
liver and diaphragm. His suggestion is to stop running and use a
hand to press the liver up against the diaphragm until the pain
ends.

There's a little panel there that says ``Could not complete

somebody refuse to work overtime? I never saw a message like that.
``Connection failed,'' OK, but the connection is fine. ``Download

just says it couldn't do it anymore, as in ``Oh, God, I just can't
go on.'' (WARNER, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

Computer to update its operating system to improve your Mac's ease

much of it grass roots. Amateur and professional programmers are
coming up with some wonderful tweaks to the operating system. One
good example is a piece of shareware called FinderPop. Shareware is
software you can download and try out without charge but are
expected to pay for if you end up using it. (HADAD, Atlanta

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ President Clinton may yet pull an
education-policy rabbit out of the empty-hat 105th Congress, but
either way, the 105th will soon and mercifully relieve us of
itself, to go home and seek license from the voters to act out
again next year. It is a dismal prospect, which voters, if the
current soundings prove right, will ratify in perhaps historically
small numbers. (Teepen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED

   TRAVEL-DORAL13-COX_I was on a mission: To see what it is like to
play from where the pros play on The Blue Monster _ if no longer
Florida's most challenging or beautiful course, then certainly its
most storied. Designed in 1961 by Dick Wilson, the course has been
a pro stop for decades _ the Doral tournament helping to build
Florida's golf reputation in the '60s. But thanks to better
equipment and longer hitters, by the early '90s, The Blue Monster
had lost its teeth. MOVED.

espresso mixed with Sambuca. (They bring in their own food.) Owners
Jerry Somma and Abe Debabneh turn on the TV so the guys can watch
the hyperkinetic Emeril Lagasse whip up a dish on the Food Network.
(Fans of the show, they dub themselves The Emeril Club). But when
new customers walk in, Debabneh walks toward them, shakes their
hands and says, ``Come on in! Come on in!'' to break the ice. ``We
always greet them and invite them in. We treat everyone like

   ZYDECO _ Long renowned and crowned as the ``king of zydeco,''
the late Clifton Chenier might have trouble recognizing much of the
musical legacy that has flourished in his wake. Yes, the sound is
still based on the interplay of sprightly accordion and the
metallic scrape of a rubboard. Yes, the music still fills the
country roadhouses and radio airwaves throughout the Creole
communities of Southwest Louisiana (spilling over the border into
pockets of East Texas), making a visitor feel like he has entered
another dimension: Planet Zydeco. (McLeese, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   ZYDECO-COX_ But who is this Beau Jocque character, boasting and
toasting like a rapper, exhorting his fans to ``Check it out, lock

His Name'' was inspired by Snoop Dogg and whose transformation of
the theme from an old TV show _ ``Movin' on Up'' from ``The

But she can think as clearly as she did before Amyotrophic Lateral

<P>
   HANDY-COX_Hands, like any other body part, need preventive care
if they're going to operate at peak performance. Healthy hands are
part of a healthy lifestyle. Early intervention often can prevent
small problems from becoming big ones, experts say. The key is
paying attention to how the hands are being used. After a long day
of typing, are you playing two hours of tennis or gardening for
three hours? (Martin, Austin American-Statesman). MOVED.

 &HT;    KOSOVO'S ETHNIC ALBANIANS FINDING SCARCE REFUGE IN BOSNIA
 &HT;    With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.
 &HT;    By SUSANNAH NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Sevdije Gashi left Kosovo a few
days after her village was attacked and her home burned down by
Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Though the timing is never good for refugees trying to escape
such violence, it was particularly bad for this mother of three.
She was about to have another baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was born on the bus to Bosnia,'' Gashi said, shyly showing
off her gurgling three-week-old daughter. ``My mother-in-law had
just been arrested by Serb police. We had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Gashi's family of six -- including he husband -- lives in an
abandoned Coca-Cola bottling plant in Sarajevo, eating, sleeping
and crying together on the 10-by-10-foot square of floor that has
become their home.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 other refugees live in the same factory, with no
running water, no heat and no idea what their future holds, as
winter looms and NATO officials debate military airstrikes to force
Yugoslavia to end the seven-month conflict in the Serb province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian government officials estimate 12,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees from Kosovo have ended up in this country. But with about
800,000 of its own refugees to deal with three years after the war
here ended, the government has been reluctant to help the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Bosnian government's responsibility to take care of
these people,'' said a frustrated Melissa Ward, the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees official in charge of the makshift camp at
the Coca-Cola plant.
</P>
<P>
   The government wouldn't let UNHCR install heaters or a kitchen
in the camp, and officials have insisted the refugees be moved to
another facility by the end of the month so work to rehabilitate
the factory can begin. A left-over from Bosnia's communist past,
the plant belongs to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing all the funds, but the government isn't
cooperating,'' she said. ``We're only asking for assistance with
the infrastructure, the water, housing facilities, health-care. The
government promised to send a doctor, but he never came.''
</P>
<P>
   While several government officials declined to comment on the
situation, one official in the Bosnian ministry of public affairs
said the government was doing all it could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bosnian government has problems of its own,'' the official
said, asking that his name not be used. ``The Bosnian government,
the Bosnian people, we have a lot of refugees of our own to take
care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot talk about is the situation fair, or unfair,'' he
added. ``These people didn't come here because they wanted to. They
fled terrorism. But there's not much we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bosnia couldn't stop the Kosovo refugees from coming.
Famous for being the only country in the world with no visa
requirements for foreigners, much of Bosnia's border with
Yugoslavia is controlled by Bosnian Serbs -- who don't even require
passports for people coming from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Without passports or money or family connections, the Kosovo
refugees here aren't able to leave Bosnia. And the other countries
of Europe haven't been willing to accept them, even if they did
have passports and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here, like in a trap,'' said Milazim Hasani. ``We
expected we could go somewhere from here. But where can we go?''
</P>
<P>
   Hasani fled Kosovo with his wife and two children -- one three
years old, one 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope NATO will take some steps. The best solution for us is
to go back to Kosovo,'' he said. ``But it seems like the
international community is trying to make a situation like they did
in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasani blames inaction by the international community for his
problems, like many Bosnians did during the ethnic war here. But
officials worry that it's too late for the international community
to do anything in Kosovo that will help the people in the Coca-Cola
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to find a solution for these people for the
winter,'' Ward said. ``You can't expect them to repatriate during
the winter. They'll be here until spring at least.''
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR is working to arrange a different facility for the
refugees in the Coke factory.
</P>
<P>
   For now, 1,076 people take showers in a hut with seven stalls
and only one small boiler to heat the water. They wash their dishes
under a spigot of nonpurified water in the middle of a parking lot.
They sleep on mats on the floor of the drafty warehouse with holes
in the roof. Their children play with old Coca-Cola crates, and the
garbage they find in piles around the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are killing our children here,'' said Ibrahim Shala, a sort
of mayor of the camp. ``Look at our pavilions, with 600 people
sleeping in one of them every night. There are diseases being
spread around. Our children are in mortal danger here.''
</P>
<P>
   When no Bosnian doctor came to the camp, Dr. Lecaj Shukri,
himself a refugee from Kosovo living with family in the area,
volunteered to see patients in a makeshift clinic. After seeing
lots of skin infections, diarrhea, dehydration and
gastro-intestinal problems -- even two cases of hepatitis -- he
wonders aloud ``why we don't have an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions here are very bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo refugees in the Coca-Cola plant are living in, by
far, the worst conditions in Bosnia. But even here, they are better
off than they would be in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the bombing, they destroyed everything which survived,''
said Nusreta Rama of the Serbian forces that attacked her village.
``They don't want the people back. They burned everything they
didn't steal. All that is left of my house is the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't even think about when she will go back to Kosovo,
though she says she wants to return to her home someday. Right now,
life in the camp occupies her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of being lucky to be out of Kosovo, it's hard to
say,'' Shala said. ``Maybe we are happy because we escaped the
possibility of being shot. But if we stay here longer, if winter
comes and we are here, it will be a catastrophe.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON -- The backlash against feminism comes not so much from
men as from daughters rebelling against their mothers, one of the
high priestesses of feminism will argue in a new book.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Jong's first book for four years will cover a range of
subjects including the iconization of Diana, Princess of Wales, and
President Clinton's current problems, to the castigation of working
mothers and what makes the perfect man.
</P>
<P>
   A polemicist, poet, novelist and essayist, Erica Jong's works
have been translated into 27 languages. Known for her commitment to
women's rights, authors' rights and freedom of expression, she has
a Web site on which she conducts a lively discussion for writers
and posts creativity tips for fans.
</P>
<P>
   Her best-known work is the explicit and provocative ``Fear Of
Flying,'' published in 1975. It captured the spirit of the time
with its fictional heroine's conflict between her desires for
sexual fulfilment, career satisfaction and security. It made Jong a
feminist heroine for the young, just as her mid-life memoir ``Fear
of Fifty'' published in 1994, related to the concerns of women in
middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The new book of essays, ``What Do Women Want? Power, Sex, Bread
and Roses,'' will be published by Bloomsbury in January. Jong, 56,
claims in her new work that Hillary Clinton has had a pivotal role
in paving the way for the first female president.
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``Our love-hate relationship with Hillary Clinton
mirrors our ambivalence about powerful women. The ambivalence has
shifted in the last few decades and will shift even more as our
brazen daughters take over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of brazen daughters, she says that feminism has
suffered a backlash because of daughters rebelling against the
creed of their mothers. ``How can anything espoused by their
mothers be either radical or real? But note that our daughters
nonetheless want everything that feminism stands for: equal pay,
egalitarian marriages, and a place in the White House (without
being smuggled in by the president for unpresidential duties).
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism is the whole climate of their lives, the air they
breathe. It hardly even needs a name anymore. This is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the Louise Woodward case, Jong despairs that
``in an age when most mothers work because they have to, it is
nothing short of astounding that this case resulted in raving
callers to talk shows who scream that Dr. Deborah Eappen deserved
to have her baby die because she left him with a 19-year-old nanny.
So much for 25 years of feminism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jong is more ambivalent about the Princess, saying: ``Why should
I doubt that Diana was kind? I'm sure it never occurred to her to
renounce her whole clothing allowance and donate it to land-mine
victims so they could buy prostheses. I'm sure it never occurred to
her that one pair of South Seas pearl-and-diamond earrings could
fund a whole anti-land-mine charity for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   On the perfect man she concludes: ``The perfect man is, after
all, the one who sees the best in you ... because he loves both who
you are and what you can become, his vision helps you become more
truly yourself. As you grow sure of yourself in his love, you
generously mirror his best self as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be intrigued by things that ended relationships. Now
I am most fascinated by what allows them to continue.''

WHEN IRONING IS NOT AN OPTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``indispensable'' travel dress is headlined in one catalog.
Another highlights clothes ``designed specifically for the rigors
of world travel.'' ``Pack with less bulk,'' says the redoubtable
L.L. Bean, never one to squander syllables.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of wardrobes just for travel is an offshoot of both
the boom in adventure travel _ meaning no equipment or time for
ironing _ and the airlines' squeeze on suitcase space. In the days
of the steamer trunk and Railway Express, there was no reason to
buy something particular for the road: You took everything you
owned if you liked.
</P>
<P>
   Travel clothes, as displayed in catalogs, are usually of
synthetic fibers, for wrinkle resistance, compressibility and rapid
drying. Faced with a suitcase stuffed with heavy jeans and wool
shirts, most natural-fiber fans can make the leap to something
else, especially the ever-softer microfibers. The new travel
clothes also have many and sometimes tricky pockets. Often the
clothes are designed to serve in a number of situations.
</P>
<P>
   I took a look at a few interesting women's travel garments from
five catalogs. (There are, of course, similar options for men.)
Catalog clothes avoid elements requiring precise fit, and thus
sizing is vague.
</P>
<P>
   Elastic may bridge the gap when the nuances of size are reduced
to small, medium and large. Here are the results of our
unscientific test.
</P>
<P>
   The clear favorite on all counts was an ``indispensable black
travel dress,'' from Travelsmith in Novato, Calif. This synthetic
jersey dress can be ordered with long or short sleeves, in a short
or long length and with a turtle or jewel neckline.
</P>
<P>
   The dress, made in the United States, is cut with a flared skirt
and a relatively low Empire waist. It is made of nylon and Lycra;
the fibers caught on my fingers but did not bother others. The
tester, a colleague, who tried on the long (49 inches from the back
of the neck in regular) and short (36 inches) dresses, both with
short sleeves, is tall and slender: a chiffon scarf or stole would
have prepared her well for the theater.
</P>
<P>
   She considered the long model too long for daytime wear. This
slightly clingy fabric is not altogether forgiving and requires
inconspicuous underwear, although the cut and color accommodate a
range of shapes and situations.
</P>
<P>
   This washable dress is a backpacker's lifesaver: the short
version, in size small (6 to 8), compressed into a roll 6 inches
long and 12 inches around, about the bulk of two pairs of wool
socks, and weighed 11.5 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The sizes range from extra small (2-4) to extra large (18-20).
The 6-8 we looked at was cut on the large side. The short version
with short sleeves costs $89; with a long skirt, $99; with a long
skirt, long sleeves and a turtle neck, $109. PS: This basic black
also comes in basic midnight blue and basic chianti. Travelsmith,
60 Leveroni Court, Novato, Calif. 94949; (800) 950-1600.
</P>
<P>
   From Magellan's in Santa Barbara, Calif., came the ``Milano
travel outfit,'' a boxy five-button jacket to be worn with slacks
or a flared skirt. All three items, made in the United States, are
designed to be roomy. The imported fabric, a polyester and viscose
blend, is a black-and-white basketweave on one side and tiny white
dots on black on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The jacket, with cuffs and slash pockets, is in the basketweave;
the fabric is reversed for trousers and skirt. All pieces are
unlined, to keep bulk down, but unfortunately the shoulder pads
show if the jacket is taken off.
</P>
<P>
   The pants have an elastic waist in back and sliding devices on
the side that ease the fit six inches more. The jacket weighs 13
ounces, the pants, 12.5 ounces and the skirt 9.5 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The outfit, although somewhat stylish, unhappily was not checked
for quality: the zipper on the deep passport pocket on the skirt
front was sewed _ so it could not be unzipped; buttonholes were
poorly finished. The jacket, skirt and pants come in sizes 4 to 22.
The jacket costs $64; the skirt $56 and the pants $65. Magellan's,
110 West Sola Street, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93101; (800) 962-4943.
</P>
<P>
   Ex Officio is a Seattle manufacturer, in business 12 years, that
distributes through outfitting and sports supply shops like Paragon
in New York and E.M.S. and also through some catalogs, including
Magellan's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These clothes have a cargo-pants air. Ex Officio is the creator
of the ``ultimate travel skirt,'' made of nylon with a twill weave
on the outside. The skirt, made in China, is in six gores, and
buttons up the front. It has elastic panels in the back of the
waist, wide belt loops and two deep mesh-fabric pockets in the side
seams, plus a passport pocket with a Velcro closing, reached from
inside the waist band.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a ``floating pocket,'' a waterproof
zippered pouch four inches square sewed to a cord clipped to a loop
sewed into the waistband. This can be tucked into a pocket; the
theory is that credit cards would thus be easier to get out than
the passport.
</P>
<P>
   The skirt comes in sizes 4 to 18 in dark neutrals: navy, dark
garnet, pine, brown and khaki. It is long enough to pass muster in
places where women are supposed to be covered but not dressy enough
for an elegant evening.
</P>
<P>
   It came out of the box a bit wrinkled _ not a good sign,
although it would probably straighten out if hung up. The price is
$58.
</P>
<P>
   The company sent along a Baja Plus cotton-polyester shirt to go
with the skirt. It has lots of features for warm-weather hiking: a
big double pleat in the back, mesh ventilation openings on the
side, a hidden zip pocket, shoulder patches and lots of Velcro _
almost everything but grenade rings.
</P>
<P>
   This is marked at $79. Ex Officio, 1419 Elliott Avenue West,
Seattle, Wash. 98119; (800) 644-7303. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coats are an inescapable pain in the neck for travelers.
Slickers and windbreakers are fine for hiking, but usually will not
serve if the trip involves restaurant meals or the like. We looked
at two packable trenchcoats.
</P>
<P>
   The LL Bean H2Off coat is made of a polyester microfiber that is
soft and smooth and water-repellent. The long coat has pocket flaps
to keep water out, raglan sleeves, a cape front and back and no
belt. The lining is nylon mesh under the cape area, regular nylon
down to the hem.
</P>
<P>
   The coat zips down the front and has snaps on top. The one we
had was an appealing blue that LL Bean calls mallard. This
machine-washable coat, made in Thailand, is cut large, weighs 10
ounces and compresses into a roll 17{ inches around by 9 inches
long. The sizes are small to extra-large (6-8 to 18-20); colors are
black, red, lilac, mallard and light khaki.
</P>
<P>
   The price is $129. If packing is not involved, it can be bought
with a wool lining for $179. LL Bean, Freeport, Maine 04033; (800)
221-4221.
</P>
<P>
   Hammacher Schlemmer sells a coat that is crinkle nylon, bears
the label of Kenneth Barnard and is made in the Philippines. It
buttons down the front, has two slash pockets, a buttoned interior
breast pocket and a half-lining. Packed in a Velcro-closed pouch,
12 inches by 10 inches, it weighs 6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   This ``generously oversized'' coat looks odd when worn: the
raglan sleeves drop almost to the waist, which tended to make our
tester look swamped. It comes in red, tan and black and costs
$89.95. Hammacher Schlemmer, 9180 Le Saint Drive, Fairfield, Ohio
45014; (800) 543-3366.

   &UR; VACATION PLANNING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; www.sidewalk.com &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to plan a three-day weekend, and I had heard that
Microsoft's Sidewalk, which started in early 1997, was the place to
begin on the Web. It was also the place I ended, exploring it on
and off over a week. Designed mainly for residents of the cities it
covers, Sidewalk does not offer airline information or online
reservations, but it is a blessedly consistent site with an
excellent search function, handsome despite its many
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   It's up and running for a dozen places: Boston, Chicago, Denver,
Houston, Melbourne, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle,
Sydney, Minneapolis/St. Paul. And by Thanksgiving, Microsoft says,
it will add entertainment information, like movie reviews and
concert listings, for ``every town in America,'' and Zagat
restaurant reviews in a total of 40 areas.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, of which I am a native but which I haven't
visited in years, was appealing. What follows are my choices; yours
would certainly be different. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were 19 major categories for the City, as Northern
Californians call it, from Find a Movie to Find a Place to Stay.
Although the other cities offered similar information, it gratified
my San Francisco chauvinism to note that Houston and Denver had
only a dozen options each, and even New York had a mere 16. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To find a place to stay, you can search for a specific place or
pick a region _ in Sidewalks, San Francisco includes the East Bay,
Napa Valley and other areas _ and a special option. I picked San
Francisco and Historic Interest. That gave me 13 places, divided
into bed-and-breakfasts, hotels and motels. The Fairmont and Mark
Hopkins Intercontinental hotels, curiously, were listed as motels.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My first choice was a luxury hotel, like the Fairmont, but a
cooler head usually prevails, so I examined the bed-and-breakfasts.
For the Red Victorian, in Haight-Ashbury, all the essential
information was in the first listing, and a click away was a short
article (``the rooms and decor reflect the Summer of Love'').
</P>
<P>
   Next, dinner the first night. A button produced the names,
addresses and phone numbers of 22 restaurants near the B&AMP;B. An
Asian place, the EOS Restaurant and Wine Bar, sounded promising.
After spending most of a day flying, getting to and from airports
and checking in, a restaurant a walk from the hotel is a fine
idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next night we would wander farther afield. I selected
Mexican/Southwestern cuisine, which San Francisco was noted for
when I was growing up there; $15 to $20 per entree; three stars as
a rating, and romantic as the option. There were no romantic,
medium-priced, excellent Mexican restaurants. Maybe I was too
choosy. I eased up on the conditions, and was rewarded with the
names of 58 places. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with the hotels, you can click on the name of a restaurant in
the brief list, and get a full page of information, including a
review. For one Mexican place, the Cadillac Bar near the Moscone
Center, it said ``if Tijuana is your idea of Mexico, the place has
succeeded.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next, some things to do. In the Arts and Music section, I picked
Poetry/Spoken Word and got the names of six events _ readings, live
comedy and such _ for the next month and half. All of the Sidewalk
subcategories operate the same way, so once you've found, say, a
hotel, you have also learned how to search for a restaurant or an
art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   To find another thing to do, I went into Places to Go and was
given 14 major categories. I picked Culinary Shops/Schools, and was
presented with 85 places to shop for, eat or learn about food. It
was an eclectic list, with Tante Marie's Cooking School, the Cellar
at Macy's Union Square and to the 24th Street Cheese Company all on
board.
</P>
<P>
   A walk in a park would help after eating too much. There were
four romantic parks listed, headed by the Palace of Fine Arts,
which I can attest is romantic, although Land's End was the
Sidewalk choice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER GUIDES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There must be a couple of dozen other city guides on the Web. I
dipped into several of them, but always returned to Sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   You might, however, try Lycos City Guide, cityguide.lycos.com,
which covers the world in a far more limited way, naturally, than
Sidewalk covers metropolitan areas; CityInsights,
www.cityinsights.com, which concentrates on San Francisco, Chicago,
New York and Boston, but without much in any of them, or USA
Citylink, www.usacitylink.com, with most of the cities you've ever
heard of.

   BC-IRISH-BETRAYAL-2ND &LR;   &UR; TAKE-BOS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; CORK, Ireland: ... ``The Informer'' &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, O'Callaghan grew disillusioned and dismayed
with the IRA, convinced it indulged in the very acts of
sectarianism and barbarism that it condemned as endemic to the
British state in Northern Ireland it was sworn to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to get back at the IRA by destroying it from within.
He compromised many IRA missions, none more sensational than a 1983
plan to murder Diana, princess of Wales, and Prince Charles.
O'Callaghan also unwittingly caused the disappearance and presumed
murder of a Quincy man named John McIntyre, who was blamed by
Boston gangsters for compromising a 1984 gun-running mission. In
fact, it was O'Callaghan who gave up the Valhalla, the trawler used
to ferry $1 million of guns to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about who compromised the Valhalla was intense,
especially after Corcoran's body turned up in March 1985. Without
elaboration, the IRA said Corcoran had been executed for informing.
Some people assumed Corcoran ruined the gun-running mission.
</P>
<P>
   But according to O'Callaghan, Corcoran had been under suspicion
by the IRA for other botched operations. After IRA men abducted him
and accused him of informing, Corcoran quickly confessed, according
to O'Callaghan, who said he later taped Corcoran's admissions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan said he suggested the IRA hold a press conference
and have Corcoran tell his story to embarrass the police and their
methods of recruiting informers. His motive, he said, was to save
Corcoran. But he said his superior, reputed IRA chief of staff
Kevin McKenna, dismissed the idea, saying, ``Kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan says he called police, giving them the location of
the Kerry farmhouse where Corcoran was being held. Police refuse to
discuss that allegation. Eventually, it came down to O'Callaghan
and Corcoran. O'Callaghan briefly flirted with the idea of telling
him to run off. But he said that would have amounted to his own
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the mask off him,'' O'Callaghan said in 1994. ``It was
just the most pathetic sight. To the very end, I was hoping the
Gards (police) would come through the door, just take Corcoran and
his wife away somewhere, give them a new life, a new identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, O'Callaghan said, convinced there was no way out, he
shot Corcoran in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Now, O'Callaghan tells a different story. In his book, he says
he confessed to force the police to conduct an investigation. While
admitting that ``with hindsight such a course of action may seem
foolhardy and difficult to understand,'' O'Callaghan wrote, ``I
knew that my motives were well intentioned. I wanted the truth to
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan says he has not been told by his handlers why
Corcoran was allowed to die. ``Was I regarded as more valuable than
Corcoran and therefore to be protected even at the cost of his
life?'' he asks. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Eileen Corcoran. But she considers O'Callaghan's
word unreliable. She is not alone. When O'Callaghan testified for
the Sunday Times of London last spring in a libel case brought by
IRA leader Thomas ``Slab'' Murphy, he did little to bolster his
credibility. When Murphy's lawyer asked O'Callaghan to name any
person to whom he had told the truth in the past 10 years,
O'Callaghan replied, ``It's extremely difficult to give you that
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Belfast, a man who was a senior figure in the
IRA at the time of Corcoran's murder said O'Callaghan fingered
Corcoran as an informer and took it upon himself to kill Corcoran
after Corcoran confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corcoran was a tout,'' said the man, who spoke on the
condition that he not be named because he would be subject to
arrest for IRA membership. ``The problem is, we didn't know
O'Callaghan was a tout at the time. Now, in hindsight, you can see
why O'Callaghan was so anxious to do him.''
</P>
<P>
   As the IRA man sees it, killing Corcoran helped O'Callaghan
ingratiate himself with his IRA superiors, showing them he remained
a committed revolutionary willing to kill even a friend on orders,
while also eliminating the possibility that Corcoran might blow his
cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Callaghan knew the Gards wouldn't expose him, so it was
perfect,'' said the IRA man who, despite his hatred of O'Callaghan,
steadfastly believes the IRA was entitled to kill Corcoran because
``he knew the rules when he got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   If O'Callaghan's original tale had the ring of truth, his new
claim has the ring of self-preservation. He is open to prosecution
in the Irish Republic. But there is nothing to suggest the Irish
government is anxious to get to the bottom of this.
</P>
<P>
   A few months before he became Ireland's justice minister in June
1997, John O'Donoghue promised to find out what happened to
Corcoran. But since taking office, O'Donoghue has said only that
the matter is under investigation. Police held O'Callaghan for two
days of questioning in Dublin before releasing him without charge
May 1. Damian Hogan, a police spokesman, said only that the
investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, meanwhile, have failed Eileen Corcoran, whose
plaintive cries for help have fallen on deaf ears. Dick Spring, the
former deputy prime minister, is the only one who has responded,
demanding that the police and government clear the air, ``for the
family's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring's outrage is isolated. Other members of the Dail,
Ireland's Parliament, won't talk about it. This is as much a
cultural as political phenomenon. Since achieving partial
independence in 1922, Ireland has remained one of the most
conservative and authoritarian democracies in Europe. While Irish
politicians seldom hesitate to condemn misconduct by the
British-controlled Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland,
they rarely criticize the Garda Siochana. The police and Justice
Department are excluded from Ireland's Freedom of Information Act,
which became law this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, the police do largely what they want, so there is no
expectation that they should tell Eileen Corcoran why her husband
was killed, nor is there any real public pressure on them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her living room with her eldest daughter, Catherine,
Eileen Corcoran begins to cry as she explains how important it is
for her and her children to know what happened to her husband, what
his last words were. ``Did he say anything about us?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine is resolute. ``This has devastated our family, and no
one has given us the decency of explaining what happened,'' she
said.

   John Corcoran was not the only member of his family to fall
victim to IRA brutality and police indifference. Eight years after
his murder, his daughter Ursula, 18, hanged herself in the family's
back yard.

</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year-old, Ursula took her father's death the hardest.
She was hysterical and had to be sedated. As she grew into
adolescence, she had trouble sleeping. The image of his body,
stuffed into a sleeping bag and dumped by the side of a road,
haunted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It destroyed her soul,'' her mother said, sighing. ``There
have been a lot of souls destroyed by this.''

   CORK, Ireland _ Someone owes Eileen Corcoran an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, her husband was marched into a field and
ordered to kneel. After John Corcoran mumbled a prayer, someone put
the muzzle of a pistol to the back of his head and fired.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 45, with a wife and eight children at home, John
Corcoran died the ignominious death of an informer, the worst of
all possible deaths in Ireland, a nation that for centuries was
betrayed by the words of those who sold out their country for money
or revenge.
</P>
<P>
   If Corcoran was a traitor to the Irish Republican Army, which
killed him, then he died in service to the Republic of Ireland,
which considers the IRA as much a threat to its sovereignty and
national security as Britain does.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the IRA, which claimed his murder in a terse
statement, nor the Irish police, who refuse to confirm or deny that
Corcoran worked for them, will disclose the circumstances of his
death.
</P>
<P>
   That means Eileen Corcoran and her children sit here in a quiet
neighborhood outside the city where Frank O'Connor mastered the
short story, waiting for an explanation, frustrated by the unknown
and official indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Corcoran believes her husband was sacrificed by the Garda
Siochana, Ireland's national police force, to protect its most
prized informer ever: Sean O'Callaghan.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the family's grief, O'Callaghan, a confessed IRA
assassin, has given conflicting accounts about his role in the
murder. In a 1994 jailhouse interview with the Globe, O'Callaghan
said he shot Corcoran because IRA superiors ordered him to, but
insisted he had earlier begged his police handlers to rescue
Corcoran. He said he never learned why police ignored his calls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two years after his release from prison, O'Callaghan is
the author of a best-selling book on his exploits as the most
senior IRA figure to turn on the organization. Now, O'Callaghan
denies he shot Corcoran, saying he made up the story so Irish
authorities would be forced to disclose what happened in that field
13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan says he confessed to Corcoran's killing in a
convoluted but ultimately noble attempt to get to the bottom of the
murder that left a widow with eight children to raise.
</P>
<P>
   But that widow, Eileen Corcoran, isn't buying it. ``I don't
believe Sean O'Callaghan,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for police, she doesn't know whether to believe them or not,
because they have told her nothing.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the world has applauded the steady progress of the
Irish peace process, what happened to the Corcoran family and what
continues to haunt them is the bitter, enduring legacy of a dirty
war.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale of idealism, nationalism, the brutality of
guerrilla warfare, and betrayal, of a country, of a cause, and of a
husband and father named John Corcoran, the odd man out in a deadly
game.
</P>
<P>
   John Corcoran grew up in Cork, an area far from Northern Ireland
but where revolutionary fervor still burns. Eileen Corcoran said
her husband was raised listening to romantic rebel tales by his
grandmother, a staunch republican who believed force was necessary
to end British control of the six counties that constitute Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran worked as a warehouse manager, but his wife knew he did
odd jobs on the side for the IRA. It was a strain on their
marriage. Years ago, the police arrested him. Eileen Corcoran
believes, but has no proof, that her husband made a fatal pact with
the police in which he agreed to pass on information about the IRA
if he was allowed to return to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran was a guppy in the IRA pond, someone so far removed
from the inner workings of the organization that all he could give
up were other small fish. O'Callaghan, however, was different. He
was a hardened killer and by 1985 had become one of the IRA's most
senior operatives. He had killed people in Northern Ireland, and
had worked with leading IRA figures there.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1994 interview in Maghaberry prison in Northern
Ireland, O'Callaghan described in detail how he shot Corcoran,
stressing that he had done so reluctantly, because his Irish police
handlers had not responded to his calls to rescue Corcoran, and
because he would have been shot by the IRA if he failed to carry
out an order to kill Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan was in prison after confessing to two murders in
Northern Ireland: a woman solider killed by a bomb, and an off-duty
Catholic policeman who was shot as he sat in a pub. In 1996, eight
years into a double life sentence, he was pardoned by Queen
Elizabeth, &UR;  &LR; then given a $300,000 advance to write his
autobiography, ``The Informer.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK -- ``Murmansk - Hero City'' proclaims the large, faded
sign as you enter Russia's great northern port. Like many mementos
from Soviet times, it is a mixture of the absurd and the oddly
stirring.
</P>
<P>
   Times were truly hard, Hitler was at the gate and ice-free
Murmansk was Russia's lifeline. Now times are truly bad again. Only
there are no heros; only incompetents and villains, the omnipresent
crisis -- and icebreakers that break no ice.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly life in Murmansk belies the economic debacle that has
overtaken the country. Built in bleak Soviet style along a rocky
fjord 200 miles above the Arctic Circle, this city will never yield
an easy living. But at a price, goods of all kinds are available.
</P>
<P>
   Panic and queues are not in evidence. You are tempted to conform
to the conventional expert wisdom: Russia once more will sacrifice
and suffer, but you predict, will somehow muddle through as always.
And maybe so. But out in the villages, in the orphanages and the
hospitals, among the sick and the old and the disadvantaged, the
foreboding is as palpable as the first wet snow of late September.
And desperate times beget desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   No help is to be expected from the country's capital in name,
Moscow. Like everywhere else in Russia, Murmansk must sidestep the
center and barter to secure what it needs -- in its case swapping
fish and minerals for fruit, vegetables and consumer goods from
other regions.
</P>
<P>
   But Murmansk has gone a historic step further. For the first
time a Russian regional leader, in the person of its governor, Yuri
Yevdokimov, has appealed not to his own federal government, but to
the neighboring authorities of Norway and Finland for help.
</P>
<P>
   The step is unarguably wise and, from one perspective, merely
another step toward a more open and ``normal'' Russia. But for a
region at the very heart of the strategic defense of a proud,
secretive and autarchic country, it signifies an enormous
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with economic collapse, the eternal ties which bind Russia
are starting to come asunder.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, consider the icebreakers. If nuclear-missile
submarines are the emblem of Severomorsk, the closed city 10 miles
up the fiord which is home of the Northern Fleet, Murmansk's pride
are its giant nuclear and diesel icebreakers.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like them anywhere -- monstrous machines of up
to 75,000 horsepower that can carve a 30-yard wide channel through
10-foot pack ice. Tall as good-sized office blocks, equipped with
saunas and small swimming pools, they can stay at sea for five
months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   With them Russia can allow itself to dream of turning the 3,500
miles of the ``Northern Eastern Passage'' linking Western Europe
and Asia across the top of the world, into a new artery of global
commerce. Without them, the communities strung out along Siberia's
bleak northern shores -- settlements as remote as any on earth,
with strange, un-Russian names like Dikson, Buolkalach and Ur'ung
Chaya -- would perish.
</P>
<P>
   Without them the estuaries of Siberia's great rivers, the Ob,
the Yenisei and the Lena would be permanently frozen. The vital
mining city of Norilsk, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle and
producer of 15 per cent of the world's nickel, would be cut off,
and Russian research and defense stations on the islands of the
polar ocean would have to close down.
</P>
<P>
   Early autumn should see the icebreakers at their busiest,
escorting cargo ships before the ice becomes too thick even for
them to cope. But now there is no money, and precious little trade,
just the crisis. Business on the northern route is down 80 per
cent, and half the ships in the icebreaker fleet lie idle in dock.
The Murmansk Shipping Company, which operates the vessels, has
received from Moscow less than a third of the funds it needs to
maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the difference is recouped with three-week cruises to
the North Pole for foreigners prepared to shell out $18,000 to
$30,000 a head for the ultimate chic in summer holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, crew salaries have gone unpaid for two months. The
settlements risk going without fuel and other essential supplies
during the bitter cold and darkness of the Arctic winter. Some may
have to be evacuated, perhaps forever.
</P>
<P>
   The ``crisis'' has succeeded where even Hitler failed,
destroying even hope.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM -- STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Father Nikodim, assistant to Bishop Simon of Murmansk, is about
to celebrate a marriage -- if celebrate is the correct word for a
ceremony with virtually no guests, in an empty church under
restoration and swathed in scaffolding, where fresco painters go
uncaring about their business.
</P>
<P>
   Never, he says, have the prospects been as miserable: the winter
of 1991 after communism collapsed, was as bad in logistical terms,
but at least there was promise of a new system and better things.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a catastrophe. For the church, suicide is the greatest
sin, but now people are just killing themselves in despair. During
the 20 years I've been a priest, I could only imagine these things,
and hear of them -- but now I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour the union is blessed and the ceremony is
over. The couple leaves, stepping off into a future as dark as the
lowering sky, carrying the first squally snow showers of a winter
which for the far Russian North could be the hardest in half a
century.

IN A DEEP FIELD, `PFEIFFER' TAKES WORST HONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite incredible odds, the fulminations of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and the demonstrated indifference of the American public,
``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' returned this week for a
second episode.
</P>
<P>
   Truly we live in an age of miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Back when networks were networks and not pipsqueaks like UPN,
this would never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   No sirree. When CBS put ``South of Sunset'' on the air in 1993,
and CBS had profound second thoughts, the cop show was canceled
like (set ital)that.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   One episode and gone, dead, kaput. The coffin was nailed shut
and the thing was buried before anyone debated how bad ``South of
Sunset'' was.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I believe that in the course of reviewing ``Desmond
Pfeiffer,'' I might have called it the worst show of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   We critics like calling things ``worst'' and ``best.'' Some
movie critics, usually the sorts who work on TV, come across ``one
of the year's 10 best films'' as many as 30 or 40 times during the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers have e-mailed me since the ``Desmond Pfeiffer''
debut last Monday to say that my ``worst of the decade'' assessment
was harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Not only harsh, but thoughtless. To which, of course, I always
raise my hand and smile.
</P>
<P>
   In their judgment, ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' was not (set
ital)puh-(end ital)first worst, but in (set ital)puh-(end ital)fact
a poor second worst to some other monstrosity of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jenny McCarthy Show'' is mentioned. That's the MTV series
in which the former Playboy Playmate, in her show's first sketch,
poked her finger down her throat and spewed stage vomit. Then the
show got bad.
</P>
<P>
   That was a cable show. Listen up. If we're going to include
cable, then I'm just not going to participate in this discussion.
Period.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I reviewed ``The Jenny McCarthy Show'' and the
regrettable Fox series ``Pauly,'' with that annoying Pauly Shore,
at the same time last year and declared that they were two of the
worst shows ever.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind decade. Ever. And that seems worse than ``Desmond
Pfeiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But we're really unable to put stink bombs extraordinaire on
balance scales and say (set ital)phew,(end ital) this is
scientifically the more malodorous.
</P>
<P>
   Or to subject the shows to a Stink-O-Meter test, where we hook
them to wires and find ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' posting a 9.8 compared
with a convincing 9.83 for ``Pauly.''
</P>
<P>
   No, as always, taste and smell are closely related. I'm not
recanting, exactly, but I'll admit that there have been plenty of
bad shows in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cop Rock'' was in 1990. Actually, I thought it was an
interesting show. But it will always be remembered otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC executive's kids liked L.A. radio personalities Mark
Thompson and Brian Phelps, leading to a mishap called ``The
Adventures of Mark and Brian'' in 1991. It lasted 11 weeks. NBC
executives are stubborn critters.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriately named ``Woops!'' was on Fox for several weeks
in 1992. It was a wacky sitcom about nuclear war survivors. One of
my source books calls it ``a post-apocalyptic `Gilligan's
Island.''' Got your scent glands twitching?
</P>
<P>
   ``South of Sunset'' graced the 1993 season for that one
inglorious night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Oats,'' ``Hardball'' and ``Models Inc.'' brought up the
rear in 1994. Just for the heck of it, I'm awarding ``Models Inc.''
the Miss Congeniality award for bad TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinky and the Brain'' didn't do much for me, but ``Brotherly
Love'' is an even worse memory from 1995. Too many brothers. Too
much TV love. Bad taste in mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher'' came along in 1996 and went on
to become the least watched network series for the next two
seasons. Which made it a licensed loser. But still, remember ``Lush
Life'' on Fox, with Lori (``Tank Girl'') Petty? She tanked. Look at
it this way. Suddenly ``Brotherly Love'' looks like the stuff you
use to wash away the taste of ``Lush Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, 1997. Who was cuter in ``Meego,'' Bronson Pinchot or the
kid? Trick question _ they were both awful. But I hated the insipid
genie series ``You Wish'' (from the creative mind that brought you
``Charles in Charge'') even more.
</P>
<P>
   We're back to ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' with its
Lincoln log anatomical jokes. Is it that much worse than ``The Army
Show'' or ``Mercy Point'' or ``Holding the Baby'' or the yet-to-air
``Wind on Water''?
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad I asked myself that question, because it is. In fact,
I'm now surer than ever, convinced beyond the shadow of a ratings
point, that ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' is indeed the worst show of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At least until tomorrow.

KITSCH DREAMS: FILM ROOTED IN ROMANTICS 
</HEADLINE>
 ART-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Imagine walking around inside a painting and you have
the visual premise for the new film ``What Dreams May Come.''
</P>
<P>
   In that New Age treaclefest, Robin Williams plays a doctor who
dies and discovers that his personal heaven looks just like his
wife's paintings. He finds himself among drooping wisteria trees
and enough royal-blue flowers to fill out the background for all
the animated Strawberry Shortcake cartoons ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have roundly trounced the movie as preachy, silly,
tedious, sappy and pretentious. It is all those things. But they
have generally missed the movie's visual sources, the
art-historical references being made. Most of them call Williams'
computer-generated paradise a ``Renoir come to life'' or a
``Maxfield Parrish vision.''
</P>
<P>
   However, although there are a few Parrishesque lushnesses, its
central artistic vision comes not from the Impressionists and
certainly not from 20th-century magazine illustrators.
</P>
<P>
   No, the film draws more than anything on early 19th-century
Romantic painters and their Victorian progeny.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to see them show up on the screen because
among serious critics it is a period of art history that doesn't
get much respect. Critics can talk about Eugene Delacroix without
sputtering and Joseph Mallord William Turner without condescension,
although both are admired mainly as precursors to the later
Impressionists; but critics tend to become more than a little
patronizing when discussing such painters as Thomas Cole, Frederic
Church, Caspar David Friedrich, Gustave Dore and _ worst of all _
John Martin.
</P>
<P>
   These are painters who, in the aggregate, made Cecil B. DeMille
possible. They gave us grandiose visions of gargantuan exoticisms.
Their subjects were the Deluge, the Plagues of Egypt, the Day of
Wrath, the Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and _ my personal
favorite _ Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion. Human figures
are dwarfed not only by vast landscapes, but also by immense
architecture. Martin once painted a Balshazzar's Feast as taking
place in a building that was projected to be a mile long.
</P>
<P>
   So, there they are, all those impossibly high mountains,
painfully distant horizons, the longing of those waterfalls and the
nostalgia of those weeping trees.
</P>
<P>
   It is the stuff our own century has made camp out of. It has
become translated to painted dinner plates sold in magazine offers,
a landscape populated with Hummel figurines. It is the mawkish
frontispiece of illustrated Sunday school texts.
</P>
<P>
   What those painters were trying to depict, however, wasn't a
suburban vision of a hereafter _ one movie critic called the
current film version of heaven a ``McDonald's in the Mall of
America'' _ but a vision of transcendence, a sense that the world
is larger, more beautiful and more electric than we allow ourselves
to notice in our everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that such an anagogic sense has turned so
bourgeois. What once was dangerous and radical has become sedate,
complacent and conservative.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fatal flaw of New Age thinking that it is as
comfortable as an easy chair and an old pair of slippers. So ``What
Dreams May Come'' turns into a retelling of the Orpheus myth with a
happy ending tacked on. New Age philosophy allows only for happy
endings.
</P>
<P>
   Real philosophy is not a warm sudsy bath; life as we live it
tells us it has harder edges and less narcissistic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the fairy-weight thought that we take away from
the movie, but the sense of wandering around inside a painting.
</P>
<P>
   So Williams climbs the infinite staircase from John Martin's
manic engraved illustrations to Milton's ``Paradise Lost'' among
the floating angels of Philipp Otto Runge. When he descends to
hell, he boats through waters with floating nudes straight out of
Delacroix's ``Barque of Dante,'' and his ultimate resting point is
under the naked winter tree of Caspar David Friedrich's ``Man and
Woman Contemplating the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   One after another, paintings from the early 19th century float
by and we enter and cruise through them.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through art is not a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   It is the expectation in Chinese painting, where the viewer is
supposed to imagine himself a tiny figure walking up the mountain
path among the pine trees toward that ``scholar's cabin'' at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   And even in film, there is an earlier and much better attempt.
</P>
<P>
   It is in ``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' an anthology film by the
Japanese director from 1990. In one segment, called ``Crows,'' a
young amateur painter, with his paint box on his back, visits
southern France looking for Van Gogh's landscapes. He comes across
the master himself, played by Martin Scorsese, and follows him
through the countryside, which miraculously turns into a living Van
Gogh painting as they walk through it.
</P>
<P>
   It captures the sense that the current film misses, that it is
the eyes of the artist, ever more awake and aware than we can be,
that see the world _ in William Blake's words _ ``as it is,
infinite.'' &QL;

 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.: ... ``the elderly''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers know, moreover, that space flight has a number of
effects on the cardiovascular system, that returning astronauts who
try to stand up can even lose consciousness, and that the heart
actually gets smaller during long flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that aging has some similar effects on the
cardiovascular system,'' said Richard J. Cohen, a Harvard-MIT
Division of Health Sciences and Technology professor who heads the
cardiovascular alterations team for the National Space Biomedical
Research Institute. ``The studies that will be done on Senator
Glenn might tell us whether aging makes some of these effects more
severe. And we may learn some things from space flight about how
aging affects the cardiovascular system.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is the pretext. What matters here at Cape Canaveral,
where the 25th mission of Discovery and the 94th mission of the
17-year-old Space Shuttle program is nearing its countdown, is the
context. And that is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Glenn was hoisted above a booster rocket, the
nation was involved in a great struggle for prestige and power, and
though the space program was cloaked in romance it was in reality a
proxy for realpolitik.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months earlier, Yuri A. Gagarin, a 27-year-old Russian test
pilot, had orbited the earth once, traveling 25,000 miles in 108
minutes. ``Let the capitalist countries try to catch up,'' Soviet
leader Nikita Khruschev told Gagarin.
</P>
<P>
   Catching up did not prove to be easy. Glenn was in the control
center when an unmanned test orbital mission made a perfect liftoff
from Pad 14. Forty seconds later the Atlas booster, which weighed
135 tons, exploded. ``We looked at each other,'' Glenn said, ``and
thought we'd better have a little chat with the engineers, which we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days of NASA's innocence, and perhaps of its
greatest risks. ``Back in those days, we were trying to figure out
whether we could even do space flight,'' Glenn said. ``Doctors were
worried about stuff like whether our eyeballs would change in
flight and we wouldn't be able to see anything, or whether we could
even swallow in space. Those things were up in the air in 1961. We
needed to find out whether space flight was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One sentence in a popular 1961 paperback, Martin Cadin's ``Man
into Space,'' inadvertently conveyed the risk involved in the first
flights: ``Certainly the astronauts of Project Mercury are being
given the greatest possible chances of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom made successful suborbital
flights in 1961, but though they won headlines, the politicians and
the space professionals knew they had only nicked the surface of
space. It was an orbital flight that mattered, and America didn't
have one yet.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's frustration grew. Ten times Glenn was scheduled to
ride his Atlas booster into orbit, and each time adverse weather or
technical problems caused the flight to be postponed. The 11th
time, on Feb. 20, 1962, the booster pierced the sky, and three
words &UR;  &LR; uttered from Mission Control, pierced the American
consciousness: ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's pulse rate at liftoff was 110 beats per minute, far less
than Shepard's (126) or Grissom's (162). And for two orbits the
flight went as planned. Then came a cascade of troubles. His
controls went haywire. (The astronaut could die in space.) The heat
shield worked itself loose. (The astronaut could die in the earth's
atmosphere.)
</P>
<P>
   The world held its breath.
</P>
<P>
   But the important thing, according to Glenn, who has relived
those moments for 36 years, is that the world watched it all _ the
launch, the peril, the recovery in the ocean _ in real time, which
seemed like forever but in reality was only 4 hours, 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all open, open to the whole world,'' Glenn said. ``That
was a turning point in our national psyche. People stood in those
parades mopping their eyes, they were crying so much.'' In New
York, the cheers came from 4 million people. Later that day
sanitation crews in lower Manhattan swept up a record 3.5 million
tons of ticker tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something that was new,'' Glenn said. ``I laid the
groundwork for the other flights. Now we're using space for what I
thought we eventually would use it for _ to benefit people back
here. We did basic research back then. We still only have our toe
in the door, but we're doing more and more important research every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One more time, Glenn is on the verge of space flight. One more
time, Glenn is a national symbol. One more time: Godspeed, John
Glenn.

THE HERO OF OUR AGE SETS OFF ON ANOTHER PIONEER FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Say this about John Glenn, World War II
and Korea veteran, test pilot, Mercury astronaut, legislator,
presidential candidate, Space Shuttle payload specialist, American
hero: He has grit. Staying power. And a willingness to try new
things. A resume for the ages, or at least our age.
</P>
<P>
   And an enduring place in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other figure of our time, John Herschell Glenn
Jr., a product of the center of the country and a devout acolyte of
the center in American politics, has remained at the center of the
action of our national life _ longer than Charles Lindbergh, longer
than Richard Nixon, longer than John Wayne, longer than almost
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at 77, this man _ who set a transcontinental speed
record in an F8U Crusader fighter in July 1957, who was a cameo
figure in Camelot, who was a stalwart of the Senate for nearly a
quarter-century _ is preparing to strap himself in a spacecraft
again and be hurled, against the force of gravity and maybe against
all odds and all reason, into the heavens for a victory lap around
the world. It is an act of courage, madness, stubbornness,
perseverence _ and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a moment of nostalgia for the Model T days of our age
of space discovery. There was one man, alone, in Friendship 7 in
1962. Glenn joins a crew of five men and a woman on Discovery on
Oct. 29. There were 20 circuit breakers on Friendship 7. There are
961 on Discovery. There were 48 items stowed on Friendship 7. There
are about 2,600 on Discovery. There were 56 toggle switches on
Friendship 7. There are 856 on Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The crew compartment on Friendship 7 was 36 cubic feet. On
Discovery it is 2,325 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury was small,'' Glenn was saying the other day. Unlike
most overachievers, he is a man of understatement. And though he
reflects his time, he is remarkably unreflective. ``All I could do
is get in and be in the contour couch. At best I could loosen the
straps. But I had to sit still. The instrument panel was only 23
inches from the bridge of my nose. Now it's much different.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Cape Canaveral, where old rocket boosters litter the
landscape like some space-age Stonehenge, Glenn is forever clad in
silver, one of the flyboys of the New Frontier, the wisecracking,
envelope-stretching, death-defying Mercury astronauts who climbed
atop the Redstone and Atlas rockets, squeezed into a space capsule
and, as the world watched on black-and-white televisions in
classrooms and train stations and big urban squares, became the
pioneers of the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   And so last week, when he sat behind the wheel of an armored
vehicle called an M1-13 in the shadow of Pad 39B to practice an
emergency escape technique, or entered a space craft for the first
time in 36 years, he not only looked like a museum piece. He was
one.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way it dos not matter that Glenn looks a lot older in
the blue cotton jumpsuit of the Shuttle crew than he does in the
standard blue business suit of the Senate. (In both roles, he's
been wearing the American flag on his sleeve for decades.) Nor does
it matter that he seemed a bit self-conscious among astronauts who
weren't even toddlers (one wasn't even born) when he piloted
Friendship 7 into space, becoming both the first American to orbit
the earth and an enduring emblem of American courage and resolve in
the Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered only that John Glenn, who was here so long ago, was
here again, training amid the growls of a menacing alligator in one
of Cape Canaveral's many swamps, ready to be a symbol for his
country again.
</P>
<P>
   This time he is John Glenn, super senior. This time he is the
symbol not of what a youthful nation with a cult-like worship of
vigor dared to do, but a symbol of what an aging nation that has
come to realize many of its dreams is willing and able to do.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who has led the life of his times, is having the time of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's the kind of guy who doesn't change heartbeat or
expression no matter what he's doing, even if he's over Korea and
his plane is being shot at,'' said Democratic Senator Patrick J.
Leahy of Vermont, who like Glenn was elected to the Senate in 1974
and who, even though the launch is scheduled for less than a week
before the midterm congressional elections, will be here at the
Kennedy Space Center to watch Glenn go back into orbit. ``But when
he talks about this _ about this flight _ he looks 25 years younger
and is really, really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily when the village elders talk about an established
figure hanging around with people younger than his own daughter
there are snickers, looks of disapproval, and the phrase ``midlife
crisis'' hangs ominously in the air. Not everyone approves of what
NASA is permitting Glenn to do. Veteran astronaut Story Musgrave,
for example, has openly criticized Glenn's role and has suggested
that the senator has not been training rigorously enough.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a rhyme, or at least poetic justice, and maybe even
a reason for Glenn's role.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn won his berth on Discovery after convincing NASA officials
that he was uniquely qualified to conduct experiments that might
help scientists better understand the process of aging _ in space
and on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be able not only to benefit the astronauts on long
flights but also work on the frailties of old age back here on
earth,'' Glenn said in an interview. ``I was feeling for all these
years that my age was a detriment to going back into space, but
suddenly it's an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers are dubious that much can be learned from
Glenn's one-man experiment. But others hope to adapt the methods to
combat the body's disorientation in space to help earthbound
patients, especially older people who fall frequently, with walking
and posture disorders. These scientists hope, moreover, that space
travel might provide hints on how biochemical signals affect bone
formation in astronauts, hints that might help prevent osteoporosis
in the elderly.

actually gets smaller during long flights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a typical 3-year-old, my daughter Amy planned for Halloween
with gusto. She chose her own costume _ a purple leotard and a tutu
_ and wore it every day for weeks before the big event. She could
hardly wait to fill an entire bag with candy!
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know that Amy's Halloween would not be all smiles.
One minute she was shouting, ``Trick or treat!'' and the next she
was petrified of a teen-age witch we saw on our block.
</P>
<P>
   She flew into my arms, sobbing, ``I'm so scared!'' and demanding
to go home to Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed that our fun was ending so abruptly, I took Amy
home. As it turned out, she had a much better time greeting
trick-or-treaters at our door than she had venturing out into
unfamiliar Halloween country.
</P>
<P>
   I shouldn't have been so surprised by my daughter's reaction.
``It's not unusual for a 3-year-old to be overwhelmed on
Halloween,'' notes Ava Siegler, a child psychologist in New York
City and a contributing editor to Child magazine. ``Toddlers and
many preschoolers don't yet have the firm boundaries that help them
differentiate between what's real and what's pretend, making it
difficult for them to see scary things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young children often don't like to be surprised,'' adds Karen
Marschke, a developmental specialist at the Corlears School in New
York City. ``They can't easily place new experiences into a context
that they understand, and this can leave them feeling confused and
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   How much Halloween excitement is appropriate for young kids? It
depends on your child's age and developmental stage.
</P>
<P>
   Babies are oblivious to what's going on; it's kids between 1 and
5 who are at risk of becoming frightened by what they're exposed to
on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   But even more essential than following age guidelines is
``taking into account your child's temperament and personality,''
notes Marschke. While an outgoing toddler may thrive on the
excitement, one who's slow to warm up or easily upset would benefit
from a more cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toddlers &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Keep it low key. Kids under age 3 are really not ready to go
trick-or-treating yet; they will feel much safer at home with you.
Many don't even enjoy the dressing-up part, since they often find
costumes constricting. It's important for you to keep expectations
reasonable and to plan activities that are short and predictable,
like a Halloween puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   If your child wants to dress up, a quick trip to a relative's
house to show off her costume is enough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preschoolers &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Stay flexible. Children age 3 and older can better understand
the concept of pretend versus real, and are therefore ready to get
more involved in Halloween activities, including trick-or-treating.
But remember that even preschoolers can have a wide range of
reactions to Halloween _ from delight to terror.
</P>
<P>
   Before the big day, prepare your child for what's to come. Look
at costumes in a store, pointing out that people will be wearing
them. Say, ``This is a day when kids put on funny or scary outfits.
You'll see some ghosts and witches, but remember that underneath
each costume is a little boy like you,'' says Siegler.
</P>
<P>
   When planning activities, remember shorter is better. Limit
trick-or-treating to a few close friends or neighbors, so your
child doesn't get overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how much you prepare, if on the big day your child
still seems frightened, then you need to accept that he's not ready
yet. ``Parents have to determine how much of this holiday is for
them _ because they want to see their child dressed as a pumpkin _
and how much of it kids really enjoy,'' adds Siegler. ``Halloween
is not just about a photo-op. It's a children's holiday, so if they
are not having fun, don't celebrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you follow your child's cues and stay flexible, Halloween
will be an adventure to remember. And when he's ready, you'll snap
photos galore.

<P>
   There's no doubt about it: For kids, Halloween is incredibly
exciting. But it's also potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Safe Kids Campaign (NSKC) in
Washington, D.C., children under age 15 are four times more likely
to be hurt in a pedestrian accident on Halloween than on any other
night of the year. Injuries from falls and burns are common, too.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there are some simple ways to keep your
kids safe without taking any of the fun out of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to know:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Think ahead &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A week or so before the big event, start talking about Halloween
safety, and be sure to communicate your rules clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are most likely to act impulsively when they're highly
stimulated,'' says Janette Benson, associate professor of
psychology at the University of Denver. ``Because they are so
focused on their goal _ in this case, the candy-they don't stop to
think before they act.''
</P>
<P>
   Take time to go over the rules when your children can focus on
what you're saying, then give a reminder on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shop wisely &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Fires are the third-leading cause of accidental deaths among
children. So when you're assembling a costume:
</P>
<P>
   Look for masks, hats, wigs and clothing labeled ``flame
resistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoid outfits that have billowing material, long capes, or baggy
sleeves that could catch fire if brushed against candles or fit
jack-o'-lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dress for safety &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Nothing takes the fun out of trick-or-treat time faster than a
Halloween ``boo''-boo caused by a slip or a fall. Be sure to:
</P>
<P>
   Hem your kids' costumes to mid-calf length or shorter to prevent
stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Secure hats and wigs so they don't slip child down and block
your child's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Mom's heels or Dad's boots, no matter how cute they look.
Choose comfy shoes with nonskid soles instead.
</P>
<P>
   Consider using face paint or makeup instead of a mask, which can
obstruct vision. If a mask is a must, cut the eye holes wide enough
so your child can see clearly in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boost visibility &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Make sure trick-or-treaters can still see and be seen when the
sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Use bright or light-colored costumes that can be spotted easily
by drivers. Add color to all-black outfits by persuading your child
to wear fluorescent tights. And give your child a flashlight to
help her navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Secure reflective tape or stickers to costumes (brands
identified as ``retro-reflective'' work the best).
</P>
<P>
   If you can't incorporate reflective tape into your child's
costume, put some on her shoes or treat bag.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Devise a game plan &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Before you set out trick-or-treating with kids, map a route of
familiar homes to visit and set a time limit. Get an early start
with young kids so you can be home before it's too dark.
</P>
<P>
   Remind kids not to dart into the street or cross between parked
cars-a risk when they're overexcited.
</P>
<P>
   Tell them to stop at corners and look left, right and left
before crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluate your child's maturity before letting him trick-or-treat
without you. Most kids under 10 aren't ready to go it alone, says
Dr. Marilyn J. Bull, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics'
section on injury and poison prevention.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Check the loot &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Halloween's a time for treats, but be cautious. Inspect all
candy before kids start snacking, and throw out anything
suspicious, says Pam Kreppel, a registered dietitian at Nassau
County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y. Toss cracked or crushed
candies and items with loose or tipped wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Remove treats that pose a choking hazard to kids under 4, warns
Kreppel. These include chewy candies with nuts or caramel; round,
hard candies; lollipops; and small, loose treats like gum balls.
Safer bets are plain chocolate bars, pretzels, or chocolate-covered
wafers.

<P>
   True, it's no trip to Disneyland. But taking your kids to the
grocery store can be fun _ and educational. Try these tips the next
time you're low on milk and bread:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Before you go &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Create a ``just for kids'' project to shop for. Whether you're
making a lemonade stand, cutting stamps from potatoes or creating a
shaving-cream sculpture, ask your child to add the necessary
supplies to the grocery list. Looking for ``her'' special items
will help keep interest high.
</P>
<P>
   Plan ahead. Schedule your trip when everyone is well-rested. And
eat a healthy snack before you go to brighten everyone's mood and
make that candy aisle a little more resistible.
</P>
<P>
   Ask questions. On the way to the store, talk about your grocery
list. Ask younger children ``What shape are oranges?'' and ``What
color is a box of Cheerios?'' Recognizing shapes, colors and logos
is a great pre-reading exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At the store &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for kid-sized carts. Many stores now have carts sized just
for the younger set. Your child will have fun adding ``his'' items
to his own cart.
</P>
<P>
   Give your child choices. Asking ``Should we get peas or green
beans?'' teaches decision-making skills and makes your child feel
important.
</P>
<P>
   Make learning fun. Preschoolers love to match items with
coupons. Once you're in the correct aisle, give your child a hint
about where the item is. Older kids can help compare unit prices to
find the best value.
</P>
<P>
   Use your senses. Younger kids are eager to learn about shapes,
textures and smells. Let them help you fill a bag with apples.
Teach them how to ``thump'' a cantaloupe and listen to the sound.
Smell the lemons together. Encourage your child to use all her
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Goof off! Wave at babies in passing carts. Make up a song about
bananas. With older kids, fun often equals challenge. Ask them
``How many different vegetables can you name in one minute?'' or
``If you ran your own store, what would you sell?''
</P>
<P>
   Teach money management. You may want to allow an older child to
spend a set amount of money on a treat. Learning to wisely spend a
limited amount of money is good lesson for every child. Even
better: Stop by the magazines or the children's book area and allow
your child to choose an item.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Back home &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep little hands busy. Older children can put away
non-breakable items. For added fun, have them play ``beat the
clock'' with a kitchen timer. By asking younger kids to ``put all
the vegetables in a pile'' or ``stack all the paper products by the
closet,'' you're teaching important concepts _ while giving
yourself time to put the ice cream in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Reward yourselves! Whether it's enjoying a cup of cocoa at the
kitchen table or making those potato stamps, take 15 minutes with
your kids to unwind and say thanks for a job well done!

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What has 30,000 slightly crazed participants, more
than 2 million spectators and 40 bands along miles of streets all
over New York City?
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Marathon, of course, with this year's 29th
running Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the race is not just for New Yorkers. About half of the
American participants, from 7,000 to 10,000 men and women, come
from elsewhere in the United States. Another 10,000 are foreign
runners; last year 95 other countries were represented, led by
France, Germany and Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As this mass of humanity spreads along the route, runners see
parts of New York that many natives never see in their lifetimes,
let alone in one day. And runners are cheered on by spectators
sometimes 10 deep along the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in Staten Island, the race goes through Brooklyn,
Queens, into Manhattan, briefly into the Bronx and back into
Manhattan, finishing after 26.2 miles at Tavern on the Green in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the scene at the 10:40 a.m. start has been a wild one. So
many runners throng the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge that many have to
walk the first mile, with times running as long as 10 minutes. On
the plus side: In clear weather from the bridge's mid-point runners
have a spectacular view of the city, one you'll never get from a
tour bus and perhaps not even from an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Each neighborhood has its history and quirks. Staten Island is
New York's forgotten borough and home of a succession movement.
Brooklyn, founded in 1636, was New York's rival until its
annexation 100 years ago. Queens was named for Catherine Brahanza,
King Charles II's queen. The Bronx is home (for now) of the New
York Yankees (an election will decide the fate of a stadium
proposed for Manhattan's West Side). And to reach that finish line
in Manhattan is, as the song goes, ``to be a part of it, New York,
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing is the best part of the marathon. The worst, of
course, is hitting The Wall, too often the fate of runners who get
caught up in pre-race excitement. The best advice for average
runners is go out slow, remain steady and save something for the
end.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of fatigue is usually found in the Bronx around the
20-mile mark. The crowds are sparse; the elite runners have already
finished. It's you and the road, and you have to tough it out
mentally to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Here you might regret having told yourself beforehand, I have to
do three hours or a personal best. Finishing is an accomplishment
in itself.
</P>
<P>
   (I know firsthand. In my first and only marathon, I ran New York
at age 40. My goal was breaking three hours. At the end, I was
happy just to cross the finish line, at three hours 41 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   For your efforts, there's a medal and a long look back at what
you accomplished. And, in passing, a streetwise tour of the five
boroughs. Better than a tourist bus any day.
</P>

PRESIDENT MAKES INDIAN EDUCATION A TOP PRIORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<P>
   On Aug. 6, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13096
concerning American Indian and Alaska Native Education. The
president's initiative targets the serious problems plaguing Indian
schooling _ dropout rates and substance abuse. The first
federal-tribal conference on education under the executive order
opened in Nashville, Tenn., this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiative not only mandates cooperation among
federal agencies and dialogue with tribal leaders, it opens an
essential pathway to the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly half-a-million American Indian students from
kindergarten through high school have the highest dropout rate of
any group in the nation. More than 25 percent of the American
Indian/Alaska Native students who should have graduated in 1992
dropped out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 90 percent of Indian students attend public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 190 tribal schools across this country are in
terrible disrepair. And those public schools, which are built on
tribal lands, have never really addressed the cultural needs of
Indian students.
</P>
<P>
   In the past there has been little cooperation between Head Start
programs serving Indian children and tribal schools, and less
cooperation between public schools on tribal land and tribal
schools. In the hodgepodge of federal, state, and local educational
programs, Indian students often fall between the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Section 1 of Clinton's order sets the goals: ``The federal
government has a special, historic responsibility for the education
of American Indian and Alaska Native students. Improving
educational achievement and academic progress for American Indian
and Alaska Native students is vital to the national goal of
preparing every student for responsible citizenship, continued
learning, and productive employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive order creates a task force and sets deadlines. The
17-member task force represents 15 federal departments and
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Education, the
Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and
the Department Health and Human Services. It will consult with
tribes, the National Congress of American Indians, the National
Indian Education Association and the National Advisory Council on
Indian Education. By August 2000, the task force must have
developed a comprehensive federal Indian education policy.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gover, who has headed the BIA for nearly a year, called
the executive order an initiative to develop a strategy for dealing
with educational problems in several areas _ ``to reduce the
dropout rate and to address some of the social problems that are
facing Indian children, having to do with drug and alcohol abuse
and domestic violence. And a third, that's sort of a
chicken-and-egg proposition _ we want to improve their performance
in science, math and English.''
</P>
<P>
   Gover explained the importance of presidential executive orders:
``What we find in almost any subject area is that there are a
number of agencies that have resources which can be brought to
bear, but only rarely does the federal government coordinate its
efforts so that we combine our resources or unify our approach to
particular problems. An executive order puts the power of the
president behind an effort to do that sort of policy or resource
coordination. That alone often will improve situations even without
the expenditure of new money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president says something is a priority, then all
sorts of doors begin to open. One of the doors we need to really
kick open is in the budget process. We know we've got over a
billion dollars of needed construction in the BIA school system.
And getting the kind of commitment we need at the beginning of the
budget process from the Office of Management and Budget becomes
considerably easier when we are able to say `Indian education is a
presidential priority.' Quite often it has symbolic significance
that translates into real political clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're so pleased that the president would turn his
attention to Indian education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton order pushes other federal agencies to recognize
their responsibilities to the tribes and prods them to make their
resources available. Certainly, the U.S. Department of Education
has a great many more educational resources than the BIA. And now
those resources can be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Melody McCoy, staff attorney for Native American Rights Fund in
Boulder, Colo., says tribal organizations had worked on the
fundamentals of this education initiative since 1994. Their
recommendations were presented to Clinton in March 1997. The
executive order adopted much of their comprehensive policy
statement. ``That's fast, as government action goes,'' said McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal control over Indian education is a pivotal concept in
this initiative, according to McCoy. Public schools on Indian
reservations need to take into account they are on Indian land and
be more attuned to tribal culture, mores and social problems, she
said. The agenda in these schools is not set by Indians and should
be. Educational goals are imposed from outside tribal culture.
McCoy sees the executive order as an important step toward
improving Indian education through Indian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been recognized that students of a distinct minority
culture suffer when thrust into schools which only reflect the
values of the majority culture. For them, success in school
represents a failure of their own community; failure in school,
however, becomes success in the community and preservation of their
culture. Tragically, children in such a situation are often forced
to choose one culture over another.
</P>
<P>
   And lose, whichever path they pick.
</P>
<P>
   This tribal-inspired education initiative was needed a hundred
years ago. It deserves the full support of Congress, federal
agencies and the voters.

WHY AREN'T MORE PARENTS FURIOUS OVER BILL CLINTON'S BAD BEHAVIOR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since January, my wife and I have never watched the TV news
without a mute button within reach. When President Clinton and his
troubles come up around our 7-year-old son, we speak in code. We
closely monitor the headlines, censoring any mention of the squalor
that has become our national life.
</P>
<P>
   And for several months, our efforts seemed to succeed. Clinton's
grand jury testimony, the furor over his address to the nation, the
release of the Starr Report, all came and went with Patrick still
oblivious. Or so we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a recent night, came the question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that Monica Lewinsky?'' Patrick asked when Hillary Clinton
appeared on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   My head swiveled toward him. My heart sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said. ``That's the president's wife. And how do you
know about Monica Lewinsky?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' he said. ``The news is crazy about her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, just who is Monica Lewinsky?'' I asked, trying to assess
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Bill Clinton is sorry about her, or something like that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he returned to his childish business. I have had a more
difficult time going back to mine. Instead, my anger builds, my
sense of violation. What else has Patrick heard about? The dress?
The cigar? I'll admit it: I'm afraid to ask.
</P>
<P>
   My son's question was inevitable, I guess. In this media age, no
parent can insulate children from this pornographic tragedy. So
Bill Clinton and his misdeeds collide head-on with the primal urge
to teach my son, to nurture and protect him. But protect from whom?
The stranger on the street corner? The bully on the playground? Sex
and violence on TV? The president of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   As if raising children in this country weren't hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I wonder now about other parents out there, the extent to which
the mute button has become part of their parenting ritual, the
extent to which they, too, are outraged. Given Clinton's standing
in the polls, I wonder whether I'm alone. I seem to keep losing
arguments to liberal friends, who are surprised that I would
consider chronic lying, under oath and otherwise, an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't talked to my friend Tom in almost a year, so it was
inevitable that our discussion would turn to the president. He is a
highly educated liberal with a keen mind, and once again, as our
argument grew more intense, I found it impossible to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the Starr Report (Tom had read it from cover to
cover) supports impeachment, he said. Clinton lied about sex, but
who wouldn't? FDR cheated. Kennedy cheated. Eisenhower cheated. All
politicians lie. This is no bedtime parable about George Washington
and the cherry tree, but a true-life tale of a typically randy
politician who lied to cover his flanks, de rigueur behavior in an
increasingly venal political world.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, my views sounded positively Victorian, prudish,
intolerant _ traits I've tended to condemn in others. Polling data
clearly supported Tom's view. I was the one out of step, and for a
few minutes, that bothered me. But only for a few minutes. If I'm
uncool, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I try to teach our children to be honest. To admit
their mistakes and learn from them. That actions have consequences.
That laws are important. That our government bodies and the
presidency are institutions to respect, perhaps even aspire to.
That sex is the ultimate expression of love between a man and a
woman who are married.
</P>
<P>
   But at every turn, on every issue, we compete with the words and
deeds of the president, the embodiment of our national mythology.
There once was a time when the president ranked behind only God and
Mom and Dad in the pantheon of American childhood. Now we are
undermined from the same bully pulpit. This just should not be.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps we are not alone in our feelings, after all.
Clinton's behavior, says Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, himself
a Democrat and Clinton friend, ``is as influential as the negative
messages communicated by the entertainment culture.''
</P>
<P>
   `` ... In choosing this path,'' Lieberman said, ``I fear that
the president has undercut the efforts of millions of American
parents, who are naturally trying to instill in our children the
value of honesty. As most any mother and father knows, kids have a
singular ability to detect double standards. So we can safely
assume that it will be that much more difficult to convince our
sons and daughters of the importance of telling the truth when the
most powerful man in the nation evades it.''
</P>
<P>
   So why do so few seem to care?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a great while,'' former Education Secretary William
Bennett writes in his bestselling new book, ``The Death of
Outrage,'' ``a single national event provides insight to where we
are and who we are and what we esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson's acquittal of murder charges in 1995 is one
example. For years, we had been congratulating ourselves on our
progress in race relations. Then came the verdict, and a stunning
demonstration as to the degree that issues of race still divide us.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The current national trauma is another such window. Clinton's
steady approval ratings are attributable to much more than a robust
economy. More importantly, the polls point to a nation that seems
to have lost its way, to a tired, beleaguered society in which
there are fewer and fewer values upon which we can all agree.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman said on the Senate floor last month: ``I am afraid
that the misconduct the president has admitted may be reinforcing
one of the worst messages being delivered by our popular culture,
which is that values are fungible.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Jerry Springer Syndrome. The entertainment culture
has grown more and more base. The average American child will
witness 200,000 acts of violence on television by the time he or
she is 18, according to ``Selling Out America's Children,'' a 1994
book by Minneapolis psychologist David Walsh. As the title of
Bennett's book suggests, we are increasingly incapable of being
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence, this weariness, seems to have crept into the
unlikeliest of places. Recently, I called famed pediatrician Dr. T.
Berry Brazelton, expecting to find a man similarly appalled by
Clinton's betrayal of our families.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brazelton was reticent, and said he is close to Hillary
Clinton, who he said is a wonderful person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to say anything to hurt her, or the things
she's working for,'' Brazelton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief discussion about how to talk to children about the
scandal, he went on to say that oral sex ``isn't as frightening to
them (children) as it is to us. Why pass on our anxiety?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, from Brazelton, this: ``We've allowed this to besmirch a
man who's doing a lot for the country, made more of it than it
really deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few of us out there who would disagree.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   My friend Leslye Rood would be one. Her son, Timmy, is the same
age as my son, Patrick. For most of his life, Leslye and her
husband, Joel, have strived to inculcate in Timmy bedrock values
and a sense of our American past.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time he was 6, Timmy Rood could tell you about George
Washington and the American Revolution, Abraham Lincoln and
abolition of slavery, Franklin D. Roosevelt and World War II. It
was in the past year that he first spoke of a dream of becoming
president himself, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Timmy's own question, asked one night after
his parents hurriedly shut off the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why are people mad at the president?''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, like parents everywhere, Leslye and her husband were
forced to explain infidelity to a boy who was yet to turn 7.
Married people aren't supposed to have girlfriends, Timmy was told
by his parents, and the president had a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, isn't he a daddy, too?'' Timmy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he's a daddy, too,'' his mother told him. ``And that's
another reason why people are upset.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he still married?'' Timmy asked. ``Is he still the girl's
daddy?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was still married. Yes, he was still a daddy. Yes, it is
wrong to lie. Yes, it is confusing.
</P>
<P>
   But Timmy understood, only too well. As of last week, his dreams
were of playing professional soccer, and owning a company to clean
up the environment, but no longer of being president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not in Timmy's realm anymore,'' Leslye told
me. ``And it's not because Timmy thinks it's above him. It's
because he thinks it's below him. When Timmy thinks of doing
something noble and significant with his life, he falls back on
these other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a world where the passion for good and the passion for
goals has been kind of suffocated,'' she said. ``It's like the
oxygen has been removed from the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   But childish disillusionment doesn't seem to count for much when
the economy is booming. Undermining parents doesn't rise to the
level of an impeachable offense. So now we will keep our mute
buttons handy. We will continue to censor the headlines as best we
can. We will wonder where our values have gone. And we will thank
the heavens for Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire.

TRAMMELL CROW'S ASIAN ART COLLECTION TO MAKE UP NEW MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When a guy walks into a room of major Asian artworks
and plops down in the first marble Mughal pagoda available, you
assume he has more than a passing familiarity with the material on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be where Trammell Crow Jr. comes from.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old scion of commercial real estate magnate Trammell
Crow, he grew up with a number of these works _ the snowy white
pagoda for several years was at Millcreek, the Crow family farm
near Mineola, Texas _ and unpretentiously treats them like the old
friends they are.
</P>
<P>
   He pats a granite Indian bull on the head. He points to a pair
of Himalayan gilt-bronze figures and wishes they could be on his
night stand.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Crow clearly is the man in charge of an
ambitious project: a new $5 million museum showcasing the splendid
Asian artworks his parents have acquired during the past three
decades. Admission will be free, and expanded hours are planned to
ensure maximum public convenience.
</P>
<P>
   So here is Crow, asking why a section of gallery wall hasn't
been covered in silk, insisting that a backdrop no one will see is
painted black (just in case) and touting the cutting-edge,
electronic educational aids that will be installed in the new
museum's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Trammell and Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art,
it opens to the public Dec. 5 in a graceful, retrofitted pavilion
that rests at the foot of towering Trammell Crow Center. About 300
of young Crow's old friends will be displayed, including a fabulous
collection of Chinese jade objects, Japanese painted screens,
Indian and Southeast Asian sculptures and, yes, Himalayan
gilt-bronzes. Highlights include an outstanding Tang Dynasty horse,
the world's second-largest flawless crystal ball and a Chinese
scholar's desk furnished with several lovely accouterments for
contemplation and writing.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 200 to 250 items will be rotated periodically onto
display.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's emphasis will be on beautiful and unusual objects.
Crow makes it clear that archaic ax heads, though dear to scholars
and not entirely absent from the collection, hold little appeal for
him and weren't what sparked his father's love.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was born of the senior Crow's desire to diversify
his investments: He, of course, is the Dallas-based founder of a
company that has been the world's largest developer of commercial
properties and currently is the world's largest manager of
commercial properties.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1971, Trammell Crow bought his first piece of carved
Chinese jade. Within three years, his passion for the stuff had
grown to where he bought an entire collection: the aptly named Moss
collection of more than 140 pieces of jade. Today, the Crow
collection of jades, alone, stands at more than 1,200 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Trammell Crow became not only a lover of jade, but a
Sinophile and lover of Asian art and culture in general, his son
says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The various kids kind of caught a collecting bug from Dad over
the years,'' Crow adds, but then says, ``Actually none of us has so
much collected as we've borrowed from my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow and his four siblings first learned of the project almost
two years ago. Their mother and father called them together and,
after everyone milled around for a while, wondering what was up,
said they wanted to use their 3,000 works of Asian art to establish
a museum.
</P>
<P>
   They also appointed Trammell Jr. to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew they were mulling it over,'' he says. ``But it
was probably an easy decision for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, though, carrying out his parents' decision wasn't
that easy.
</P>
<P>
   The project's first expert adviser _ Clarence Shangraw, emeritus
curator for San Francisco's Asian Art Museum _ edited objects for
display from 3,000 to about 550, but wasn't very helpful about
setting up museum administration. Former Dallas Museum of Art
director Rick Brettell came in next, but didn't much further the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jennifer Casler, the Kimbell Art Museum's curator of
Asian art, came on board early, to set up the educational program.
The Dallas Museum of Art, just across the street, lent Crow a
number of exhibition preparatory assistants. And Peggy Booher,
former director of InterCultura _ the now-defunct, Fort Worth-based
exhibitions organization _ came on board as acting director.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Crow and Booher mix joshing with serious talk about what
goes where, the prep staff installs lighting and unpacks objects.
Soon, in a matter of weeks, the rest of North Texas will enjoy what
one remarkable family has enjoyed and is ready to share.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Calcium is fast emerging as the nutrient of the decade, a
substance with such diverse roles in the body that virtually no
major organ system escapes its influence.
</P>
<P>
   As the most abundant mineral in the body, calcium has long been
recognized as vital to the formation and maintenance of strong
bones and teeth. But bones, rather than serving as the final
destination of calcium, are in a sense, just a starting point. They
continuously release the mineral into the system where new research
suggests it may play a central role in controlling blood pressure
and easing premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. In addition, new studies
indicate that unused dietary calcium may help to prevent colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The recent focus on calcium comes at a time when the nation is
becoming increasingly deficient both in the mineral and in vitamin
D, which enables the body to absorb and use it. While the most dire
effects of too little calcium and vitamin D are seen in adults, it
is the country's children who have drawn some the most intense
concern, since this calcium-diminished younger generation is
putting itself at much greater risk for osteoporosis _ the
brittle-bone disease now plaguing many older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic deficiency or imbalance of calcium is what Dr. Susan
Thys-Jacobs, a gynecologist at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital in New
York, believes is largely responsible for the disruptive symptoms
of PMS suffered by as many as 40 percent of women. In fact, Dr.
Thys-Jacobs said in an interview, PMS may be a harbinger of
osteoporosis, a warning that a woman is not consuming or absorbing
enough calcium and, as a result, is constantly losing bone.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the promising results of a pilot study of calcium's
ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms and menstrual pain, Dr.
Thys-Jacobs and colleagues at 11 other medical centers enrolled
nearly 500 women with debilitating PMS in a trial of calcium's
ability to relieve their monthly discomfort. For two months, the
women kept careful track of the occurrence and severity of 17
symptoms grouped under four categories: mood swings, bloating, food
cravings and pain. Then they were randomly assigned to take either
1,200 milligrams of calcium daily (as calcium carbonate in Tums
E-X) or a look-alike placebo. The women continued on their assigned
regimens and evaluated their symptoms for the next three menstrual
cycles.
</P>
<P>
   By the third cycle, Dr. Thys-Jacobs and her collaborators
reported in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the
overall severity of symptoms was reduced by 48 percent in the
calcium group, compared to 30 percent in the placebo group.
Improvement in the calcium group exceeded that of the placebo group
in every category of symptoms studied, both psychological and
physical, and in 15 of the 17 symptoms evaluated. Most
dramatically, subjects in the calcium group noted a 54 percent
reduction in aches and pains, while the placebo group experienced a
15 percent increase in pain symptoms. The study was financed by a
grant from SmithKline Beecham, makers of Tums.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thys-Jacobs concluded that women with PMS might have a form
of ``functional hypocalcemia'' _ calcium levels in their blood and
urine are normal, but only because parathyroid hormone levels are
abnormally high and the hormone is continually extracting calcium
from their bones to replenish the blood's supply. She suggested
that all women with PMS be assessed for deficiencies of calcium and
vitamin D, as indicated by their blood levels of parathyroid
hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. She pointed out that ``80 percent
of a person's vitamin D is made in the skin when exposed to
sunlight, but a lot of young women are now avoiding the sun and
using sunscreens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their vitamin D levels are very low,'' Dr. Thys-Jacobs ``and
therefore they're not absorbing enough calcium from their diet even
if they consume enough, which most young women do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies in people and animals have linked high-fat diets to
colon cancer and shown that fatty acids and the bile acids released
to process them are irritants that stimulate abnormal cell
proliferation in the colon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Lipkin of the Strang Cancer Research Laboratory at
Rockefeller University in New York described studies in the 1980s
showing that calcium could bind tightly to these irritants and
inhibit their ability to stimulate cell proliferation. With calcium
present, as it would be on a calcium-rich diet, the cells
differentiate and mature like normal epithelial cells. Lipkin and
his colleagues showed that calcium supplements could inhibit
colonic cell proliferation in people known to be susceptible to
colon cancer. This finding gained support from population studies,
most of which found a link between consumption of milk and other
calcium-rich dairy products and a reduced risk of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, directed by Dr. Peter Holt of St.
Lukes/Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City and published two
weeks ago in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
showed that calcium-rich foods worked as well or better than
previously thought. When the participants' consumption of low-fat,
calcium-rich dairy products was doubled, reaching 1,200 milligrams
of calcium a day, cell growth in the colon became normal. The 70
participants had undergone surgery earlier to remove benign polyps,
which are common forerunners of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin, a co-author of the new study, said that animal research
indicated that increasing calcium levels to protect epithelial
cells might also help prevent cancer in such organs as the breast,
prostate and pancreas. Raising the animals' intake of calcium and
vitamin D reduced excessive cell proliferation and induced normal
development of epithelial cells in these various organs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of studies since the early 1980s have also implicated
calcium as a potentially important contributor to normal blood
pressure, especially the calcium found in dairy products. The
findings suggest that a low intake of calcium-rich dairy products
may partly account for the high rates of hypertension among
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of calcium might also contribute to the rise in blood
pressure that commonly accompanies aging in this country. Even if
calcium intake is adequate, which it usually is not, most older
people are deficient in the active form of vitamin D needed to
absorb calcium properly.
</P>
<P>
   While the American Heart Association's latest assessment of the
relationship between high blood pressure and dietary minerals
strongly emphasized sodium chloride (i.e. salt) as the prime
offender, it also noted that the harmful effects of a high-salt
diet were most common among people whose diets are low in calcium.
Though he was a co-author of the association's statement, which was
published recently in the journal Circulation, Dr. David McCarron,
a hypertension specialist at Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland, champions the view that calcium-rich milk products are
more effective than a low-sodium diet in curbing hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McCarron's view won major support from the surprising
results of the large, federally financed DASH trial (for Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension). That study found that a diet rich
in low fat dairy products, fruits and vegetables dramatically
lowered blood pressure in adults with high-normal blood pressure or
mild hypertension, even though participants lost no weight and
continued to consume ample amounts of salt. What is more, the blood
pressure benefits were noted within two weeks of starting the diet.
</P>
<P>
   The DASH diet contains up to 1,200 milligrams of calcium,
whereas study participants who continued on their regular diets got
only about 450 milligrams of calcium. Nearly half of Americans
consume less than 450 milligrams of calcium a day, ``and it's
getting worse,'' McCarron said.

   Calcium is fast emerging as the nutrient of the decade, a
substance with such diverse roles in the body that virtually no
major organ system escapes its influence.
</P>
<P>
   As the most abundant mineral in the body, calcium has long been
recognized as vital to the formation and maintenance of strong
bones and teeth. But bones, rather than serving as the final

continuously release the mineral into the system where new research

</P>
<P>
   The recent focus on calcium comes at a time when the nation is
becoming increasingly deficient both in the mineral and in vitamin
D, which enables the body to absorb and use it. While the most dire
effects of too little calcium and vitamin D are seen in adults, it
is the country's children who have drawn some of the most intense
concern, because this calcium-diminished younger generation is
putting itself at much greater risk for osteoporosis _ the
brittle-bone disease now plaguing many older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The new research has come in a flurry. Just in the last two
months, a New York research group reported that eating more
calcium-rich foods reduced the risk of colon cancer in men prone to
the disease, and another New York-based team described a 50 percent
reduction in life-disrupting premenstrual symptoms among hundreds
of women who took daily calcium supplements.
</P>
<P>
   In August, findings reported by Boston researchers supported
earlier evidence that calcium was important in controlling high
blood pressure. The researchers found that blood pressure fell in
women with mild hypertension after brief exposures of their skin to
ultraviolet-B radiation, which stimulates the production of vitamin
D.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, published in the British Medical Journal in
August, researchers in Argentina showed that women who were given
calcium supplements during pregnancy had children whose blood
pressure remained lower than average for at least the first seven
years of life, which would lower their risk of later developing
hypertension. And in the current issue of The American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition, a research team at the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles reported that adding calcium to the diet
lowered blood pressure in 116 black teen-agers who normally
consumed little of the mineral.
</P>
<P>
   The new work builds on a well-established body of research
pointing to calcium's complex role in the body. Through the years,
scientists have demonstrated that calcium is required for myriad
body functions:
</P>
<P>
   _Transmission of nerve impulses that control muscle
contractions.
</P>
<P>
   _Release of chemicals that carry messages between nerves.
</P>
<P>
   _Binding together of cells to form organs.
</P>
<P>
   _Production and activity of enzymes and hormones that regulate
digestion, fat metabolism, energy release and saliva production.
</P>
<P>
   _Clotting of the blood to initiate wound healing.
</P>
<P>
   _Secretion of hormones and other substances from glands
throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   _Chemical signaling within cells.
</P>
<P>
   _Growth and maturation of lining cells throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that calcium plays so many roles,'' said
Dr. Hector DeLuca, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin who
is an expert on vitamin D and calcium metabolism. ``Since all life
originated in the sea in a bath containing calcium, we all
developed systems that depend on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once animals emerged from the sea, leaving behind a steady
supply of calcium, the body had to evolve a system for keeping
calcium ``at sea level'' in the blood, DeLuca said. The result was
the evolution of a calcium storage tank _ the bones _ for the body
to draw on from minute to minute when blood levels of this
essential mineral drop too low, as well as a mechanism to establish
and replenish the body's calcium from outside sources _ the diet.
This mechanism involves vitamin D. In its activated form as a
hormone, vitamin D enables calcium to enter the blood through the
intestinal wall and be incorporated into bone.
</P>
<P>
   But if the body does not receive enough dietary calcium to
maintain the needed blood level, parathyroid hormone leaps to the
rescue. Its job is to signal the release of calcium from the bones
to restore a normal blood level of this life-sustaining mineral. If
the diet is chronically deficient in calcium (or vitamin D), as it
is for as many as three-fourths of Americans, the bones gradually
get weaker and weaker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PMS, Then Bone Disease? &LR;

   A chronic deficiency or imbalance of calcium is what Dr. Susan

hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. She pointed out that ``80 percent
of a person's vitamin D is made in the skin when exposed to
sunlight, but a lot of young women are now avoiding the sun and
using sunscreens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their vitamin D levels are very low,'' Dr. Thys-Jacobs ``and
therefore they're not absorbing enough calcium from their diet even
if they consume enough, which most young women do not.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preventing Cancer? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tissues throughout the body are lined with epithelial cells like
the ones that form the outer layer of skin. They grow, mature,
slough off and are replaced by new ones. In the lining of the
colon, where cancers arise, the turnover of epithelial cells
normally takes a week. But in people prone to colon cancer, these
cells fail to grow and mature normally and instead immature cells
proliferate rapidly. Studies in people and animals have linked high
fat diets to colon cancer and shown that fatty acids and the bile
acids released to process them are irritants that stimulate
abnormal cell proliferation in the colon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Lipkin of the Strang Cancer Research Laboratory at
Rockefeller University in New York described studies showing that
calcium could bind tightly to these irritants and inhibit their
ability to stimulate cell proliferation. With calcium present, as
it would be on a calcium-rich diet, the cells differentiate and
mature like normal epithelial cells.
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin and his colleagues showed that calcium supplements could
inhibit colonic cell proliferation in people susceptible to colon
cancer. This finding gained support from population studies that
found a link between consumption of dairy products and a reduced
risk of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, directed by Dr. Peter Holt of St.
Luke's-Roosevelt and published two weeks ago in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, showed that calcium-rich foods worked
as well or better than previously thought. When participants'
consumption of low-fat, calcium-rich dairy products was doubled,
reaching 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day, cell growth in the
colon became normal. The 70 participants had undergone surgery
earlier to remove benign polyps, common forerunners of colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin, a co-author of the new study, said that animal research
indicated that increasing calcium levels to protect epithelial
cells might also help prevent cancer in such organs as the breast,
prostate and pancreas. Raising the animals' intake of calcium and
vitamin D reduced excessive cell proliferation and induced normal
development of epithelial cells in these various organs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Regulating Blood Pressure &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A person's blood pressure is influenced by many factors,
including genetics, body weight, physical activity and, in some
cases, salt intake. But dozens of studies since the early 1980s
have also implicated calcium as a potentially important contributor
to normal blood pressure, especially the calcium found in dairy
products. The findings suggest that a low intake of calcium-rich
dairy products may partly account for the high rates of
hypertension among African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of calcium might also contribute to the rise in blood
pressure that commonly accompanies aging. Even if calcium intake is
adequate, which it usually is not, most older people are deficient
in the active form of vitamin D needed to absorb calcium.
</P>
<P>
   While the American Heart Association's latest assessment of the
relationship between high blood pressure and dietary minerals
strongly emphasized sodium chloride (i.e. salt) as the prime
offender, it also noted that the harmful effects of a high-salt
diet were most common among people whose diets are low in calcium.
Though he was a co-author of the association's statement, which was
published recently in the journal Circulation, Dr. David McCarron,
a hypertension specialist at Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland, champions the view that calcium-rich milk products are
more effective than a low-sodium diet in curbing hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McCarron's view won major support from the surprising
results of the large, federally financed DASH (Dietary Approaches
to Stop Hypertension) trial. That study found that a diet rich in
low fat dairy products, fruits and vegetables significantly lowered
pressure in adults with high-normal pressure or mild hypertension,
although participants lost no weight and continued to consume ample
amounts of salt. Also, the blood pressure benefits were noted
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The DASH diet contains up to 1,200 milligrams of calcium;
participants who continued on their regular diets got only about
450 milligrams of calcium. Nearly half of Americans consume less
than 450 milligrams of calcium a day, ``and it's getting worse,''
McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   His main concern now is the ``seriously deficient'' diet
consumed by a very large proportion of American children. Children,
he said, are drinking soda and juices, not milk, and they rarely
come close to eating the recommended five servings a day of fruits
and vegetables. He believes parents and schools are setting
children up for a lifetime of ill health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcium is a lot more than simply bone health,'' McCarron
concluded. ``It may even influence behavior,'' he said, citing a
space shuttle study in which rats bred to become hypertensive were
``frantic'' on a low-calcium diet, but when fed more calcium,
``they relaxed and enjoyed the space flight.''

HALLOWEEN GOBBLIN': SCARE UP SOME ALTERNATIVES TO SUGAR-LADEN
CANDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Halloween means candy, candy and more candy. As a parent, this
may well concern you.
</P>
<P>
   Are the 22 grams of sugar in a bag of Skittles any better than
the 27 grams in 1/4 cup of M&AMP;Ms? Should the 4 grams of saturated
fat in two Reese's Peanut Butter Cups make alarm bells go off in
your head?
</P>
<P>
   Experts at the American Heart Association recommend keeping
total fat intake for children older than 2 to no more than 30
percent of calories each day. But Georgia Kostas, nutrition guru at
the Cooper Clinic in Dallas for 19 1/2 years, has a simpler answer:
Don't worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. At times like Halloween, Kostas says, it's easier
to just count calories than to do the math on fat, sugar and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Kostas' real-world advice for Halloween treat-fearing parents:
Make sure that no more than 10 percent of your kids' daily total
calories are from sweets (an average kid consumes 1,500 calories a
day). Spread out the loot over the weeks that follow the holiday,
instead of letting your offspring binge right into a sugar high.
</P>
<P>
   Here are nine nutritious (OK, somewhat nutritious) treats you
can hand out this year _ four to make, and five you can grab at the
grocery store.
</P>

<P>
   TO MAKE
</P>
<P>
   This first recipe is not exactly the stuff of health diets, but
``at least you're getting the apple underneath,'' says Georgia
Kostas.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIED APPLES
</P>
<P>
   10-15 medium apples
</P>
<P>
   3 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   15 cloves
</P>
<P>
   1-2 teaspoons red food coloring
</P>
<P>
   Push wooden craft sticks into the stem end of clean apples. Set
aside. Combine sugar, cream of tartar, water, lemon juice and
cloves in heavy saucepan. Stir over heat until sugar dissolves. Add
coloring. Boil, without stirring, to hard crack stage. Remove from
heat; skim out cloves. Twist apples in syrup quickly. Place, upside
down, on buttered cookie sheet or foil.
</P>
<P>
   Optional: Dust half of each apple opposite skewered end with
chopped nuts.

VIAGRA AND THE OLDER WOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Viagra, which has revved up the sex lives of many men, may have
another down side, this one among the female partners of the men
taking it.
</P>
<P>
   More and more older women are suffering from frequent, urgent,
burning urination _ usually found among women half their age and
sometimes called honeymoon cystitis, say three doctors who noticed
the condition among their patients in Covington, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The condition has been especially prevalent in women 55 to 75,
said the doctors in a letter published in a recent issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   When the doctors went to their charts, they found the common
bond: ``Every one of their husbands had been treated with Viagra,''
said Dr. Henry M. Patton, one of the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The urinary condition often occurs after prolonged sexual
activity and allows bacteria from the genitals to creep into the
urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   Vaginal dryness, common among some postmenopausal women, can
encourage cystitis.
</P>
<P>
   To stave off the condition, Patton suggests that his patients
drink extra liquids and urinate before and after sex. If that
doesn't work, he added, antibiotics will.

THE UGLY HANDWRITING AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CORNELIA DEAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody knows it, but now researchers in Wales have proved it:
Doctors have rotten handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the Department of Public Health in
Swansea, studied 92 men and women at the health authority
headquarters, an accident and emergency department at one hospital,
and other departments at another hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They grouped the respondents into three classes: doctors, nurses
and other medical professionals, and administrative staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were asked to provide handwriting samples,
including their names, the alphabet and numbers from 0 to 9. They
were told the samples would be used to evaluate software for
scanning handwriting. Instead, it was used to see how many samples
were legible.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses and other professionals had the clearest writing,
followed closely by the administrators. Doctors lagged far behind,
with almost twice as many illegible characters as those from the
other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were slightly older than the nurses and
administrators, but the age difference did not explain the
discrepancy, the researchers said. The doctors were all equally
illegible, regardless of age or sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study suggests that doctors, even when asked to be as
neat as possible, produce handwriting that is worse than that of
other professions,'' said the report in a recent issue of The
British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   There was one bright spot: all three groups wrote numbers
clearly, which the researchers attributed to the necessity of
writing drug dosages clearly. That finding shows that doctors can
learn to write legibly. Maybe they just need to try harder.

   As NASA marks the 40th anniversary of its founding on Oct. 1,
1958, aspects of the occasion are more archeological than
astronautical. So it sometimes seems on the back roads and in the
weeds along the shore of Cape Canaveral, Fla., where the ruins
evoke memories of all those rockets in the early morning and the
eerie twilight after the cheering stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Sand blows over the artifacts of the golden age of American
space flight. Wild hogs root around the edges of derelict launching
pads. Steel beams that once braced Moon-bound ships lie rusting in
a field called the ``bone yard.'' Some scenes, where flowers and
weeds cover concrete fencing and bunkers, bear a haunting
resemblance to forlorn battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   This was a major battleground in a war, the Cold War between the
Soviet Union and the United States. Congress gave birth to NASA in
response to Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite. Three
years later, NASA was challenged to beat Russia to the moon. Thus
began the Apollo Project, the golden age of space flight.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins of Canaveral can be read in two ways. As monuments of
inspired mobilization, they represent a progression of
technological steps leading to the moon, the early artifacts
abandoned like so many stone tools made obsolete by bronze and
iron. Some future archeologist might marvel at how rapidly the
space-age toolmakers progressed.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruins also are a stark reminder that NASA's best days
are behind it. The agency was a victim of its own success: This
prodigy of the Cold War promised us the moon, and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has had other successes, but its most celebrated mission in
a long time will be a nostalgic moment, not a giant leap for
mankind. The next space shuttle flight, scheduled for launching on
Oct. 29, will be about the past. John Glenn, 77, will be returning
to orbit, where in 1962 he brought respectability and hope to the
fledgling space program as the first American to orbit Earth.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's long-awaited next step into the future is supposed to
occur in November or December, with the first launching of
components for the International Space Station. But the Russians,
adversaries become allies, are having trouble paying for their
share of the project. A space station lacks the urgency and appeal
of the moon goal of old. And workers have painted ``Abandon in
Place'' on the mammoth concrete artifacts of the first space age.

ENTHUSIASM OF DOCTOR CAN GIVE PILL EXTRA KICK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Though some people respond more strongly to placebos than others
do, it seems that everyone responds at some time or other. And
doctors seem to play a large role in the degree of that response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that trumps everything is the enthusiastic
physician,'' said Dr. Dan Molerman of the University of Michigan.
For example, one study offered the same drug to patients with
identical symptoms, with one difference.
</P>
<P>
   Some were told by their physicians, ``This drug has been shown
to work,'' while others were told, ``I am not sure if this
treatment will work _ let's just try it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first group of patients did much better, Molerman said.
``The physician is an agent for optimism and hope and a great
inducer of beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians can even fool themselves. Years ago, researchers
carried out controlled studies of a drug for angina or heart pain
and found it was no better than a placebo, Molerman said. Once
doctors knew that, its effectiveness fell.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors and patients affect one another's expectations,
both are swept up into a wider context of culture and biology, said
Dr. David Morris, an adjunct professor of medicine at the
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The brain circuits through
which placebos act, he said, are activated through the experience
of living in a particular culture.
</P>
<P>
   To explore the importance of cultural context, Molerman, in an
analysis forthcoming in the journal Medical Anthropology Quarterly,
compared 122 double-blind placebo-controlled ulcer studies from all
over the world. Doctors used the same techniques, the same drugs
and the same placebo pills and studied an image of the stomach
lining before and after treatment to see what worked.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs worked 75 percent to 80 percent of the time, Molerman
said, whereas the placebos worked from zero to 100 percent of the
time, depending on the country. The placebo healing rate for ulcers
in Germany was 60 percent, almost double the world average of 36
percent, which is about where the United States fell. But in
Brazil, the mean placebo healing rate was a startling 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have hint of what is going on here,'' Molerman said.
``I can only say that cultural differences affect ulcer treatments,
even though ulcers are the same the world over.''

HIGH CHLAMYDIA RATES FOUND IN TEEN-AGERS

<P>
   The sexually transmitted disease chlamydia has become so common
among teen-age girls in some parts of the United States that
doctors have begun to recommend that sexually active girls be
tested for the disease twice a year, instead of once a year, as
called for by current medical guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how rich or poor you are, or where you
live,'' said Dr. Penny Hitchcock, chief of the Sexually Transmitted
Diseases Branch of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases. Just being a sexually active teen-ager, she said, is the
the greatest risk factor for contracting chlamydia.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that
four million cases of chlamydial infection occur in the United
States each year, making it the most common treatable sexually
transmitted disease. The infection and its complications cost the
nation $2.4 billion a year. Researchers said that incidence of the
disease did not appear to be rising, but that increased testing has
revealed disturbingly high rates of infection.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is a
leading cause of female infertility and of life-threatening
complications of pregnancy. Some researchers think that untreated
chlamydia may also cause damage beyond the reproductive system. The
bacteria can make their way into joints, and a team of researchers
led by Dr. Charles Henry, an oral surgeon at Boston University,
recently suggested that Chlamydia trachomatis may play a role in
the painful jaw condition, temporomandibular joint syndrome, or
TMJ.
</P>
<P>
   In its early stages, chlamydia causes no symptoms in 75 percent
of women, who may go untreated, allowing the infection to linger
and ascend the reproductive tract, where it leaves scars. Half of
men also remain symptom-free, which helps chlamydia spread since
people can be infected without knowing it, and pass the bacteria
along to one sexual partner after another. Chlamydia can also
infect the throat and be transmitted during oral sex, Dr. Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Testing for chlamydia is easier than it used to be. In the past,
women needed a pelvic examination, but now just a urine sample is
sufficient. If the result is positive, antibiotics can cure the
infection, and, if given early, prevent complications. But it is
not clear how early is early enough, Hitchcock said. In some cases,
the bacteria move into the reproductive tract within a week.
</P>
<P>
   The call for twice-a-year testing, by researchers at Johns
Hopkins University, is based in part on their study of 3,202 girls
ages 12 to 19 in Baltimore who went to clinics for birth control,
pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. The highest rate of
infection, 27.5 percent, occurred in 14-year-olds, but older girls
also had high rates, near 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the girls in the study were black city dwellers, but the
researchers said that other studies showed chlamydia to be a
serious problem in whites and other teen-agers as well, with
infection rates over 10 percent even in rural areas and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially worrisome was the finding that among the girls who
tested positive and were treated, more than half became infected
again within six to seven months. The finding helped convince
researchers that twice-a-year testing was essential, said Dr.
Charlotte Gaydos, an author of the study, which was published in
August in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said that testing twice a year was ``a good place to
start,'' but added, ``I don't know if it's enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the National Center for HIV,
Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis Prevention at the
CDC, said that for now, the national recommendations would not be
changed. She said that once a year was still reasonable and testing
more often would waste money. But she said that regions with high
rates could set their own policies on testing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Beilenson, Baltimore's health commissioner, said that
one reason the infection rate was so high among the youngest girls
was that they were much less likely than older girls to use
condoms. He said that many were pressured into having sex by older
men in circumstances that amounted to statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock warned that condoms might not be the solution.
Scientists do not know why, but condoms do not work as well against
chlamydia as they do against other sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A second study by Dr. Gaydos and her colleagues, published in
September in The New England Journal of Medicine, also found high
rates of chlamydia in 13,204 young female military recruits. The
highest rate in any age group, 12.2 percent, occurred in
17-year-olds. The overall rate was 9.2 percent, but women from five
Southern states _ South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and
Mississippi _ had rates of more than 15 percent. Women from
Washington and Oregon had lower rates, below 5 percent, a
difference that Dr. Gaydos attributed to more effective screening
and treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues noted that neither of their studies
included men or boys, who must also be treated to help break the
cycle of infection. But screening programs focus on women and
girls, because the consequences of infection are known to be severe
for them. Less is known about complications in boys, but Hitchcock
says it is possible that a lingering case of chlamydia may also
interfere with their fertility later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading teen-agers to be tested for chlamydia is not always
easy, Dr. Gaydos said, particularly if they have no symptoms and
fear their parents' discovering what they have been up to.
Hitchcock said home testing kits like those used to test for
pregnancy were being developed, and might help solve that problem.

ROME GLORY IS NOW TUNISIA'S  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Romans named it Africa. Not the continent, just one small
corner of it jutting into the Mediterranean, the country we know
today as Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   This ancient name merely hints at Tunisia's importance to the
Roman Empire; proof of it can be seen in the country's many
imposing, and often well-preserved Roman sites.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 100 miles from Sicily (and now just an hour's flight
from Rome), Tunisia was a granary of the empire, its agricultural
riches _ olives, grapes and grains _ underwriting many elaborate
construction projects throughout Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   The country's sun-drenched landscape is a mix of crowded souks,
richly carved mosques, Berber villages, desert expanses, seaside
fortresses and whitewashed resort hotels. Everywhere there are
remnants of Rome: villas, temples, baths, theaters, aqueducts and
arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Roman ruins are in northern Tunisia, a few hours'
drive from Tunis, the capital. Carthage, Dougga, El Jem and Sbeitla
were among the sites my husband, Richard, my daughter, Patricia,
and I visited on a 10-day trip last December.
</P>
<P>
   Though the roads are well maintained, we asked a Pennsylvania
tour company to make arrangements for a car, driver and guide to
make the sightseeing easier. Our well-informed Tunisian guide,
Nejib Ben Lazreg, was also an archeologist. Aside from the
occasional small tour group (usually German), we generally had the
ruins to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tunis, where we began our trip, is a clean, modern city, fairly
Westernized and user-friendly. For an introduction to the Roman
sites that were on our itinerary, we visited the Bardo, Tunisia's
national museum, which has a staggering wealth of Roman mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   We spent several hours viewing huge panels, including one
depicting Neptune surrounded by octopus, scorpion fish and all
sorts of easily identifiable sea creatures. Though most of the
exhibits were Roman, some rooms had archaic terra-cotta votive
offerings from Carthage, a site we were especially curious about.
</P>
<P>
   This fabled kingdom of Dido and Aeneas, of Hannibal and his
intrepid elephants _ so vividly imagined in Flaubert's ``Salammbo''
_ was the maritime power that Rome finally destroyed in the third
Punic War in 146 B.C. Was there really nothing left of Carthage, as
the guidebooks had suggested?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Scipio and his conquering legions did an extremely
thorough job of destroying Carthage before the Romans started to
build their own monuments during a period of 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we saw what was left of Carthage, which is now a
high-rent suburb of Tunis. Lavish contemporary villas, including
the president's palace, surround several sprawling archeological
digs.
</P>
<P>
   Some columns, bits of pavement, carvings, tombs, funerary
monuments and terra cotta statues, plus the outlines of the
ingenious circular Punic harbor _ which sheltered the fleet and had
an interesting central dry-dock area _ are about all that are left
of pre-Roman Carthage (814 to 146 B.C.). These meager remains are
overshadowed by the majesty of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Caesar began rebuilding Carthage on the Roman model when he
arrived in 46 B.C. after routing his rival Pompey's armies. Seeing
the vast Antonine baths started by Hadrian in 116 and completed by
Antonius Pius in 162, we began to grasp the scope of the public
works.
</P>
<P>
   The huge baths, the fourth largest in the Roman Empire and the
largest outside Rome itself, are spread over nine acres running to
the edge of the sea, a piece of real estate that any modern spa
builder would envy. They are reached through an alley of tumbled
stone remains in the Parc Archeologique des Thermes.
</P>
<P>
   A single immense granite column, one of eight that originally
supported the roof, has been re-erected on a concrete plinth, and
it soars nearly 60 feet to the top of its huge Corinthian capital,
providing visitors with some idea of the original height of the
vaulting.
</P>
<P>
   But what there is left to see of the imperial baths is at the
basement level, where wood for the furnaces to heat the water was
stored and where the water was channeled from aqueducts and
cisterns to fill the pools.
</P>
<P>
   Signs and diagrams guided us from the viewing terrace through
the maze of pillars and vaults in the complex, which was divided
into separate wings for men and women, with gymnasiums, dressing
rooms, steam rooms, and warm and cold pools, including one of
Olympic proportions. It must have been a fabulously restorative
place after an evening of heavy banqueting.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby La Marsa, one of several small Mediterranean towns
west of Carthage, we stopped for lunch at a seafood restaurant
called Le Golfe. With its 800-mile coastline, Tunisia is a paradise
for seafood lovers _ as the Roman mosaic in the Bardo Museum aptly
suggested _ and though couscous is also ubiquitous, the food is
generally more diverse and spicier than the cuisine in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   At Le Golfe we ordered langoustines; those irresistable briks,
the pastry turnovers filled with potato and egg, or this time, with
shrimp and egg; a grilled vegetable salad called mechouia; and
grilled daurade, accompanied by crisp white wine. On this sunny,
somewhat chilly December day we decided against a table on the
terrace overlooking the Mediterranean, and sat in the whitewashed
dining room.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins of Roman Carthage are so scattered that it is
difficult to imagine the city's dimensions and details. But
imagining a city _ in this case, a Roman one _ is not difficult at
Dougga, known as Thugga in Roman times, a site that covers a high
wind-swept plateau less than two hours' drive southwest of Tunis.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 200 Roman cities that were established in the
northern half of Tunisia, Dougga is the most complete. Just enough
sensitive restoration suggests the extent of the city. The parking
lot leads directly to the partly restored theater, built in 168,
which could hold up to 4,000 spectators in semicircular rows of
limestone seats banked into the hillside. We tried the acoustics
and discovered that a stage whisper could be heard clearly in the
cheap seats on top.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A paved Roman road runs from the theater through the central
square. Several temples are clustered around the forum, including
the Capitoline temple, a well-preserved monument featuring a
handsome portico of Corinthian columns that was dedicated to
Jupiter, Juno and Minerva.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling along the road we explored the remains of a market,
the third-century triumphal arch of Alexander Severus, several
series of barrel-vaulted cisterns from which water flowed by
gravity, as well as some outlying temples.
</P>
<P>
   Dougga had three public baths, all to the south, down the
hillside from the forum. The Baths of Licinius, or Winter Baths,
which we reached by a staircase from the original entrance, are the
most impressive, but the Cyclops Baths, so named for the mosaic
that can now be seen in the Bardo Museum, are notable for the
communal latrines. What's left of a number of houses can also be
seen in this district.
</P>
<P>
   At the very edge of the city is the splendid Mausoleum of
Ateban, a Punic monument built in 202 B.C. Its three stories are
covered with carved reliefs and topped with a pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   From Dougga we drove another 40 minutes to Bulla Regia. Many
tour operators and guidebooks suggest that this site, less than 30
miles from the Algerian border and famous for its two-story villas,
is too long for a day trip from Tunis. But since we were on the
road by 8 a.m., we had ample time to visit Dougga and Bulla Regia
and return to Tunis by 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There was also time for a pleasantly fortifying lunch of chorba,
a spicy tomato and lamb soup thickened with barley; roast chicken;
and a dessert of baklava, fresh clementines and dates in the dining
room of the small Hotel Simuthu in Jendouba near Bulla Regia. It
was not the only time a delicious bowl of chorba anchored the
lunchtime break.
</P>
<P>
   Bulla Regia is only about two miles off the main highway. Like
most Roman sites it has a small museum of artifacts, including
sarcophagi and other items found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The dig meanders through a scrubby landscape on the opposite
side of the road, and at first glance seems to be mainly rubble
with some vestiges of temples, baths, a forum and several early
Christian basilicas. That's because much of what there is to see is
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Bulla Regia was one of the richest cities in Roman Africa, the
home of grain and olive oil merchants who built two-story
subterranean villas that would be cool in summer and warm in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, each has a central courtyard reached by one or more
staircases and surrounded by a series of arched underground rooms.
There are only vestiges of the upper rooms at ground level.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the mosaics that once decorated these houses are
now in the Bardo Museum, some remain, and they include finely
detailed and well-preserved hunting scenes, as well as portraits of
noble women.
</P>
<P>
   One depicts the sea full of fish in the House of Fishing,
another is a maritime scene of Venus and Neptune in the House of
Amphitrite. The high windows at the lower level allowed for maximum
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south and nearer the coast, El Jem (also known as Al
Jam) is worth a visit for its astonishing amphitheater, said to be
the third largest in the Roman world. The riches of the olive oil
trade, the oil used in ancient Rome for lamps as well as for
cooking, account for its grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   El Jem was a stop on our five-day driving tour of the southern
part of the country, heading along the coast before going inland to
desert areas. Though still surrounded by endless miles of olive
groves (Tunisia is one of the world's largest producers of olive
oil), El Jem, at the edge of a dusty small town with the same name,
appears to be in the middle of nowhere. It was formerly Thysdrus, a
city of 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The amphitheater, in better shape than the Roman Colosseum and
considered more advanced in its engineering, is now used for a
summer music and theater festival. But in Roman times, this third
century arena, an oval nearly 500 feet long that could hold 30,000
spectators on many tiers of seats, is thought to have been used for
more bloodthirsty events, involving not only gladiatorial combat to
the death but also throwing prisoners and slaves to the lions.
</P>
<P>
   We climbed to the upper levels of the amphitheater and wandered
through the underground passages and vaults, where animals and
prisoners were kept.
</P>
<P>
   Souvenir stands and stores selling crafts and antiques fill the
plaza around the amphitheater, and small shops sell good Tunisian
sandwiches of sausages or tuna and harissa, a spicy condiment.
There is an archeological museum, with a collection featuring
mainly statuary and coins, a short drive away.
</P>
<P>
   We continued to follow the trail of olive oil. By the late third
century, the power of Thysdrus was supplanted by Sufetula, a
settlement founded in the first century A.D. and also made
prosperous by olive oil. Its ruins, crisscrossed by a grid of paved
streets, now lie on the outskirts of the city of Sbeitla. This is
the prettiest Roman site, built of rich golden-hued stone and
nicely maintained with flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   The decumanus, the main thoroughfare, crosses the forum with its
trio of beautiful temples. The largest one, dedicated to Jupiter,
is flanked by porticoed sanctuaries to Juno and Minerva, a
departure from the usual practice where a single temple in the
forum celebrates all three gods.
</P>
<P>
   Baths, an amphitheater, a theater, cisterns, fountains, an oil
press and two triumphal arches enrich the site. Here, near the
temples, are three early Christian basilicas, the Churches of
Vitalis, Bellator and Servus, converted from Roman buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Now only the outlines of the buildings remain, with a few
columns, mosaics and finely carved baptistries; one of white marble
resembled an unfolding flower. As at the other sites, basic
explanations are provided by excellent signs and diagrams in
French, English and Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the night in a nearby clean but drab hotel that is
notable only for its view of the sunset over the ruins. The
restaurant was adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sbeitla was briefly the capital of Tunisia in the seventh
century, it fell to Arab invaders in 647. The center of power moved
north to Kairouan, the fourth holiest Moslem city after Mecca,
Medina and Jerusalem, where a forest of columns harvested from
Roman sites supports the arches of the courtyard and the sanctuary
of the main mosque.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Kairouan for several hours on our way back to
Tunis, a route that is dotted with a number of other Roman sites.
For a short distance, it runs alongside the towering arches of an
aqueduct that once extended more than 60 miles and supplied water
for those grand Antonine baths at Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   The aqueduct pointed us back in the direction of Carthage and
Tunis. In Tunisia, all roads lead there. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best times to visit Tunisia are spring and fall. Our trip
was in December, the rainiest season, especially in coastal areas.
We had some wet afternoons and evenings, but never a steady
downpour. Temperatures ranged from the mid-60s to the low 70s,
dropping to the high 40s to low 50s at night.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is charged at most Roman sites, usually $2 to $4, with
$1 extra for taking photos.
</P>
<P>
   There are no nonstop flights between New York and Tunis, though
Tunisair is supposed to begin this service before the end of the
year. A round-trip fare between New York and Tunis with good
connections can range from $800 to $1,500; the best connections are
on Lufthansa (through Frankfurt) and Alitalia (through Rome).
Round-trip air fare between Rome and Tunis, the shortest flight
from a major European city (50 minutes), ranges from $260 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Some travel companies based in the United States can arrange
complete custom itineraries in Tunisia. We were pleased with Tunis
USA, 155 East Lancaster Avenue, Wayne, Pa., 19087; (800) 474-5500.
</P>
<P>
   Archeological Tours, 271 Madison Avenue, Suite 904, New York,
N.Y. 10016, (212) 986-3054, offers one Tunisian itinerary each year
for a group of about 20 people with an archeologist as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   For information, contact the Tunisia Tourist Office, 1515
Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20005; (202) 466-2546,
fax (202) 466-2553, on the Web: www.tunisiaonline.com. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting Around
</P>
<P>
   In general, visitors can expect to pay $150 to $250 a day or
about $750 a week for a car and driver. Hotel concierges may be
able to arrange for English-speaking drivers or guides. A compact
car without air-conditioning can be rented from Hertz, Avis or
Europcar for about $100 a day, or $500 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these agencies will also rent cars with drivers. It is a
good idea to be sure that luggage will not be exposed. The roads
are generally good, except in the desert, and well-marked with
signposts in French and Arabic. It is best not to drive after dark.
</P>
<P>
   In general, safety did not seem to be a problem. But it is
necessary to be careful of pickpockets, especially in Tunis. Though
there are some persistent shopkeepers, visitors are rarely hassled
in the medinas. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   There are comfortable, fairly modern but charmless hotels in the
main cities. Hotels carry government ratings in stars, but what is
a five-star hotel in Tunisia would probably be considered four-star
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Tunis, the well-situated Africa Meridien, 50 Avenue Habib
Bourguiba, (216-1) 347-477, is about $130 a night for a double. It
has air-conditioning and a pool.
</P>
<P>
   The International, 49 Avenue Habib Bourguiba, (216-1) 331-144,
is nearby, with doubles starting at $100 including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Most coastal cities like Hammamet and Sousse have good resorts,
some new, very comfortable and with big pools and health clubs.
They often arrange day trips to Roman sights with multilingual
guides.
</P>
<P>
   But inland, where many of the Roman sites are, lodging choices
narrow considerably. In Sbeitla, the Sufetula, opposite the ruins,
(216-7) 465-074, was clean but drab, and cost $40 a night for a
double, including breakfast. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   Tunis is a big, cosmopolitan city offering many dining options.
In the Medina, Dar el Jeld, 5 Rue Dar el Jeld, telephone (216-1)
560-916, is in an elegant converted palace with Tunisian
specialties. Dinner for two costs around $60, with wine. A
three-course tourist menu with couscous is $14 a person.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dining experience in a palatial though somewhat less
romantic setting but with slightly better food, can be had at
Essaraya, 6 Rue Ben Mahmoud, (216-1) 563-091, where dinner for two
will cost about $60 including wine.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern city, we enjoyed Le Carthage, 10 Rue Ali Bach
Hamba, (216-1) 255-614, where excellent fresh fish and a Berber
specialty, lamb cooked in a clay pot, are served. Dinner for two
with wine: about $40.
</P>
<P>
   In La Marsa, Le Golfe, 5 Rue Larbi Zarrouk, (216-1) 748-219, is
a pretty seaside place with delicious fresh fish. Dinner for two
with wine averages $50.
</P>
<P>
   For mint tea or Turkish coffee and pastries, there are two
famous cafes, M'Rabet, Souk el-Trouk, (216-1) 263-681, in the
Medina in Tunis, and the Cafe des Nattes, on the main square in
Sidi Bou Said. Near Bulla Regia, we had a nice prix-fixe lunch ($9)
at the Hotel Simuthu in Jendouba, (216-8) 634-043.

POWERFUL, PASSIONATE OPRAH BRINGS MORRISON'S CHALLENGING NOVEL TO
SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's probably a ridiculous thing to say, but in person,
Oprah Winfrey is just like, well, Oprah Winfrey. Meeting actors,
one generally has to get past the fact that they're nothing like
the characters they play _ it IS called acting, after all _ and in
fact, not much like their talk-show personas either. But most
Americans who own televisions have spent some time with Winfrey,
whose combination of iron will and sensitivity has made her the
center of daytime media culture, if not the most powerful woman in
the United States. She's so much like the Oprah we see on her show
that you have to wonder if there's a private Oprah somewhere, who
sits back a remove, judging all the people who charge at her
familiarity and chatter away like old friends.
</P>
<P>
   She's not playful with her power either _ no one else could get
a major studio to finance ``Beloved,'' the story of a former slave
whose life is turned around by a woman who may be the ghost of her
dead infant daughter. ``Beloved,'' director Jonathan Demme's first
drama since ``Philadelphia,'' is probably the biggest-budgeted
black art film in the history of the medium, adapted from a novel
that daunts even the most attentive reader. (Toni Morrison's morose
and dissociative work is not the kind of material that regularly
delights the giant book club that Winfrey has created).
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' is Winfrey's first starring role in a feature film,
and the first theatrical release she has appeared in since her
debut in 1985's ``The Color Purple,'' in which she appeared with
her ``Beloved'' leading man Danny Glover. Winfrey is the first to
admit that she's asking a lot of audiences to suspend disbelief _
to ignore her Oprahness _ and give in to the movie. ``Frankly,''
she says, ``I'm a little worried, not because of that _ I think
that people will accept me _ but because it's a unique movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And casting herself in the lead role of a movie made from a
novel by an African-American Nobel Prize winner is getting the
full-on media spotlight, with Winfey appearing on the covers of
Time and Vogue _ probably the first time that's happened since ...
well, at least since Madonna decided to release her midlife-crisis
electronica album. In an upcoming issue of Vanity Fair, Winfrey is
featured in a story about the three most powerful women in media _
the other two being Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing oppressive or heavy-handed about her in this
conversation. None of that New Age determination to teach the world
to sing in perfect harmony that has recently manifested itself on
her show comes up as she settles onto a sofa at the ruthlessly posh
Mansion on Turtle Creek. Instead, after a few moments of digressive
chat about talk shows _ and how none of the people who are getting
talk shows these days has any realization of how difficult doing
one is _ she allows that she doesn't watch much television at all.

   ``Because I want to have a life,'' she says, simply. ``If you
want to have time to see your friends and read after work _ and we
do 200 shows a year _ then you don't have time for television. The
only one I pay any attention to is Rosie (O'Donnell). I like her.
We almost got into business with her, but it wasn't something I was
ready for at the time. I take my time deciding about what I'm going
to do, which is why it took me so long to be in another movie.''
Winfrey's dramatic appearances have been through her TV
productions, which include the miniseries ``The Women of Brewster
Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to one of those people who got a (talk) show,''
she says, pondering the chatfest glut, ``and you can't even have a
conversation with this person. So why would anybody in their right
mind give this person a talk show? It's surprising to me how little
most of the people who make decisions about TV know about it. I
think it's because they don't go out and talk to people. So they
don't have any sense of what people want to see. It's what I do all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like when you see all these polls about the American people
having forgiven President Clinton. That's not what I was hearing
from the people who came to the show. That's why we did a show
about (that topic), and gave folks a chance to say what they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's mentioned that the audience seemed to circle Clinton
like a lynch mob, she responds, ``Really? Is that what you think? I
thought they were just getting something off their chest. Yeah. I
do believe that people are more sophisticated than the media thinks
they are. But they were also mad, and that never came up
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey doesn't harangue, but her mastery of conversational
technique is subtle and acute _ you're never aware of any cunning.
Rather, you note that she regards the conversationalist with her
strictest concentration. She admits that ``Beloved'' is a tough
sell, because ``even I had a hard time getting through it. I kept
getting stuck on those first eight pages. I told Toni it was hard
to get through, that I had to work and she said, `It's called
reading, dear,''' Winfrey says, and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew she didn't think I could do the part. `Oprah's so
emotional, and Sethe (Winfrey's character) is not. I'm just not
sure.' But she saw it and was surprised, and I said, `It's called
acting, dear,''' Winfrey says, savoring the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary piece of work. And I thought (the book)
had more of a foreign-movie feel. So at first I was thinking of
maybe Peter Weir, or Jane Campion, because of what I thought they
could bring to it. But after I talked to Jonathan (Demme), I
realized that he had the right ideas for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, didn't she find ``The Piano'' kinda goofy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, you mean with that piano on the beach stuff?'' she says,
sheepishly. ``Yeah, I guess I did. But I wanted `Beloved' to be
treated as art, and that meant finding a director who can work as
an artist and has an artist's understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   She agrees that ``Beloved'' is a fuller vision of a world than
``The Color Purple,'' with its peculiar fear of sex. ``Frankly, I
was just happy to be in a movie, and learn from all those amazing
people _ Steven (Spielberg), Whoopi (Goldberg), Quincy (Jones).''
When Spielberg's reticence is mentioned, she nods in agreement.
``Yeah, (the movie's) got its problems. But what bothers is me is
... look at all those movies _ `Boyz 'N the Hood,' `Menace 2
Society' _ that are about kids killing kids, abusing women, that
get treated like art. But people jumped all over `Color Purple'
because they thought it was attacking black men. They missed the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it got really interesting,'' Winfrey continues, frowning.
``I got to the Oscars''_ Winfrey got a Best Supporting Actress
nomination _ ``and there's the NAACP, out there protesting the
movie, carrying (protest signs) talking about all the harm it did
to the image of black men. Then, when we didn't win any awards and
I'm leaving, they're protesting because the movie got shut out and
that the Academy is racist. I guess they must've had other signs
ready, just in case. How do they work so fast?''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey undoubtedly gave a lot of thought to the way the
material should be handled, and agrees there was an American
condescension to Morrison's work, not acknowledging its spiritual
connections to Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the like. ``It's true,''
she notes, ``people dismissed Toni's stuff as folklore, when it
really is like the Southern version of magic realism. If you grew
up in the South, you know those kinds of ghost stories and the kind
of spell they can weave.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's writing is built on that Southern African-American
mysticism. So does Winfrey worry that the adaptation, with its
words like ``haints'' (the Southern term for ghosts) will leave the
mainstream white audience puzzled?
</P>
<P>
   ``That could very well be,'' she says, ``and not just because of
that. I mean, in some of the test screening, people would come out
and say, `This isn't a slave story. It's about a mother and her
daughter.' People have expectations about what to expect in movies
about slaves, and this is so much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tough sell. That's why I'm trying to keep them very
specific in the marketing. It's important we give a sense of the
movie, and not give it all away. It is definitely a movie that made
me work hard, and will require that the audience works hard, too.''

STRAP PACKS  
(JT)

   By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ The most surprising accessory seen so far on the
spring runways is the reinvented fanny pack. The trend started in
New York with Helmut Lang, who slung a holster-style bag around
models' waists and attached it to the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   A raft of variations have been seen here.
</P>
<P>
   In Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's D&AMP;G show, the models wore zippered pockets
in clear plastic on their belts. At Prada, bags rode in back on a
belt around the waist or hips while a tiny purse was strapped
around one model's arm. Missoni showed bags on belts around the
hips, and Trussardi had double bags on the back of belts. Tiny
purses circled the wrist at Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Bottega Veneta had several versions, including a fold-over bag
on a belt that can be converted to a shoulder bag, a holster that
goes around the shoulder and across the body, and a sizable flat
bag to wear around the hips like an apron.

   BOSNIA-REFUGEES _ SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Sevdije Gashi
left Kosovo a few days after her village was attacked and her home
burned down by Yugoslav forces. Though the timing is never good for
war refugees, it was particularly bad for this mother of three. She
was about to have another baby. ``She was born on the bus to
Bosnia,'' Gashi said, shyly showing off her gurgling three-week old
daughter. ``My mother-in-law had just been arrested by the Serbian
Police. We had to leave.'' Now Gashi's family of six lives in an
abandoned Coca-Cola bottling plant here, eating, sleeping and
crying together on the 10-by-10-foot square of floor that has
become their home. More than 1,000 other refugees live in the same
factory, with no running water, no heat, and no idea what their
future holds as NATO officials debate air strikes to end the
conflict in Kosovo and winter looms in Sarajevo. (Nesmith, Cox News
Service). With photos. If NATO forces attack targets in Kosovo,
CoxNet will produce a page of background and feature stories.

   SOCIAL-SECURITY _ WASHINGTON _ Mayor Roxanne Qualls of
Cincinnati, a Democratic candidate for Congress, stirred
controversy by greeting President Clinton when he came to town to
raise money. Now she's trying to steer her campaign toward
friendlier territory. Like many of her fellow Democrats across the
country, she is pressing the issue of Social Security. The
president, too, has joined the effort with daily jibes at
Republicans. For Social Security recipients, always uneasy to have
the program in the crossfire, it's politics as usual this fall.
(Malone, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   GORE13 _ WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ Vice President Al Gore, filling
in for a president tied down by the last-minute flailings of a
Congress eager to get on the campaign trail, plans a two-stop visit
in South Florida, flying in to Palm Beach International at 10 a.m.
Tuesday. He will address a Unity brunch in Palm Beach and then make
some Everglades statement at the tarmac before he flies out of PBIA
around 1 p.m. (Staletovitch, West Palm Beach)
</P>
<P>
   CANCERDRUG _ The wave of the future in cancer drugs _
genetically-engineered chemicals that target the buliding blocks of
spreading cells _ is officially here. Amid hype and speculation,
the California company that developed Herceptin, the first of these
drugs for breast cancer, has worked around the clock to begin
shipping it to doctors this week, nearly three months ahead of
schedule and less than two weeks after the drug received FDA
approval. We talk to some of the first Texas women to have tried
Herceptin, which could be a wonder drug for many women who haven't
beaten breast cancer with conventional treatments. (Park, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   UT-NOBEL-PRIZE _ Ferid Murad, a researcher at the University of
Texas Health Science Center in Houston, will share the Nobel Prize
for Medicine with scientists at the State University of New York at
Brooklyn and UCLA. They separately discovered and elucidated the
way nitric oxide (normally considered a contributor to air
pollution) relaxes and widens blood vessels -- a phenom that has
proven useful in the treatment of heart disease and shock but whose
best known exploitation is in the wildly popular anti- impotence
drug Viagra. Not to be confused with the dentist favorite nitrous
oxide, or laughing gas, a different chemical. (Stanley, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN _ Some of them are here and indications are the crowds
could or could not reach expectations for the last words from Nancy
Fowler. A stigmatic expert from Boliviar plans to visit Fowler at
the farm. What do Catholics think about all this? (Scott, Anderson,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18. WITH PHOTOS.

   The Washington Monument has been closed to the public until
December to erect scaffolding so that workers can inspect, repoint
and clean its marble skin. At the same time, the red lights that
warn aircraft away from the 555-foot obelisk will be resealed and
its eight observation windows will be reglazed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big job, since 36,000 stones will have to be dealt with.
The National Park Service hopes to complete the work in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The monument will be reopened when the scaffolding is completed.
Visitors will pass through a 280-foot covered walkway to the
entrance. The walkway will run through a safety zone established by
a fence that will circle the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, which was completed in 1884, was closed from
January to May this year so that its heating, ventilating and
air-conditioning systems and its elevator could be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   The scaffolding will be wrapped in a fabric designed by the
architect Michael Graves, which will be illustrated in a way to
suggest the stone-and-mortar pattern of the tower but will be
sufficiently transparent to allow people to watch the restoration
work.

   Britannia's Gangplank Lowers for the People
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, world leaders like Nelson Mandela, Tony Blair
and Mahatma Gandhi have been entertained aboard the Britannia, the
luxurious vessel used by Queen Elizabeth and her family around the
world. On Wednesday, the 412-foot yacht, which has recently been
refurbished, will be opened to the public for tours at the port of
Leith, two miles from the center of Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia, launched on April 16, 1953, was decommissioned
last Dec. 11. Technically a Royal Navy ship, the yacht has sailed
more than a million miles.
</P>
<P>
   Budgetary constraints have much to do with the Britannia's new
role as a tourist attraction. British taxpayers spent $160 million
maintaining the yacht over the last 10 years, and a major refit
would have prolonged her life for only a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors reach the ship through a visitor center designed by Sir
Terence Conran. Its centerpiece will be the yacht's 41-foot tender
floating in a pool. Britannia's original wheelhouse will also be
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board, visitors will be guided around Britannia's five
decks by an audio tour. The bridge, the state dining room, drawing
room and the Royal Apartments _ as they were when occupied by the
royal family, with white walls, bronze metalwork and dark mahogany
woodwork _ will be viewed through door-sized glass panels. The
engine room, the captain's cabin and the galleys are also on the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia will be open daily except Christmas. A shuttle bus
will run from Princes Street and from Waverley Station in
Edinburgh. Tickets will be about $10, and must be booked in
advance.

   Michelin Offers Guide to 3 Northeast States
</P>
<P>
   Michelin has just published its first green guide for New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The 376-page tourist guide discusses
such sights as the Adirondacks, Niagara Falls, the Hudson River
Valley, New York City, Atlantic City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and
Lancaster County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Maps, photographs and illustrations accompany various sections
of the guide along with historical notations, touring tips and
information about shopping, parks, beaches and other recreational
opportunities. Attractions are rated by stars, ranging from one to
three, to indicate degrees of importance: interesting, worth a
detour and worth the trip. Cape May, N.J., for example, gets a
three-star rating, as do Lancaster County in Pennsylvania and the
American Museum of Natural History in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is available at bookstores and map stores at a
suggested price of $20.

   Greyhound Is Adding More Buses With Lifts
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound Lines has announced a plan that it says a year from
now will allow the disabled to catch a lift-equipped bus at any of
its 4,000 stops nationwide, provided the traveler calls 48 hours
ahead. To do this, it will raise to 80, from 26, the number of
lift-equipped buses in its fleet of 2,100.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Greyhound, the country's biggest
long-distance bus company, was made just before the federal
Department of Transportation presented its rule for bus
accessibility under the Americans With Disabilities Act on Sept.
24.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater announced that a
deadline of 2012 had been set for all big companies that operate on
schedules _ as Greyhound does _ to have their entire fleets
lift-equipped. The department praised Greyhound's step, but said
the new rule went far beyond that. In any case, the rule requires
48-hour call-ahead service until all equipment is lift-equipped.

   In San Jose, a New Home for the Cutting Edge
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever had an urge to design a roller coaster or have a
3-D map of your head made by a rotating laser scanner, the new
permanent home of the Tech Museum of Innovation, which opens in San
Jose, Calif., on Oct. 31, may be the place for you.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight years since it was founded, the Tech has been a
showcase for the kinds of gizmos that make Silicon Valley famous.
The focus on cutting-edge technology will continue at its new
132,000-square-foot building, a vivid mango-colored box topped by a
deep blue dome. Nearly 300 hands-on exhibits will be divided among
four theme galleries _ devoted to exploration, communications,
human health and performance, and innovation in the Silicon Valley.
Some exhibits _ including one allowing visitors to perform
simulated heart surgery using instruments that enter a life-size
mannequin _ have never appeared in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   The building will also house a learning center, laboratories, a
gallery for changing exhibits, a gift shop and cafe, and an IMAX
theater with reclining seats to view the eight-story concave screen
in the dome. The theater will open on Nov. 3 with the film
``Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tech Museum, on Plaza de Cesar Chavez, is at the corner of
Market Street and Park Avenue in downtown San Jose. Admission to
either the theater or the galleries is $8, $7 for those older than
65, $6 ages 3 to 12. A combination ticket is $13.50, $12.50 for
seniors and $10 for children. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed
Monday. Information: (408) 795-6100, or at www.thetech.org.

THE 1998 BLOOPIE AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We begin the award of this year's coveted Bloopie Awards _ for
outstandingly sloppy solecisms in advertising copy _ by holding our
noses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let snoring come between you and a good night's sleep,''
says an ad for Breathe Right Nasal Strips in Smart Source. (That
Sunday supplement styles itself SmartSource, but I like to put a
space between whole words, especially when the second word is
capitalized. The name of this column will never be OnLanguage.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Try them for a week,'' urges the snoring copywriter, ``so your
bed partner can learn to breathe through their nose, instead of
their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal pronoun  &UR; their &LR; , like  &UR; them &LR; , is plural, referring
to more than one person. In this case, the writer wanted to refer
to either one or the other of the bed partners, not both. That
meant choosing the singular  &UR; his &LR;  or  &UR; her &LR; . But the writer was in a
bind: he or she could not choose either  &UR; his &LR;  or  &UR; her &LR;  because he
or she could not specify whether the male or the female was doing
the snoring; the product is designed for either one.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Drop the  &UR; your &LR;  and make it all plural _ ``so bed
partners can learn to breathe through their noses, instead of their
mouths.'' This is an improvement but not a perfect way out because
the sales pitch is aimed at only one of the bed mates: the
bleary-eyed partner kept awake by the other's nasal vibrations. (I
will now leave this award because I can hear the reader falling
asleep, noisily.)
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up in the ``their's no their their'' category is IBM,
among whose solutions for a small planet is this headline: ``You
can't begin to help a client until you've walked a mile in their
shoes.'' The writer did not want to say  &UR; his &LR;  shoes, which would
infuriate female customers, or to stretch his copy to  &UR; his or her &LR; 
shoes. The fix: Make  &UR; client &LR;  plural. The ad continues: ``Improving
the quality of education in our schools is the most important
challenge IBM has ever tackled.'' Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with that entry, IBM took a full page to ask, ``Can
You Really Buy a Computer That Makes Someone Feel Differently About
Their Job?'' Howard Pelzner of Miami notes IBM's  &UR; their &LR;  problem (a
virus loose, perhaps) and adds, ``It should be  &UR; different &LR; , the
adjective, not  &UR; differently &LR; , the adverb.''
</P>
<P>
   This suggests the  &UR; bad/badly &LR;  differentiation: ``To feel bad''
is to be depressed, while ``to feel badly'' means to have a
numbness in the fingers. A purist would extend that feeling to
 &UR; different/differently &LR; : To feel different is to be a stranger in a
strange land, while to feel differently is to receive sensation
from antennae rather than fingers. But you won't find that fine
distinction made by most, and certainly not on a computer's grammar
checker.
</P>
<P>
   The Spelling Bloopie goes to the Orvis catalog for inadvertently
restraining newly married women who tend to take the bits in their
mouths. ``Beautifully made bridal leathers'' are advertised as
going into its brown ``Bridal trim belt'' for waist sizes 30 to 44.
Sorry, but Flirtation Walk is no bridle path.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bridal &LR; , an adjective, refers to a woman being married, who
gets a bridal shower and gets to throw the bridal bouquet and spend
a night in the bridal suite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bridle &LR; , a noun derived from the Old English  &UR; bregden &LR; , ``to
move quickly,'' has to do with the leather headgear used to control
a horse. When the bridle is yanked, it causes the animal to bridle
_ the verb's meaning has been extended to ``to show hostility at an
affront.'' When a newly married woman takes offense and rips off
her veil to holler at the groom, we can witness a scene of bridal
bridling.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Mastercard _ more living, less limits'' is the slogan of
the bankers' credit combine, and it is more or less bankrupt
grammar. ``Shouldn't this read  &UR; fewer &LR;  limits?'' writes Andrew
Goldberg, a shoofly copywriter in New York. ``The less/fewer
problem is getting worse by the hour!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Less &LR;  describes quantity;  &UR; fewer &LR;  deals with number. Years ago,
Safeway was given a Bloopie for its sign at a checkout counter that
read ``Ten Items or Less,'' and lo! Ever since, I've gone zinging
through with my nine items past a sign that correctly says ``Ten
Items or Fewer.'' The elitist media strike again.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes a picture of the actress Susan Sarandon, in an ad for
the American Museum of Natural History, asking, ``What part do each
of us play?'' Writes the Bloopie nominator Maxine Skopov of
Orangeburg, N.Y.: ``Shouldn't that read `What part  &UR; does &LR;  each of
us play?' Could so many proofreaders, editors, printers have missed
what virtually leaped out at me?''
</P>
<P>
   The part played by each of that phalanx of editors does not
guarantee correct usage. Remember the famous 1940s radio line ``the
Shadow knows''? A black comedian liked to use Black English in
spoofing it: ``Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The
Shadow do.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the literary set? The Ivy League Bloopie goes to
Princeton University Press for advertising ``Disarming Strangers,''
by Leon V. Sigal, as ``an inside look at how the Korean nuclear
crisis originated, escalated and was ultimately diffused.'' Mark
Thompson of Time magazine notes, ``If they can't tell the
difference between  &UR; diffuse &LR;  and  &UR; defuse &LR;  at Princeton, what's the
hope for the rest of us?''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Krauthammer, the only pundit trained as a psychiatrist,
wrote an article in The Weekly Standard about President Clinton's
self-absorption aptly headlined ``The Solipsist-in-Chief.'' That
reminded me that I had, in a recent polemical harangue, knocked
some politicians who made merely grammatical mistakes as
 &UR; solipsistic solons &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wardlow of Cornelius, N.C., led the charge of the
Gotcha! Gang: `` &UR; Solipsism &LR;  is the theory that the self is the only
thing really existent while  &UR; solecism &LR;  is a violation of
grammatical rules. It seems to me that your mistaken solons are
 &UR; solecistic &LR;  rather than  &UR; solipsistic &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   O Solecism Mio. I earned a Bloopie of my own.

`NOVA' TAKES ON EL NINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll remember El Ni &LR; n &LR; o, the big bad weather machine that
turned much of the California coast into muck and misery last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes ``Nova'' (Tuesday on PBS) with its scientific look,
with satellites and instrumentation, at what causes El Ni &LR; n &LR; o.
</P>
<P>
   Science's answer: Hey, darned if we know.
</P>
<P>
   It seems science is sharp on the symptoms of El Ni &LR; n &LR; o _ the
trade winds reverse direction and blow west to east, pushing a huge
volume of heated water toward South America _ but not the
underlying cause.
</P>
<P>
   The open question is, what makes the Pacific ripe for a change
in trade winds every three to seven years? And does mankind
influence the frequency?
</P>
<P>
   The impact is plain enough. The 1997-98 version of El Ni &LR; n &LR; o
left about 250,000 people homeless, killed about 300, played
immense havoc on property, made the 49ers lose to the Green Bay
Packers and, for all we know, forced Bill Clinton to fib to Paula
Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains and flooding struck North and South America, as
usual. Drought hit India, southern Africa, Australia and Indonesia.
Winter was uncommonly mild in much of North America. There was a
sparse hurricane season in the Atlantic, where high winds blew
apart developing storms.
</P>
<P>
   Straightforward and comprehensible, ``Nova'' delivers the El
Ni &LR; n &LR; o basics and reminds us that the phenomenon has probably been
around for several million years.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, ancient Peruvians tried human sacrifices to soften
El Ni &LR; n &LR; o's punch. No point in reviving that; it doesn't seem to
have worked.
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd thing about documentaries, though. Sometimes what
you carry away from it isn't the nut of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it's the Ka'imimoana, a ship that crisscrosses the South
Pacific to service an array of buoys that measure changes in the
open water.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the year at sea in the balmy Pacific, benefiting
mankind and probably not exactly balled up with stress.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure, but I think I want that job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And here's why. I love postseason baseball, but I'm annoyed by
the razor commercials that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette is advertising its new Mach 3 shaver, which has three
blades. A shaving simulation shows you how the first blade gets
most of the whisker, the second blade leaves a bit of stubble and
the third blade polishes off that pesky follicle.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But when Gillette introduced its two-bladed Trac II in
1971, the company ran similar commercials. Back then, the simulated
second blade sliced off all the stubble left over from the first
blade.
</P>
<P>
   So, what gives? Was Gillette fudging its commercials then, or
now?
</P>
<P>
   I phoned a Gillette public relations guy in Boston and argued
politely for a bit. He insisted that both commercials were accurate
representations. I'm puzzling over how that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Um, maybe you can understand now why a sea cruise might be in
order.

NO GAIN IN BACKWARD EXERCISE EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By LIZ NEPORENT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Monday night at the New York Sports Club on Wall
Street, a woman was turned around on the stair climber and stepping
backward. Nearby, several exercisers were striding on elliptical
motion trainers, switching the direction of their leg movements
from forward to reverse and back again every couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both activities are common in gyms across the country and
evidence of a growing trend: backward exercising.
</P>
<P>
   Though backward running here and abroad has always attracted a
fun-loving but small following, including participants in an annual
backward mile run in New York's Central Park on April Fool's Day,
exercising in reverse has now shifted into high gear because of the
popularity of machines like elliptical trainers, stair climbers and
Spinning bikes that allow exercisers to move backward and forward.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased popularity of the reverse workout, fitness
experts question whether exercising backward is safe and effective
or just another fitness fad. Many suspect that it is the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask someone why they're exercising backwards and they'll
usually tell you they're trying to tone their butt and the backs of
their legs,'' said Ben Gelfand, a physical therapist and author of
``Return to Glory Days'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997), a primer on
athletic injuries. But computer analysis indicates that the
quadriceps, muscles in the front of the thigh, are doing most of
the work during backward stair climbing, walking and running, while
the buttocks and the hamstrings in back of the thigh muscles are
virtually idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also not great for the lower back because your posture
and body alignment are thrown out of whack,'' Gelfand said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a better, safer way to tone the buttocks would be to go
to the weight room and do strengthening exercises like lunges and
leg presses, which target that area.
</P>
<P>
   And, while a 1995 Texas Tech University study found that walking
backward at a 16-minute-a-mile pace elicited higher heart rates and
burned more calories than regular jogging at a faster pace, Edmund
Burke, director of the exercise science program of the University
of Colorado in Colorado Springs, warns that it is not a practical
way to get in shape or lose weight. ``Since you don't have eyes in
back of your head it's an awkward way to move,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   As for elliptical motion trainers, which require the legs to
move in an elongated circle, the manufacturers do not push the
backward motion feature. ``Though they probably won't cause any
more injuries than forward movement, there's also no proof that
it's beneficial,'' said Graham Melstrand, a sales representative
for the Reebok CCS Body Trek and Body Peak elliptical motion
trainers. Melstrand explained that the option to stride backward on
the Reebok machines is a byproduct of the belt drive mechanism
design rather than something engineered intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Retro-cycling, pedaling backward on an exercise bicycle, may
even be dangerous. ``We don't recommend it because of the injury
potential,'' said John Baudhuin, president and chief executive of
Mad Dogg Athletics, the company that trains and certifies aerobic
instructors to teach the popular indoor cycling program, Spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Baudhuin said Spinning bikes have toe clips that act like ski
bindings to keep the feet firmly anchored in the pedals, but they
only work when pedaling forward. Backpedaling increases the risk of
the feet disengaging and the pedal crank hitting the shins. Mad
Dogg was so alarmed by the number of bloodied and bruised ankles
caused in this manner that they released statements warning
instructors to stop the practice. ``We told them that backward
pedaling was unsafe and should not be included as part of the
Spinning curriculum,'' Baudhuin said.

IN `ANTZ,' FEMALES SHOULD BE WEARING THE PANTZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(mk) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen has played many implausible characters in his
career: a human sperm, a failed writer, an aging nebbish who
remains irresistibly attractive to gorgeous Barnard students. Yet
none is as preposterous as the one that he assumes, by voice and
persona, in the new and critically acclaimed animated feature,
``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen plays Z, a whiny, disgruntled worker ant who digs dirt and
falls in love with Bala, a whiny, disgruntled princess ant played
by Sharon Stone. Z's best friend is Weaver, a hypertrophic soldier
ant, played by that he-man's he-haw man, Sylvester Stallone.
Weaver's boss, and Bala's fiance, is the tyrannical General
Mandible, who has the voice of Gene Hackman and the eternal jaw of
George C. ``Patton'' Scott. General Mandible barks to his soldiers,
``Men, let's move it!'' and ``Gentlemen, now you can see how
dangerous individualism is!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' is a cute movie. It is a visually dazzling movie. It
has some amusing, ant-appropriate lines in it, like when Z
complains to his therapist about having been neglected by his
parents; but what else can you expect, he sighs, when you are ``the
middle child in a family of 5 million?'' Nevertheless, any viewer
who knows about ants cannot help but feel disgruntled, a case of
rantz in the pantz.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the movie's ad line: ``Every ant has HIS day''
(emphasis added). If there is any group of creatures in the animal
kingdom for which that possessive pronoun is inappropriate and
unjust, it is ants. You might as well say ``Every nun has his day''
or ``Every mythical one-breasted Amazon warrior has his day.''
Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University, a leading authority on
ants, estimates that a million billion ants are alive in the world
today. The sum biomass of ants, he says, weighs four times as much
as birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals combined.
</P>
<P>
   And that staggering ant biomass is almost exclusively female. If
you could examine each of the earth's million billion ants, you
would almost surely fail to find an example of a Woody Worker or a
Sly Soldier. You would not find a male ant that digs dirt, cuts
leaves, lugs sandwich crumbs back to the nest, or takes on invading
termites, as General Mandible's troops do with unmistakably
androgenic roars.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, nearly every task that is performed in an ant colony is
performed by females. They build the nest, they defend the nest,
they tend the larvae to insure a continuous supply of female labor.
Male ants almost do not exist. In the average colony, they account
for less than one percent of the population, and those that exist
live very brief lives.
</P>
<P>
   So what do these rare specimens do? To get an idea, think back
to Allen's literally seminal role in ``Everything You Wanted to
Know About Sex.'' Male ants subsist solely to inseminate the queen
during her so-called nuptial flight, when she flies out of her nest
in search of sperm. The males are there to greet her, and she mates
with one or more, storing their contributions internally to use as
needed. ``Males are really just bags of sperm,'' said Kenneth Ross,
an entomologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. They are
non-refillable bags, alas, and they do not store well. ``With
almost no exception, males die immediately after mating,'' said
Ross. ``If they haven't mated by the time winter comes, they are
cannibalized by the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The same principle of female dominance applies to the other
famously social insects, the honeybees. In their case, scientists
have given the males a wonderfully evocative name, drones. Honeybee
drones do not work, and they do not overwinter.
</P>
<P>
   Among ants and bees, the overwhelming majority of the females
are sterile. They do not breed, but instead live to serve the queen
and the tribe, each in her specialized fashion. Colonies of ants
and bees have been called superorganisms because the individuals
act with such a high degree of coordination and interdependence
that they might as well be cells of the body. Behind that
willingness to sacrifice self for the whole is an unusually high
degree of genetic relatedness. For most animals, including humans,
siblings share about 50 percent of their genes. Among ants and
bees, by contrast, the sister workers in a colony are, on average,
75 percent related to each other, the result of a complex system of
genetic inheritance given the appropriately thick name of
haplodiploidy.
</P>
<P>
   That shared legacy encourages each worker to behave as though
the ants to each side of her are practically as valuable as she is.
And that state of group-think in turn helps explain why ants are,
as Wilson has written, ``the dominant little-sized organisms of the
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch for the males is that they do not share and fare
alike. Male ants (and bees) have only half the number of
chromosomes seen in the females. As a result, they are much less
closely related to their female peers than the workers are to each
other. A male cannot depend on the unshakable bonds of close
kinship to save his chitin. His hope rests in the queen's nuptial
flight, when she emerges to gather semen. His hope is that she
chooses him and his. So maybe a male ant does have his day _ but
that day will be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Note to Z: Stop whining, keep digging and dress in drag.

THE LEONIDS: A VIEWER'S GUIDE

<P>
   Unfortunately for residents of the United States, the Leonid
storm on Nov. 17 is expected to begin at 2:43 p.m. Eastern standard
time and is likely to last for only an hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, therefore, the entire show will be during
daylight hours and will be invisible, unless unusually bright
bolides, or exploding fireballs, flash through the sky.
</P>
<P>
   People in East Asia, however, will have ringside seats, and if
skies are clear, they are likely to witness a great meteor display
under ideal conditions: a dark, moonless night.
</P>
<P>
   Although some forecasters predict that there will be an even
better Leonid storm the next November _ actually, the second
installment of this year's storm _ it will be visible only from
Europe and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm next month may include some especially bright
fireballs, said Joe Rao, a lecturer at New York's Hayden
Planetarium, in an article in the November issue of Sky &AMP; Telescope
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some meteor enthusiasts and astronomers plan to travel to Asia
this year and to Europe in 1999 to see the events. The next chance
of a really spectacular Leonid show anywhere on Earth will not come
for another century.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States will not be the best vantage point
for Leonid watching on Nov. 17, people willing to get up a few
hours before dawn on that day and the next may see more meteorites
than they would on a normal night.
</P>
<P>
   The closest approach the Earth will make to the center of the
meteoroid swarm is 790,500 miles _ more than three times the
distance of the Moon from the Earth, but many dust fragments are
likely to stray into collisions with the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., who tracks space objects of various kinds,
cautioned that spectators in the United States should not expect
too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think the Leonid storm this year will be as good
as the one in 1966, which was the best one this century, but we
think the 1998 shower will be more modest _ perhaps something
between 200 and 5,000 meteors per hour,'' Yeomans said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, sky watchers clocked a rate of up to 100,000 meteors an
hour at the peak of the Leonid storm.
</P>
<P>
   For meteor fans, Rao recommends watching the darkest part of the
eastern sky from about 1 a.m. until dawn, on both Nov. 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do, set that alarm clock,'' he advised. ``Not
until 2098 or perhaps 2131 will hopes for a Leonid storm again be
justified.''

   Ask people if they have negative attitudes toward blacks, women
or the elderly, and you are likely to hear a chorus of denials. But
give those same individuals a simple test to tap unconscious
beliefs, two psychologists say, and the results often tell a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice can be so pervasive and so deeply rooted that many
people are not consciously aware of their biases, say Dr. Anthony
Greenwald of the University of Washington and Dr. Mahzarin Banaji
of Yale University, developers of the Implicit Associations Test.
</P>
<P>
   The test, a series of word-pairing tasks, is intended to measure
implicit or automatic associations to social groups. In one
version, subjects are asked to pair random combinations of pleasant
and unpleasant words _ ``peace'' and ``paradise'' versus ``hatred''
and ``violence'' _ with combinations of proper names common among
white or black Americans _ Brad and Peggy versus Jamal and Latisha.
Other versions of the test address unconscious assumptions about
women and older people. Still others focus on self-esteem and sex
differences in preferences for math or art.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald and Banaji and their colleagues have given the test to
hundreds of undergraduates, including more than 1,000 Yale freshmen
this fall. Thousands of other people are taking the test on line,
by visiting a Web site (www.yale.edu/implicit) for the researchers.
The site received 50,000 hits in its first week, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   In studies using the race-based version of the test, 90 percent
of white subjects took longer to pair pleasant words with black
names and unpleasant words with white names than the other way
around, a delay the psychologists interpret as an automatic or
implicit preference for white names.
</P>
<P>
   This discrepancy remained significant even when the researchers
took into account the familiarity of the proper names, the order in
which the words were presented, whether the pleasant words appeared
on the right or left side, and other factors that might influence
the results. Data from black subjects are still being collected,
but Greenwald says many black people taking the test also show a
preference for white names, though to a weaker degree.
</P>
<P>
   While the test may reveal unconscious prejudice, the researchers
note that no evidence links a person's performance on the test with
attitudes or behavior in the outside world. ``We like to think of
it as an unconsciousness-raising tool,'' Banaji said, a tool ``for
increasing awareness or self-analysis. It should not be used to
select individuals for jobs or to select a jury.''

   &UR; Does walking during labor's early stages ease pain and hasten
delivery? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not for all women. Some do not want to walk. But the
majority, if encouraged, will get up and then say, ``Oh, that feels
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   It keeps them moving around and there's less chance of the
baby's being stuck in an unfavorable position.
</P>
<P>
   You let gravity work. You're standing up and you want baby to
come down and out. It's just my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The mother can always get back in bed if she doesn't like it.
But the help makes a big difference. You show them what they can
do, how not just to walk, but to sway back and forth, leaning on
the bed, or on their husband; things you might do if you were
having a lot of abdominal or back pain and were left to your own
devices.
</P>
<P>
   _MARION McCARTNEY, Director of professional services for the
American College of Nurse-Midwives.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe that medically it hastens the labor, or that the
contractions are better. But I think it is a very good thing to
tell patients they have the option. If that's what the patient
really wishes to do, walking will allow her to feel more in
control, not just tied to a hospital bed attached to a scary
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that makes me angry is when patients are huddled over
with pain but say I  &UR; must &LR;  get up and walk. Patients begin to
believe they  &UR; must &LR;  do this because they've been told so, by a
friend or a relative or in a book. But do you really need to be out
there throwing up? Would you normally get out of bed if you're sick
or lightheaded? They're making themselves do something they
wouldn't otherwise do, and blame themselves if they can't.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Periodically for at least the last 1,000 years, a spectacular
rain of meteors spawned by a passing comet has lighted up the sky,
inspiring fear, wonder and admiration.
</P>
<P>
   The meteor storm, which shot hundreds of thousands of blazing
streaks across the heavens 33 years ago, is soon due to hit the
Earth again, and this time space scientists are concerned about its
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior of periodic meteor storms is hard to predict with
certainty. The meteor show forecast for Nov. 17 or 18 might be
spectacular or it might be a dud.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever the case, every one of the 600-odd satellites
orbiting the Earth _ spacecraft used for communications, military
reconnaissance, peace-keeping missions, climate and weather
monitoring, astronomy, navigation and science _ will be hit by
ultra-high-speed meteor dust.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of major damage to any of the satellites is
regarded by experts as small, but cannot be discounted. This storm
of meteors, called Leonid meteors because they come from the
direction of constellation Leo, will be the first to hit the Earth
since 1966 when the world's space programs were in their infancy,
and its effects on satellite systems are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear of possible damage has prompted many meetings by
experts in recent months to discuss ways of minimizing hazards, and
the operators of important satellites are taking no chances.
Whenever possible, satellites will be turned out of the way of the
meteor storm for a few hours and placed in partial electronic
hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   Both military and commercial satellite operators said that even
during maneuvering, major satellite functions would continue,
including the transmission of voice, data and television traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The only human beings who will be in space during the storm are
the Russian crew of the Mir space laboratory, which will be unable
to get out of the way. American space officials said they expected
the Russians to ride out the storm inside the Soyuz reentry
vehicle, docked with Mir, enabling them to make a quick escape if
Mir should be badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal day, dozens of meteors hit the Earth's atmosphere
and burn up. But besides this steady influx of meteors, there are
also occasional showers and meteor storms associated with passing
comets.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid meteors begin as dust or small chunks that break
loose from Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle whenever it approaches the Sun.
Once every 33 years, the ribbon-like stream of dust and particles
trailing the comet usually intersects the Earth's orbit around the
Sun, just as the Earth is passing.
</P>
<P>
   Comet 55P/Temple-Tuttle, about two and a half miles in diameter,
was discovered in 1865 by Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, who
calculated that its orbit around the Sun took a little over 33
years. The historical record of the Leonid meteor storms goes back
at least 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The comet itself has never come close to hitting the Earth. But
particles that break loose from the comet are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to Congress in May, Dr. William H. Ailor of the
Aerospace Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., a consultant to the Air
Force on hazards to spacecraft, warned that this year's Leonid
storm would pose the most serious meteoroid threat ever faced by
the world's spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Because of the very high speed of the particles _
they will be moving at speeds over 155,000 miles an hour _ the
storm poses an even greater and somewhat unknown threat.''
</P>
<P>
   (Astronomers designate objects moving earthward as
``meteoroids.'' When one of these hits the atmosphere and burns up
it is called a ``meteor.'' If a meteor survives through the
atmosphere and hits the ground it is called a ``meteorite.'')
</P>
<P>
   Showers of Leonid meteors may produce hundreds or thousands of
blazing meteors each hour. Such storms pose no danger to life on
the ground because most of the cometary particles are smaller than
grains of sand and burn up high in the atmosphere. Occasionally,
larger chunks enter the atmosphere to produce bolides _ fireballs _
that leave luminous trails sometimes persisting for several
minutes. Sometimes bolides explode, producing dazzling flashes of
light.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ahmet Ozkul of Intelsat, the largest operator of global
communications satellites, estimates that the probability of any of
the company's 20 satellites being damaged by a Leonid meteoroid in
November will be less than 2 percent if no precautionary measures
are taken.
</P>
<P>
   But operators intend to do what they can. One precaution will be
to maneuver these two-ton satellites (each valued at about $1.5
million) so as to present smaller targets for meteoroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Leonid shower,'' he said, ``most operators will
slue their satellites around so that their big solar panels are
turned edgewise to the stream of particles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ground controllers of some satellites plan to reduce the volume
of commands from ground stations to avoid electronic garbling and
erroneous commands that can be caused by the impact of dust
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Meteoroid damage to spacecraft has been rare since the mid-1960s
when spacecraft became common. An exception was a European
communications satellite named Olympus, which was knocked out of
operation in 1993, presumably by meteoroid impact.
</P>
<P>
   (Another recent failure of a communications satellite occurred
on May 19, when uncontrolled spinning of Galaxy IV shut down most
pagers in the United States for nearly a day. A spokesman for the
Panamsat Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., the owner of the satellite,
said it had been determined that its loss had resulted from
internal failure, not from a hit by a meteoroid or debris.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, astronauts conducting a repair mission on the orbiting
Hubble Space Telescope found a hole about the size of a quarter in
one of the instrument's dish antennas. The hole might have been
made by a meteoroid, although Dr. John Campbell of the Space
Telescope Science Institute, which operates the satellite, said the
damage was more likely to have been from the impact of a piece of
man-made debris from some space mission.
</P>
<P>
   Space experts consider ``sand blasting'' by micrometeoroid to be
a more likely threat than penetrating hits. Without actually
piercing vital parts of spacecraft, the hail of microscopic
particles is expected to cause wear and tear during the few hours
of the storm, that would be equivalent to the wear and tear of up
to three years of normal operation without meteoroid storms.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another hazard is electrical.
</P>
<P>
   A microscopic particle hitting the skin of a spacecraft at 44
miles per second is vaporized into plasma _ an ultra-hot,
electrically charged gas. During the plasma's ephemeral existence
it may conduct its electrostatic charge to the spacecraft, causing
arcing, short circuits and damage to computer chips and circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Sand blasting by comet dust can also damage mirrors, lenses and
the optical components used by spy satellites, weather sensors and
orbiting astronomical instruments, including the Hubble Space
Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, during and after the Leonid storm,'' Campbell said,
``we intend to slue the Hubble telescope around so that its metal
back faces the meteoroids, shielding its optics from damage.''
</P>
<P>
   For 10 hours the telescope will be pointed opposite the
direction from which the meteors will be coming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intelsat will also slue its communications satellites, so that
their big solar panels are turned edgewise to the meteoroid stream
for about three hours, thereby presenting the smallest possible
targets, Ozkul said.
</P>
<P>
   The Intelsat satellites, which carry digital, voice and
television signals, operate 22,300 miles high in what are known as
geosynchronous orbits, in which each satellite remains permanently
over the same spot on the Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of serious damage to Mir are regarded as very small,
American experts said, noting that even the space shuttle has been
knicked by debris from time to time with no serious effects. (For
example, the shuttle Atlantis was hit both by a meteoroid fragment
and a piece of debris in September last year.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the big Mir station will not be able to maneuver
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   To be on the safe side, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has delayed the launching of the space shuttle until
after the Leonid shower.
</P>
<P>
   Some satellites in low-earth orbits can actually hide from
meteoroid storms, Ozkul said. Some carry enough fuel that they can
maneuver into orbits in which the Earth will shield them for a
short time from the peak of the meteoroid storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiding from the storm would be a judgment call,'' he said,
``because you would use up a lot of precious maneuvering fuel, but
it can be done in an emergency,'' Ozkul said. ``We couldn't do it
with our geosynchronous satellites, which are 22,300 miles up, but
some near-earth satellites could hide behind the Earth long enough
to reduce the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aerospace Corp. regards the Leonid shower as a test, from
which the world's satellite owners and users will gain useful
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Some satellites, including the galaxy of Air Force satellites
serving the Global Positioning System of navigation, can detect and
report meteoroid hits on themselves. Such information may lead to
improved meteoroid protection for future space stations, Ailor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 600 active satellites in orbit, half are
American, and about half of these are military. Only ``a handful''
of these satellites will be reoriented, said Maj. Perry L. Nouis of
the Air Force, spokesman for the United States Space Command. Power
will be temporarily reduced for some satellite systems to lessen
the chance of electrical problems caused by meteoric dust, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Nouis said, ``This year's Leonid storm
will give us a lot of data that may be useful for protecting
satellites against future showers.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may be more appropriate venues to first learn the art of
rock climbing than an enormous granite escarpment known as Suicide
Rocks. The formation is the size of several football fields, albeit
vertical ones, and emerges out of the San Jacinto Mountains of
Southern California at an altitude of 7,500 feet. This means
climbers must deal with the thin air as well as the rocks, which
are sufficiently intimidating on their own.
</P>
<P>
   My anxiety was mitigated slightly by the splendor of the setting
on a perfect late summer day. I had gone climbing with three fellow
novices and our guide, John Gleeson, assistant manager of a
climbing gym called Rockreation in Los Angeles. Our first climb was
up a route called ``the plague.'' Gleeson insisted it was easy, and
it was, if you had 10 years' climbing experience, as he did. At
first, it was pleasantly and surprisingly simple: a 65-degree
incline with numerous cracks, knobs and ledges to support hands and
feet.
</P>
<P>
   This incline, however, was interrupted by an overhang, where the
rock folded back over itself, leaving a horizontal v-shaped opening
to negotiate. It could be done, as Gleeson demonstrated, by bracing
your back against the rock face and your feet against the overhang
and shimmying up the rock. This required a faith in friction to
hold you in place. I tried the move twice, lacked sufficient faith,
and failed twice.
</P>
<P>
   At such moments, two kinds of thoughts pass through your mind.
There are the irrational ones: in this case, that my breathing
sounded precisely like that of the underwater respiration of scuba
divers in Jacques Cousteau documentaries. Then there are the
rational ones, which are inevitably and repetitively some variation
of ``what am I doing here, and how do I get out?''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor rock climbing is about two things: The first is fighting
gravity, which is as much about technique _ a combination of
strength, practice and experience _ as the surprisingly cerebral
activity of figuring out just how you're going to make it up the
slab of rock above you. Experienced climbers often claim that it is
the meditative aspect of climbing that is the primary reason they
do it. Once on the rock, you are absorbed with the puzzle of making
the correct moves that will get you to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the top is all about proving you're good enough,
which is the second thing. To a novice, rock climbing entails a
challenge that is as close to overwhelming as you may find in
sport. It is also one of the few activities you will do that can
seem insanely dangerous and yet be completely safe and absolutely
exhilarating. Indoor rock-climbing is what A.J. Liebling, the
legendary New Yorker writer, might have called a milksop substitute
for the outdoor variety. Experienced climbers use climbing gyms to
expand their repertory of moves, as well as stay in shape in the
off-season. It is challenge enough for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The gyms look like junior college productions of The Hall of the
Mountain King, with climbing walls, arches and boulders, all
studded with colorful projections of varying degrees of usefulness
for supporting your weight. These surfaces will be labeled to
indicate the difficulty of a particular route up the wall if you
limit yourself to one color. The scale will go from around 5.5 or
so, which is easier than climbing up a ladder, to 5.14, which I now
believe is a featureless, horizontal surface that has to be
negotiated from beneath.
</P>
<P>
   All you'll need in the gyms is your usual work-out attire. The
gyms will supply rock climbing shoes and a harness, which is worn
around the waist and thighs, like a macho diaper. The shoes are a
cross between ballet shoes and the rubber slippers that surfers
wear. They are worn without socks and are excruciatingly tight _
ideally, several sizes too small _ to facilitate clinging to
footholds on infinitesimal ledges. When they fit correctly, the
pain will become intense.
</P>
<P>
   Indoors or out, rock climbing is not a sport for anyone who
believes in regular pedicures _ or, for that fact, manicures. Gyms
will offer a novice class, which is what I took before going to
Suicide. The class is a good prerequisite for entrance into the
sport, although it's likely to start with a request that you sign
an indemnity agreement promising that you (or your next of kin)
won't sue the gym in the event of accident. It will then cover the
basics from putting on your harness to the art of belaying
(pronounced buh-LAY-ing) the remarkably simple and fail-safe method
for catching a climber who overextends. Belaying requires a
partner, which makes rock climbing by necessity a communal sport.

<P>
   The workout itself will build strength in your forearms and
hands, specifically, and your legs if you're climbing correctly. It
also gives you a new sense of body position and balance, because
you will learn to contort your body into a range of previously
unimaginable pretzel-like shapes to get up the wall or rock. But
the training is very specific and shouldn't substitute entirely for
other aspects of a regular fitness program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can supplement your training program to add variety and
novelty to it, give it a competitive edge and give you motivation
to get in and train,'' says Dr. Alan Mikesky, head of the Human
Performance and Bio-mechanics Laboratory at Indiana
University-Purdue University in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   If you do choose to climb rocks instead of gym walls, consider a
month or so in a gym working on your moves and your balance. Once
you do, or even if you don't, plenty of organizations _ including
the gyms _ offer climbing trips for novices on up. My trip to
Suicide cost me $90 for the day and I had to get there and back on
my own.
</P>
<P>
   Before going, there are a few things you should know. For
instance, while you'll likely experience your share of fear, you
won't _ or at least I didn't _ fear either death or injury. You
quickly develop confidence that belaying will keep you safe. When I
slipped, which I did many times, I fell only a few inches before I
was caught. What I did fear was embarrassment and failure. When I
finally made it up the plague, I felt a sense of overwhelming
relief. I had not failed myself. That was the point.
</P>
<P>
   There are also things you may learn about your character while
rock climbing that may (or may not) be of extraordinary use to you
in later life. For instance, you may learn that it is possible to
continue climbing upward just because your guide tells you to go
up, not because you believe it can be done. You may learn that
despite some pain and total exhaustion, you can look forward to
climbing the next week because it will be a kick to be good at this
sport _ and to routinely view the world from such spectacular
vantage points. And, the only way to do that is to keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most profound, you may learn, as I did, that if you
are fond of the skin on your knees, you should not start your
outdoor climbing career wearing shorts.
</P>

   NUMBERS _ ATLANTA _ Mitch Reiner can remember 61 phone numbers,
his Social Security number, his parents' birthdays, his locker
combination, his kid brother's age (sort of: ``Twel-el-el-ve. Yeah,
12.''), his best and worst golf scores, the year Columbus arrived
in the New World, and the price and product number of every single
smoothie at Smoothie King. OK, that's because he works there.
Still, that's a lot of numbers to keep track of _ especially for
somebody who just turned 16 a week and a half ago. ``If you think
about it, it's really not much, because it's everything you think
about. All your friends, all the numbers you know,'' says Reiner, a
sophomore at Pope High School in Marietta. Just think of what we
use numbers for every day: phones, pagers, zip codes, bank
accounts, security alarm codes, TV channels, clothing sizes,
airline flights, appointment times, important dates. (Kim, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-DORAL13-COX_I was on a mission: To see what it is like to
play from where the pros play on The Blue Monster _ if no longer
Florida's most challenging or beautiful course, then certainly its
most storied. Designed in 1961 by Dick Wilson, the course has been
a pro stop for decades _ the Doral tournament helping to build
Florida's golf reputation in the '60s. But thanks to better
equipment and longer hitters, by the early '90s, The Blue Monster
had lost its teeth. MOVED.

Two books about the Clinton scandal _ by William Bennett and Ann
Coulter _ are already on the nonfiction bestseller lists, and, with
the publication this week of two new tomes there soon may be more.
James Carville has written a snitty assessment of Ken Starr, while
David Maraniss has done a thoughtful and revealing reading of
Clinton's Aug. 17 address to the nation. The impeachment debate may
be played out on the bestseller list as well as the judiciary
committee, displacing for a time at least, the staple tell-all

espresso mixed with Sambuca. (They bring in their own food.) Owners
Jerry Somma and Abe Debabneh turn on the TV so the guys can watch
the hyperkinetic Emeril Lagasse whip up a dish on the Food Network.
(Fans of the show, they dub themselves The Emeril Club). But when
new customers walk in, Debabneh walks toward them, shakes their
hands and says, ``Come on in! Come on in!'' to break the ice. ``We

   ZYDECO _ Long renowned and crowned as the ``king of zydeco,''
the late Clifton Chenier might have trouble recognizing much of the
musical legacy that has flourished in his wake. Yes, the sound is
still based on the interplay of sprightly accordion and the
metallic scrape of a rubboard. Yes, the music still fills the
country roadhouses and radio airwaves throughout the Creole

IN MILAN, A STATE OF UNEASE ON THE RUNWAY

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ With the current political and financial turmoil
in the world and with the millennium fast approaching, society is
being affected in countless ways. And fashion, being a reflection
of the times, is in its own state of unease, searching for a new
way of dressing post-minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be particularly true in Italy, where the
government has just been toppled by a no-confidence vote in
Parliament and where many designers, too, seem to have lost
confidence. The sharp tailoring that Italy is known for is no
longer the prevailing style, but no one has yet come up with a
definitive new direction, although several have tried with varying
degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   Miuccia Prada and Jil Sander scored in the way that they put a
high fashion gloss on casual sports clothes. But the equally
influential Tom Ford of Gucci went all out for glamour and high
spirits with raucous prints and sparkly beads.
</P>
<P>
   Donatella Versace, too, was in an upbeat mood in the best
collection she's done on her own since the death of her brother
Gianni last year. Dark blue drapes on the walls and blue sand on
the floor at the company's palazzo achieved a perfect foil for the
floral and geometric patterns in cheery shades of pink, purple and
aqua. Kate Moss got into the groove by having her long straight
hair dyed bright pink for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Printed gauze layered over printed jersey had a soft-focus
effect, and the pink of a pants suit was a shade pale enough for a
baby's blanket. There were some long skirts and some extremely
short ones, often worn with a brief top in a contrasting print.
Lace appliqued onto felt had an invitingly fuzzy texture, and the
house's signature chain mail looked new with floral embroidery or a
purple orchid printed on it. While the clothes were still sensuous,
the sharp edges had definitely been blunted.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Giorgio Armani's sharp tailoring was nowhere to be
seen in the beautiful collection he showed Sunday. All structure
and inner construction was left on the cutting-room floor. The few
jackets on the runway hung as limply as sweaters over pants or
skirts that were veiled in a layer of tulle or chiffon. This
layering went from day to evening, blurring the difference and
contributing to the aura of lightness that prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   All the evening dresses were strapless columns, often with a
scarf around the breasts tied in the front or back. The dull grays,
taupes and blues Armani favors got a jolt in the evening segment
with a series of pink and orange dresses embroidered with flowers,
veiled, of course, with a layer of chiffon to tone down the color.
Chiffon or tulle was also layered over beading to dull the sheen.
It's a technique many designers are using, and it's a very
effective form of understatement. Armani is going with the flow of
fashion but doing it in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Gianfranco Ferre is celebrating his 20th year in business by
doing exactly what he wants, which is to shake up the fashion
world. His show on Thursday night, to inaugurate his new palazzo in
one of the oldest sections of town, was an over-the-top
extravaganza in which the few wearable pieces of clothing were lost
amid the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   With towering African headdresses and stiletto heels, the models
looked eight feet tall, a height that exaggerated the effect of
designs like leather dresses as short as jackets, and skirts made
of stiff belt leather merely a hand span wide. And then there were
cone-shaped skirts, a suit made of pieced alligator, silver-studded
sheer black minidresses, raffia bustiers, and white shirts with
tails that swept the floor. But the pieces de resistance were ball
gowns of great swaths of pink and copper-colored taffeta that
swirled around the bodies of the models and ended in ballooning
trains. It was a show that will not soon be forgotten, and that is
no doubt what Ferre intended.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say what Karl Lagerfeld intended in the Fendi
show with overwide and overlong pants that puddled around the
models' feet, with long dresses that trailed streamers of ribbons,
with a row of slits cut into the sides of some clothes, and with
metallic appliques on a baggy jump suit. In any event, a spring
show from a house known for its furs is more of an amusement than a
serious treatise.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Missoni, now designing for the house her parents built,
is developing her own signature, with airy knits in stripes and
wavy patterns and youthful styles with a casual air. The spring
clothes are actually more summery looking, like what a fashionable
woman would wear on a weekend out of the city. There are long
sleeveless dresses and long skirts or clam diggers shown with
halters, all in the colors of sand, earth and sky. For evening,
similar pieces were coated, with a shimmer of clear sequins.
</P>
<P>
   A young spirit also wafts through the collection of the American
designer Victor Alfaro, who shows in Milan because an Italian
company, Gilmar, produces his line. It features variations of
cropped T-shirts or camisole tops and hip-riding pants or skirts,
mainly in white, beige or pale yellow. There are also open-weave
hand-knit sweaters and sleek leathers, and for evening beaded gauze
dresses in white or ivory over cashmere tube dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury of Alfaro's cashmere and silk fabrics and the
delicacy of the beadwork raise the clothes from ordinary sportswear
to designer stature, and they fit comfortably into the high-fashion
scene in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Moses is another American who has slipped into the
Italian scene with ease by concentrating on cashmere and silk in
sportswear-inspired styles that are beyond trends. Her great talent
is an eye for color, which for spring includes pale lilac, peach,
pink and mint alongside white, beige and black. The colors are so
faded-looking that combining three for a stripe has a subtle
effect. There are sweaters with short sleeves of crystal-beaded
gauze and others overlaid with sequined net.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moses, who has also been designing the Genny collection for
the last five years, has done her last show for the house. Genny
has named as her successor Josephus Melchior Thimister.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Ferretti gave an injection of youth serum to her usually
elegant collection by cropping the tops to bare the midriff and
navel over low-riding pants and skirts. Geometric lines or raised
seams give a special effect to simple shift dresses and narrow
skirts that fall several inches below the knee. Embroidery or
beading is added with a light touch, in the Ferretti style, as in a
hint of colored embroidery on the hem of underskirts worn with
sheer white dresses that have rows of tucking.
</P>
<P>
   Mila Schon is a venerable designer who has enlisted young
assistants in the last few seasons to rejuvenate her line. For
spring, that means slitting the front, back or side of shift
dresses, and showing white leather dresses with raised seams or
cutouts in circular patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The week of shows in Milan may not have resulted in a consensus
on where fashion is heading, but it certainly spewed out a lot of
ideas for people to consider as Paris takes over the stage this
week.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many doctors know the story of ``Mr. Wright,'' who was found to
have cancer and in 1957 was given only days to live. Hospitalized
in Long Beach, Calif., with tumors the size of oranges, he heard
that scientists had discovered a horse serum, Krebiozen, that
appeared to be effective against cancer. He begged to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   His physician, Dr. Philip West, finally agreed and gave Wright
an injection on a Friday afternoon. The following Monday, the
astonished doctor found his patient out of his ``death bed,''
joking with the nurses. The tumors, the doctor wrote later, ``had
melted like snow balls on a hot stove.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Wright read medical reports that the horse
serum was a quack remedy. He suffered an immediate relapse. ``Don't
believe what you read in the papers,'' the doctor told Wright. Then
he injected him with what he said was ``a new super-refined double
strength'' version of the drug. Actually, it was water, but again,
the tumor masses melted.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was ``the picture of health'' for another two months _
until he read a definitive report stating that Krebiozen was
worthless. He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who know this story dismiss it as one of those strange
tales that medicine cannot explain. The idea that a patient's
beliefs can make a fatal disease go away is too bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   But now scientists, as they learn that the placebo effect is
even more powerful than anyone had been able to demonstrate, are
also beginning to discover the biological mechanisms that cause it
to achieve results that border on the miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   Using new techniques of brain imagery, they are uncovering a
host of biological mechanisms that can turn a thought, belief or
desire into an agent of change in cells, tissues and organs. They
are learning that much of human perception is based not on
information flowing into the brain from the outside world but what
the brain, based on previous experience, expects to happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Placebos are ``lies that heal,'' said Dr. Anne Harrington, a
historian of science at Harvard University. A placebo _ the word is
Latin for ``I shall please'' _ is typically a sham treatment that a
doctor doles out merely to please or placate anxious or persistent
patients, she said. It looks like an active drug but has no
pharmacological properties of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Until fairly recently, nearly all of medicine was based on
placebo effects, because doctors had little effective medicine to
offer. Through the 1940s, American doctors handed out sugar pills
in various shapes and colors in a deliberate attempt to induce
placebo responses.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, doctors have real medicines to fight disease. But
these treatments have not diminished the power of the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Texas are conducting a study of arthroscopic knee
surgery that uses general anesthesia in which patients with sore,
worn knees are assigned to one of three operations _ scraping out
the knee joint, washing out the joint or doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``nothing'' operation, doctors anesthetize the patient,
make three little cuts in the knee as if to insert the usual
instruments and then pretend to operate. Two years after surgery,
patients who underwent the sham surgery reported the same amount of
relief from pain and swelling as those who had had the real
operations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent review of placebo-controlled studies of modern
anti-depressant drugs found that placebos and genuine drugs worked
about as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you expect to get better, you will,'' said Dr. Irving
Kirsch, a psychiatrist at the University of Connecticut who carried
out the review. His findings were met with a great deal of
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent study of a baldness remedy found that 86 percent of
men taking it either maintained or showed an increase in the amount
of hair on their heads. But so did 42 percent of the men taking a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies are specifically designed to explore the power of
placebos rather than drugs. On Coche Island in Venezuela, asthmatic
children were given a sniff of vanilla along with a squirt of
medicine from a bronchodilator twice a day. Later, the vanilla odor
alone increased their lung function, 33 percent as much as did the
bronchodilator alone.
</P>
<P>
   And at Tulane University, Dr. Eileen Palace is using a placebo
to restore sexual arousal in women who say they are nonorgasmic.
The women are hooked up to a biofeedback machine that they are told
measures their vaginal blood flow, an index of arousal. Then they
are shown sexual stimuli that would arouse most women.
</P>
<P>
   But the experimenter plays a trick on the women by sending,
within 30 seconds, a false feedback signal that their vaginal blood
flow has increased. Almost immediately they then become genuinely
aroused.
</P>
<P>
   Placebos are about 55 percent to 60 percent as effective as most
active medications like aspirin and codeine for controlling pain,
Kirsch said. Moreover, placebos that relieve pain can be blocked
with a drug, naloxone, that also blocks morphine.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, many scientists thought that placebos might work by
releasing the body's natural morphinelike substances, called
endorphins. But that is not the only explanation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While placebos can act globally on the body, they can also have
extremely specific effects. For example, a study was carried out in
Japan on 13 people who were extremely allergic to poison ivy. Each
was rubbed on one arm with a harmless leaf but were told it was
poison ivy and touched on the other arm with poison ivy and told it
was harmless.
</P>
<P>
   All 13 broke out in rash where the harmless leaf contacted their
skin. Only two reacted to the poison leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown, time and again, that placebos can work
wonders. Like ``real drugs,'' they can cause side effects like
itching, diarrhea and nausea. They can lead to changes in pulse
rate, blood pressure, electrical skin resistance, gastric function,
penis engorgement and skin conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why? Explanations of why placebos work can be
found in a new field of cognitive neuropsychology called expectancy
theory _ what the brain believes about the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Like classical conditioning theory (Pavlov's dogs salivate at
the sound of the bell), expectancy involves associative learning.
The medical treatments you get during your life are conditioning
trials, Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's white coat, nurse's voice, smell of disinfectant or
needle prick have acquired meaning through previous learning,
producing an expectation of relief from symptoms. Each pill,
capsule or injection is paired with active ingredients, and later,
if you get a pill without active ingredients, you can still get a
therapeutic effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such conditioning shows how expectations are acquired, Kirsch
said. But it does not explain the strength and persistence of
placebo effects. These responses occur almost instantly, with no
apparent conscious thought, and are therefore wired firmly into the
brain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Response expectations are strong because the world is filled
with ambiguity. A long thin object seen in dim light could be a
stick or a snake. But it may not be safe to take the time to find
out. So people evolved a mechanism to anticipate what is going to
occur. This expectation speeds the perceptual processing at the
expense of accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   As in the outside world, people's internal states have inherent
ambiguity. That is why, when people in an experiment were given a
drug that produced a surge of adrenaline, they interpreted the
feeling as anger, euphoria or nothing at all, depending on what
they had been told to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of alternative medicine say its enduring appeal is
explained by the placebo effect. When conventional therapies fail
to help chronic or poorly understood conditions, the acupuncturist,
homeopathist or chiropractor steps into the breach with a potent
belief system ready-made to help the suffering patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy in a white coat or a guy dressed in feathers can
induce a patient's immune system to fight back, who is to say which
is better?'' said Dr. Dan Molerman, a medical anthropologist at the
University of Michigan at Dearborn.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the expectancy theory emerged about 10 years ago,
when many scientists realized how closely the brain, the immune
system and the hormone production of the endocrine system are
linked. Chronic stress sets into motion a cascade of biological
events involving scores of chemicals in the body _ serotonin,
cortisol, cytokines, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Such stress lowers resistance to disease and alters gene
expression. When people are under stress, wounds tend to heal more
slowly, latent viruses like herpes erupt and brain cells involved
in memory formation die off. The precise molecular steps underlying
all of these changes have been mapped out.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the opposite? Can a thought or belief produce a
chemical cascade that leads to healing and wellness? Researchers
studying placebos think the answer is yes, and they offer several
ways it might work:
</P>
<P>
   _ A placebo might reduce stress, allowing the body to regain
some natural, optimum level called health.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special molecules may exist that help carry out placebo
responses. For example, a recent study found that stressed animals
can produce a Valium-like substance in their brains, but only if
they have some control over the source of the stress. People almost
certainly have similar brain chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Placebos may draw their power from the way the brain is
organized to act on what experience predicts will happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne, a neuroscientist at the New School for
Social Research in New York, explains it this way: The brain
generates two kinds of activation patterns, which arise from
networks of neurons firing together.
</P>
<P>
   One type is set in motion by information flowing into the brain
from the outside world _ smells, tastes, visual images, sounds. At
the same time, the cortex draws on memories and feelings to
generate patterns of brain activity related to what is expected to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The top-down patterns generated by the cortex intersect smoothly
with the bottom-up patterns to inform us about what is happening,
Kinsbourne said. If there is a mismatch, the brain tries to sort it
out, without necessarily designating one set of patterns as more
authoritative than another.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations that result are internally generated brain
states that can be as real as anything resulting purely from the
outside world. For example, recent experiments with monkeys show
that if they expect a reward like a sip of apple juice, cells in
their brains fire 20 to 30 seconds before they actually receive it.
In other words, expectancies are embedded in the brain's
neurochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are misled by dualism or the idea that mind and body are
separate,'' said Dr. Howard Fields, a neuroscientist at the
University of California at San Francisco who studies placebo
effects. A thought is a set of neurons firing which, through
complex brain wiring, can activate emotional centers, pain
pathways, memories, the autonomic nervous system and other parts of
the nervous system involved in producing physical sensations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morphine will alter brain patterns to reduce pain. So will a
placebo. Obviously, placebos have limits. Wright's miraculous
remission aside, most people cannot think, hope or believe their
way out of cancer or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Howard Spiro, a gastroenterologist at Yale University,
put it: Some diseases are unleashed with the power of a fire hose.
Others unfold at a trickle, and perhaps those are the ones amenable
to placebo effects.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a warm Sunday afternoon, my husband, Richard, and I, both
native New Yorkers, were entertaining my cousin Kate and her
boyfriend, Paul, from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, after trekking around the city, we
decided to enjoy the view and some refreshments from the top of the
World Trade Center. We were stopped by the lobby elevator
attendant, who said we couldn't go up because Kate was wearing
sneakers, and no sneakers were allowed after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He also informed us that there was a ``real cheap'' shoe store
in the mall just outside the lobby. We went searching, but the
cheapest shoes we could find were $50. OK, we thought, we'll try
the observation deck. Admission for four (without drinks) was $48.
We were stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Then Paul had a brilliant idea. We left Kate in the lobby while
the rest of us went up to the bar at Windows on the World. After
being seated at a table with a spectacular view, we slipped my
shoes into Paul's knapsack. My long, flowing pants covered my bare
feet, not that anyone was looking.
</P>
<P>
   Paul took my shoes down to Kate. The Foot Police never noticed
that the same shoes walked by him twice. The tab for the view,
drinks and hors d'oeuvres for four: $62.

   George Banks' daughter, Karen, a high school sophomore, was
preparing for a world history test, and her father offered to help
her study. ``No thanks, Dad,'' she said. ``Your history was a long

   It was one of those days. Martin Hason's first appointment was
at 7:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m. he was an hour behind schedule. He
pushed and shoved through the morning, and by early afternoon was
at his desk with three calls to return.
</P>
<P>
   He was on one of them when call-waiting beeped. He picked up. An
unfamiliar caller with a cheery voice introduced himself as a
broker for an investment firm. The caller went on, ``I'd like to
offer you an outstanding issue of municipal ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, I'm busy,'' Hason said, and clicked off.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hason answered the phone and heard the same voice,
but this time the caller was a little less cheery. ``I don't have
time for you,'' the caller said _ and clicked off.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: A recent matinee of ``Sideman.''
</P>
<P>
   The time: Intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The players: Richard W. Barr, seated beside one matron and in
front of another.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: (sitting behind Barr and calling out to Woman No.
2, seated beside him) ``Marge, is that you?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Helen, where were you? I waited in the lobby
until the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``There were heavy rains out my way and I barely
made it here on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Why did you wait until now to speak to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``I didn't recognize you. You've changed your hair.
It was only when I saw your rings as you were applauding at the end

   My friend Gary Goldsmith came home very late from work and
realized that his wallet was missing. After searching everywhere,
including the grocery store he had just come from, he went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, his phone rang. A voice asked, ``Mr.
Goldsmith, did you lose something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You found my wallet?'' Gary responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look outside your door,'' the voice said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gary could say, ``I'd like to give you a reward,'' the
voice continued: ``Don't worry about a reward. I've helped myself
to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his door, Gary found his wallet, neatly wrapped, with
his credit cards and license intact. But the wallet was $173
lighter.

   Two elderly gentlemen, obviously friends, were on a crosstown
bus, sitting near Hy Farber. They began discussing their health
problems, and one went into great detail about his bout with the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   The other man commented that it was fortunate that the friend
had been attended to by a doctor. ``With those symptoms, a person
could die young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend's answer was succinct: ``It's too late for me to die
young.''

   Cynthia Pader saw a pedestal she liked in the window of an
antiques store on Madison Avenue. She ran into the store and asked
the salesman if the pedestal was real marble.

   &UR; SONGS YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Today's music may sound a lot different than what I listened to
25 years ago, but I take comfort in the fact that the lyrics are
just as indecipherable now as they were then.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, indecipherable lyrics discourage people from
``singing along'' to their favorite song, thus saving the nerves
and ears of the rest of us from irreparable damage. Flailing away
at an air guitar or flapping about the room like a loon in heat is
one thing; attempting to sing, out loud, the chorus of ``Blinded by
the Light'' is another thing entirely.
</P>
<P>
   I mention ``Blinded by the Light'' specifically because few song
lyrics have generated as much confusion in the minds of listeners
as these, written by one of the most incomprehensible composers of
our time, Bruce Springsteen. If you are into computers (and there
is certainly no good reason why you should be), you will find an
entire web page (http://www.kissthisguy.com/) devoted to possible
translations of the chorus, as suggested by hundreds of earnest, if
somewhat underoccupied, fans. Some of the more plausible guesses
include:
</P>
<P>
   _Held up like a loofah by the foreman of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Shot loose like a goose, another runner in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Revved up my big Dodge and did a runner with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   _Rabbit in a lot of juice, like a doughnut in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Racked up like a moose, that's been run over in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Caught up at the juice bar in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Wake up like a dachshund in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   And my personal favorite:
</P>
<P>
   _Throw up blah blah blah in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   (The actual lyrics, for what they're worth, are: ``Blinded by
the light/Revved up like a deuce/Another runner in the night.''
Just further proof that truth is not always stranger than fiction.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, by the way, is named after one of the more famous
misheard lyrics from the song ``Purple Haze'' by Jimi Hendrix. The
actual lyrics were ``Scuse me while I kiss the sky'' but many fans
(this one included) thought Hendrix said ``Scuse me while I kiss
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Older (or younger) readers who find this error to be rather lame
should keep in mind that this all took place in the '60s and
Hendrix concerts were very loud and the concert halls were
invariably filled with a lot of fog, or something, that distorted
the lyrics. So lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can mishear a lyric, of course, but to qualify as a
classic, a misheard lyric must meet two criteria: 1) You must
believe your misheard version is better than the original, and 2)
You must have convinced at least one other person that your version
is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, I, and millions of other rock fans who suffered
greater or lesser degrees of hearing loss during the '60s, firmly
believed that the Creedence Clearwater Revival song ``Bad Moon
Rising'' contained the lyric ``There's a bathroom on the right,''
when the actual words were, obviously, ``There's a bad moon on the
rise.''
</P>
<P>
   We assumed, I guess, that lead singer John Fogarty was simply
giving us concert-goers some useful information, though, in
hindsight, it did seem like an odd thing to put in a song. In my
defense, I can only say that I didn't take it as far as Creedence
fan Rick Marks did. Marks not only got the ``Bad moon on the rise''
part wrong, he also misheard the line, ``I think we're in for nasty
weather'' to read, ``I think we're in for mashed potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another song that has been misheard is ``Witchy Woman'' by The
Eagles. Benjamin Dover, somehow, misheard the title line as,
``OoohhOoo, windshield woman/See how high she flies/OoohhOoo,
windshield woman/She got the moon in her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought,'' said Dover, ``that the song was about some
zoned-out freak riding around in his car while having ghostly
hallucinations through his windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing moment of revelation came, predictably enough,
when Dover read the song title on the album jacket. To his credit,
Dover believes that his version of the lyrics is better than the
original and claims to have convinced at least one friend that his
version is the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   TV theme songs are frequently misheard, which is a double
tragedy as some of these tunes are like steel plates, so
permanently embedded are they in our skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have misheard the line in the theme song to ``All in
the Family'' that goes, ``Gee, our old LaSalle ran great.''
Versions that are either better or worse than the original,
depending on your point of view, include, ``Gee, those were the
salad days,'' ``Gee, I love old sour grapes'' and the truly
bizarre, ``G.R.O. LaSalle Redgrave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones'' theme song has given me trouble ever since
the show debuted in 1960. I speaking specifically of the line
``Let's ride/With the family down the street/Through the/Blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah.'' I thought, possibly, that the missing
line was ``Making friends with all they meet,'' but that didn't
seem likely as Fred's grumpy nature didn't win him a lot of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible possibility might be, ``And see how much old
Fred can eat'' as Fred had quite the appetite, though it was
unclear why anyone would want to ride around with this family just
to watch Fred gorge himself.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after all these years, thanks to The Archive of
Misheard Lyrics, I know that the actual line is ``Courtesy of
Fred's two feet.'' Personally, I think my lyrics are better than
the real ones. And my dog agrees with me.

had been attended to by a doctor. ``With those symptoms, a person

   &UR; SONGS YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Today's music may sound a lot different than what I listened to
25 years ago, but I take comfort in the fact that the lyrics are
just as indecipherable now as they were then.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, indecipherable lyrics discourage people from
``singing along'' to their favorite song, thus saving the nerves
and ears of the rest of us from irreparable damage. Flailing away
at an air guitar or flapping about the room like a loon in heat is
one thing; attempting to sing, out loud, the chorus of ``Blinded by
the Light'' is another thing entirely.
</P>
<P>
   I mention ``Blinded by the Light'' specifically because few song
lyrics have generated as much confusion in the minds of listeners
as these, written by one of the most incomprehensible composers of
our time, Bruce Springsteen. If you are into computers (and there
is certainly no good reason why you should be), you will find an
entire web page (http://www.kissthisguy.com/) devoted to possible
translations of the chorus, as suggested by hundreds of earnest, if
somewhat underoccupied, fans. Some of the more plausible guesses
include:
</P>
<P>
   _Held up like a loofah by the foreman of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Shot loose like a goose, another runner in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Revved up my big Dodge and did a runner with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   _Rabbit in a lot of juice, like a doughnut in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Racked up like a moose, that's been run over in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Caught up at the juice bar in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Wake up like a dachshund in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   And my personal favorite:
</P>
<P>
   _Throw up blah blah blah in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   (The actual lyrics, for what they're worth, are: ``Blinded by
the light/Revved up like a deuce/Another runner in the night.''
Just further proof that truth is not always stranger than fiction.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, by the way, is named after one of the more famous
misheard lyrics from the song ``Purple Haze'' by Jimi Hendrix. The
actual lyrics were ``Scuse me while I kiss the sky'' but many fans
(this one included) thought Hendrix said ``Scuse me while I kiss
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Older (or younger) readers who find this error to be rather lame
should keep in mind that this all took place in the '60s and
Hendrix concerts were very loud and the concert halls were
invariably filled with a lot of fog, or something, that distorted
the lyrics. So lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can mishear a lyric, of course, but to qualify as a
classic, a misheard lyric must meet two criteria: 1) You must
believe your misheard version is better than the original, and 2)
You must have convinced at least one other person that your version
is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, I, and millions of other rock fans who suffered
greater or lesser degrees of hearing loss during the '60s, firmly
believed that the Creedence Clearwater Revival song ``Bad Moon
Rising'' contained the lyric ``There's a bathroom on the right,''
when the actual words were, obviously, ``There's a bad moon on the
rise.''
</P>
<P>
   We assumed, I guess, that lead singer John Fogarty was simply
giving us concert-goers some useful information, though, in
hindsight, it did seem like an odd thing to put in a song. In my
defense, I can only say that I didn't take it as far as Creedence
fan Rick Marks did. Marks not only got the ``Bad moon on the rise''
part wrong, he also misheard the line, ``I think we're in for nasty
weather'' to read, ``I think we're in for mashed potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another song that has been misheard is ``Witchy Woman'' by The
Eagles. Benjamin Dover, somehow, misheard the title line as,
``OoohhOoo, windshield woman/See how high she flies/OoohhOoo,
windshield woman/She got the moon in her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought,'' said Dover, ``that the song was about some
zoned-out freak riding around in his car while having ghostly
hallucinations through his windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing moment of revelation came, predictably enough,
when Dover read the song title on the album jacket. To his credit,
Dover believes that his version of the lyrics is better than the
original and claims to have convinced at least one friend that his
version is the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   TV theme songs are frequently misheard, which is a double
tragedy as some of these tunes are like steel plates, so
permanently embedded are they in our skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have misheard the line in the theme song to ``All in
the Family'' that goes, ``Gee, our old LaSalle ran great.''
Versions that are either better or worse than the original,
depending on your point of view, include, ``Gee, those were the
salad days,'' ``Gee, I love old sour grapes'' and the truly
bizarre, ``G.R.O. LaSalle Redgrave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones'' theme song has given me trouble ever since
the show debuted in 1960. I speaking specifically of the line
``Let's ride/With the family down the street/Through the/Blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah.'' I thought, possibly, that the missing
line was ``Making friends with all they meet,'' but that didn't
seem likely as Fred's grumpy nature didn't win him a lot of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible possibility might be, ``And see how much old
Fred can eat'' as Fred had quite the appetite, though it was
unclear why anyone would want to ride around with this family just
to watch Fred gorge himself.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after all these years, thanks to The Archive of
Misheard Lyrics, I know that the actual line is ``Courtesy of
Fred's two feet.'' Personally, I think my lyrics are better than
the real ones. And my dog agrees with me.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a warm Sunday afternoon, my husband, Richard, and I, both
native New Yorkers, were entertaining my cousin Kate and her
boyfriend, Paul, from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, after trekking around the city, we
decided to enjoy the view and some refreshments from the top of the
World Trade Center. We were stopped by the lobby elevator
attendant, who said we couldn't go up because Kate was wearing
sneakers, and no sneakers were allowed after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He also informed us that there was a ``real cheap'' shoe store
in the mall just outside the lobby. We went searching, but the
cheapest shoes we could find were $50. OK, we thought, we'll try
the observation deck. Admission for four (without drinks) was $48.
We were stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Then Paul had a brilliant idea. We left Kate in the lobby while
the rest of us went up to the bar at Windows on the World. After
being seated at a table with a spectacular view, we slipped my
shoes into Paul's knapsack. My long, flowing pants covered my bare
feet, not that anyone was looking.
</P>
<P>
   Paul took my shoes down to Kate. The Foot Police never noticed
that the same shoes walked by him twice. The tab for the view,
drinks and hors d'oeuvres for four: $62.

   George Banks' daughter, Karen, a high school sophomore, was

   It was one of those days. Martin Hason's first appointment was
at 7:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m. he was an hour behind schedule. He
pushed and shoved through the morning, and by early afternoon was
at his desk with three calls to return.
</P>
<P>
   He was on one of them when call-waiting beeped. He picked up. An
unfamiliar caller with a cheery voice introduced himself as a
broker for an investment firm. The caller went on, ``I'd like to
offer you an outstanding issue of municipal ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, I'm busy,'' Hason said, and clicked off.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hason answered the phone and heard the same voice,
but this time the caller was a little less cheery. ``I don't have
time for you,'' the caller said _ and clicked off.

2, seated beside him) ``Marge, is that you?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Helen, where were you? I waited in the lobby
until the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``There were heavy rains out my way and I barely
made it here on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Why did you wait until now to speak to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``I didn't recognize you. You've changed your hair.
It was only when I saw your rings as you were applauding at the end
of the act that I realized it was you.''

   My friend Gary Goldsmith came home very late from work and
realized that his wallet was missing. After searching everywhere,
including the grocery store he had just come from, he went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, his phone rang. A voice asked, ``Mr.
Goldsmith, did you lose something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You found my wallet?'' Gary responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look outside your door,'' the voice said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gary could say, ``I'd like to give you a reward,'' the
voice continued: ``Don't worry about a reward. I've helped myself
to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his door, Gary found his wallet, neatly wrapped, with
his credit cards and license intact. But the wallet was $173

fan Rick Marks did. Marks not only got the ``Bad moon on the rise''
part wrong, he also misheard the line, ``I think we're in for nasty
weather'' to read, ``I think we're in for mashed potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another song that has been misheard is ``Witchy Woman'' by The
Eagles. Benjamin Dover, somehow, misheard the title line as,
``OoohhOoo, windshield woman/See how high she flies/OoohhOoo,
windshield woman/She got the moon in her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought,'' said Dover, ``that the song was about some
zoned-out freak riding around in his car while having ghostly
hallucinations through his windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing moment of revelation came, predictably enough,
when Dover read the song title on the album jacket. To his credit,
Dover believes that his version of the lyrics is better than the
original and claims to have convinced at least one friend that his
version is the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   TV theme songs are frequently misheard, which is a double
tragedy as some of these tunes are like steel plates, so
permanently embedded are they in our skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have misheard the line in the theme song to ``All in
the Family'' that goes, ``Gee, our old LaSalle ran great.''
Versions that are either better or worse than the original,
depending on your point of view, include, ``Gee, those were the
salad days,'' ``Gee, I love old sour grapes'' and the truly
bizarre, ``G.R.O. LaSalle Redgrave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones'' theme song has given me trouble ever since
the show debuted in 1960. I speaking specifically of the line
``Let's ride/With the family down the street/Through the/Blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah.'' I thought, possibly, that the missing
line was ``Making friends with all they meet,'' but that didn't
seem likely as Fred's grumpy nature didn't win him a lot of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible possibility might be, ``And see how much old
Fred can eat'' as Fred had quite the appetite, though it was
unclear why anyone would want to ride around with this family just
to watch Fred gorge himself.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after all these years, thanks to The Archive of
Misheard Lyrics, I know that the actual line is ``Courtesy of
Fred's two feet.'' Personally, I think my lyrics are better than
the real ones. And my dog agrees with me.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a warm Sunday afternoon, my husband, Richard, and I, both
native New Yorkers, were entertaining my cousin Kate and her
boyfriend, Paul, from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, after trekking around the city, we
decided to enjoy the view and some refreshments from the top of the
World Trade Center. We were stopped by the lobby elevator
attendant, who said we couldn't go up because Kate was wearing
sneakers, and no sneakers were allowed after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He also informed us that there was a ``real cheap'' shoe store
in the mall just outside the lobby. We went searching, but the
cheapest shoes we could find were $50. OK, we thought, we'll try
the observation deck. Admission for four (without drinks) was $48.
We were stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Then Paul had a brilliant idea. We left Kate in the lobby while
the rest of us went up to the bar at Windows on the World. After
being seated at a table with a spectacular view, we slipped my
shoes into Paul's knapsack. My long, flowing pants covered my bare
feet, not that anyone was looking.
</P>
<P>
   Paul took my shoes down to Kate. The Foot Police never noticed
that the same shoes walked by him twice. The tab for the view,
drinks and hors d'oeuvres for four: $62.

   George Banks' daughter, Karen, a high school sophomore, was
preparing for a world history test, and her father offered to help
her study. ``No thanks, Dad,'' she said. ``Your history was a long
time ago. Newer things have happened that you're not aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Hubsmith enjoyed this switch on the usual _ a
handwritten sign at a Duracell battery display in a Home Depot
store: TOYS NOT INCLUDED.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those days. Martin Hason's first appointment was
at 7:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m. he was an hour behind schedule. He
pushed and shoved through the morning, and by early afternoon was
at his desk with three calls to return.
</P>
<P>
   He was on one of them when call-waiting beeped. He picked up. An
unfamiliar caller with a cheery voice introduced himself as a
broker for an investment firm. The caller went on, ``I'd like to
offer you an outstanding issue of municipal ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, I'm busy,'' Hason said, and clicked off.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hason answered the phone and heard the same voice,
but this time the caller was a little less cheery. ``I don't have
time for you,'' the caller said _ and clicked off.
</P>

front of another.

<P>
   Woman No. 1: (sitting behind Barr and calling out to Woman No.
2, seated beside him) ``Marge, is that you?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Helen, where were you? I waited in the lobby
until the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``There were heavy rains out my way and I barely
made it here on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Why did you wait until now to speak to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``I didn't recognize you. You've changed your hair.
It was only when I saw your rings as you were applauding at the end
of the act that I realized it was you.''

   My friend Gary Goldsmith came home very late from work and
realized that his wallet was missing. After searching everywhere,
including the grocery store he had just come from, he went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, his phone rang. A voice asked, ``Mr.
Goldsmith, did you lose something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You found my wallet?'' Gary responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look outside your door,'' the voice said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gary could say, ``I'd like to give you a reward,'' the
voice continued: ``Don't worry about a reward. I've helped myself
to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his door, Gary found his wallet, neatly wrapped, with
his credit cards and license intact. But the wallet was $173
lighter.

   Two elderly gentlemen, obviously friends, were on a crosstown
bus, sitting near Hy Farber. They began discussing their health
problems, and one went into great detail about his bout with the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   The other man commented that it was fortunate that the friend
had been attended to by a doctor. ``With those symptoms, a person
could die young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend's answer was succinct: ``It's too late for me to die
young.''

   Cynthia Pader saw a pedestal she liked in the window of an

30, old enough to wonder if it really begins at 50.

Volvo.

   &UR; SONGS YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Today's music may sound a lot different than what I listened to
25 years ago, but I take comfort in the fact that the lyrics are
just as indecipherable now as they were then.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, indecipherable lyrics discourage people from
``singing along'' to their favorite song, thus saving the nerves
and ears of the rest of us from irreparable damage. Flailing away
at an air guitar or flapping about the room like a loon in heat is
one thing; attempting to sing, out loud, the chorus of ``Blinded by
the Light'' is another thing entirely.
</P>
<P>
   I mention ``Blinded by the Light'' specifically because few song
lyrics have generated as much confusion in the minds of listeners
as these, written by one of the most incomprehensible composers of
our time, Bruce Springsteen. If you are into computers (and there
is certainly no good reason why you should be), you will find an
entire web page (http://www.kissthisguy.com/) devoted to possible
translations of the chorus, as suggested by hundreds of earnest, if
somewhat underoccupied, fans. Some of the more plausible guesses
include:
</P>
<P>
   _Held up like a loofah by the foreman of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Shot loose like a goose, another runner in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Revved up my big Dodge and did a runner with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   _Rabbit in a lot of juice, like a doughnut in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Racked up like a moose, that's been run over in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Caught up at the juice bar in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _Wake up like a dachshund in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   And my personal favorite:
</P>
<P>
   _Throw up blah blah blah in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   (The actual lyrics, for what they're worth, are: ``Blinded by
the light/Revved up like a deuce/Another runner in the night.''
Just further proof that truth is not always stranger than fiction.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, by the way, is named after one of the more famous
misheard lyrics from the song ``Purple Haze'' by Jimi Hendrix. The
actual lyrics were ``Scuse me while I kiss the sky'' but many fans
(this one included) thought Hendrix said ``Scuse me while I kiss
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Older (or younger) readers who find this error to be rather lame
should keep in mind that this all took place in the '60s and
Hendrix concerts were very loud and the concert halls were
invariably filled with a lot of fog, or something, that distorted
the lyrics. So lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can mishear a lyric, of course, but to qualify as a
classic, a misheard lyric must meet two criteria: 1) You must
believe your misheard version is better than the original, and 2)
You must have convinced at least one other person that your version
is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, I, and millions of other rock fans who suffered
greater or lesser degrees of hearing loss during the '60s, firmly
believed that the Creedence Clearwater Revival song ``Bad Moon
Rising'' contained the lyric ``There's a bathroom on the right,''
when the actual words were, obviously, ``There's a bad moon on the
rise.''
</P>
<P>
   We assumed, I guess, that lead singer John Fogarty was simply
giving us concert-goers some useful information, though, in
hindsight, it did seem like an odd thing to put in a song. In my
defense, I can only say that I didn't take it as far as Creedence
fan Rick Marks did. Marks not only got the ``Bad moon on the rise''
part wrong, he also misheard the line, ``I think we're in for nasty
weather'' to read, ``I think we're in for mashed potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another song that has been misheard is ``Witchy Woman'' by The
Eagles. Benjamin Dover, somehow, misheard the title line as,
``OoohhOoo, windshield woman/See how high she flies/OoohhOoo,
windshield woman/She got the moon in her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought,'' said Dover, ``that the song was about some
zoned-out freak riding around in his car while having ghostly
hallucinations through his windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing moment of revelation came, predictably enough,
when Dover read the song title on the album jacket. To his credit,
Dover believes that his version of the lyrics is better than the
original and claims to have convinced at least one friend that his
version is the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   TV theme songs are frequently misheard, which is a double

KAVA MAY SOOTHE JAGGED NERVES, BUT IS IT SAFE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(ll) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pill that calms you down without making you dull, sleepy or
addicted? It may seem too good to be true, but the prospect of
inner peace with no strings attached is tempting more and more
Americans to try kava, an herbal product derived from the roots of
a pepper plant grown in Fiji, Vanuatu and other Pacific islands.
</P>
<P>
   To many people who suffer from anxiety and insomnia, kava might
seem an ideal ``natural'' alternative to Valium and the other
potentially addicting drugs prescribed to soothe ragged nerves.
Kava is said to have been used for thousands of years in the
Pacific to help people relax and socialize. Unlike alcohol, which
can make people boisterous or belligerent, kava users report that
the herb calms them without dulling the mind or causing hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no scientific studies of kava in human beings in
the United States. Yet Americans spent $15 million on kava in 1996,
and twice that much in 1997, according to the Nutrition Business
Journal, which projects sales of almost $50 million this year. Ed
Smith, president of Herb Pharm, in Williams, Ore., one of about 40
American companies that sell kava, said, ``Kava was virtually
unknown three years ago, and now our sales are going through the
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale price, $14 to $20 for a kilogram of dried root
(2.2 pounds), nearly doubled in the last few years, Smith said.
Kava has become the subject of several popular books, and numerous
Web sites sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific trials of kava have been conducted overseas,
especially in Germany, and have found it helpful in alleviating
anxiety and easing symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, sleep
disturbances and emotional problems. The active ingredients are
chemicals called kavalactones, which have a mildly depressing
effect on the nervous system. The German researchers found no side
effects or withdrawal symptoms when people stopped taking kava.

<P>
   But important questions about kava have yet to be answered. It
is not known whether the products sold in the United States have
the same properties as the ones tested in Germany or the
traditional kava-based drinks prepared fresh in the Pacific.
Researchers also do not know whether kava can be used safely for a
long time or whether it can be combined with other drugs or natural
products. Because it depresses the nervous system, some doctors
warn patients not to take it with alcohol or drugs like Valium that
have the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   Kava is not totally benign. Road signs on some Pacific islands
warn people not to drink kava and drive. In addition, there have
been rare instances of kava abuse among Pacific islanders,
resulting in problems with the skin and liver. All apparently clear
up when the person gives up kava.
</P>
<P>
   The original kava is a far cry from the hermetically sealed
bottles now stocked in American health food stores. An 18th-century
traveler to Polynesia wrote that kava was prepared in a ``most
disgustful manner.'' The freshly dug roots were cut up and chewed
(preferably by virgins), spat into a communal bowl and mixed with
coconut milk or water. The resulting fluid was then strained and
passed around. People had such a good time drinking kava that
Christian missionaries tried to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   On some islands, kava was pounded rather than chewed.
Traditionally, only men drank it. Westerners who have tried kava
say it is bitter and tastes like dirt. It also numbs the mouth. In
his book, ``Kava: Medicine Hunting in Paradise'' (Park Street
Press, 1996), Chris Kilham wrote that he was glad he had worn shoes
to a kava bar on Vanuatu, because the patrons did so much spitting
to get the taste of kava out of their mouths that there wasn't a
dry spot on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the kava sold in the United States is not
prepared in the traditional manner. The roots are dried and ground
by machines into a powder that can be sold as is, for blending into
drinks; put into pills or capsules, or made into an alcohol-based
extract.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael J. Balick, curator of the Institute of Economic
Botany at the New York Botanical Garden, said the demand for kava
was leading growers in Micronesia to begin cultivating upland
forests that should be preserved as watersheds. The Nature
Conservancy, Balick said, is trying to encourage the growers to use
low-lying tracts that are not so critical to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Kava is sold not as a drug but as a dietary supplement and, as a
result, is largely exempt from the control of the Food and Drug
Administration. Supplements, unlike drugs, do not have to be proved
safe and effective and are not tested or inspected by any
regulatory agency. The FDA does not usually investigate a
supplement unless people report problems. The agency has no
evidence of health problems caused by kava, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Under FDA rules, manufacturers may not claim that their
supplements can treat or prevent disease. They can, however, make
so-called structure-function claims, saying, for instance, that a
product promotes strong bones or supports the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   For kava, Smith of Herb Pharm said: ``We can make somewhat
nebulous claims. We can say it enhances well-being, but we can't
say it relieves anxiety.'' Yet people are buying it in the hope
that it will ease anxiety, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to put on the label that it could be used for
relieving anxiety,'' Smith said. ``I know it does.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site devoted to inquiries about kava listed 660
messages in early October. The writers ranged from people seeking
help with anxiety to those looking for a new way to get high. Some
described the results as pleasant, but others called kava useless.
One wrote: ``Got nothing from the first few small hits, then I
downed the remaining two-thirds of the bottle and got a very mild,
slightly relaxing effect for a couple hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roberta Lee, an internist in Tucson, Ariz., who became
familiar with kava while practicing medicine in the Pacific, was
not surprised by that story. There is no way of knowing how much
active ingredient was in the product, Dr. Lee said, or how high the
person's anxiety level might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Lee recommends kava to some of her patients. She said
that its effects were subtle, and that she urged her patients to
use brands from large European manufacturers, which she declined to
name. Because kava is considered a drug in Europe, she said, it is
more carefully regulated than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about patients having access to these herbal
medications without a prescription or any regulation or even
general advice,'' she said. ``People in health-food stores are
giving advice, and they're not pharmacists or medical people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee would like to see the European studies of kava repeated
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know what works on a sort of moderate anxiety
level,'' she said. ``My hunch is that it probably wouldn't be
appropriate for someone with very major anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she said, if kava does prove useful, it will be
``just one tool'' in treating anxiety, along with diet, exercise,
counseling and other forms of therapy.

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY A POLITICAL FOOTBALL THIS ELECTION SEASON
 &HT;    650&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James Gorham has heard it all before, and it always
makes him uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Retired at age 68, he depends on Social Security payments to
make ends meet, especially so he can afford the $210 each month for
his wife's medications. And whenever the politicians talk about
``saving'' the program, Gorham worries that any change might mean a
cut in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like one of those situations where Republicans and
Democrats are using it for a football,'' said the former city
worker, who supplements his income by working part-time at
Washington's Friendship Terrace Apartments.
</P>
<P>
   As Gorham spoke last weekend, the airwaves were already
crackling across the country with congressional campaign ads that
suggest Social Security could be in jeopardy. President Clinton,
recovering from his downcast demeanor after the House voted for an
impeachment inquiry, has come back sounding feisty to raise doubts
about whether Republicans can be trusted with Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will have to decide if they believe that
Social Security should be saved, before this surplus is spent for
other things,'' he said Sunday, the latest in a string of almost
daily accusations that House Republicans were trying to ``raid''
the federal budget surplus to provide tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fired back that Clinton was doing almost the same
thing himself. Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the
National Republican Campaign Committee, charged that the White
House was ``demanding we spend as much as $20 billion out of the
Social Security surplus on new government spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have credibility questions on the super-sensitive
topic, however. Although they tout the federal ``surplus,'' the $71
billion in extra revenue from the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30
comes from Social Security payroll taxes that were used to finance
deficit spending in the rest of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the first overall federal surplus in 30 years is only
a tiny drop in the big bucket of the $5.5 trillion federal debt
accumulated over decades of deficits. At the Congressional Budget
Office, spokesman Hank Cox said, ``We get occasional indignant
letters asking, 'Why are you saying you're in surplus?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, both parties agreed to put off a major
overhaul until 1999, partly so that partisan posturing wouldn't
foreclose reform options.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, scandal-weary Democrats are using the Social Security
issue in many of their House and Senate races this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it's going to get a lot of attention,'' said Olivia
Morgan, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. ``Democrats have always been the protector of the Social
Security system. When Social Security is the issue at hand, we have
the home-field advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, Mayor Roxanne Qualls used the subject to help
shift the discussion away from the president's conduct in her tight
race against Rep. Steve Chabot, a member of the House Judiciary
Committee that will conduct the Clinton impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when many Democrats were distancing themselves from
Clinton, Qualls greeted the president and led him on a tour as he
visited her city for Democratic fund-raising. Since then, Qualls
has been running a campaign ad stressing her concern about Social
Security, a message reinforced by an AFL-CIO ad raising questions
about Chabot's commitment to the program.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Democratic challenger Jim Berryman mounted a fierce
attack on Republican Rep. Nick Smith for proposing overhauling
Social Security to permit more private investments. Smith withdrew
the plan after he was named chairman of a bipartisan congressional
Social Security task force.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas
has jumped to Smith's defense. ``No matter where one stands on
these ideas, we must begin to talk honestly about them in a
forthright manner, without resorting to partisan attacks and
demagoguery during this election year,'' Stenholm said in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Almost any such discussions trigger concerns among Social
Security recipients, who are caught in the political crossfire of
lawmakers whose own government pensions are far more generous than
those offered in private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   When the policy-makers begin suggesting that the program needs
an overhaul and that benefits must be re-examined, recipients often
have a quick retort, recipients at the Friendship apartments had a
quick retort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I both paid into it,'' said Elizabeth Tichenor,
a retired secretary whose husband worked until his death at age 70
and never collected from the Social Security system he had paid
into for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard, so that we would have something to live on
when we got old,'' she said as she sat in the dining room at the
Friendship retirement apartment. ``And thank heavens, because how
would we live?''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed Sheldon Martin, a retired insurance agent, ``Don't forget
that when we were working, we put into it.'' He added of Clinton's
promises to protect Social Security: ``I just hope that he says
what he means.''

STILL LIVING WITH AIDS, AND ENDLESS JOKES ABOUT BANANAS

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When one first meets Jeff Getty, 41, at his Japanese-style loft
in Oakland, Calif., it is hard to think of him as a man who has
lived with HIV and AIDS for 18 years. Getty gives off an air of
vitality. His eyes gleam; he is muscular, articulate and energetic.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign of AIDS is an infusion tube filled with
antibiotics sticking out of his right arm _ an emergency measure he
needs to fend off a nasty lung infection. But Getty has learned to
live with AIDS, even defeating death.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Getty made international headlines when he
persuaded the federal Food and Drug Administration to permit him to
have an experimental bone marrow transplant from a baboon. The
graft did not take, but Getty believes that the radiation treatment
he received as part of the transplant procedure may have extended
his life, along with a succession of experimental therapies and his
``warrior'' attitude about the disease. At any rate, his transplant
was controversial. And the aftermath, surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happens to you, Jeff Getty, when you eat a banana in
public? A. I can't do it. People go ``urk, urk.'' They start
laughing uncontrollably, scratching their underarms, and making
embarrassing jokes like ``How are your friends at the zoo?''
</P>
<P>
   After I participated in the experiment, the jokes really came
hard. It began with gifts of stuffed monkey toys. Next, somebody
made a tape of songs about monkeys. I got a banana holder as a
gift. Then, I went on the Tom Snyder show and he tried to hand me a
banana. There I was, going, ``Tom, don't try to hand that to me on
camera.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought all the ribbing would eventually stop _ especially
since the baboon bone marrow graft didn't take. But this went on
for years. What I suspect it's all about is people alleviating
their own discomfort with what I've done. Q. And what exactly did
you do that makes people so uncomfortable that they make banana
jokes? A. Cross the border of human-centrism. I've come to think
that when we do cross-species research, the people who participate
are thought of as not necessarily 100 percent human afterward.
There's this unconscious sense that the procedure has created
something adulterated, a human-animal. Q. Are you a human-animal?
A. Well, when you take baboon bone marrow and put it into somebody,
that's a pretty strong statement. Bone marrow is the progenitor of
all the cells of the body. It would follow that many of the cells
of the person would become baboon cells _ not just the immune
cells, but also the red blood cells. After the procedure, the
question is ``Is the person 100 percent human?'' With something as
fundamental as a bone marrow transplant, it's questionable. Q. Do
you feel you are not 100 percent human? A. It's not an issue, I
feel. My body rejected the bone marrow rather quickly. But most
people don't know that. To this day, most people think I have
baboon life within me.
</P>
<P>
   You know, when you look at horror movies, you have to wonder:
Why are they so fascinating, these films about werewolves and
things that crawled out of the ocean part fish, part human? Human
culture is full of fascinating mythology about centaurs and
werewolves. And I have the feeling that what I've done is touch
many people's, including many scientists', deep unconscious fear
that xenografting means creating werewolves and monsters.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that's so devastating because there are so many areas
where xenografting is logical and necessary _ is that this is a
fear that many scientists won't admit to. You know, it's not
``scientific'' to be afraid you're making a monster. Q. How did you
get to the idea of doing a baboon marrow transplant? A. I'm a
member of ``The Dobson Project,'' a West Coast think tank on
immunology that was founded by the activist community here. Once a
year, activists and top immunologists meet for three days and look
at ways to restore human immune systems. We design new protocols
for this.
</P>
<P>
   The baboon marrow transplant was one. Baboons have a natural
resistance to HIV. So if one could get a baboon immune system to
engraft temporarily into a human, the question is: Might it help
that human being get rid of the virus? Could baboon cells teach
human cells how to fight the virus?
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to create two immune systems functioning side by
side, the human and the baboon _ what is called ``a chimera immune
system.'' This has been done in animals quite a bit in research.
You can't get one immune system to completely agree that the other
is self and, thus, will not be rejected. You have to trick them
into coexisting, side by side, instead of fighting. Q. How was your
health at the time you wanted the baboon marrow transplant? A.
Very, very bad. It was December of 1995, my worst year. I was
failing all the new drugs and was close to death. So I thought,
``What the hell _ why not go into an experiment that had a
long-shot chance of helping?'' Honestly, I didn't expect to
survive. Q. Weren't officials of the Food and Drug Administration
extremely negative about the procedure? A. Negative? They put
endless obstacles in our way. In the end, we were able to mobilize
a good part of the activist community and the experiment went
forward.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Control the experiments and monitor the people
who are experimented upon. Any person who has had this kind of
xenografting should assume that they might have some unknown
viruses. They should be taught about safe sex and how to avoid
transmitting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But interestingly, a lot of the people who work in animal
husbandry and the veterinary sciences are exposed to all kinds of
animal diseases and they are not being monitored. Q. After the
operation, you had lots of communications from the folks at the
CDC. A. I'll say. Afterward, it seemed to me that the CDC was
hoping to find a baboon virus in me, that they were even
disappointed when they didn't. Every time they'd discover a new
baboon virus, they'd be on the phone saying, ``We want more blood
to see if you've got this one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty gross sometimes. I felt I was carrying the future
of cross-species research on my shoulders. As long as they didn't
find any disease, the research could go forward. But if they found
something, this very valuable possibility for humans might end. Q.
There are people who say you're being humano-centric by encouraging
the use of animals as spare parts for humans. How do you answer
them? A. Oh, you mean the animal rights people? People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals has called for all AIDS research to
stop using animals _ so it's hard to take them seriously. Act Up,
in fact, has demonstrated against them. Frankly, if my life is in
danger or my child's, and a baboon heart would help, I would say,
``Yes, I want to go forward with that.'' Q. At present, humans
receive heart valves from pigs. Why isn't there the same kind of
opposition to that? A. Well, pig valves are another thing,
entirely. They don't carry viruses. And even then, I bet that
people with pig valves get lots of pig jokes. I'm telling you right
now: People who have pig valves on their hearts don't go around
advertising it.
</P>
<P>
   And people who get pig brain isolates, where they place cells
for people with epilepsy and Parkinson's into the brain _ you can
just imagine what will happen there. They are going to be called
``pig-headed.'' And people are going to wonder if they are thinking
right or thinking like a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, if I can't eat a banana in public, what's going to
happen to people with pig implants in their brains?
</P>
<P>
   As xenografting continues, we're going to see, I think, society
having a hard time with it. We're going to see irrational fear of
animal diseases and the shunning of people who've had animal
transplants. It's going to be a long time till this procedure is as
accepted as, let's say, human to human heart transplants have
become.
</P>
<P>
   And think about that, 20 years ago, people were concerned about
cross-racial organ transplants, and this is a much bigger border.
And yet all science tells us, we're heading right for it because of
the shrinking pool of donor organs available for humans and the
growing technology that makes transplants possible. Q. Any regrets
about doing the experiment? A. None whatsoever. I want to stand up
for this.

 &HT;    Clinton's woes become fodder for two more volumes
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The debate over the impeachment of President Clinton may be
moving beyond Congress and political talk shows to the nonfiction
best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Death of Outrage,'' a critical view of the Clinton
presidency by former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, and
``High Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' in which lawyer Ann H. Coulter
states the case for impeachment, are among the Top 5 books on The
New York Times Bestseller List.
</P>
<P>
   This week, two Simon &AMP; Schuster volumes join the burgeoning crop
of works about the scandal. Presidential adviser James Carville
attacks independent counsel Kenneth Starr in ``... And the Horse He
Rode in On'' ($14.95), while in ``The Clinton Enigma'' ($17),
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Maraniss details how the
president's Aug. 17 4 1/2-minute televised national address on his
extramarital affairs reveals his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   Carville's snitty little book, which includes a brisket recipe
and a doctored photo of the independent counsel rifling a Simon &AMP;
Schuster trash container, will probably receive more attention. The
outspoken ``ragin' Cajun,'' who directed Clinton's presidential
campaign and later married Republican strategist Mary Matalin, is a
high-profile television guest.
</P>
<P>
   In ``... And the Horse He Rode in On,'' Carville is his usual
outrageous self, though he is serious about putting ``all the nasty
facts about Mr. Starr in one place where everyone can finally see
what a travesty of justice, and mammoth waste of taxpayer ... money
his investigation is.'' If we let Starr ``continue his jihad,''
Carville writes, ``the mean and menacing essence of him will remain
with us forever like Strom Thurmond or a cheap tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the tone, and if you want the Cliffs Notes, skip to
``Appendix C: Sixty Reasons Why I Don't Trust Ken Starr's
Investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The book most likely will be appreciated only by Starr
detractors, though even they may be weary of Carville's
vituperation. (Even his wife calls him a serpenthead.)
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss' work, however, will probably appeal to a broader
political audience, particularly those who wonder what motivated
the president's self-inflicted political wounds. In little more
than 100 pages, the Washington Post reporter who authored ``First
in His Class,'' the first Clinton biography, paints a sure-handed,
nuanced miniature of hubris.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the president speak on Aug. 17, it struck Maraniss that
the ``uneasy little address, born of necessity, shaped for
survival, delivered with stubborn persistence, argumentative to the
last, brushing off history, clinging to hope, ringing with the urge
to start over and move forward, hated by the elite, grudgingly
accepted by the public, somehow reverberated with all the qualities
of Bill Clinton's melodramatic political life.''
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss uses words, phrases or paragraphs from that night's
rhetoric to review the development of Clinton's political and
religious philosophy, or to reflect on his relationship to wife,
mother, daughter, brother and absent father. He observes that
though the president once revealed his choice of underwear to a
national audience, he is really ``a one-man darkness unit'' who
consistently withholds important information about himself and his
office.
</P>
<P>
   The ``core of the Clinton riddle,'' Maraniss believes, lies in
the president's reference to the liaison with Lewinsky as ``a
critical lapse in judgment.'' It was not an aberration, he writes,
but ``reflected one of the more familiar traits'' of Clinton's
life, ``a recklessness that seemed to contradict his stated beliefs
and imperil his accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss finds the president's attack on Starr ``the most
predictable element in his speech. It was the almost inevitable
result of a personality that explained and rationalized
compulsively; that tended ever to the political strategy of
attacking his attackers.''
</P>
<P>
   If politics is war, Maraniss is right to parse Clinton's
rhetoric: his career has increasingly been defined by a debate over
his words, Maraniss writes. Now, the stakes in that debate have
finally ``reached the level of whether his words constituted
perjury or obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The president remains a bit of an enigma to his biographer, who
has never been able to satisfactorily explain exactly why Clinton
evokes ``a visceral hatred in some people.'' One of the many
ironies of ``the Clinton tragedy,'' he writes, is ``that he was
always his worst enemy, while his enemies, by overreacting, were
often, unwittingly, his strongest allies.''

 &HT;    Glenn's return to space makes lodgings scarce
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still haven't planned your trip to the Kennedy Space Center to
watch John Glenn's historic space shuttle launch? Don't expect a
front-row seat. Or nearby accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who became the first American to orbit Earth in 1962
aboard Friendship 7, is scheduled to blast off aboard the space
shuttle Discovery at 2 p.m. Oct. 29. At 77, he'll be the oldest
space traveler ever.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of a million people are expected to squeeze
into a one-mile area around the space center in Cape Canaveral,
Fla., to witness the launch, with many more watching from rooftops
and roadsides all over Central Florida. Hotel rooms and parking
spaces should be as scarce as Starbucks outlets on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Brevard County Department of Tourism predicts almost all the
hotels within 30 miles of the launch site will be booked, with few
cancellations anticipated. Procrastinators are being steered to
Orlando, about 50 miles west, and even St. Augustine, 118 miles
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sold out for more than a year,'' says Bill
VanEngelenburg, owner of the 126-room Best Western Space Shuttle
Inn, about three miles from the center. ``I haven't seen this kind
of response since the first shuttle launch'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But the Daytona Beach Hilton, 70 miles north, is still taking
reservations for its six-night ``Rocket to the Stars'' package,
which includes lodgings, a view of the launch from the beach and a
champagne toast for $150 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The space center's complimentary parking passes, which are
usually issued to people who ask for them in writing, have been
suspended for this launch to accommodate the large number of
requests from VIPs and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best unofficial places to view the launch are along
the Indian River on U.S. 1 in downtown Titusville and along the
Beeline Expressway, according to the Brevard County Department of
Tourism. But these are expected to fill up very early.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet may be via the space center's $20 launch package,
which includes access to a viewing area in Titusville (about eight
miles from the launch pad), reserved parking and a Glenn space
shuttle T-shirt. More than half the 5,000 packages are still
available, but are expected to sell out by the Oct. 23 ticketing
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting to your viewing destination may be a problem. In
the past, high-profile launches such as the first one after the
Challenger disaster in 1986 have resulted in traffic jams
stretching for miles around the space center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that they can get here an hour or two
before the launch,'' says space center spokeswoman Melissa Tomasso.
``But they need to be here a long time before that.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommends that ticket holders arrive at the Titusville
viewing area by the 6 a.m. opening time. To make the wait more
entertaining, the space center will provide concessions and live
music. And a crew from ``Good Morning America'' is scheduled to be
there, conducting interviews with the Glenn faithful.
</P>

 &HT;    Vanity Fair focuses on 200 women
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably no surprise to most that Vanity Fair ($3.95) has
named Oprah Winfrey as the most influential woman in America.
Winfrey is one of the 200 female legends, leaders and trailblazers
featured in a dazzling pictorial portfolio by Annie Leibovitz and
30 other photographers. Anne Cox Chambers, chairwoman of Atlanta
Newspapers Inc. and former U.S. ambassador to Belgium, is
spotlighted as one of the leading women in media.
</P>
<P>
   Other categories, including entertainment, politics and book
publishing, feature the usual suspects: Madonna, Barbra Streisand,
Jodie Foster, Madeleine Albright, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Janet
Reno, Elizabeth Dole, Patricia Cornwell and Terry McMillan, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Graydon Carter notes that the special report represents a
milestone for the women's movement. ``A portfolio of this sort
would have been impossible 20 or 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   _ BOOKED: One of the newest entries in the magazine field is
Book ($4.95), a publication devoted to literary matters. The debut
issue features a cover story on Tom Wolfe and his novel ``A Man in
Full,'' and interviews with authors Wally Lamb, Anna Quindlen and
Jim Harrison. ``Book won't just be about books,'' says editor
Jerome Kramer. ``We're going to write about people and places and
ideas that are important to people who care deeply about books.''
The Wolfe article offers little new information, but the magazine
has promise.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE NEWSWEEKLIES: Newsweek ($2.95) offers the most interesting
take on ``this tinny new impeachment war.'' Featuring photographs
of a painfully youthful Bill and Hillary Clinton _ all hair,
polyester and smiles _ the cover story, ``The Children of
Watergate,'' compares and contrasts many of the players in
Watergate and Monicagate. Even Henry Kissinger weighs in with an
essay on what it's like to conduct foreign policy in an impeachment
crisis. ``In such an atmosphere, normality and hysteria exist side
by side,'' the grand old diplomat writes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Time ($2.95) magazine offers a baffling special
report on ``How to Make a Better Student.'' Enjolique Aytch, a
17-year-old student at Atlanta's Grady High School, is one of
several kids with inspirational stories to tell, but these lessons
hardly seem revolutionary. The ``new'' tips for parents include: Be
role models, be involved, encourage learning, feed children's
passions and _ here's the wildest concept of all _ treat every
child as an individual. Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   _ BEST SCI-FI: Entertainment Weekly ($2.95) takes us where no
magazine has gone before with a feature on the 100 all-time
greatest works of science fiction. Topping the list, of course, is
``Star Wars,'' the 1977 fable that rejuvenated a genre that had
fallen into a black hole. Close behind is ``Star Trek,'' the cult
series by Gene Roddenberry. Rounding out the Top 5 are ``The
Twilight Zone,'' ``Frankenstein,'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   _ QUICK READS: Savannah, Ga. is not the only coastal city with
colorful characters. In the October issue of GQ ($3.50), Jack Hitt
remembers growing up in Charleston, S.C., with his own version of
Boo Radley next door. Three decades later, he discovers that Dawn
Pepita Langley Hall, who made headlines as one of the world's first
transsexuals, was not what she appeared to be. . . . In its
conspiracy issue, George ($2.95) raises questions about the
mysterious death of Clinton's Whitewater partner Jim McDougal,
probes the murders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, and invites
filmmaker Oliver Stone to speculate about secret plots throughout
history.

 &HT;    Just how dependent are we on numbers in this high-tech world?
Let us count the ways.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Mitch Reiner can remember 61 phone numbers, his Social
Security number, his parents' birthdays, his locker combination,
his kid brother's age (sort of: ``Twel-el-el-ve. Yeah, 12.''), his
best and worst golf scores, the year Columbus sailed for the New
World, and the price and product number of every single smoothie at
Smoothie King.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's because he works there. Still, that's a lot of
numbers to keep track of _ especially for someone who just turned
16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, it's really not much, because it's
everything you think about. All your friends, all the numbers you
know,'' says Mitch, a sophomore at Pope High School in Marietta,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of what we use numbers for every day: phones, pagers,
ZIP codes, bank accounts, security codes, TV channels, clothing
sizes, airline flights, appointments, important dates.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, you do have to know more numbers than you used to,
mostly thanks to technology. We interact with machines instead of
humans more than ever. Instead of bank tellers, we use ATMs;
instead of secretaries, we use voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   No studies have been done on the number of numbers people have
to memorize or the number of numbers a person can memorize. But
anecdotal evidence overwhelmingly points to a greater dependence on
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Arlethia Perry-Johnson, an assistant vice chancellor of the
state Board of Regents, says her number memory load has increased
noticeably in the last several years, partly because of
work-related innovations such as Internet access and new software
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, the tremendous amount of numbers we have to deal
with now,'' said Michael Epstein, a cognitive psychologist at Rider
University in Lawrenceville, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to move around more than they did decades ago. Plus,
there are simply more people using the same 10 numerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people who are using systems requires that we be
more and more specific,'' Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As if you have to tell that to anybody in metro Atlanta, where
beepers, cell phones and fax machines have spawned so precipitously
that we have acquired not one, but two new telephone area codes in
the past three years. Now we have to remember more numbers ... so
we can remember more numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, consider the possible alternatives. Had the father
of 11th-century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci not sent him to an
Arab math teacher when he was young, he wouldn't have introduced
Arabic numerals to the Western world, and we might still be using
the Roman numeral system in the year MCMXCVIII. Enough said, and
apologies to the people who run the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when the phone book was a book, instead of a
five-volume series? Remember when you could count TV channels on
your fingers, with some left over?
</P>
<P>
   If you can, your days of total recall are, um, numbered. Robin
West, a psychology professor at the University of Florida, has done
studies that show people 70 and older have a much harder time than
those under 40 remembering a string of 10 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Memory is fallible at any age, though. Christina Dicks doesn't
have her driver's license yet, and the 15-year-old Roswell High
sophomore can recite nearly 220 numbers, including 26 birthdays and
anniversaries (big family). But her brother's work number eludes
her. So she keeps a list of important numbers in her purse, in
addition to her address book at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can know a number, and then not talk to that person for a
month and forget it,'' Dicks mused.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, what we do and don't remember. You probably don't
memorize your credit card numbers. You don't need to, unless you
habitually lose your wallet, and then you have bigger issues.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people seem to forget their own cell phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know somebody else's cell phone, but I don't know my own,''
said Muriel Shannon, 40. The Griffin resident also doesn't know the
Social Security numbers of her three children _ but she remembers
her ex-husband's.
</P>
<P>
   Buckhead resident David Michaelson, 45, is a serious baseball
fan who has participated in rotisserie leagues for 10 years. He
knows some pretty obscure statistics, such as the fact that Hall of
Famer Rogers Hornsby had the highest batting average in the
National League for six consecutive years, 1920 to 1925. He also
can tell you the year of every car he's ever owned, starting with a
1968 Ford Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask him his license plate number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you,'' he admitted. ``I always have to go
look. I mean, it's on the back of my car.''
</P>
<P>
   The human memory is limitless. People can, and often do,
remember numbers they no longer need, such as old street addresses
and the phone number they had when they were eight.
</P>
<P>
   If memory had a ``do not fill past'' line, then people wouldn't
clutter their mental attics with the number of calories in a Big
Mac (530), the number of feet in a mile (5,280) or the number of
times Elizabeth Taylor has been married. (Somewhere between the
number of Henry VIII's wives and Shaquille O'Neal's shoe size.)
</P>
<P>
   But the human memory actually isn't very good at remembering
abstract concepts such as numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a wide range of relatively arbitrary information that
we have to deal with,'' said William Glassman, a psychology
professor at Ryerson Polytechnic University in Toronto. ``The
problem is that our memory is not well designed to deal with random
pieces of information. Our memory is designed to deal with
information in a context.''
</P>
<P>
   A good memory trick is to give numbers a context by attaching a
mental image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can remember pictures better than intangible things. We can
remember `toy' better than we can remember `equilibrium,'
`kangaroo' better than `vague,'' said David Markoff, a memory
improvement expert from Malibu, Calif., otherwise known as . . .
wait . . . what was it? Oh yeah, ``Memoryman.''
</P>
<P>
   When Markoff isn't hawking his memory self-help courses or
memorizing 50-digit numbers forwards and backwards, he's promoting
the action-packed Memoryman comic strip, in which Memoryman appears
as a tights-clad superhero with ripped quads and the ability to
completely memorize ``TV Guide.'' You may not find this as
impressive as, say, leaping tall buildings in a single bound, but
it's an image you won't quickly forget.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the whole point: to form visual associations with
numbers. Even something as simple as noticing where numbers are on
a telephone keypad or seeing a pattern in a number makes its memory
more durable.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hornsby earned the highest ever National League
batting average _ .424 _ in 1924, and Michaelson is quick to point
out that the last two digits of both numbers are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Perry-Johnson uses numbers significant to her when choosing
access codes and passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to use things that are triggers for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   You can't always choose the numbers you want, though. A popular
trick for remembering random numbers involves using a mnemonic
system to convert them into words or phrases, by substituting
certain consonants for each numeral and then filling in whatever
vowels are needed. According to this system, the number 31
translates into MT. Insert an A and you get the word mat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would have been easier to mentally coordinate 31 with
Baskin Robbins' famed flavors. This system may seem cumbersome, but
proponents assure it's worth it, especially for longer strings of
numbers. Probably the poorest way to learn numbers is rote
memorization, or repeating something over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to think that mnemonics are easier,'' Epstein
said. ``The key is that they're more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of a number also plays a role. Psychologists have
theorized that the average person's short-term memory can retain
between five and nine ``chunks'' of information without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, when learning a long string of numbers, such as your
Social Security number, each number is a memory chunk. After a
while, the entire string itself becomes one chunk and you can
rattle it off without effort.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Keith of Ormond Beach, Fla., whose specialty is training
older people in memory improvement, suggests visualizing numbers in
groups of threes, and imagining funny or silly scenes to accompany
each group. Why funny?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time you went on vacation and nothing happened? It's
like a dream. The last time you were embarrassed in front of
people? You remember every detail,'' explained Keith, who has
dazzled TV talk-show audiences by memorizing the name of every
person in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   You could try to simplify the numbers in your life by choosing
the same digits for all passwords and access codes, as some do.
Should this sacred number ever fall into unscrupulous hands,
however, you risk an empty checking account, charges for long
distance phone calls you never made, malicious e-mail sent in your
name, general pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that could happen anyway because of the Year 2000
Problem, which just goes to show that skimping on numbers isn't
necessarily a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, computer programmers trying to conserve memory
space decided to use only the last two digits of a year for dates.
Under this system, a computer recognizes 1999 as 99 and 2000 as 00
_ which comes before, not after, 99, thus throwing computers'
internal clocks for a wild loop. Companies worldwide are spending
billions trying to fix the problem, and glitches are still
expected.
</P>
<P>
   As technology improves, the numbers in your life will increase.
Cable companies say digital TV, which is just around the corner,
will multiply channel capacity from dozens to hundreds. Phone
companies are heading toward ``number portability,'' which will
allow people to take their phone number wherever they go, thus
eliminating the original meaning of area codes _ and making
10-digit dialing the norm, not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Better work on your number recall _ or buy a portable Rolodex _
because you're going to use more numbers, more of the time.
</P>
<P>
   You can count on it.

 &HT;    Headline goes here on so many lines
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PBS' ``Frontline,'' as it always seems to do, is proving once
again that what you don't know eventually could hurt you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plague War'' (PBS, check local listings) is a piercing bell
toll about the potential threat of world biological terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   You may be watching ``Felicity'' and worrying whether that
pretty little Felicity Porter will indeed buck up and ask Ben to go
to her first college party with her. But out there in the real
world, somewhere in the dark, somebody you don't even know is
working diligently to perfect anthrax, small pox and plague bombs
with the intent of erasing the kind of life you're living right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Biological terrorism is ``not a matter of if,'' one expert says
on tonight's unsettling ``Frontline,'' it's only a matter of
when.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they think about it much or not, Americans know the
threat is real.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic terrorism has struck Oklahoma City and the World Trade
Center in New York. And deadly sarin gas was used to kill 12 and
injure thousands during one terrorist group's assault on a Japanese
mass transit system.
</P>
<P>
   The killer viruses themselves aren't at all pretty. Photos
showing victims of anthrax and small pox are displayed briefly in
this hour in an ugly, ugly testament to the viruses' extraordinary
power to maim, torture and kill.
</P>
<P>
   One expert says a biological terrorist attack ``would be as
close to a living hell as we've ever known.'' And it appears easy
enough to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge is pretty much all on the Internet, experts say.
And one unnamed American _ he's called ``Uncle Fester'' on this
show _ demonstrates mixing a toxin in his own kitchen. The result:
enough stuff in the bottom of his test-tube, he says, to kill
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plague War'' ventures well beyond the terrorist movement to
document years of research in the former Soviet Union for
biological weapons that could have been delivered via strategic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive interview with Ken Alibeck, the defector and top
official in the Soviet program, reveals an intricate, secret system
of research in Siberia, St. Petersburg and other places, resulting
</P>
<P>
   in new _ and evermore virulent _ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax was ``grown by the ton,'' one expert says, adding the
Soviets had ``thousands of scientists and engineers'' devoted to
the project. It was ``so massive and had such capacity it was
unimaginable,'' he says. ``They had really thought about using
these weapons and how to use them and their effects.''
</P>
<P>
   His comrades, Alibeck says, never developed biological weapons
for the battlefield. It was ``for use against civilians. New York.
Los Angeles. Chicago. ...''

   The scene has been played out again and again over the
millennia: A hungry bird spies a bug and pounces, driving its beak
into its hearty insect meal. Now, in a twist on this ancient story,
scientists are training birds to aim at virtual insects,
computer-generated fakes at the heart of a growing field of
ecology.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of such bloodless creatures are being
shaped, colored and directed on the computer screen as researchers
find new ways to explore a wide array of questions about why real
animals act the way they do. The virtual menagerie already in use
by biologists includes spiders, flies, chickens and fish, variously
posed as prey, predators or alluring mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a virtual ecology,'' said Dr. Alan B.
Bond, who along with Dr. Alan C. Kamil, a fellow behavioral
ecologist at the University of Nebraska, carried out a study
reported in the current issue of the journal Nature. ``The blending
of the living animal and the computer model allows us to ask
questions that were inaccessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond and Kamil were interested in the longstanding question of
why members of a single species may have very different color
patterns. One popular hypothesis was that the variation results
when predators focus on hunting down the most common type until it
becomes rare and then switch to hunt whatever has become the common
type in its place. By doing so, they would prevent any one color
type from being hunted into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   But the hypothesis has been difficult to test. Field studies
involved things like leaving out banquets of differently colored
worms fashioned of pastry and coming back to see what the birds had
taken. But while researchers saw that the common type was favored,
they were unable to show that birds actively switched their
favorite from one type to another as frequencies of different types
changed.
</P>
<P>
   On the computer, however, researchers created a virtual
population of differently patterned black-and-white winged moths,
based on the wing pattern of actual underwing moths. The computer
then drew sample moths from the virtual population and offered them
to the birds. Pecked moths were considered killed and were removed
from the population.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers saw that the birds tended to attack the common types
and pass on the uncommon types, just as predicted, as different
types waxed and waned in frequency.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers two months to train each blue jay to
recognize on-screen moths as food items, but once they did,
researchers say the birds went at the images with such vigor that
they had to place a protective shield over the screen to keep the
jays from shattering the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the blue jays were slow to catch on, some animals
respond instantly to a computer-generated meal.
</P>
<P>
   When shown a computer-generated insect, toads ``will look at it,
hop over to it and actually put their tongue on the screen trying
to get it,'' said Dr. David Clark, an animal behaviorist at Alma
College in Michigan who is also doing virtual experimentation. A
praying mantis, he said, will stalk a virtual fly and lunge its
legs at it.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has also worked with spiders and finds that females do
their come-hither leg tapping at the sight of virtual males
performing just the right courtship behaviors. He said he had been
able to tease apart the important elements of courtship by creating
male spiders of varying color patterns (something he said would
have killed real animals if done with paint) and programming them
to perform combinations of behaviors that no actual spider would
ever do.
</P>
<P>
   But not all animals take to computers so readily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried showing snakes mice walking around on a little
screen,'' Clark said. ``I didn't have much luck.'' Lizards were
similarly unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, researchers said, is that computer monitors
are specifically built to reproduce the world for the human eye.
</P>
<P>
   Bird color vision, for example, ``is so very different and so
much better than ours,'' said Dr. John A. Endler, an evolutionary
biologist at James Cook University in Australia, that using color
images may always be an impossibility with them. (Researchers on
the new study used black and white patterned moths.)
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the technology and discovering what animals find
convincing is all part of this new field, just as it was years ago
when biologists began playing taped recordings of frog, bird and
insect songs _ now a tried and trusted experimental technique _ to
see if animals would respond.
</P>
<P>
   Bond and Kamil are also using birds known as Clark's nutcrackers
to study the three-dimensional problem of spatial memory _ that is,
how a bird remembers where it stored all its bits of food _ a
seemingly perfect experimental problem to solve using virtual
reality. But even if the birds are ready, the researchers may not
be.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two months training blue jays to peck a computer
screen, Bond realizes it would take a tremendous amount of work to
train Clark's nutcrackers to react naturally to a
computer-generated three-dimensional space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wouldn't want to think of what you'd have to do to get
reliable virtual reality with a nutcracker,'' Bond said.

SCIENCE WATCH: A HARVEST OF GOLD

   There may be gold on them thar hills. A team of New Zealand
scientists has induced plants to accumulate gold in their tissues
by growing them on ore. If the price is right, the researchers say,
it may be economically feasible to ``mine'' gold by growing
chicory, say, on a pile of mining waste.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using plants to remove metals from soil is not
unheard of. Certain species known as ``heavy accumulators'' have
been used to clean contaminants from polluted sites. But the
researchers, reporting in the journal Nature, say their studies
appear to be the first evidence of significant accumulation of gold
by plants.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers grew chicory, mustard and other species on gold
ore treated with ammonium thiocyanate, used in mining to make the
metal soluble. After several weeks, the plants were harvested and
tested. Depending on the plant, the ore and the amount of compound
used, gold was found in concentrations up to about 20 parts per
million.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, with current gold prices of about $300 an ounce, a
field of greens would yield enough gold to more than pay the cost
of treating the soil, the researchers say. If the price rises, they
say, gold farming could become even more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Color Switch
</P>
<P>
   How does a butterfly change its stripes? Scientists at the
University of Wisconsin have found a biochemical switch that does
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied the Eastern swallowtail butterfly, which
usually develops a pattern of yellow and black stripes on the
wings. But some females appear in basic black, mimicking another
kind of swallowtail that is unpalatable to birds.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfly wings are made of tiny scales that are colored
individually, just before the butterfly emerges from its chrysalis.
Colored pigments are deposited first, then black ones.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated an enzyme, DDC, that controls the
pigmentation process. In the Eastern swallowtail, it is active
early in yellow tissues and later in black ones. But in the
all-black variety, it shuts down during the early phase, preventing
the production of yellow pigment. The scales that would have been
yellow are then colored black when the enzyme ``switch'' turns on
again.
</P>
<P>
   A Methane Rain
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent clouds with a chance of methane showers: That is
the forecast for Titan, Saturn's huge moon, astronomers in Arizona
and Hawaii say.
</P>
<P>
   From the Voyager 1 observations of Titan in 1980, the moon is
known to have a thick atmosphere of nitrogen and methane. But all
that gas has also obscured what goes on in the lower reaches of the
atmosphere. Scientists have theorized that the moon might have a
liquid cycle with clouds, rain and seas, of methane rather than
water. But more recent analyses indicate that Titan's climate might
be drier and less dynamic than was previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The new data, gathered with a telescope and a spectroscope that
use narrow bands of near-infrared wavelengths to ``see'' through
the upper atmosphere, indicate the presence of transient methane
clouds at 5 to 25 kilometers above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to New Fields
</P>
<P>
   Most people with degrees in science and engineering do not have
science or engineering jobs, according to a study by the National
Science Foundation. Using 1995 data, the foundation reported that
2.6 million people with science and engineering degrees held jobs
in the field, while 4.7 million with the degrees worked outside the
field.

   NEW YORK _ The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in
Manhattan will observe its 30th anniversary Wednesday with a gala
at Alice Tully Hall to be broadcast by PBS on ``Live From Lincoln
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Sills serves as host of the broadcast, the pianist Andre
Watts will be the master of ceremonies and the soprano Barbara
Bonney will be among the guest artists. Miss Bonney replaces Dawn
Upshaw, who withdrew because of illness.
</P>
<P>
   In a program of work from Bach to Copland, other guest artists
will join the Chamber Music Society and its artistic director, the
clarinetist David Shifrin. &QL;

   Paying $40 million of taxpayers' money for an abstract painting
by the Dutch master Piet Mondrian earned a rebuke Monday for Prime
Minister Wim Kok of the Netherlands, his finance minister and the
president of the Dutch central bank.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft report, the Court of Audit, an independent body that
investigates government spending, said the purchase of Mondrian's
``Victory Boogie-Woogie'' with public funds was unauthorized and
inappropriate. Official responses were being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-by-51-inch diamond-shaped collage of small squares of
bold blues, reds and yellow, in oil and black crayon, belonged to
the publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse Jr. The highly regarded work
goes on display on Oct. 29 at The Hague Municipal Museum. &QL;

   Halloween may be a couple of weeks away, but sprites are taking
over the Frick Collection beginning at noon Wednesday with the
opening of a new exhibition, ``Victorian Fairy Painting,'' running
through Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Said to be the first comprehensive show ever devoted to this
distinctly British genre, popular from the early 19th century
through the beginning of World War I, this display of 34 paintings
and works on paper is derived from a larger touring exhibition
organized by the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the University
of Iowa Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The artists drew their inspiration from Shakespeare and Sir
Walter Scott, theater, dance, music and even drugs and
spiritualism. &QL;

   Dublin has narrowed the field of candidates to design a $6
million sculpture intended to symbolize the city as the Eiffel
Tower and the Statue of Liberty symbolize Paris and New York. The
short list consists of the London-based architectural firms Ian
Ritchie and McGarry Hunt and the young Dublin architect Jonathan
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   All three designs involve illuminated towers. The new structure
would replace Nelson's Pillar, featuring a statue of the British
naval hero Horatio Nelson, which was blown up by the Irish
Republican Army in 1966 on the 50th anniversary of the Irish
uprising against British rule.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will move through the East on Tuesday. Although
initially rather dry, the front will quickly moisten, spreading a
band of clouds and broken showers eastward from the eastern Great
Lakes. A few rumbles of thunder are also possible, as a potent jet
stream disturbance pivots across the Northeast. While rain may fall
hard for a time, amounts will generally be below one-half inch
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated showers will precede the front in the Middle Atlantic
states. However, the front's passage will be marked by little more
than a shift in the wind direction in the Tennessee Valley and Deep
South. Across Florida, seasonable warmth and humidity will
continue, with widely separated thundershowers developing, mostly
over the south.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty, chilly breezes from the northwest will prevail over the
upper Middle West. A conveyor belt of moist air will cause clouds
and pockets of showers to persist near the northern Great Lakes,
where temperatures will average more than 8 degrees below normal.
Farther west, readings will hold in the 40s over the Northern
Plains despite intervals of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   A complex frontal system will cross the Rockies. Given that
moisture is lacking, most places will be dry with only patchy
clouds. But the atmosphere will gradually moisten over the western
Plains, as winds from the east ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest will be unsettled, as winds blow onshore.
Showers will fall along the coast as well as along west-facing
mountain slopes. Initially high snow levels will fall below 6,000
feet later Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wet Siege
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 inches of rain doused Portland, Maine, from Thursday to
Sunday, with 5.61 inches falling just on Saturday. The latter total
made October 10, 1998, the fifth wettest day in Portland since
records began in 1871. The deluge in eastern New England was caused
by a slow-moving low-pressure system, which continually drew
Atlantic moisture inland, thus fueling protracted rains. October
is, on average, one of the driest months. But growing temperature
contrasts between the Arctic and Tropics can energize potent low
pressure systems, which, when stalled, can produce very heavy
rains.

<P>
   William Bergman knew how he wanted to die. ``He wanted to be
free of pain,'' said his daughter, Beverly, ``and die at home with
us.'' But when Bergman, an 85-year-old retired railroad detective
from Hayward, Calif., contracted lung cancer last February, he got
only half his wish. He died at home, his daughter said, but in
miserable pain.
</P>
<P>
   To experts in end-of-life care, it is a familiar tale: An
elderly patient dies in intractable pain. But Bergman's daughter
has set out to give this old story a different ending and in the
process has touched off an intense debate about how best to improve
the treatment of the dying.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Compassion in Dying Federation, an Oregon
group whose director helped legalize assisted suicide in that
state, Ms. Bergman filed a complaint to the Medical Board of
California, asking that her father's doctor be disciplined for
failing to prescribe powerful narcotics that could have given
relief to the dying man.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was unsuccessful. In August, the board wrote Ms.
Bergman that while ``pain management for your father was indeed
inadequate,'' no disciplinary action would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Bergman's complaint represents a new tack in
the long-running campaign by patient advocates to improve care of
the dying. For decades, doctors have worried that they might be
disciplined, or even face criminal prosecution, for the aggressive
use of morphine and other narcotics to control pain. Now, some
advocates are trying to swing the pendulum in the other direction,
by pressing authorities to punish doctors for not using pain
medicine aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that doctors can get into trouble for
overprescribing; everybody knows that,'' said Dr. Joanne Lynn,
president of Americans for Better Care of the Dying, a nonprofit
group based in Washington. ``We need a counterweight that you can
also get into trouble for deliberately underprescribing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Tucker, director of legal affairs for Compassion in
Dying, says doctors must learn ``that there is a professional risk
if they fail to treat pain adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say it is unfair to discipline doctors, many of whom
have not been educated about how to properly care for patients in
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it difficult to justify punishing people for doing
things that they were not educated to do,'' said David Joranson,
director of the Pain and Policy Studies Group at the University of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   So far, complaints to state medical boards about undertreatment
of pain have been rare, said Dale Austin, deputy executive vice
president of the Federation of State Medical Boards, which
represents 69 licensing authorities around the nation. But Austin
calls it ``an up-and-coming issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey conducted last year, Joranson's group found that 8.1
percent of state medical board members questioned knew of doctors
who had either been investigated or disciplined for undertreating
pain. That was up from 5 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a year since the Supreme Court, in
rejecting a constitutional right to die, noted that dying patients
do have a right to the brand of medicine known as ``palliative
care,'' which focuses on controlling pain and providing comfort.
Many doctors and nurses say that patients who contemplate suicide
might not do so if they were confident their pain would be
adequately treated.
</P>
<P>
   But studies show that patients routinely suffer pain that could
be relieved, in part because of lingering fears among doctors about
the consequences of prescribing narcotics too liberally.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to ease those fears, many state licensing
authorities have adopted new policies on pain management in recent
years. California's guidelines, revised in 1994, are typical. They
say that doctors will not be disciplined for prescribing powerful
pain medications if they take a proper medical history, outline a
treatment plan, obtain informed consent from their patients,
monitor the use of the drugs and keep detailed records.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Federation of State Medical Boards published a
similar set of model rules for its members to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as the medical boards have been trying to reassure
doctors, Congress has been making them uneasy. Both the House and
the Senate are considering bills that would enable the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration to investigate doctors who write
prescriptions for lethal doses or combinations of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is intended to overturn Oregon's assisted
suicide law. But it is opposed by a broad coalition of doctors'
groups, including the American Medical Association, which say the
law would have a chilling effect on doctors who write legitimate
prescriptions for pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   A similar chilling effect exists in states where doctors must
write multiple prescriptions for controlled substances on a special
pad _ one copy for the doctor, one for the pharmacist and one for
state drug enforcement authorities, who monitor the prescriptions
in an attempt to curb trafficking in illicit narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   When Bergman was discharged from the Eden Medical Center in
Castro Valley, Calif., his internist, Dr. Wing Chin, prescribed
Vicodin, an oral analgesic that did not fall under the so-called
triplicate requirement. Bergman's daughter said she asked for
something stronger, but, records show, Chin said he could not
immediately order anything stronger because he did not have his
triplicate pad with him. Instead, Bergman was given an injection of
a pain reliever and a skin patch that contained a narcotic.
</P>
<P>
   Chin declined to be interviewed. But end-of-life care experts
say the triplicate requirement, recently eliminated in New York,
often keeps doctors from prescribing the most powerful narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge deterrent,'' said Lynn. ``You have to use the
prescriptions in sequence. You can't put a pad in your office and a
pad in your black bag and a pad in the hospital, and if they are
stolen there is hell to pay. A lot of times, a doctor will try to
substitute a less potent drug that doesn't require all this
documentation.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, managing pain is a tricky business, and experts
say standards may vary with each individual case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with pain is that it is sometimes easy to manage _
and sometimes very difficult,'' said Dr. Diane Meier, director of
the palliative care program at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New
York. ``It is easy to say that a doctor was incompetent. But that
doctor might have been doing the best job humanly possible, and
still fail.''

IN PEER REVIEW, EXPERTS OFTEN SKIP OVER DIRECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times) 
(ll) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   How well do doctors follow directions?
</P>
<P>
   Not very well, apparently, when it comes to a standard practice
followed by medical journals.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, editors of scientific publications have called on
experts, or peers, to review the findings submitted for publication
to check on the methods that researchers used to justify their
conclusions. Each publication has its own set of directions for
reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that many reviewers rely on their own criteria
without reading what editors ask them to. Dr. Roy M. Pitkin, the
editor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in Los Angeles, long suspected
that reviewers ignored the editors' instructions. So he inserted
this sentence in the letter his journal sent to 122 reviewers: ``If
you have read this, call or fax our office, we will give you a gift
worth $20.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 reviewers, or 17 percent, claimed the gift, a
long-distance phone card, said Pitkin, who published his findings
in The New England Journal of Medicine, which also uses peer
review. Among the first-time reviewers, the rate was even lower, at
10 percent, Pitkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Does it mean scientists are not paying attention? Some aren't so
sure, suggesting instead that it is all in the incentives. Perhaps,
among eminent obstetricians, $20 just isn't worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   One respondent thought that claiming the reward would be
worthwhile and gave the phone card to his daughter at college. But
Pitkin laughed and said the obstetrician later told him that the
daughter ``still hasn't called home.''

TALIBAN'S LATEST CRACKDOWN TARGETS MEN WHO TRIM THEIR BEARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PUL-I-CHARKI, Afghanistan _ The commandant himself summoned
them, so the inmates walked briskly across the dusty prison yard,
these 75 men jailed here because they had illegally trimmed their
beards.
</P>
<P>
   Grooming can be a man's undoing in Afghanistan. As the ruling
Taliban interpret the Koran, an adult male is obliged not only to
grow a beard but also to leave the hairy underbrush unmolested by
scissors. Scruffiness is required by law. Fidel Castro would be
considered appropriately whiskered; Pavarotti would not.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago the Taliban began getting tough on trimmed beards
in Kabul, the capital. Patrols from the General Department for the
Preservation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice now snatch violators
from the bazaars and bring them six miles to Pul-i-Charki, a
notorious prison where earlier governments made sadistic use of
electrodes and hot stoves.
</P>
<P>
   The commandant, Ghiasuddin Mazhari, 30, a well-muscled man
wearing a white long-tailed turban, took a seat on a rock near a
tomato patch. The prisoners, like children at story hour, sat
cross-legged before him in the dirt. An aggressive sun basted
everyone with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men are brought here for 10 days, given religious
instruction and then released,'' Mazhari said with a sweep of his
hand. ``We do not treat them harshly. As you can see, in this area
there are no locks on the gates, and men can move freely about.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old prison has fallen into disrepair, with many of
its iron doors torn from their hinges. Nothing prevented these men
from escape except the automatic weapons and grenade launchers of
the guards.
</P>
<P>
   A prisoner named Mohammed Arif, 34, volunteered to speak first.
The owner of a small pharmacy, he had a thick, raven beard, and his
guilt was as plain as this hair on his face, all of it barbered to
an incriminating evenness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been brought here to be informed that the Prophet
Mohammed, peace be upon him, had a beard and that as proud Muslims
we also should have them,'' Arif said, as if reciting some
memorized oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are treated here as guests and brothers,'' he said, ``and
we are all under the guidance of our teachers, who instruct us in
the ways of Islam. The beard is a necessary part of every man, and
we display it as a way to propagate our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The commandant nodded his approval, as did several prisoners. A
second inmate then used this opportunity to describe the
spirituality of the prison's daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get up for prayers at 4:30 a.m., perform our ablutions
together and recite the Koran,'' said Samin Jan, also a shopkeeper.
``Then we sit like brothers and have proper tea and breakfast
before spending the rest of the day in learning and prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan had a shamefully modest amount of facial hair for a man of
34. His excuse, like that offered by many of the beard-deficient,
was recent travel out of the country. Afghanistan's Islamic
neighbors Iran and Pakistan have a more relaxed attitude about
whiskers. To many there, a clean shave is a mark of prosperity and
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want people to think I was a refugee,'' Jan said.
</P>
<P>
   As others spoke up apologetically, it was impossible to know how
much of what they said was cautious performance and how much
genuine penitence.
</P>
<P>
   Faiz Mohammed, 45, the owner of a general store and a father of
six, seemed to be a dignified man with wire-rimmed glasses and a
salt-and-pepper beard. ``I have learned more in the past few days
than in my entire life before,'' he said enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners sleep on the concrete floors in Pul-i-Charki's large
vaults. Blankets are lined up neatly against the walls. Some men
are permitted two of these covers, so one can be rolled into a
pillow or used as a thin mattress. A single bulb provides weak
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to be here,'' said Mohammed Faisel, only 18. ``This
is better even than home.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the proud commandant and his heavily armed entourage finished
giving the tour, there was sudden activity outside. Mullah Gul
Mohammed, a military chief of the virtue and vice patrols, had
arrived with 15 new prisoners and decided to pause for tea.
</P>
<P>
   An imposing man with long crow's feet beside his eyes, Mohammed,
45, has a congenitally deformed foot and uses an old walking stick.
He acted sternly at first, concerned that photos might have been
taken. Many of the Taliban believe that Islamic teachings proscribe
any images of the human figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please do not think us brutal,'' the mullah said, finally
turning genial after his tea had been poured. ``We bring these men
here only to educate them in Islam. We are good to them. We have
just sent a man home after only five days because he was old and
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed's vigilantes are feared in Kabul. Cruising in pickup
trucks and flying white flags of purity, they thrash women caught
outside without a burka, an all-enveloping garment that hides even
their eyes. They also confiscate music cassettes and televisions.
</P>
<P>
   For them beard enforcement has become a challenge that requires
an experienced hand. ``The trimmed beard is hard to the touch,''
the mullah said. ``A proper beard is soft.''
</P>
<P>
   He beckoned for more tea and joked about the beard lengths of
the dozen men seated near him. These days it is easy for him to be
lighthearted. By his judgment the beard campaign has been a
success. He credits much of this to the rigorous religious tutoring
at Pul-i-Charki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to have a case where a man has been caught
twice,'' he said, smiling triumphantly. ``One time seems to be
enough.''

`CHASING EL NINO': A BOLD ASSAULT ON EL NINO'S MYSTERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ll) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ``Nova'' ventures on the track of El Nino, the
mysterious phenomenon that every few years rages out of the Pacific
Ocean to wreak havoc around the world. Its impact in 1997 and 1998
is fresh in memory.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when El Nino strikes is lamentably clear; the
puzzle of why has sent a team of scientists, the focus of Tuesday's
program, patrolling the Pacific with a long line of data-collecting
stations.
</P>
<P>
   What the scientists know already is that El Nino disrupts normal
weather patterns: Trade winds may reverse direction, sending the
warm water that normally moves toward Australia and Indonesia back
toward the South American coast, with infamous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1982-83 El Nino, areas of Peru, which was hit first,
received 30 times the normal rainfall; the flooding cost Peru some
$1 billion in damages and 600 deaths. Worldwide damage came to $13
billion and 2,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Put in place in 1994, the El Nino detection system, perhaps the
largest scientific instrument ever built, is kept afloat by buoys.
Constantly monitoring the Pacific's winds and waves, the system's
70 stations can come up with hints of suspicious changes and may
deliver an El Nino forecast, as they did in 1997. But what was
predicted to be a minor event, as one forecaster concedes and
television viewers may recall, turned out to be a ``whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   A result was destruction from Africa to California, where
meteorologists can be seen flying smack into the storms to measure
their impact. It makes for quite a show, and the only sure
prediction about El Nino is that it will come again.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I submitted a draft report to my
manager, and when he reviewed it with me, he mentioned several
times that the spelling was atrocious. He made no substantively
negative comments regarding the content, but he circled every
spelling error, and then said I should take more pride in my work.
I said this is just a draft, but he said that does not matter. What
do you think? R.G.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Since your manager spelled out what he is seeking in a
draft report, why not hit ``spell check'' before submitting these
reports to him? This is a situation in which you are both arguably
right, with the emphasis on arguably. However, there is no point in
turning this situation into an issue.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, spelling is a critical reflection of the
quality of any given written material. When a report is laden with
spelling errors, the assumption is that the overall report is
sloppy, and whoever wrote it did not do his or her best.
</P>
<P>
   For other people, spelling is not a major concern, particularly
on a draft. Their focus is on the content, and the assumption is
that spelling errors can be corrected later. Interestingly, one
additional influence in this area is e-mail, where many of the
rules of spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are often
jettisoned into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is not the case for your manager. If you want to
work productively with him, remember that his priority list
includes a spelling list.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are a medium sized company, and my boss told me it's time
to have an employee newsletter, and he wants me to be in charge of
it. I hardly have enough time to do my own job, but when I said
this to him, he said he knows I can handle it. Now what do I do?
S.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: This newsletter does not have to be bad news for you. Your
boss has confidence in you and has presented an opportunity to
stand out. Before you refuse to deliver the paper, perhaps you
should do some research as to what this really entails.
</P>
<P>
   Make a few phone calls to other companies, check out the local
bookstore and library, or do an Internet search, so that you can
learn about company newsletters. There is a vast spectrum of
approaches, ranging from glitzy-glossy editions put together by
outside services, all the way to a typed one page monthly
announcement of employee birthdays and a restatement of the
vacation policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since you are obviously busy with other work responsibilities,
try to find a newsletter formula that fits within your time
constraints. In this age of desktop publishing, there are several
user-friendly programs that can help you produce a quality
newsletter. Approached under terms that are acceptable to you, this
project can be an excellent way for you to get some good management
experience and some good press as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the law firm where I work, the raises have decreased in
frequency and amount, and new employees with lesser skills are
being brought in at a salary close to mine, although I am the lead
secretary. My review is late, and my raise is lower than the rest
of the staff. Going over the office manager's head leads to a
serious repercussions. I feel my options are limited because of my
age and recent health problems. Short of changing jobs, do you have
any suggestions? L.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: You would like the firm to show you the money, but the only
thing the firm is showing is ineptitude. The larger issue is the
firm's apparent lack of interest in employee communication,
satisfaction, and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Your best hope is to try to turn your office manager into your
advocate. Go back to this person and let him or see the measurable
costs associated with your current pay situation, and the major
benefits associated with a more equitable pay system. You should
approach this person in a sales mode, and try to mirror his or her
speech patterns, body language, and general style.
</P>
<P>
   If you end up with ``no sale,'' it will be important to come to
grips with the realities of this situation: You are not satisfied
in your job, there is no one to help you within the firm, and you
are staying on board primarily because of perceptions about your
marketability due to age and recent health problems. You are being
unfair to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   In today's labor market, you may have more going for you than
you think. Besides, staying in a dissatisfying job is not good for
your health. Although you asked what to do short of changing jobs,
something needs to be changed, and it sounds like the firm may be
very firm indeed.

RUSSIA MAKES 11TH-HOUR PITCH TO AVERT NATO STRIKES IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-NATO) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia mounted a last-ditch campaign Monday to avert
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, warning that it may signal an
end to cooperation with the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of Russia's diplomacy reflected the ascension of
Yevgeny Primakov, the foreign minister turned prime minister who
has often cast Moscow as a wounded great power in an open-ended
struggle with the West.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign minister, Primakov had no higher goal than to
circumscribe NATO's influence and contest American dominance. He
repeatedly described the Balkans as historically an area of Russia
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Russia orchestrated a full-court press.
</P>
<P>
   First Primakov told Italy's acting prime minister, Romano Prodi,
that NATO strikes would be a ``tragic mistake'' that threatened
cooperation between Moscow and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Then Russia underscored its unhappiness by recalling its
representatives to NATO headquarters. A Russian general even
engaged in a bit of saber-rattling by threatening to ship arms to
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Russia's leverage is somewhat limited.
</P>
<P>
   Russia cooperation with NATO has never amounted to very much.
Its representatives at NATO headquarters are primarily interested
in fighting old wars over NATO expansion, not finding new ways to
work together.
</P>
<P>
   The sole exception has been the deployment of Russian
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, an arrangement that is widely
regarded as successful but not indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Parliament could vote down the second strategic arms
reduction treaty, and obtaining Russia's approval of the accord is
a high American priority.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of the treaty is already in doubt in the
Communist-dominated Parliament. And Primakov has publicly said
approving it is in Russia's interest, as its missiles are getting
old anyway.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has never been popular with the Russian public. But with
Russia's economy in a state of near collapse, Western intervention
in the Balkans appeared to be primarily an obsession of Russia's
political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Primakov has proved to be very skillful at playing a weak
hand. As foreign minister he helped negotiate the Founding Act,
which set the terms of NATO's expansion to the East.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's strategy Monday appeared to be to influence some of
the waffling members of the alliance by threatening a rupture in
NATO-Russia cooperation. The approach also distances Moscow from
NATO in the event the strikes go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Ivanov, Primakov's former deputy and his successor as
foreign minister, Monday described NATO military intervention as
``a very dangerous decision which brings us to the red line, after
which, from our point of view, some very hard consequences may
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said NATO military action
would lead to an annulment of agreements between Russia and the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko faction, was a
rare voice of moderation.
</P>
<P>
   From the hospital where he is being treated for a heart attack,
he said the Yeltsin government had not been tough enough with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and urged Russia and NATO to
find common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, for one, seemed to appreciate the Kremlin's help.
Monday it announced that Borislav Milosevic, the president's
brother, would be its next ambassador to Moscow.

 &HT;    News of acquisition drops Snow's shares to 52-week low
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beazer Homes has acquired most of the assets of Snow
Construction of Orlando, but the company's shares closed at a
52-week low Monday after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunwoody, Ga.-based builder is now the fourth-largest home
builder in that part of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed at $16.81 1/4 a share, down 31 1/4 cents. Last
week, Beazer and several large U.S. home builders saw their stock
prices take hits as investors were concerned that industry profits
would shrink from the record-setting levels of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   On April 7, Beazer Homes shares were selling at a 52-week high
of $27.12 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Beazer Homes' Florida deal is in keeping with the company's
strategy of expansion by acquisition. From Snow, Beazer acquired
six subdivisions, 300 lots and a 70-home backlog. Prices in the
subdivisions range from the $100,000s to the $400,000s. Although
that is a bit high for Beazer's traditional market of first-home
and first-move-up buyers, Chief Financial Officer David S. Weiss
noted that Orlando tends to be an upscale market in which the top
tier of first-move-up houses could be in the $400,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Snow is Beazer Homes' second Orlando-area deal in 12 months. The
company bought Calton Homes last November for $16.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Snow transaction is worth $13 million in backlogs. Weiss
declined to say what percentage of that would show up in profits.
However, he did say the company is comfortable with Wall Street's
$1.28 per-share estimate for the quarter ended in September. Those
fourth-quarter results, and fiscal year 1998, will be released
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Beazer Homes' mortgage business, now two years old, ``added a
fair amount to our profitability _ between 25 and 50 basis points
to our operating profit margins (in fiscal 1998),'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Beazer Homes has operations in the Southeast, Southwest and
Texas, and employs 1,143 people.

 &HT;    NBA, union take final stab at settlement
 &HT;    (EDS: Can run with BKN-STERN, a Q and A with Commissioner
Stern.)
 &HT;    By Jeff Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In probably their last chance to save the opening
weeks of the regular season, the NBA and the NBA Players
Association meet in New York today for the first full negotiating
session since team owners walked out of a meeting in August.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides met last Wednesday, when the league answered
questions about a 17-page proposal it made in late September. The
players have complained that the most recent offer is too
restrictive and that it includes language that Hawks center and
union vice president Dikembe Mutombo termed insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is we must have some cost certainty in any
agreement, at least percentage certainty,'' commissioner David
Stern said.

 &HT;    Q and A with NBA commissioner David Stern
 &HT;    By Jeff Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With hope for the Nov. 3 season opener fading, the NBA
and the NBA Players Association sit down today in New York to
discuss the league's recent offer. In an interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution staff writer Jeffrey Denberg, NBA commissioner
David Stern talks about the stakes and the background of the
league's 104-day lockout of players.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you don't reach agreement soon, can you save the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not sure. Frankly, the baseball owners and hockey owners
(both hit by long strikes) were wrong in their assessment and
that's what we preach to our owners, that they should not think
that this will be short. They should be prepared for the long haul.
The rallying cry of the union _ to foster unity _ has been, ``We
made a bad deal the last time and the owners are trying to make it
worse; the owners think we'll fold after one paycheck.'' We've said
exactly the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Players say repeatedly the owners are rich men making huge
profits, but trying to deny them their fair share. How do you
respond to that?
</P>
<P>
   A: They make the point that franchise values have gone up.
That's absolutely true and if owners sell, they will make money. .
. . Players' salaries have gone up from $60 million in '83 to a
billion now and franchise values have kept pace at similar
multiples. It has been a good system for both sides. So, we're
saying to them, we're willing to raise expenses but not at the same
rate as they've been raised in the last three or four years. We
promise in writing it will go up 20 percent over the next four
years. . . . In light of what's going on with the world markets _
Asia is under duress, Brazil and Latin America struggling badly,
the dollar getting pounded and all that impacting the United States
_ a commitment of 20 percent over four years is probably one of the
largest collective bargaining commitments being made in America.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In response to the 17-page offer you presented to the players
two weeks ago, the union charges there are too many restrictions,
too many details after such a long period of inactivity. How do you
respond?
</P>
<P>
   A: Perhaps we should have done this a little earlier but we
couldn't even agree to meet, so the notion of sending a proposal
didn't make a lot of sense. Still, I've been around here long
enough to know, hey, we'd better have something on the table
because as the season begins to dwindle away there are going to be
meetings and we'd better know what we are talking about. . . . The
first deal, I tell you, would have been a good deal for players and
owners alike. The second deal had huge risk for owners because of
the removal of taxes and the addition of other options. But given
the fact there had been work stoppages in three other sports, we
made it and took our changes albeit with the safety valve of being
able to re-open (negotiations). And that brought us to our present
circumstances. Look, people tell us if we had left the previous
agreement intact we would have had three more years of labor peace.
But my argument is that if you are making an automobile for $15,000
and selling it for $14,000, labor peace doesn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is this impasse agent-driven? Some see the hand of David Falk
in the players' stance.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think that was fair to say last time. This time it's easy
to bash agents. But I have no proof of that and I have no suspicion
of it. Look, this is driven by historical force. We hear the
players saying that the owners are getting a $3 billion TV
contract, we want a piece of it. They are getting a piece of it.
They're getting 57 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The percentage of income that baseball and football pay to
players is in the 60s. Why are they able to pay a higher percentage
than the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   A: Baseball is a losing proposition. The majority of teams are
losing money. If you gave me the NFL's network television revenues,
our percentage would go up hugely. If your costs are set and your
incremental revenue is just network television money, you can pay a
higher percentage of each additional dollar to the players. We
would make the deal in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Although the league average salary is $2.6 million, many
veterans like Tyrone Corbin of the Hawks are limited to minimum
salary by cap circumstances. Hasn't the system failed them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. We agree the Ty Corbins of our league shouldn't
have to play for the minimum ($326,000 in '97-98). We say they
should play for $750,000. And beyond that we're also open to making
sure that the money to pay them comes out of some other source so a
team won't be tempted to hire a two-year guy at $300,000 to save
cap room. That's easy enough to do but at the end of the day it has
to come from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The NBA receives payments from NBC and Turner whether or not
there are games. So, what is the incentive to play games?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our teams won't have any immediate cash flow problems. But as
you know, the TV payments are not a windfall. They ultimately have
to be repaid in terms of product or cash payment. There are a
handful of teams that will do better by not operating than if they
had to operate under (the old agreement), but if they didn't want
to play games they wouldn't be in the business.

 &HT;    Akinwande may be 'open' to postponing fight with Holyfield
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The manager for heavyweight Henry Akinwande said
Monday the top contender would be open to putting off his mandatory
title shot against Evander Holyfield, thereby clearing a major
hurdle for a unification fight between Holyfield and Lennox Lewis
as early as February.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Courreges said Akinwande, whose bout with Holyfield in June
was voided when he tested positive for hepatitis, might be willing
to accept compensation in lieu of rescheduling the fight
immediately. Akinwande, who has not yet been relicensed, could get
``step-aside'' cash and a contract to fight the winner of
Holyfield-Lewis. ``Henry might be upset, but if the deal is good
for him, I'll put sense in his head,'' Courreges said.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King arrived in London on Monday to try to complete
a deal for Holyfield with the Lewis camp. He was optimistic,
saying, ``I don't know when and I don't know where the fight will
take place, but we are going to work to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest potential deal-breaker is King negotiating his own
guaranteed earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who owns the WBA and IBF titles, likely would make
about $20 million. Lewis, the WBC champion, would get $10 million.

 &HT;    Key to Virginia's defensive success is consistency, coaching
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The University of Virginia and outstanding defensive
play have become synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers went on a four-year tear through 1996 where they
were no worse than third in the nation in pass interceptions and
have been in the top 20 in scoring defense for six of the past
eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign is no exception. The Cavaliers are second in the
ACC and 10th in the country in total defense, allowing 272.6 yards
per game, while leading the ACC and ranking fourth nationally in
scoring defense at 10.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator year after year has been defensive
coordinator Rick Lantz, who is in his eight season in
Charlottesville, Va. Lantz will be making a homecoming of sorts
Saturday when the seventh-ranked Cavaliers meet No. 25 Georgia Tech
at Bobby Dodd Stadium. He served as defensive coordinator at Tech
under Bill Curry in 1982 and '83.
</P>
<P>
   ''We play an aggressive defense,'' Lantz said. ''We put people
in position to make plays. What we don't do is have them sitting
and reading and reacting on the line of scrimmage. We've developed
a couple of pressure-type packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Lantz and head coach George Welsh have managed to stockpile an
outstanding array of talent, led by All-America candidate Anthony
Poindexter at safety. In the Cavs' last game, Poindexter dominated
Duke, recording 11 tackles, two interceptions and one fumble
recovery in a 24-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line has been a pleasant surprise. Its leader is
Antonio Dingle, who is cool and ice to Dingle's fire and fury.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken player who has been known to trash-talk during a
game, Dingle wears red contact lenses. Looking across the line and
seeing a 300-pound man with red eyes has unnerved more than one
offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he'd just keep his mouth shut and play, he'd be better
off,'' Lantz said. ''But he's tried to do things the right way this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingle is the strength of the defensive front and he's drawing
the attention of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Dingle tends to draw most attention from the opposition. ''We
have put him in a situation a lot of times where he's getting
double-teamed,'' Lantz said. ''But if they stay down on him too
long, they might find a linebacker running through the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive boss says Virginia's biggest test to date will
come Saturday against the potent Yellow Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tech is really talented,'' Lantz said. ''They don't create
theory problems, but they create concentration problems. They run
the same people with a two-back formation, then go to three backs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a Joe (Hamilton) admirer,'' Lantz said of the Tech
quarterback. ``And their receivers ran by those defenders on the
tape we saw of the (North Carolina game. They're good.''

 &HT;    For Commodores, schedule doesn't get easier
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Vanderbilt lost a 27-24 non-conference game to
Western Michigan Saturday on a last-second field goal, even upbeat
second-year head coach Woody Widenhofer was downcast.
</P>
<P>
   So were his players, some of whom wept openly in the locker
room. The Commodores, who haven't won since a 17-7 triumph over
Northern Illinois on Oct. 11, 1997 _ come to Athens against
13th-ranked Georgia Saturday at 0-5 and carrying the heavy baggage
of a 21-game SEC losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Vandy has played the Bulldogs tough recently at Sanford Stadium,
ruining Georgia's homecoming with a 43-30 win in 1994 and holding
on late before losing 13-2 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Commodores are missing seven starters from the
conference's top-ranked defense last year and are using a multitude
of underclassmen at key positions.
</P>
<P>
   Vandy hasn't beaten an SEC team since a 14-10 win over Kentucky
in 1995, and ending its SEC misfortunes this year looks like an
increasingly dim prospect, with Florida, Kentucky and Tennessee
still ahead. A loss to Georgia also would ensure Vandy's 16th
straight losing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even talk it or think about it,'' Widenhofer said of
the losing streak. ``We're proud to be in the SEC. It's a tough
conference (in which) to win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, they didn't know how to handle even modest
prosperity, blowing an early 14-0 lead to trail 24-14 before
rallying in the fourth quarter. Placekicker John Markham evened the
contest at 24-24 with a 46-yard field goal with 37 seconds
remaining, but he missed two other makeable attempts in the final
period. Western Michigan, which began the winning drive on its own
20, reeled off a 43-yard pass play to get into field goal range and
judiciously used two timeouts before booting through the winning
points as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Vandy lost 19-16 in overtime at TCU the week before. Both losses
were precipitated by turnovers and penalties, things that its
previously stellar defense had been able to withstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good defense the last two years that kept us in a lot
of games,'' Widenhofer said. ``But we've got a new group now that's
getting better every week. It may not show in the results, but
we're playing our best players.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen are playing a larger role than Widenhofer would like.
Of Vandy's 85-man roster, 61 players are no better than redshirt
sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman tailback Rodney Williams has been a godsend.
His 156-yard effort against Western Michigan gave him three
straight games rushing for 100 yards or more, something done only
one other time by a Vanderbilt player.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Dave Wallace stepped in as the starting quarterback
after a 42-0 opening loss to Mississippi State and has been making
gradual progress. Redshirt freshman Jamie Winborn has been a
stopper at middle linebacker, inheriting All-America Jamie Duncan's
shoes and leading the team in tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Widenhofer, once the mastermind of the Pittsburgh Steelers' Iron
Curtain defense, admits that maintaining patience for a long-term
payoff is becoming increasingly difficult. But he really has no
choice to approach his task any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players know they're getting better, despite the tough
losses we've had,'' Widenhofer said. ``We don't dwell on defeats.
We have to keep looking ahead, because that's where our team is.''

DODGERS MANAGE TO HEAR THIS: NO!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you ever expect to see the Los Angeles Dodgers begging for a
manager? In your lifetime? In your children's lifetime?
</P>
<P>
   How did things come to this point? Two years ago, the Dodgers
were playing in the post-season. They were the paper champs of
baseball, and the organization was considered a model of
efficiency. Along the Dodgers' 1990's timeline, those were the
glory days.
</P>
<P>
   These are the gory days.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland rebuffed the Dodgers before they even had a chance
to offer him the manager's job. Felipe Alou just decided to stay in
Montreal, which is interesting since the Expos aren't exactly sure
they're staying in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are surrounded by examples of how drastically things
have changed. Ex-Dodger Dusty Baker is a successful manager in San
Francisco. Davey Lopes and Dave Stewart, despite what happened
Sunday night, are critical to the Padres, who are still on the
verge of entering the World Series. Leyland chose to manage a team
Colorado in the same division.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal put a heavy guilt trip on Alou to get him to stay put.
But riddle me this: In any other year of their 40 in Los Angeles,
would an experienced manager ever have turned the Dodger job down?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. When people around baseball look at the Dodgers,
they no longer see an immaculate franchise. They see this:
</P>
<P>
   An ownership group that made a lot of rookie mistakes in 1998.
Managers are wary of owners who make personnel decisions. If Fox
can trade Mike Piazza, it can trade anyone.
</P>
<P>
   A payroll with a lot of expensive, dead weight. It's hard enough
to win with players you like, want and can afford.
</P>
<P>
   A new management team that is behind in the count. Kevin Malone
is blameless, but future candidates already know they didn't top
his short list.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Tommy Lasorda hanging over the franchise. It
doesn't matter whether Lasorda had anything to do with the canning
of Bill Russell and Fred Claire, or has the ear of Malone or any
Foxie. The presumption around baseball is he did, and does. Image
is everything.
</P>
<P>
   A roster that leans more towards
</P>
<P>
   rebuilding than regrouping. The Dodgers may have to get a lot
worse before it gets better. It's happened elsewhere, and it could
happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone doesn't necessarily agree. The new general manager,
who's been as upfront and direct as possible, has a solution in
mind for everything. The decisions by Alou and Leyland do not
change his outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were at the point of their careers where they can pick
and choose where they work,'' he said Sunday. ``It's not about the
organization (in baseball) any more. There are more factors
involved, and managers like Felipe have more choices and options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I analyzed this myself and asked what this really meant. They
were the most high-profile, available guys out there and had
options. I really think Felipe wanted to come, but the Expos made
him feel obligated to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Dodgers helped make Alou and Leyland the two
highest paid managers. Malone didn't set out to raise this
financial bar. Imagine the marked-up price tag now for Davey
Johnson, who managed the Mets, Reds and Orioles into the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't looking to create a new watermark,'' Malone said.
``It's a reflection on the state of the game. We're starting to see
managers paid like NBA coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. Being a major league manager is still about
winning, but it's not the only consideration. If that were so,
Johnson wouldn't have been unemployed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Managers have to have some baby-sitting skills, and be willing
to deal the deck handed them. They need to earn the respect of a
clubhouse filled with players who make 10ten
</P>
<P>
   times as much money, and learn how to deal with diversity and
the potential for turnover.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, they usually get the chance to play in October, at
which time they can show how fundamentally sound they can be (Joe
Torre) or how inept (Bobby Cox). The only thing more regular in
October than Halloween is Cox's annual postseason meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Fans and the media may look at the Dodgers and see a team that
couldn't touch the 1995 or 1996 Dodgers, but Malone sees a team
that can win a division title. To that end, he wants someone who
understands the job and has cachet in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Johnson and Kevin Kennedy, who spent 10 years in the
organization and managed the Rangers and Red Sox, are next in line,
and why Davey Lopes or Mike Scioscia aren't being considered, at
least not yet. Given the choice between Johnson and Lopes, Dodger
fans vote for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice between Lopes and, say, Larry Bowa or Ray
Knight, they might be willing to spend a year rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Malone isn't. ``I believe I have to go with someone who has
major league experience,'' he said. ``Lopes, Mike and other coaches
have a lot of qualities. But with the stakes involved now, I don't
think we can develop a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt we were really regrouping, we could with a younger
manager and develop together. But we feel like we're contenders. I
believe we can win a division title. We have adjustments to make;
we have to balance the lineup, and improve our defense, bullpen and
bench. But it doesn't need a drastic overhaul.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully not. It had enough of that in 1998 to last a lifetime.

<P>
   HIGHLAND, Calif. _ A century after Indian wars roiled the West,
another battle is raging here over a ballot measure that would
expand the state's $1.4 billion Indian gambling industry. It pits
California's gaming tribes against an unlikely coalition of Nevada
casinos, unions, church groups and other businesses in what may
become the most expensive fight in California political history.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino on a patch of
tribal land 60 miles east of Los Angeles makes the stakes clear.
The afternoon sun is still high, but the parking lot is filling
fast, and inside the smoky 90,000-square-foot gambling hall, the
hopeful already sit glued to most of the 1,000 video slot machines
and to row after row of bingo tables.
</P>
<P>
   This 24-hour no-frills casino is an economic miracle for the
tiny San Manuel tribe, which once scratched out an income raising
apricots and lived in shacks and trailers on a dusty 648-acre
reservation. Now, 40 landscaped houses dot the hillsides behind the
casino's walls, and security officers on bicycles patrol newly
paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Manuel Indians have a problem: They and about 40
other tribes began installing slot machines over the last decade
without first reaching compacts with the state, as required by
federal law. So Gov. Pete Wilson and federal prosecutors consider
their casinos illegal and have moved to shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the gaming tribes are sponsoring a hotly contested
ballot measure in the Nov. 3 election that would allow broad
expansion of casino-style gaming on Indian lands statewide. In a
potent illustration of the power of gambling money in politics, it
seems likely to set a new record for spending on a ballot
initiative here.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the two sides have raised at least $60 million and
spent about $53 million, mostly for a barrage of competing
television commercials. About $43 million has been raised by
tribes, $22 million of it from the San Manuel tribe alone, while
opponents, led by the casino operators at Hilton Hotels Corp. and
Mirage Resorts Inc., who fear untaxed Indian competition, have
raised $15.5 million and spent $1 million more. The previous
spending record for a single measure was $57.5 million on a
securities fraud proposal two years ago; $84 million was spent on a
group of competing insurance reform measures in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Public polls have shown the gambling measure, Proposition 5,
winning majority, but not overwhelming, support among voters, many
of whom are sympathetic to decades of Indian privation in a state
that paid bounties for Indian body parts in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming tribes contend that nothing less than their historic
sovereignty and economic survival is at stake, and their
advertisements feature members attesting that Indian gaming has
broken the cycle of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our livelihood,'' said Ken Ramirez, 38, vice-chairman
of the San Manuel tribe, who grew up on the reservation when it
held only a handful of families, with water too fetid to drink. He
declined to disclose the tribe's revenues from gaming, but noted
that about 110 people now live on the reservation, where, with
gambling proceeds, the tribe has drilled 16 deep wells and plans to
market bottled water commercially.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of Proposition 5 accuse the gaming tribes of scare
tactics. They say the tribes' campaign exaggerates the threat to
Indian welfare and obscures the real menace of a measure that would
allow the spread of gambling throughout the state, divert business
from privately operated theme parks, racetracks and card rooms and
yet provide few economic benefits over all, because Indian casinos
pay no taxes on their profits, though gamblers pay income taxes on
their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think it's an incredible con game,'' said Frank
Schubert, who is managing the ``No on 5'' campaign for the
Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling, which has run ads in which
a jogging couple is stunned by a volcanic eruption of garish casino
signs in their neighborhood. ``We've had millions and millions in
TV ads bombarding the state for months now about reservations
getting electricity and being able to be linoleum on a dirt floor,
when in fact it's a handful of tribes spending a fortune to keep a
special deal.''
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the 557 Indian tribes around the nation,
including tribes in Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin, now offer
some form of gambling. The 1988 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act affirmed tribes' rights to offer bingo, and, subject to
negotiated compacts with individual states, slot machine games. But
some governors have complained about vagaries in the law and
Congress has debated making clarifications.
</P>
<P>
   In other states where Indians are either seeking gambling
compacts or negotiating the renewal of existing ones, the
California debate is being closely watched.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national perspective, many states and tribes have
already resolved this,'' said John Dossett, general counsel of the
National Congress of American Indians in Washington, which
represents 250 tribes. ``If this issue were to be resolved in
California, there'd be less pressure in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But resolution here seems unlikely any time soon. Opponents of
Proposition 5 warn that if it passes, it will immediately be tied
up in years of litigation, and could well violate the California
State Constitution's ban on ``Nevada or New Jersey-type casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in for a long battle here instead of a politically
negotiated solution in which both sides say, `Let's make this
work,''' said Cathy Christian, counsel to the Coalition Against
Unregulated Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming tribes say they are prepared to fight. They complain
that they have been caught in an impossible situation because,
eager for revenue, they began offering gambling while their right
to do so was still being litigated. Since then Wilson, a Republican
and a foe of gambling in general, has refused to negotiate a
compact with any tribe that was already gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Proposition 5, the gaming that currently exists on
Indian lands in California could be taken away from the tribes,''
said Waltona Manion, a spokeswoman for the tribal alliance known as
Californians for Indian Self-Reliance. ``Why remove something
that's working, and that's proven to have taken these tribes off of
welfare dependency and put them on the road to self-sufficiency?''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson has offered a clear alternative. Last spring, he
reached an agreement with the Pala Band of Mission Indians in San
Diego County that would allow a new form of video slot machine but
outlaw those now used by gambling tribes. In the months since, 10
more tribes, some of them under threat of federal action, have
signed the Pala compact, which limits each tribe to 199 of the new
machines but allows them to lease rights for unused machines to
other tribes, up to a maximum of 990 for any tribe, with a
statewide cap of 19,900. The State Legislature ratified the
agreements in August.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the gaming tribes contend that Wilson, who is barred
from seeking a third term this year, refused to negotiate in good
faith, as required by the 1988 federal law. So Proposition 5 leaves
little to chance, flatly requiring the state to grant a compact
allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted
them, though, as is now the case, the measure would only allow
games in which players bet against a pool of other players' money,
not against the casino house itself, as in Las Vegas and Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure contend that it is not needed to
protect Indian gambling, and to hammer home the point, they are now
running television advertisements featuring Paula Lorenzo, head of
the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, which signed the Pala compact
and is expanding its Cache Creek Casino 45 miles northwest of
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing all this without Prop. 5,'' Ms. Lorenzo says in
the 30-second commercial as she walks through the construction
site. ``No tribe needs Prop. 5 to operate casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, supporters of the measure have accused their
fellow tribes of being turncoats recruited by ``the big Nevada
casinos,'' to oppose the proposition, in an echo of internecine
betrayals of the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Manuel Casino, which draws 3,000 to 4,000 gamblers a
day and where the card dealers now wear bold ``No on 5'' T-shirts,
players said they supported the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen to these people if Proposition 5
doesn't go through?'' asked Ruth Kennedy, a retired nurse who comes
every day to play bingo and the slots from late afternoon until the
wee hours of the morning, and who once won a $40,000 jackpot. ``Why
is Vegas and them so upset with the Indian halls? You can't tell me
this place doesn't do things for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Steven Lengel, the casino's customer
services director, it sponsors a range of school and community
programs in Highland and the neighboring towns of San Bernardino
and Redlands, and its uniformed security force of 250 is bigger
than those of the three local cities combined. It sells no alcohol,
allows none on the premises and employs more than 1,400 people, the
vast majority of them local residents.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure, including the California Labor
Federation AFL-CIO and the United Farm Workers, complain that it
would exempt the Indian casinos from environmental and worker
health and safety laws, and calls for distributing a maximum of 2
percent of the winnings from casinos with more than 400 gambling
machines to non-gaming tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea that they're somehow spending all of their money to
help their poor brothers is just not true,'' Ms. Christian said.

`BECH AT BAY': UNEVEN UPDIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the ongoing adventures of Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom have
afforded readers a big picture window on four decades of American
middle-class life, the adventures of John Updike's other alter ego,
Henry Bech, have given us a smaller, keyhole glimpse of a more
elitist form of American life _ namely, the life of a minor
novelist, as he has made his bumbling, fumbling way from the
quiescent '50s through the raucous '70s into the noisy,
publicity-mad '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The latest collection of Bech's adventures, ``Bech at Bay,''
finds Bech older but definitely not wiser. Like Rabbit, Bech has
always had a propensity for vague existential dread, unmitigated by
his own modest good fortune, and in this volume, as in ``Rabbit at
Rest,'' that spiritual anomie has evolved into a prickly awareness
of mortality and lost chances. In one of his darker moments, Bech
sees himself as ``a vain, limp leech on the leg of literature as it
waded through swampy times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bech's confidence is not helped by his suspicion that ``his
author'' _ that is, John Updike _ wanted ``to set him aside, to get
him off the desk forever.'' ``Rather frantically hoping still to
amuse, Bech had developed a new set of tricks, somewhat out of
character _ he had married, he had written a best seller.
Nevertheless, and especially as his 60s settled around him, as
heavily as an astronaut's suit, he felt boredom from above dragging
at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bech felt, Updike playfully writes, like ``an experiment whose
chemicals were about to be washed down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   As this passage suggests, Updike has lost some of his enthusiasm
for his old creation, and his weariness frequently shows. Though
``Bech at Bay'' boasts some delightful set pieces and
intermittently sparkles, like its predecessors ``Bech: A Book''
(1970) and ``Bech Is Back'' (1982), with some wonderfully witty
asides about literary life and death, it's a highly uneven
collection of stories.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these interlinked tales, like ``Bech Presides,'' are
bravura performances, sly, funny and tart as anything Updike has
written about writers, writers' egos and the waning power of the
written word. Others, however, are hokey and contrived, the
frenetic yet oddly perfunctory effusions of an author goading
himself to care.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bech Noir,'' for instance, Updike turns Bech into a
literary avenger, who, accompanied by a faithful sidekick named
Robin, terrorizes literary critics across the land, murdering those
who have had the temerity to assail his work. This Bechman wears a
cape, carries a ``rod'' with a silencer and says things like ``he's
done me a world of woe.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ill-conceived experiments uncomfortably push the gentle
satire of the Bech books into the more perilous realm of farce.
They not only force poor, long-suffering Bech to try to learn new
tricks but also turn him into a ludicrous puppet, forced to don
bizarre costumes and mouth bad dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   It is when Bech stays in character as his usual self-absorbed,
competitive but strangely melancholy self that these stories work
best, engaging the reader in his quandaries as an aging writer who
feels himself increasingly estranged from the brave new digitalized
world around him and increasingly concerned with the small literary
legacy he will leave behind, even as he finds himself unexpectedly
becoming a father in his eighth decade of life.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Updike notes, Bech had reached ``that advanced stage
of authorship when his writing consisted mostly, it seemed, of
contributions to Festschrifts _ slim volumes of tributes, often
accompanied by old photographs and an uneasy banquet at the Century
Club or Lutece or Michael's Pub, in honor of this or that ancient
companion in literature's heady battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Bech's own books are out of print or available only in
college bookstores, and he no longer sees his name, as he once did,
on drugstore racks and in airports. ``If he wasn't assigned in a
college seminar on postwar anti-realism, he wasn't read.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bech becomes president of an arts organization called
``The Forty'' _ an imitation French Academy, hypothetically
consisting of the 40 best artists in America _ he soon finds
himself presiding over its demise. Like Bech himself, the
organization seems to have become obsolete, an elitist dinosaur in
a politically correct, computer-driven world more and more
oblivious to the blandishments of highbrow art.
</P>
<P>
   But then, to Bech's surprise and everyone else's, he is awarded
the Nobel Prize in literature. Never mind that the prize is the
unintended byproduct of game-playing by committee members, never
mind that Bech himself feels unworthy: At 76, preparing to make his
Nobel speech, he has a chance to sum up his own life and the state

</P>
<P>
   Although much is made in these stories of Bech's identity as a
Jewish novelist (and there are bits and pieces of Saul Bellow,
Norman Mailer and the two Roths, Philip and Henry, in his
characterization), the writer he most resembles is his creator.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there loose parallels between Bech's early books
and those of Updike (Bech's ``Travel Light,'' like ``Rabbit, Run,''
was a response to Jack Kerouac; his novel ``Think Big,'' like
``Couples,'' was a ``triumphantly sleazy'' best seller), but Bech's
work also seems to evince the same qualities as his creator's:
namely, a fascination with ``the fuzzy texture of daily life, that
gray felt compacted of a thousand fibers, that elusive drabness
containing countless minute scintillae.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, there are huge differences between
Bech and Updike. Bech, despite his Nobel, has a reputation as a
second-string cult author; Updike, as one of America's most
eminent. Bech has a modest oeuvre of seven books, interrupted by a
16-year writing block, Updike a wildly compendious one (running
thus far to some four dozen works), among which this volume must
surely count as one of his more minor, if entertaining,
productions.

   FAMILY-TRAGEDY (Los Angeles) _ The hit-and-run death of Salvador
Sanchez over the weekend was the second time his parents lost a
child. A brother, also 4, nearly choked to death several years ago
and remains in a coma, prompting child-welfare officials to place
Salvador and his nine siblings in foster homes. Sunday started out
as a day of great joy for Salvador and his brothers and sisters:
for the first time in years, they were together, away from their
foster homes, to celebrate their father's birthday. The day ended
in tragedy, however, when Salvador was struck by a car while
crossing on an unmarked crosswalk. By Lisa Van Proyen. (Will move

   On Tuesday, relying on defectors from what is alleged to have
been an all-out effort by the Soviet Union to develop biological
weapons during the Cold War and possibly after, ``Frontline''
delivers a dire report on suspicions of the existence of stockpiles
of smallpox, plague and anthrax viruses.
</P>
<P>
   All are said to be readily convertible to offensive biological
warfare, with lethal potential. Two pounds of powdered anthrax
efficiently deployed, one researcher notes, would be enough to kill
hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plague War'' raises doubts about the enforcement of
international agreements banning biological weapons. Intelligence
experts warn that some former Soviet colonels and generals may
still be working at developing them, either for Russia or for
terrorist-prone clients.

INFIRM YELTSIN FORCED TO END TRIP TO ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin abruptly cut short a three-day
visit to Central Asia Monday after his doctor announced that
Yeltsin was suffering from bronchitis and a slight fever.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin's record of covering up the president's health
problems left many commentators questioning whether Yeltsin's
illness was more serious. It also compounded the sense that the
nation lacked a fully functioning leader during one of its gravest
crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what it is yet,'' observed the NTV independent
television channel. ``But the situation is very unclear and very
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, when Yeltsin arrived in Tashkent, the capital of
Uzbekistan, he looked weak. He lost his footing at a ceremony, and
at a state dinner he lost his place in his prepared remarks. At
another point in the evening, he had a coughing spell that prompted
him to leave for a few minutes with his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in Almaty, Kazakhstan, he painstakingly signed
documents, slowly outlining each letter of his name. Then he left
the ceremony sluggishly, nudged along by the Kazakh president, who
wrapped an arm around Yeltsin's waist.
</P>
<P>
   In returning to Moscow Monday night, Yeltsin, 67, cut short by a
day a trip designed in part to demonstrate his continued capacity
to rule. Instead his first trip abroad in five months reinforced
fears about his health two years after his quintuple bypass
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't need this visit. This was for them,'' said an aide
to Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``They needed to show that their president
was strong. This is politics.`
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's health has been so unsteady in recent months and his
involvement in the nation's political affairs so episodic that he
has often seemed to operate as a virtual president.
</P>
<P>
   Weakened physically, as well as politically, his management
style has been to appoint a prime minister, allow him enormous
leeway in forming new policies and then monitor the affairs of
state from a country residence outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's detachment has often seem so pronounced that the
Russian media has taken to reporting his occasional appearances at
the Kremlin as breaking news. A recent opinion poll indicated that
only 2 percent of those surveyed had confidence in his ability to
govern.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yeltsin has clung tenaciously to power, insisting that he
will serve out his term, which ends in the year 2000. And while
Yeltsin is no longer immersed in the intricacies of economic
policy, Kremlin veterans say he is still occasionally capable of
cracking the whip.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, the ousted head of the state tax service,
recently speculated that Yeltsin may order yet another government
shakeup if Russia's economy continues to falter over the next
several months. In that sense, Yeltsin is an absentee president,
but not a mere figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's isolation would be less serious for the nation if his
prime minister had a firmer grip on economic policy. But Yevgeni
Primakov, who has been Yeltsin's prime minister for about a month,
and a consensus choice for many Russians, seems to be at a loss
when it comes to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A former foreign minister and intelligence chief, Primakov
appears to have stronger views about NATO intervention in the
Balkans than how to close the nation's yawning budget deficit or
revive its insolvent banks.
</P>
<P>
   And the president's physical decline would be less worrisome if
there was a consensus on who should lead the nation after Yeltsin
left office.
</P>
<P>
   But public opinion is split. The leading candidates are Yuri
Luzkhov, the pugnacious Moscow mayor who has sought to reposition
himself as the head of a center-left party; Aleksandr Lebed, the
Siberian governor and former general who has yet to articulate a
clear economic program; and Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader,
whose appeal appears limited to the party faithful. Many Russians
distrust all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian constitution, if Yeltsin were to leave office
early or die, the prime minister would assume his duties for up to
three months until new elections were organized.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin appears to have never fully regained his strength since
undergoing his heart surgery in November, 1996. Since then, he has
his ups and down. This past week was definite down.
</P>
<P>
   His trip to Central Asia appeared intended to show that Yeltsin
was still capable of leading his nation. Instead, it backfired.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin arrived Sunday evening in Tashkent, he appeared to
lose his footing as he stood listening to a band at the
presidential mansion. He regained his balance only when Islam
Karimov, Uzbekistan's president, shoved an arm underneath Yeltsin
to steady him.
</P>
<P>
   At an official dinner Sunday night, Yeltsin drank two or three
glasses or red wine, according to a diplomat who was present.
Recalling the enfeebled Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, Yeltsin then
gave a confused rendering of a speech, reading the beginning,
shifting to the end and then plunging, belatedly, into the middle.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 presidential election campaign, the Kremlin
covered up Yeltsin's heart attack, describing it as a cold.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin aides insisted that this time it really was nothing more
than a cold and that there were no plans to hospitalize the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin caught a cold in Moscow at the end of the
week, before the visit,'' said Dmitry Yakushkin, Yeltsin's new
spokesman. ``When you have a cold, you need to lie in bed.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sheryl Crow is, she said, ``conducting an
experiment.'' It's a simple one, she explained recently at the SoHo
Grand Hotel, where she has been staying sporadically while her new
loft in NoHo is renovated. ``I'm staying home for the next two
months,'' she said. ``I'm going to see how that feels.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Crow, who had been touring continuously for five years
before she dropped out of the lineup of the Lilith Fair this
summer, a pause in her touring is a radical change, and not the
only one she has made.
</P>
<P>
   She has also switched from the West Coast to the East, leaving
behind the Los Angeles studio scene that had nurtured her career.
Her music is steeped in country-tinged California rock, from Bonnie
Raitt to Fleetwood Mac, with some Rolling Stones guitar licks for
ballast.
</P>
<P>
   Since she arrived in Los Angeles from her native Missouri in
1986, she had worked her way up through the West Coast music
business: singing backup with Michael Jackson and Don Henley,
writing songs that were recorded by Eric Clapton and Celine Dion
and, eventually, in weekly late-night sessions at her producer's
studio, completing her first album, ``Tuesday Night Music Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted now to New York City, she walks over to hear bands at
clubs like Acme Underground, Fez and Irving Plaza and has become
what she called ``a subwayholic.'' A song hidden at the end of her
new album, ``The Globe Sessions'' (A&AMP;M), is a rumination from a
rider on the E train. ``I love thinking I'm getting somewhere even
if I'm not,'' Ms. Crow said. ``For me, it's really quiet and
peaceful somehow. In the hubbub of it I can hear my own voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crow, who is 36, had been in motion since the release in
1993 of ``Tuesday Night Music Club.'' She worked her way from clubs
to opening-act slots to headliner while the album sold 7.2 million
copies worldwide and brought Ms. Crow her first three Grammy
awards, including record of the year (for its hit single ``All I
Wanna Do'') and best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   Between stretches of touring, she made the follow-up album,
``Sheryl Crow,'' which has sold 4.8 million copies since its
release in 1996; it won Grammys for best female rock vocal and best
rock album.
</P>
<P>
   With her newly released third album, ``The Globe Sessions,'' Ms.
Crow is staying in New York, where she has sung before television
cameras: ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``Late Show With David
Letterman'' and an edition of ``Storytellers'' taped for the cable
music channel VH-1. Her next full-scale tour is scheduled to begin
in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a part of me that wants to have a home that is an
inspiring atmosphere, as inspiring to me as being on the road is,''
Ms. Crow said. ``And I've put that off because I haven't wanted to
make the time to do it or didn't really want to deal with doing it.
It's just easier to be on a tour bus with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``The Globe Sessions'' was made at Globe Studios in the
meat-packing district of the West Village. ``I loved working
there,'' she said. ``My studio was across the street from Hogs and
Heifers and the Hog Pit, where I could get mashed potatoes and
fried chicken any night I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you have transvestite hookers everywhere, and Hell's
Angels, and it just was a cool, cool vibe. If you ever got really
hung up in the frustration of trying to get something accomplished
in the studio, you could walk out and just be amongst some bizarre
energy. It clears your head and gives you some perspective when you
walk out in such a strange, frenetic, unpredictable atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The album didn't come out the way Ms. Crow had expected. ``I
went into the studio with a bunch of songs ready to go, and I
didn't actually wind up putting any of them on the record,'' she
said. ``I think once the door gets closed and the phone is turned
off, weird things tend to surface.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new songs that emerged were written in the first person _
not the observer's perspective Ms. Crow has often used _ and nearly
all of them pondered romances that went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person that has been hung up on writing literary
songs,'' Ms. Crow said. ``They're songs that are narrative, that
are maybe cerebral, maybe not, but songs that are inspired by
writers maybe more than songwriters. This album wasn't any of that,
and I was kind of embarrassed about it. But I think it is a pretty
clear album as far as my life goes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly autobiography, Ms. Crow insisted. ``None of the
songs are specific to one person,'' she said. ``But I did realize
in making this record that I've had a pretty distinct role in most
of the demises of most of my relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it has been my love affair with my road life, my love
affair with my nonresponsible life. Relationships are hard enough
when you're present, but it's really difficult when you're not
present.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs suggest that Ms. Crow can draw on a reservoir of
melancholy. ``That's a nice emotion to be able to tap into when
you're writing songs,'' she said. ``But when I'm really miserable,
I can't accomplish anything. Part of being miserable for me is that
I'm convinced everything I do is terrible. So then you start
ripping it apart before you even finish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My manager's always trying to get me to let myself off the
hook. And sometimes you miss out on the joy of the great
experiences. I never celebrate great reviews, I never celebrate
Grammys because I always feel like I can't put too much weight on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Crow is at home in New York, she's not taking any
vacation. Instead, she has a job as a producer for one of her
idols. ``Stevie Nicks called and said, `Will you do my album?,'''
Ms. Crow said. ``So the two months I was going to take off are now
booked.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Crow is already missing her tour routine. ``For
about the last four months, around 8 o'clock every night, I start
to sense this kind of nervous energy, this kind of angst, that I
have to be out,'' she said. ``That touring lifestyle feels right to
me, almost as if it's a genetic memory. It goes along with my
Puritan work ethic, and it feels like home to me. I don't tour so
that I can make more albums; I make albums so I can tour.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the interview, Ms. Crow was rehearsing for
``Saturday Night Live.'' With a newly assembled band, she romped
through two songs from ``The Globe Sessions'': ``My Favorite
Mistake'' and Bob Dylan's ``Mississippi,'' an unreleased song he
offered Ms. Crow just as she was looking for a finishing touch on
``The Globe Sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiddles sawed, guitars twanged and Ms. Crow whooped as she
reached the last verses. She came offstage with a smile and a glint
of determination in her blue eyes. ``Every time I get up there,''
she said, ``I think I've just got to get back on the road.''

ADULTERY-WHY (Los Angeles) _ Why has America been so willing to
forgive President Clinton for his ``inappropriate relations'' with
Monica Lewinsky? Could it be because a hefty percentage of
Americans have themselves experienced adultery? Could it be that
Clinton's videotape testimony was actually a window into many
American bedrooms? We talk to cheated spouses, psychotherapists,
social scientists about the consequences of flirting with disaster
_ and why we still do it. By Jenifer Hanrahan. 
. 
ADULTERY-INSURANCE (Los Angeles) _ Infidelity Life now offers
coverage against infidelity for $2. Coverage, however, isn't an
insurance policy in the strictest sense of the word. The injured
party receives a nasty letter addressed to the cheating party, a
list of good divorce lawyers, and a ``keep-your-chin-up'' note from
Hillary Clinton. By Jenifer Hanrahan.

$2 BUYS INFIDELITY INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Worried about your spouse cheating? Now you can
cover yourself _ with an ``insurance policy'' to protect your
dignity in case of unfaithfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Infidelity Life now offers coverage against ``intentional,
unintentional and/or passive infidelities.'' The $2 policy is good
for the term of the marriage, no less.
</P>
<P>
   What is passive infidelity, you ask? ``Lusting in your heart and
premeditated flirting,'' said Bill Singletary, company president.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage, of course, isn't an insurance policy in the
strictest sense of the word. Infidelity Life is a subsidiary of TMR
Multimedia, a novelty marketing company based in Hallandale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Upon submission of proof of a spouse's infidelity, the insured
will receive the following: A really nasty letter addressed to the
cheating party, peppered throughout with lots of name-calling and
righteous indignation; a list of good divorce lawyers; a fake but
still inspirational ``keep-your-chin-up'' note from Hillary
Clinton; a scarlet letter ``A'' applique; and bipartisan
corroboration by 10 registered Democrats and Republicans, said
Singletary.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the cheater _ either accused or caught outright _
you'll receive your own personal press release containing 25
categorical denials of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not unfaithful with !ital!that!off! person,'' for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   You'll get five hair-splitting definitions of the term
infidelity that would make Clinton proud and a ``blanket apology
and atonement proviso for any unintentional harm caused to family
and/or friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When you get tired of groveling and are ready to strike back,
you'll also receive a list of your accuser's vices addressed to
his/her employer, clergyman, friends and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary said he was inspired by none other than the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is at a new low for perverseness,'' he said.
``Turn on CNN, and you see infidelity. My God, it's coming out of
the woodwork. Something's gone wrong. Everybody seems to be
sleeping with everyone else other than their spouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Might as well cash in. &UR;

ADULTERY-WHY (Los Angeles) _ Why has America been so willing to
forgive President Clinton for his ``inappropriate relations'' with
Monica Lewinsky? Could it be because a hefty percentage of
Americans have themselves experienced adultery? Could it be that
Clinton's videotape testimony was actually a window into many
American bedrooms? We talk to cheated spouses, psychotherapists,
social scientists about the consequences of flirting with disaster
_ and why we still do it. By Jenifer Hanrahan. 
. 
ADULTERY-INSURANCE (Los Angeles) _ Infidelity Life now offers
coverage against infidelity for $2. Coverage, however, isn't an
insurance policy in the strictest sense of the word. The injured
party receives a nasty letter addressed to the cheating party, a
list of good divorce lawyers, and a ``keep-your-chin-up'' note from
Hillary Clinton. By Jenifer Hanrahan.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he waits for the last votes of his 34-year
congressional career, Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton runs one hand
through his crew cut and thinks out loud, in his
right-down-the-middle way, about why the House is both meaner and
cleaner, more hard-working and less thoughtful, than when he
arrived here from Columbus, Ind., in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, he recalls, members of Congress palled around,
played cards and made a good-faith effort to be on the golf course
by 1 p.m. These days, they barely have time to get to know one
another, let alone contemplate the meaning of legislative life, in
the press of 24-hour news cycles and three-day work weeks bracketed
by rush-rush trips home.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, you could legally accept fancy gifts and pocket
leftover campaign funds when you retired. Even if you managed to
get into trouble, there was no House ethics committee until 1978.
Then again, neither was there any need to spend nearly all your
time raising money.
</P>
<P>
   As a small town lawyer, Hamilton is nostalgic about the $30,000
he spent on his first race in 1964, the year of Lyndon B. Johnson's
landslide. In his last race in 1996, Hamilton sent $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In his office, the congressman's papers are already being packed
into boxes and the mail is being marked ``return to sender.''
Settling in for a leisurely interview, the 67-year-old Indiana
Basketball Hall of Famer drapes his large frame over a
straight-backed wooden chair in a room adorned with oil paintings
of his dogs, Tawny and Buffy.
</P>
<P>
   The Almanac of American Politics has called Hamilton one of the
most respected members of the House. The politically moderate son
of a Methodist minister from Evansville, Ind., he has been a major
force on foreign policy issues and led opposition to U.S. aid for
the anti-communist Nicaraguan contra guerrillas in the 1980s. He
was House chairman of the House-Senate panel that investigated the
Reagan administration's support for the contras with the proceeds
of illegal arms sales to Iran, and also chaired the Foreign Affairs
and Intelligence Committees. Both Michael Dukakis and President
Clinton seriously considered him as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when invited to linger for a moment over some favorite
accomplishment, he mentions, not very grandly, that he did not
write the law that created Medicare but was proud simply to have
been among those who voted for it. ``I think that legislation has
enhanced the quality of life for an awful lot of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his talk about 1960s sociability on the Hill, Hamilton
seems always to have put in long hours. A 1966 profile in The
Washington Star noted that ``Hamilton gets to the office every
morning at about 6:30, reads all the mail, answers nearly all the
roll calls, and has missed going back home on weekends only a
couple of times since he took office. He doesn't drink and he
doesn't smoke and he works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been enormously popular in the 9th District, the
irregular slice of mostly rural southeastern Indiana where he was
re-elected easily until the Republican landslide in 1994. After a
narrow win that year, he again took 56 percent of the vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going to a lot of retirement dinners back in
Indiana,'' he says, ``and the things people remember are the simple
things, that I've tried to be accessible and honest and tried to
make government work. When I drive through my district and see a
sewage system or a library or a school I've had something to do
with, that gives me a lot of satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   And most likely, this unwillingness to tout his career and
contributions would have set him apart at any moment in the history
of the big, noisy institution he clearly loves.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, Hamilton says, ``You don't walk
away from a 34-year career without some regrets, and I leave very
disappointed that we haven't done something on campaign finance or
affordable health care.''
</P>
<P>
   He worries, too, about both the widening income gap and the
information gap in which the computer illiterate are increasingly
left behind. He says he entered public life at a time of great
optimism that government could curb poverty and discrimination, and
leaves at a moment of extreme skepticism that government
effectively can, or even should, address such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, his most immediate regret is what he sees as
the necessity for an inquiry into the possible grounds for
impeaching the president, a man he has admired on policy and
excoriated for the private conduct that has gotten him into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a depressing way to end a career, on the note of
impeachment,'' he says, removing his glasses, fiddling with them,
putting them back on. ``I'm distressed with the ending, but you
don't control these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, living through Watergate and Iran-Contra, Hamilton says,
has given him some perspective on the current situation: ``We look
back now and say the system worked in Watergate, but in the middle
of it it was messy and partisan. And something like that is
happening now, in my view. It's messy. It's partisan. But it's
working pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How does he answer those in his own party who respond to
criticism of Clinton's behavior by saying essentially that Reagan
did far worse and survived?
</P>
<P>
   ``In Iran-contra you were looking at a president abusing the
powers of the presidency,'' Hamilton said. ``But though a lot of
people on the left were disappointed we didn't hang him, the
evidence didn't point to that. We found out what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, ``Mr. Reagan was able to recover,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was among the 31 Democrats who broke party ranks and
voted for an open-ended impeachment inquiry. He thought it only
right to continue the process, he said, though he has not concluded
that the president's wrongdoing meets the constitutional standard
of impeachable offense. He does believe the president will finish
his term, most likely after being rebuked in some formal way.
</P>
<P>
   And as Hamilton leaves office, he wants to spend some time
thinking about how the president might be rehabilitated to assure
that the office of the presidency is not weakened, particularly on
the international stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's own future includes two new jobs: director of the
Woodrow Wilson Center, a government-sponsored institution that
promotes research as well as exchanges between scholars and
policymakers, and director of a new center for the study of
Congress at Indiana University. He and his wife, Nancy, will stay
in their home in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Congress, he says, but political life in general is a
different game now than it was in February of 1960, when Hamilton
remembers being unable to turn out a respectable crowd to greet
Sen. John F. Kennedy in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called everybody I knew and couldn't get 40 people to come
out to the Old City Hall to see him just a few months before he got
the nomination,'' for the presidency, he says, laughing. ``Now you
start running for president four years ahead of time and the voters
are so well informed, you do something and get back to the office
and the phones are already ringing off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this new sophistication is real progress, he says,
adding that today's elected officials probably pay too much
attention to constituents, tracking every poll, every hiccup in
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he feels he is leaving on the same note he came in
on: ``We're still fighting about Medicare 30 years later.''
</P>
<P>
   But there has been positive change, he says, in that the
workings of Congress now are much more open, and the body more
truly representative, with many more women and members of minority
groups in office. If he has learned anything, he says, it is how
difficult it is to make representative government work. And he
claims to have no useful advice for those who will come after him.
</P>
<P>
   He has for some time now missed the collegiality of his early
years in Washington, when he remembers a senior Republican
correcting a glaring parliamentary error he had made on a bill the
man opposed _ an act of generosity that he says would be
unimaginable today.
</P>
<P>
   He will miss his colleagues, too, he is sure. And if he has not
yet had the time to fully focused on his feelings about leaving, he
still departs feeling pretty good about his job: ``I don't leave as
a pessimist. I'm not gloomy because I have more confidence in the
institutions of government and the Congress than most of my
constituents. The process is often untidy, but it works.''

WILL `BELOVED' APPEAL TO WHITE AUDIENCES? 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The opening of the film ``Beloved'' this week has
drawn extraordinary attention in Hollywood _ and not just because
the movie was adapted from a Pulitzer-Prize winning novel by Toni
Morrison, was directed by an Academy Award-winning director,
Jonathan Demme, and stars the queen of daytime television, Oprah
Winfrey, who also produced it.
</P>
<P>
   What rivets Hollywood is whether the most expensive film yet to
deal with the black experience will appeal broadly to white as well
as black moviegoers. Without quite admitting it, virtually every
studio in town has been increasingly reluctant in recent years to
bankroll serious films about racial issues, because audiences _
white and, in many cases, black as well _ have often not shown up
at theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that ``Beloved,'' a drama of nearly three hours
about the horrific legacy of slavery, is viewed in Hollywood as
almost a test case of whether studios will continue to finance the
handful of serious films each year on black themes. The thinking is
that if this film, given its pedigree, blanket marketing campaign
and potential attraction to women, can't make it, how many can?
</P>
<P>
   The film, underwritten by Walt Disney Co., cost at least $53
million, with an estimated $30 million more budgeted to promote it.
Ms. Winfrey, who is using her considerable influence among women to
sell the film, has called it ``my `Schindler's List.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was worried about the box office for ``Beloved,''
she responded: ``I'm not as concerned as probably a lot of
marketers would be. I work every day in a business where I'm able
to cross over.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why white audiences are simply not showing up at so-called
serious black films, Ms. Winfrey echoed the views of many Hollywood
executives. ``I don't think they want to feel they're going to be
blamed'' for the characters' predicaments, she said, which are
often the product of racist behavior by whites.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many in the film industry, it is hard to attract
large audiences to serious films of any sort. The big studios'
record of producing such fare has not been overwhelming,
particularly in the face of pressure to churn out movies that open
strongly, rather than build slowly on word of mouth, and that
appeal to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The travails of black films with significant budgets and subject
matter hardly stand out from those of serious films in general,
some longtime Hollywood executives said, and a few serious black
films _ those geared particularly to women _ have performed
solidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's about black films or audiences,'' said Mike
De Luca, president of production at New Line Cinema, which has been
successful in backing films dealing with black issues. ``It's true
for audiences in general. You go to the movies to be entertained.
It's hard to market a so-called serious film that looks like you
might not have such a great time sitting through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, some top Hollywood producers and executives
said studios were particularly wary of backing serious movies on
black themes, particularly those films with significant budgets
geared to a broadly based adult audience. One reason is that these
films, even successful releases like ``Waiting to Exhale,'' often
fail to make money abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like baseball films,'' said one successful producer
who has worked in Hollywood for years. Many movies may earn at
least 60 percent of their box office abroad. (Films with black
themes, however, often have strong video sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the lack of support _ one that executives and
exhibitors are uncomfortable discussing _ is that violent episodes
at a handful of theaters showing hard-edged films about urban gangs
have apparently made some whites reluctant to attend such movies.
Compounding the problem is the resistance among some white
moviegoers to any film with a black theme.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sporadic violence, said one top executive with a
studio that has produced films on black themes, ``it's much harder
now to get a white audience to see a black movie than it was 10
years ago.'' Speaking on the condition of anonymity, he added,
``I'm not endorsing it, I'm not enjoying it, it's not right, but
that's the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker Spike Lee put it another way. Lee said he was
surprised recently to read about the baseball team from Toms River,
N.J., that won the Little League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these middle-class suburban white kids said their
favorite music was Snoop Dogg, Wu-Tang Clan and Puff Daddy _ music
has been able to do the crossover thing and not films,'' he said.
``It's easier for a large part of the white audience to listen than
to watch black faces in movies, particularly when it's not
comedic.''
</P>
<P>
   Without white audiences, many films dealing with
African-American issues cannot survive at the box office. But Lee
observed that black audiences often do not show up for serious
black films either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very rare where African-American films that aren't
comedies draw an audience _ even an African-American audience,'' he
said. The audience has to be educated about serious fare, he said.
``I cannot tell you why a large segment of African-Americans would
rather see `Booty Call' than `Rosewood' or `He Got Game,''' he
added. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another black director, Carl Franklin, said African-Americans
were hardly alone in avoiding films that touch on their history or
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately there seems to be among the American public a
disinterest, an apathy, about almost anything that has a serious
subject matter,'' said Franklin, who recently directed ``One True
Thing,'' the mother-daughter drama starring Meryl Streep and Renee
Zellweger. Despite strong reviews, it has been a box-office
disappointment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several of Lee's critically respected films, like ``He Got
Game'' ``Clockers,'' and ``Get on the Bus,'' stumbled at the box
office. The same was true of Franklin's ``Devil in a Blue Dress,''
as well as John Singleton's ``Rosewood'' (about the destruction of
a black community in Florida in the 1920s by white marauders) and
Steven Spielberg's ``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   And the recent failure of the film ``Why Do Fools Fall in
Love,'' the story of Frankie Lymon, a black singer of the doo-wop
era, led Warner Bros. to shelve ``Dreamgirls,'' the film adaptation
of the Broadway show based loosely on the rise of the Supremes.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest disappointments was the lack of drawing power
of ``Amistad,'' the much heralded drama about a real-life slave
uprising. It grossed only $44 million, according to Exhibitor
Relations Co.
</P>
<P>
   Several black filmmakers said bluntly that the subject matter
did not appeal to white audiences and that black audiences were not
intrigued by a story in which two white stars, Anthony Hopkins as
John Quincy Adams and Matthew McConaughey as the lawyer Roger
Baldwin, save and emancipate the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Not every serious film fails. Movies as varied as ``The Color
Purple,'' ``Waiting to Exhale'' and ``Soul Food,'' all aimed at
black women, have been highly successful, partly because audiences
have returned a second time to see them.
</P>
<P>
   John Singleton's ``Boyz N the Hood,'' the 1991 drama about life
in a South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood, was arguably the best,
and most highly imitated, movie about urban violence in recent
years. The film cost only $7 million and grossed $56 million.
(Characterizing the success or failure of a film hinges, of course,
on its cost and studio expectations for it.)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Beloved'' is an atypical film about the black
experience because of its pedigree _ its adaptation from the
Pulitzer Prize novel by Ms. Morrison, a Nobel laureate; its
direction by Demme, who won an Oscar for his 1991 film, ``The
Silence of the Lambs,'' and, most important, its personal promotion
by Ms. Winfrey. Without her involvement, ``Beloved'' probably would
not have been produced.
</P>
<P>
   As Terry Curtin, the publicity chief at Walt Disney, said: ``We
have the Oprah Winfrey show; a `20-20' segment; we have 11 magazine
covers, all Oprah except for two; we have Oprah and Danny Glover
and the cast doing a full press junket; we have multiple segments
on the `Today' show and `Good Morning, America''; we have `Regis
and Kathie Lee'; we have Leno; we have an A&AMP;E biography on Oprah;
we have two major premieres in New York and L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curtin added, ``Oprah is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey said she was overwhelmed after reading the poetic
and sorrowful 1987 Morrison novel about a mysterious former slave
named Sethe struggling to shape her life in Ohio in 1873, eight
years after the end of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never experienced a book like that,'' said Ms. Winfrey, who
plays Sethe in the film. ``I felt a rumbling inside myself. I
looked at the book jacket, and there was Toni Morrison's face and I
called her up and said, `What was that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Like the book, the movie is undeniably bleak and has several
horrific images of brutality toward slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey had some disagreements with Disney about the
marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strongly that people needed to be prepared for the kind
of movie they were about to see,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Early trailers showed ``beautiful images with the musical score
underneath,'' Ms. Winfrey said, adding: ``That was not enough. You
needed some dialogue to explain what it is you're going to see.''
</P>
<P>
   While Disney is hardly seeking to mute the slavery theme, the
studio is also hoping to lure white audiences, especially women, by
focusing on the movie's Oscar potential as well as its story of a
mother's desperate love for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie about slavery but also about women, and to what
end a woman will go to protect her children from being enslaved,''
said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. ``It's an anthem
movie for women.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades studios often struggled with the promotion of films
about race by separately focusing on white and black audiences.
Thomas Cripps, who has written several influential books about the
depiction of blacks in films, including ``Slow Fade to Black'' and
``Making Movies Black,'' said that studios through the 1950s had
separate advertising campaigns for films for the black press and
the general circulation press.
</P>
<P>
   For the classic 1950 film ``No Way Out,'' directed by Joseph L.
Mankiewicz, a violent tale of racial hatred that marked the debut
of Sidney Poitier, advertisements in predominantly black newspapers
played up scenes dealing with ominous race confrontation, Cripps
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In white newspapers,'' he said, ``that was never mentioned _
what was played up was introducing Poitier and upbeat images and
the challenge of integration.''
</P>
<P>
   De Luca of New Line Films, which made the current hit ``Rush
Hour'' and such gritty movies as ``Menace II Society,'' which cost
$3 million and grossed $28 million, said he was often content to
back films intended to appeal overwhelmingly to a black audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't necessarily design films to cross over, if they're
made by black filmmakers for black audiences,'' he said. ``Our
films are designed to survive in a marketplace even if there's no
crossover.''
</P>
<P>
   But several producers and studios have recently sought to expand
their audience by blurring the racial line in films. Doug McHenry,
who produced such films as the financially successful urban drama
``New Jack City'' and who directed ``Jason's Lyric,'' about two
black brothers at war with each other, said it was crucial that the
promotion and music for films with black themes embrace a wide
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a black filmmaker, but I'm making Chinese food,'' he said.
``I want everyone to eat it. You've got to design a product that
says you're invited as opposed to one that says you're excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   In the advertising material for ``New Jack City,'' for example,
the main black actors in the film _ Wesley Snipes, Ice T and Chris
Rock _ were joined by, among others, Judd Nelson, a white actor.
The modestly budgeted movie grossed $47.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were also sure that we had pop music as well as music that
was on the charts of black stations,'' McHenry said. ``It was a
predominantly African-American cast, but the appeal was to young
males, white and black, and what we said, in effect, was this was
an action crime drama on the streets of Harlem and we're going to
let you in on a fascinating subculture.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Beloved,'' Disney is hoping for as broadly based an
audience as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it will be divided along race lines,'' said
Roth, the studio's chairman. ``But is that a challenge? Sure it
is.''

IN NBA LABOR DISPUTE, YOU CAN SIDE WITH, AH, IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Somebody asked the other day whether there's ever been
two parties in a public dispute less deserving of sympathy than the
NBA owners and NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure. Here's my short list:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq vs. Iran _ Countries that have established why the rest of
the world moved out of the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr vs. Bill Clinton _ Ravenous egos more unstoppable than
the combined force of the Constitution, the rule of law, the
English language and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp vs. Monica Lewinsky _ A real-life version of Mad
Magazine's old ``Spy vs. Spy,'' only without the wit, originality
or cleverness. Just as tasteless, however.
</P>
<P>
   Don King vs. Mike Tyson _ One has electric hair, one has an
electric stare, both deserve the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as two parties in a sports-labor dispute completely
devoid of sympathy as well as empathy ...
</P>
<P>
   No. Never has been one like this one.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way:
</P>
<P>
   Which one is Beavis?
</P>
<P>
   At least in the modern labor disruptions of baseball, football
and hockey, a plausible argument could be offered that the players'
side had been at one time disadvantaged relative to ownership. That
was particularly acute in baseball, where the reserve clause
virtually bound a player to a team for life, creating little
leverage for players and boundless profitability for owners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the huge union advances made in collective bargaining
and the creation of improved free agency in the past 20 years, the
pendulum has swung. In baseball, it has swung so far that the union
runs the sport and the franchises just tag along.
</P>
<P>
   Great advances happened for basketball, too, except that its
landmark labor peace in 1984 was achieved when the sport was at its
nadir. The crisis was tangible enough that both sides worked from
the same pile of devalued rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Now we see the NBA as victim of its own success. The NBA's
two-decade-long merchandising of the game's individual heroes, as
opposed to teams, has produced a star-driven industry whose stars
make the soundest claim among all sports that league success is
more dependent upon individuals than teams, franchises or the game
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, owners have agreed, not only by lavishly marketing
the players but by paying the highest salaries in sports, rivaling
the biggest in show business.
</P>
<P>
   The owners no longer want to pay those salaries. They want
take-backs _ primarily an end to the Bird exception that allows
teams to pay their own free agents unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is how the Chicago Bulls can have a payroll of
nearly $60 million when the salary cap is less than $30 million.
It's why the league claims up to half its teams are no longer
profitable, a claim the union _ and anyone working with more than a
brain stem _ dismisses as piffle.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is ownership believes the claim sufficiently to
endure a self-imposed shutdown. Owners have two things going for
them _ a huge war chest supplied by TV revenues and the stupidity
of the American sports consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA watched baseball's recovery from the 1994 strike that
cost the World Series and bled into the 1995 season. Disastrous as
it was, the NBA, always mindful of the bigger picture, figured if
it took only four years for the dopes who run baseball to get the
game close to where it was, the basketball slicksters will need
half a season, tops. They're probably right, because of the nearly
infinite capacity of most pro sports consumers to forgive and
forget, as well as their susceptibility to clever apologies and
emotional make-goods (see Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Owners want something more like the NFL's harder salary cap. Yet
22 of the 30 NFL teams, including the Seahawks, exceed the $52
million cap thanks to a variety of loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Caps just don't work as advertised. The NBA is asking for an
artificial limit on labor costs, while there is no cap on their
potential revenues. Nor is there a cap on ticket costs. Unless caps
are agreed to on all fronts, their deployment on one element of the
economic equation will create unfairness that almost always leads
to further labor trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite having the economic points on their side, today's
basketball players are not only not disadvantaged like their
sports-labor predecessors a generation earlier, they are
financially on top of the world while operating behind the
protection of a union that works for its elite instead of its rank
and file _ exactly the opposite of all non-sports unions.
</P>
<P>
   No union member at Boeing can be expected to accept the arcane
arguments about market economics when jewelry-bedecked players roll
up to private jets in limos. Nor can the average basketball fan
accept the notion that there is nothing in the enormous wealth
accumulated by players that can't be surrendered in order to have a
season.
</P>
<P>
   The players are atop a false economy, hiding behind a false
front. The owners are creating artificial crisis and applying
artificial brakes.
</P>
<P>
   In this argument, take Iraq, and give the points.

WHY A PARTNER PUTS UP WITH SEX, LIES &AMP; ADULTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Cathleen found out after 29 years of marriage
that her husband was having an affair, it broke her heart and
nearly tore apart her family.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her rage at his betrayal, it took her five years to
file for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if I got divorced, my lifestyle would change, and
I loved him,'' said the West Hills women, who asked that her last
name not be used. ``I hate to admit that, but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the same situation, think you would leave your
husband immediately? Maybe so. But if you're like the vast majority
of Americans, your feelings about adultery are complex.
</P>
<P>
   We despise it, condemn it, say we'd never do it or tolerate it,
but when we're faced with it, our actions often contradict our
words, sociologists and ethicists say.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for our ambivalence: mixed messages.
</P>
<P>
   While marriage vows command us to remain faithful until death,
we live in a society in which we're bombarded with images of
promiscuous sex.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, people who identify with the urge to stray
hesitate to cast the first stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People overwhelmingly consider infidelity wrong, and they
overwhelmingly consider it a common failure,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Our confused feelings about the president are prime example.
During the 1992 election, Clinton acknowledged causing ``pain'' in
his marriage and yet we still elected him. Six years later, he's
confessing again, and we still seem ready to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the American public's widespread disapproval of
Clinton's liaison with a White House intern, anecdotal evidence
reveals that adulterous acts are going on all around us.
</P>
<P>
   A tabloid caught sports broadcaster Frank Gifford, Kathie Lee's
husband, in a compromising situation with a flight attendant. After
a fairy-tale wedding, Diana and Prince Charles both reportedly had
extramarital affairs. Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker lost not only their
marriage but their televangelism empire after he tearfully admitted
to his affair with Jessica Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``The American view of sexuality has always been a strange one,
a mixture of puritanism and promiscuity,'' said John Crossley,
director of the school of religion at University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in concern about adultery and the strong
abhorrence of it comes from the whole notion that adultery is one
of the most serious violations of family integrity. ... The reason
people are willing to forgive is because of the awareness of the
power of sexual temptation,'' Crossley said.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PAINFUL NONETHELESS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how many Americans are cheating on their spouses is not
entirely clear. Little data is dedicated specifically to
infidelity, and what's out there is not necessarily accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In one survey by the makers of Durex condoms, half of Americans
who filled out an anonymous questionnaire admitted to infidelity,
defined as carrying on more than one sexual relationship at a time
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In another survey, conducted by University of Chicago
researchers, about 22 percent of men and 13 percent of women
admitted to carrying on an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers vary widely because, even in anonymous surveys,
people lie, said Dr. Robert Simmermon, an Atlanta psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that infidelity may be even higher than this,'' said
Simmermon, a Durex spokesman. ``People are very secretive about
affairs. It taps into our national ambivalence about our sexual
values. What we say and what we do are at odds with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if we know adultery is commonplace, that doesn't make
it hurt any less.
</P>
<P>
   In a March survey by the American Association for Marriage and
Family Therapy, adultery was ranked as second only to spousal abuse
in impact on mental health.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being most stressful), women rated an
unfaithful spouse a 9.1 and men rated an unfaithful wife an 8.8. A
death in the immediate family, divorce or a child abusing drugs
were rated as less stressful than adultery. ``For many couples, it
breaks the real core of trust,'' said Dr. Carole S. Noreen, a
psychotherapist for more than 35 years, who has an office in
Encino.
</P>
<P>
   When Elaine discovered her husband's affair, it caused more
emotional pain than the death of her parents or even her own bout
with cancer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It damages the core of you, your soul,'' said the Valley
mother, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her
children from further anguish. ``I thought we were living the
American dream. I thought it was so ordinary and normal. Little did
I know my husband was having a very exciting life _ except it
wasn't with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pain, adultery is not a sure marital death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Every couple has their own expectations for their marriage, and
monogamy isn't necessarily included, said Judith Stacey, a
professor of sociology and gender studies at University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the case that everyone accepts a single standard of
marriage,'' Stacey said. ``People are very aware that marriage is
for a lot of reasons: having children, security, picking a place in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen said it took years to divorce her husband after his
infidelity was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women who haven't had this happen to them don't
understand why you wouldn't just pack and leave,'' she said. ``It's
because your whole life is tied up with this person. Your children
are upset and distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   When nationally syndicated radio-show host Tom Leykis found
tell-tale hotel receipts and phone bills, he tried to find out what
drove his wife to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surprised myself,'' Leykis said. ``I always assumed that if
my wife had an affair I would end the marriage. I realized when it
happened that that wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to go to therapy
or counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   What finally caused the divorce, he said, was her refusal to
admit to the affair.

DISAPPROVAL GROWS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even as opinions about sexual relations _ premarital sex,
homosexuality _ have grown more liberal, according to the
University of Chicago survey, Americans have grown more critical of
adultery than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that more than 78 percent of Americans said
infidelity is wrong under any circumstances. When Chicago
researchers first asked the question about adultery in 1973, 69.8
percent said it was always wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't just consider adultery undesirable, but they
absolutely object to it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 20 percent called it ``almost always'' or ``sometimes''
wrong, leaving only 1.6 percent seeing ``nothing'' wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   But up until the latter part of this century, most women really
had no choice but to stay in a marriage because they had few
financial options. Divorcing also was socially unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times, women's increasing economic independence,
the rising divorce rate and the specter of AIDS have contributed to
a dwindling tolerance for adultery, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While in past decades, many therapy patients opted to ignore
their husbands' affairs, today more women are willing to face it,
said psychotherapist Noreen.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, if they ever were naive about extramarital affairs,
certainly aren't now, experts said. The Clinton scandal thrust
adultery into the limelight, making it impossible to ignore. For
some Americans, this prompted a closer look at their own marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Milo Speriglio, a Sherman Oaks private detective, said his phone
has been ringing off the hook since the tawdry details of the
presidential embarrassment were aired for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brought us a lot of business,'' Speriglio said. ``More
and more people are thinking, `If the president can do it, why not
my husband or boyfriend or wife?'''

ADULTERY-WHY (Los Angeles) _ Why has America been so willing to
forgive President Clinton for his ``inappropriate relations'' with
Monica Lewinsky? Could it be because a hefty percentage of
Americans have themselves experienced adultery? Could it be that
Clinton's videotape testimony was actually a window into many
American bedrooms? We talk to cheated spouses, psychotherapists,
social scientists about the consequences of flirting with disaster
_ and why we still do it. By Jenifer Hanrahan. 
. 
ADULTERY-INSURANCE (Los Angeles) _ Infidelity Life now offers
coverage against infidelity for $2. Coverage, however, isn't an
insurance policy in the strictest sense of the word. The injured
party receives a nasty letter addressed to the cheating party, a
list of good divorce lawyers, and a ``keep-your-chin-up'' note from
Hillary Clinton. By Jenifer Hanrahan.

MANY DON'T HAVE RAINY-DAY FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
 DAY-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Kathleen Lane leaves no stone unturned in her quest to
save money. The Phoenix woman has built up a modest rainy-day fund
over the past three years, even as she worked to pay off nearly
$8,000 in debts. She uses coupons when shopping, picks up pennies
off the ground and slavishly adheres to her monthly budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'll do with my money even before it arrives,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   More Arizonans would be wise to follow her example. A recent
edition of the Rocky Mountain Poll found that nearly one in four
Phoenix area residents is saving less than 5 percent of his or her
income. About one in eight respondents reported not saving
anything, even as Arizona nears the end of its fifth straight year
of robust job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers see this as a missed opportunity on a grand
scale, especially now that the United States is feeling turbulence
from slumping foreign economies. Although Arizona's jobless rate
has hovered near record lows in recent months, there has been
unsettling news _ announced layoffs at major employers such as
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area residents earning less than $25,000 a year would be
most vulnerable to an economic downturn, if one materializes. Ten
percent of the people in this group aren't saving anything, while
34 percent are setting aside less than 5 percent, according to the
Rocky Mountain Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Also, only 25 percent of these lower-income respondents are
saving more than they were last year, compared with 36 percent of
residents in general.
</P>
<P>
   A propensity to save doesn't really take off until family income
passes the $45,000 mark, according to the Behavior Research Center
in Phoenix, which conducted the Rocky Mountain Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's results, coupled with rising bankruptcy numbers,
raise the question of whether some people become financially
reckless during good times _ making impulse buys, ringing up
credit-card purchases and failing to plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Arizonans filing for bankruptcy jumped to 24,686
last year from 19,684 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely will fear for a lot of people when the economy
turns,'' said Kim McGrigg, a spokeswoman for Consumer Credit
Counseling Services Southwest, which offers debt-repayment
assistance. ``We're already seeing more people than ever, and
bankruptcies are at record levels.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrigg thinks everyone should build up a rainy-day fund equal
to at least three months' worth of take-home pay. ``Ideally, people
should have a six-month reserve, but that's probably not
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lee Wagner, a senior financial adviser at American Express
Financial Advisors in Phoenix, suggests splitting the money into
various types of vehicles:
</P>
<P>
   _A checking account for money that can be accessed quickly and
conveniently, even if the yield is negligible or non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   _A bank savings account or money-market mutual fund paying
higher rates of interest, with possible restrictions on the number
of withdrawals or checks that can be written each month.
</P>
<P>
   _A ``laddered'' mix of certificates of deposit. The idea is to
arrange your finances so that you always have a CD coming due
reasonably soon. As a general rule, the longer the time until a CD
matures, the higher the yield it pays.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the current environment of low interest rates, no
savings vehicles are paying much. That's why you don't want to
commit too much cash to a rainy-day fund. Once you have compiled an
ample reserve cushion, it's time to turn to stocks, bonds and
mutual funds that hold these investments.
</P>
<P>
   While they are riskier, bonds and, especially, stocks have
tended to produce much higher returns over the years. They're
appropriate if you want to build wealth, rather than merely store
it.
</P>
<P>
   What other tips can help increase your saving rate?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, arrange to have money debited automatically from
your paycheck and placed in a savings vehicle such as a
money-market mutual fund. If your employer doesn't allow this, you
can have the money transferred from a checking account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payroll (and checking account) deduction plans are valuable
for the majority of people who don't have the discipline or time to
write and mail off a check each month,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   The same principal applies to retirement programs such as 401(k)
plans at work, but these accounts feature additional benefits.
Money is deducted on a pretax basis from your paycheck and
deposited into an investment account of your choice. Typically,
employers offer matching contributions of perhaps 50 cents for each
$1 you invest.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, take a new look at individual retirement
accounts, including the new Roth IRAs. It's easy for most Americans
to qualify for one or either of these tax-sheltered accounts,
including many people with pension coverage at work.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, regard saving as a regular and indispensable
activity. ``Don't view this as an optional part of your budget,''
McGrigg said.
</P>
<P>
   If you must cut up your credit cards, do so. If you must conduct
a dollar-by-dollar review of your monthly income and expenses, make
the effort. Lane, who lives on Social Security and disability
payments, funnels at least something from each paycheck into her
savings account. She plans carefully for anticipated expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might take me three months to put away enough money to have
my hair done,'' she said. ``But I live on a budget and stay on
one.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just how focused must a company be? And how much does it have to
cut before Wall Street is happy?
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions that the directors of Tenneco will
ponder when they meet on Tuesday at the company's headquarters in
Greenwich, Conn. No one expects them to announce any decisions yet.
But as the day wears on, they will most likely decide how to
jettison Tenneco's money-losing corrugated and containerboard
mills.
</P>
<P>
   Then the board will probably set a timetable for splitting the
remaining businesses _ specialty packaging and automotive parts _
into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Tenneco's final attempt to slim down to fighting
weight. The company, founded in 1940 as Tennessee Gas and
Transmission Co., a pipeline company, spent its first 50 years
growing into a conglomerate with businesses as far-flung as
shipbuilding, energy and agricultural equipment. And it has spent
the last five years whittling itself down, from six businesses to
four and now two.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, Tenneco figured that Wall Street would embrace it as
a stronger, better-focused company. Each time, Wall Street declared
it an out-of-step hodgepodge doing too little, too late. Even in
July, when Tenneco first publicly floated the idea that it would
split, its stock rallied just a bit, and then sank.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the board is expected to call it quits on the whole
conglomerate notion, probably by spinning the remaining two
businesses to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought investors would see a mini-conglomerate made up of
two superb performers, and think 2 plus 2 equals 5,'' said Dana
Mead, Tenneco's chief executive. ``They still think 2 plus 2 equals
3. So we are probably looking at the holding company's
liquidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenneco is unlikely to carry out, or even publicize, a decision
to rip itself in two until the stock market improves. But clearly,
it is poised to join ITT and Westinghouse in the dustbin of
conglomerate history.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that investors will apply more favorable
equations to the separate companies. But history should give them
cheer. Case Corp., once Tenneco's agricultural equipment
subsidiary, did a lot better after Tenneco overhauled it and sprung
it loose in 1994. And while Case's stock has slipped badly in the
last six months, analysts say investors were reacting to the
turmoil in the company's Asian markets, not to its management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual companies are always more focused, and thus more
formidable competitors,'' said George Staphos, an analyst with
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Still, automotive parts and packaging are cyclical, slow-growth
businesses. Moreover, diversified companies generally have higher
credit ratings than single-business ones, and it remains unclear
which of the two spinoffs will acquire the lion's share of
Tenneco's $3.2 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might run into problems meeting debt obligations if they
are split apart,'' warned Brian Eisenbarth, an analyst with the
brokerage firm Collins &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the businesses seem robust. Both units enjoy above
average margins in their industries. Tenneco Automotive, whose
brands include Monroe shock absorbers and Walker mufflers, has
acquired some 20 other companies since 1994, and earned $407
million on $3.2 billion in revenue last year. Tenneco Packaging,
which makes Baggies and Hefty bags, has also grown rapidly, earning
$372 million on $4 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Spinoffs generally do better, both in profits and share price,
when freed from their parents. Lucent Technologies, for example,
has been able to capture a higher stock valuation after it left
AT&AMP;T, and many chemical companies have done better without their
pharmaceutical parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts have difficulty understanding multi-industry
companies,'' said Robert Greenhill, chairman of Greenhill &AMP; Co., an
investment bank, which is advising Tenneco.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so _ but that has not depressed multiples at General
Electric, Allied Signal, Textron, or other modern-day
conglomerates. Some investors say it is Tenneco itself, not its
diversity, that is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment Case spun off from Tenneco, its performance started
to improve,'' said Warren Spitz, a portfolio manager of the
Prudential Equity Income Fund, an investor in Case. ``Tenneco just
never seems to wring profitability out of businesses it keeps.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Tenneco split has not whetted investor
appetite for Tenneco shares. Since December 1996, when the company
became two businesses, the stock has fallen 26.5 percent, to
$33.4375, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has risen
34.7 percent. Tenneco's price-earnings ratio is 14.4, trailing the
23.7 average for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their multiple stinks because Wall Street understands exactly
who they are and what they are doing, and none of us buys into
it,'' said Joel Tiss, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Such harsh criticism is not universal among analysts. Many
others say Mead and his troops at Tenneco have worked wonders with
what had been a badly managed company. ``They squeeze the most
profits out of their revenue dollars,'` Eisenbarth of Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, then the dissolution of Tenneco as a conglomerate
shows that once Wall Street loses confidence in a company, even a
cost-conscious, investor-sensitive management cannot always regain
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tenneco's actions this decade could have come out of a how-to
manual for appeasing shareholders. Under the supervision of an
independent board _ Mead is the only inside director _ Tenneco has
peeled off layers of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Out, too, went many of the corporate frills for which Tenneco
was known in Houston, its former hometown. The 85-foot yacht, two
country clubs, a 30-story headquarters building _ all are gone.
Gone too are 10 of its 13 aircraft. Its headquarters staff, once
350 people, is down to 70, and Mead is aiming for 45 by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Free company cars and other such luxuries are gone, replaced by
executive compensation programs that include mandatory ownership of
stock. Mead took his bonus in Tenneco options last year, and says
that he will not profit on them until Tenneco stock reaches $52.
</P>
<P>
   With roughly $13 billion in cash available, Tenneco has since
1992 paid down $9 billion in debt, bought back $1 billion in stock
and shored up its remaining businesses with nearly $3 billion in
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Mead has pledged to keep pruning and reinvesting. In July he
promised to cut an additional $100 million out of Tenneco's annual
costs. He says he will probably sell the old 80,000-square-foot
Henry Luce mansion in Greenwich, which Tenneco made its corporate
home in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of streamlining that Tenneco's board had begged,
in vain, for management to carry out in the 1980s. In 1988, Tenneco
sold its oil business for more than $8 billion in cash _ and
promptly sank most of it into expanding Case, just as demand for
agricultural equipment was falling.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Tenneco expanded its Newport News Shipbuilding
division just as the Cold War was ending. And it refused to drop
its Albright &AMP; Wilson chemical subsidiary, which was plagued with
environmental liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1991, Tenneco was trying to service $11 billion in
debt with just $13 billion in revenue. The board ousted the chief
executive, James L. Ketelsen, and recruited Michael H. Walsh from
Union Pacific to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was a charismatic, mesmerizing executive who knew how to
turn a business upside down,'' said Felix Rohatyn, then a partner
of Lazard Freres, once Tenneco's investment bankers, and now
ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh hired Mead, then an executive of International Paper Co.,
and charged him with solving the Case problem. Mead cut the number
of tractors Case made, trimmed overhead and reduced production
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Tenneco continued whipping subsidiaries into shape. It got
Newport News back into the market for submarines, then spun it, and
$600 million in Tenneco debt, to shareholders. The company
negotiated a tax-free merger of its remaining energy business with
El Paso Energy Corp., receiving $900 million in El Paso stock and
shifting $3.4 billion in Tenneco debt to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got one hell of a lot more for all these businesses than
any of us had expected,'' said Michael Blumenthal, a Tenneco
director since 1985 who was Treasury secretary in the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The breakups were torturous. Like so many multinational
conglomerates, Tenneco had organized itself for maximum tax
benefits, not operational efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd form companies to hold assets, and we'd have subsidiaries
of subsidiaries,'' said Robert Blakely, Tenneco's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Case operated as a stand-alone company in several foreign
countries and had to be unified before it could be sold. Many other
subsidiaries had interlocking assets, so that a subsidiary in
Germany owned Tenneco's real estate in California.
</P>
<P>
   All of those problems landed at Mead's feet in 1993, when Walsh
developed brain cancer. Mead, who had been Inside to Walsh's
Outside, became chief executive in February 1994, and chairman
three months later, when Walsh died.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is still missed by Tenneco old-timers, but many say Mead
fills his shoes well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike had the vision, the personality, the leadership skills,''
said Peter Flawn, who just retired from Tenneco's board. ``But Dana
was always better at execution, and he has really grown into the
CEO's role.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a short tenure. Mead could become chairman of either
packaging or automotive when they are split apart. Or, he could be
non-executive chairman of both. But he is 62 years old, and people
close to him say he is most likely to retire after a split.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the debt burden remains manageable, the businesses
should be able to fend for themselves. Most automotive-parts
companies were hurt by the General Motors strike this summer, and
the packaging industry has been hurt by Asia's economic meltdown.
But analysts say that Tenneco's units have weathered the problems
at least as well as their competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken advantage of consolidation opportunities all over
the globe, and we're probably just one big acquisition away from
doubling our sales,'' said Thomas Evans, president of Tenneco
Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   Tenneco Packaging has been a high flyer since 1995, when it
bought Mobil Corp.'s plastics business and its Hefty and Baggies
brands, for $1.27 billion. Tenneco has since added a zipper-lock
bag, the Hefty One Zip, and has persuaded many delicatessens to use
it for take-out sandwiches. Tenneco has also expanded its
protective packaging and flexible packaging lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to double this business by 2001,'' said Paul
Stecko, Tenneco's chief operating officer. ``We'll do it if we're
part of Tenneco or of another company. But being a pure play will
still be the best thing for our stock.''

acquired some 20 other companies since 1994, and earned $407
million on $3.2 billion in revenue last year. Tenneco Packaging,
which makes Baggies and Hefty bags, has also grown rapidly, earning
$372 million on $4 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Spinoffs generally do better, both in profits and share price,
when freed from their parents. Lucent Technologies, for example,
has been able to capture a higher stock valuation after it left
AT&AMP;T, and many chemical companies have done better without their
pharmaceutical parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts have difficulty understanding multi-industry
companies,'' said Robert Greenhill, chairman of Greenhill &AMP; Co., an
investment bank, which is advising Tenneco.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so _ but that has not depressed multiples at General
Electric, Allied Signal, Textron, or other modern-day
conglomerates. Some investors say it is Tenneco itself, not its
diversity, that is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment Case spun off from Tenneco, its performance started
to improve,'' said Warren Spitz, a portfolio manager of the
Prudential Equity Income Fund, an investor in Case. ``Tenneco just
never seems to wring profitability out of businesses it keeps.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Tenneco split has not whetted investor
appetite for Tenneco shares. Since December 1996, when the company
became two businesses, the stock has fallen 26.5 percent, to
$33.4375, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has risen
34.7 percent. Tenneco's price-earnings ratio is 14.4, trailing the
23.7 average for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their multiple stinks because Wall Street understands exactly
who they are and what they are doing, and none of us buys into
it,'' said Joel Tiss, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Such harsh criticism is not universal among analysts. Many
others say Mead and his troops at Tenneco have worked wonders with
what had been a badly managed company. ``They squeeze the most
profits out of their revenue dollars,'` Eisenbarth of Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, then the dissolution of Tenneco as a conglomerate
shows that once Wall Street loses confidence in a company, even a
cost-conscious, investor-sensitive management cannot always regain
it.

 UNDATED: regain it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tenneco's actions this decade could have come out of a how-to
manual for appeasing shareholders. Under the supervision of an
independent board _ Mead is the only inside director _ Tenneco has
peeled off layers of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Out, too, went many of the corporate frills for which Tenneco
was known in Houston, its former hometown. The 85-foot yacht, two
country clubs, a 30-story headquarters building _ all are gone.
Gone too are 10 of its 13 aircraft. Its headquarters staff, once
350 people, is down to 70, and Mead is aiming for 45 by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Free company cars and other such luxuries are gone, replaced by
executive compensation programs that include mandatory ownership of
stock. Mead took his bonus in Tenneco options last year, and says
that he will not profit on them until Tenneco stock reaches $52.
</P>
<P>
   With roughly $13 billion in cash available, Tenneco has since
1992 paid down $9 billion in debt, bought back $1 billion in stock
and shored up its remaining businesses with nearly $3 billion in
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Mead has pledged to keep pruning and reinvesting. In July he
promised to cut an additional $100 million out of Tenneco's annual
costs. He says he will probably sell the old 80,000-square-foot
Henry Luce mansion in Greenwich, which Tenneco made its corporate
home in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of streamlining that Tenneco's board had begged,
in vain, for management to carry out in the 1980s. In 1988, Tenneco
sold its oil business for more than $8 billion in cash _ and
promptly sank most of it into expanding Case, just as demand for
agricultural equipment was falling.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Tenneco expanded its Newport News Shipbuilding
division just as the Cold War was ending. And it refused to drop
its Albright &AMP; Wilson chemical subsidiary, which was plagued with
environmental liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1991, Tenneco was trying to service $11 billion in
debt with just $13 billion in revenue. The board ousted the chief
executive, James L. Ketelsen, and recruited Michael H. Walsh from
Union Pacific to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was a charismatic, mesmerizing executive who knew how to
turn a business upside down,'' said Felix Rohatyn, then a partner
of Lazard Freres, once Tenneco's investment bankers, and now
ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh hired Mead, then an executive of International Paper Co.,
and charged him with solving the Case problem. Mead cut the number
of tractors Case made, trimmed overhead and reduced production
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Tenneco continued whipping subsidiaries into shape. It got
Newport News back into the market for submarines, then spun it, and
$600 million in Tenneco debt, to shareholders. The company
negotiated a tax-free merger of its remaining energy business with
El Paso Energy Corp., receiving $900 million in El Paso stock and
shifting $3.4 billion in Tenneco debt to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got one hell of a lot more for all these businesses than
any of us had expected,'' said Michael Blumenthal, a Tenneco
director since 1985 who was Treasury secretary in the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The breakups were torturous. Like so many multinational
conglomerates, Tenneco had organized itself for maximum tax
benefits, not operational efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd form companies to hold assets, and we'd have subsidiaries
of subsidiaries,'' said Robert Blakely, Tenneco's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Case operated as a stand-alone company in several foreign
countries and had to be unified before it could be sold. Many other
subsidiaries had interlocking assets, so that a subsidiary in
Germany owned Tenneco's real estate in California.
</P>
<P>
   All of those problems landed at Mead's feet in 1993, when Walsh
developed brain cancer. Mead, who had been Inside to Walsh's
Outside, became chief executive in February 1994, and chairman
three months later, when Walsh died.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is still missed by Tenneco old-timers, but many say Mead
fills his shoes well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike had the vision, the personality, the leadership skills,''
said Peter Flawn, who just retired from Tenneco's board. ``But Dana
was always better at execution, and he has really grown into the
CEO's role.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a short tenure. Mead could become chairman of either
packaging or automotive when they are split apart. Or, he could be
non-executive chairman of both. But he is 62 years old, and people
close to him say he is most likely to retire after a split.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the debt burden remains manageable, the businesses
should be able to fend for themselves. Most automotive-parts
companies were hurt by the General Motors strike this summer, and
the packaging industry has been hurt by Asia's economic meltdown.
But analysts say that Tenneco's units have weathered the problems
at least as well as their competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken advantage of consolidation opportunities all over
the globe, and we're probably just one big acquisition away from
doubling our sales,'' said Thomas Evans, president of Tenneco
Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   Tenneco Packaging has been a high flyer since 1995, when it
bought Mobil Corp.'s plastics business and its Hefty and Baggies
brands, for $1.27 billion. Tenneco has since added a zipper-lock
bag, the Hefty One Zip, and has persuaded many delicatessens to use
it for take-out sandwiches. Tenneco has also expanded its
protective packaging and flexible packaging lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to double this business by 2001,'' said Paul
Stecko, Tenneco's chief operating officer. ``We'll do it if we're
part of Tenneco or of another company. But being a pure play will
still be the best thing for our stock.''

<HEADLINE>
WELD FLIRTS WITH GRANITE STATE REPUBLICANS
</HEADLINE>
 HAMPSHIRE-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ In politics, there are those who flirt with
running for president and those who come to the Granite State with
an entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Former Massachusetts governor William F. Weld, a moderate
Republican with a national following, came to the
first-in-the-nation primary state Monday night to flirt. He was the
star attraction at a fund-raiser for Peter Spaulding, one of the
state's five executive councilors up for reelection in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard, once you get into Salem or Nashua, to be
very coy,'' said Thomas D. Rath, a longtime Republican activist who
is supporting Lamar Alexander for president. ``If you're here,
there is an assumption. It's rebuttable, but people start with the
assumption that you're not up here for the leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld strolled alone through the front door of Mike Ruedig's
home, an hour late, all the while denying presidential aspirations
had anything to do with his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have any,'' he said, insisting that New
Hampshire has long been a home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Weld said he expected to play some sort of role in the 2000
race, citing friendships with at least five other politicians who
have been mentioned as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But when Spaulding told the gathering of Republicans that Weld
had responded to his invitation within a half-hour, Weld could not
resist mischievously jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was positively suspicious!'' he joked. But Weld also
injected a bit of politics into the evening when he told the crowd
that he supported Spaulding because he understands that ``there is
no such thing as government money, only taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some potential candidates already have offices and staff in New
Hampshire, including Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee;
Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher; and Dan Quayle, the
former vice president. Others like to visit from time to time,
dipping a toe into presidential waters. That list includes Ohio
Representative John Kasich, Missouri Senator John Ashcroft, New
York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and now Weld, attorney and
author.
</P>
<P>
   To be a flirtatious potential candidate, a politician must act
as if the mere thought of running for president is preposterous,
without directly ruling out the possibility. The advantage to
flirting is that the political establishment might actually start
begging the flirt to run, creating a buzz of speculation and
interest.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Today'' show last month to promote his new book,
``Mackerel by Moonlight,'' Weld would not say when he was getting
back into politics. ``Well, I'm happy practicing law,'' Weld said.
``I'll pick a horse in 2000, and we'll _ we'll see after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would run for president himself, Weld said that it
was far too early to speculate and that he was having fun being an
author.
</P>
<P>
   If Weld won't speculate, his friends certainly don't mind doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would make a great president,'' said Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci, who inherited the corner office from Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Howell, a former Weld aide, said he would be shocked if the
former governor ran for president in 2000. ``But on the other hand,
he's a relatively young guy and politics is in his blood,'' Howell
said. ``I could see him running again for something someday, and
this is Bill Weld, so anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Weld threw his support behind California Governor Pete
Wilson, whose campaign fizzled quickly. This summer, Weld showed up
at a lobster bake in Rye, thrown by Alexander, who never stopped
running for the Republican nomination after losing the New
Hampshire primary in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Rath said Weld has not hinted to anyone Rath knows that he is
thinking of running. Nevertheless, Rath said, a trip to New
Hampshire is a good way to guarantee attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ought to preserve every possible option for himself,'' Rath
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda L. Fowler, a political science professor at Dartmouth
College, said it makes sense for almost anybody to take a look at
running. She pointed to long shots who have emerged in the past,
such as Jimmy Carter. ``It's not an exercise in hubris for people
to be doing this,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   And if Weld doesn't ever formally run for president, the
exposure could lead to other job offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire might be good for picking a vice president,''
Fowler said. ``That could also be why somebody like a Weld is up
here, positioning himself as a Northeastern moderate Republican to
balance a ticket with someone like George Bush Jr. at the head of
it.''

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Buoyed by a stronger Japanese yen and expectations
of interest rate cuts at home and abroad, stock markets rose
throughout Asia on Monday in what has become a surprisingly
vigorous and sustained rally, although there is no guarantee that
it will last.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong posted the greatest gain, jumping nearly 6 percent, or
483.48 points, to 8,990.27. Since last Wednesday, the benchmark
Hang Seng index has jumped 19 percent. Shares also rose in Bangkok,
Thailand; Seoul, South Korea; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Jakarta,
Indonesia, although less impressively than in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed much of the rally to the stronger yen. Its
gains have taken the pressure off other Asian currencies,
particularly the Chinese yuan and the Hong Kong dollar. With a new
round of devaluations less likely, experts said local investors
were once again dipping into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   For overseas investors, Asia may no longer seem so risky, and
may even have a certain appeal, given the slowing growth in Europe
and the United States, and the problems in other emerging markets,
like Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia is still showing signs of illness, but we've diagnosed
the patient, and we can now move forward,'' said Miron Mushkat, the
director of strategy at Indocam Asia Asset Management in Hong Kong.
``Elsewhere, we're still doing the diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the robust numbers, analysts caution that Hong Kong and
other Asian markets still have deep economic problems. They said
this rally was fragile and could falter quickly _ if, for example,
the slowdown in the United States and Europe meant fewer purchases
of Asian goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear markets are characterized by extremely powerful,
short-lived rallies, where the gains are given up later,'' said
Marc Faber, the head of Marc Faber Ltd., an investment advisory
firm in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   As has so often been the case in this crisis, the rest of Asia
took its cues on Monday from Japan. Tokyo's stock market surged in
the afternoon after the upper house of the Japanese Parliament
approved a plan to tackle that nation's debt-ridden banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that another reason for the bounce was that hedge
funds and other investors had built up huge short positions in both
the yen and the Tokyo stock market. When the yen rose against the
U.S. dollar, these investors began buying shares as a hedge against
their short positions.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's market was also rife with short sellers, who are now
buying shares to offset those positions. In a short sale, an
investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them on the
open market, with an agreement to repay the loan later with more
shares, for which he hopes to pay less than he received for the
borrowed shares. The investor is betting that the market will
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong's market has turned bullish in the last few
trading sessions, there is still no shortage of pessimism in this
former British colony. In a new survey of 150 Hong Kong-based
companies, more than half said they believed that the economy would
get worse before it got better. Only 11.9 percent expected an
improvement in the next six months, according to the survey, which
was conducted by The South China Morning Post and Nomura
International.
</P>
<P>
   Those results echo the glum economic assessment given by Hong
Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa in his annual policy address
last week. Speaking in an interview on Friday, Tung said his
administration could do little to alleviate the pain of the
recession or to bring a swift recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salaries are being adjusted, companies are downsizing and
unemployment is going up,'' he said. ``So it is a very painful
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One broker argued that investors should not discount a rally,
even if it is not based on economic fundamentals. Hong Kong's
market is so psychologically driven, this broker said, that merely
the appearance of better times might be enough to set off a more
secular recovery.
</P>
<P>
   And Tung can take solace from something else: The Hong Kong
government intervened in a big way to prop up the market in August.
The action drew fierce criticism from investors and regulators
around the world. But after gaining more than 1,400 points since
last Wednesday, Hong Kong is sitting on a tidy profit.

   UNDATED - It's as if a plate glass window fell from a high-rise
during lunch hour, smashing onto a crowded sidewalk and narrowly
missing hundreds of potential victims, and no one stopped or even
looked up.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday, Oct. 4, edition of ``The Washington Post'' carried a
full-page advertisement that read in big, bold letters:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you had an adulterous sexual encounter with a current
member of the United States Congress or high-ranking government
official? Can you provide documentary evidence of illicit sexual
relations with a Congressman, Senator of other prominent
officeholder? Larry Flynt and ``Hustler'' magazine will pay you up
to $1 million if we choose to publish your verified story and use
your material.''
</P>
<P>
   It was followed by an 800 number.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a life form lower on the evolutionary scale than Larry
Flynt, aside from the parasitic organisms slithering from the ooze
in hopes of cashing in on his offer?
</P>
<P>
   The politicians in D.C. could have come out swinging. They had a
chance to take all the derisive adjectives the rest of us normally
reserve for them, and use them against Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   Who deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the porno publisher's $85,000 full-page proposition was
met with silence. None of our normally vocal congressman from
Arizona had a thing to say. Nor did most others.
</P>
<P>
   On an average day, news reporters are to Washington politicians
what Leonardo DiCaprio is to teenage girls. But not this time.
There were a few bad jokes, a ``no comment'' or two. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, Flynt said he'd received several hundred
responses, adding, `You gotta understand, a majority of those are
gonna be crank calls without any merit. If I can get only 5 or 10
percent of that, I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy?
</P>
<P>
   The guy lobs slime balls over the heart of the plate and no
bat-wielding politician is willing to take a cut.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if they're afraid of something.
</P>
<P>
   And they are, though it's not what you think. Members of
Congress aren't worried because they cheated on their spouses. Some
may have, but that's not why they refuse to attack Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex; it's about prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians know how Americans feel about people who profit from
tragedy or criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   We despise them.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the lawyers Clark, Darden, Shapiro and Cochran, who
made millions off two dead people in the O.J. Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the vultures mining gold off their ``friendships'' with
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis or Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the hyenas who hoped to make a buck off pathetic
figures like Tonya Harding or Heidi Fleiss or Susan Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Think about Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Think about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The first one illegally tape-recorded her ``friend'' in order
get material for a blockbuster book deal she'd always dreamed
about.
</P>
<P>
   The second seduced a married man, spilled her guts to a grand
jury and now is hoping for a paycheck of much more than $1 million
for book or movie rights.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Congress can afford to condemn Flynt or the low-lifes
who try to cash in on his offer, not as long as their best
witnesses against President Bill Clinton are Tripp and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians have no choice but to mill around like a flock
of sheep, with Kenneth Starr and Larry Flynt the sheperds. Or the
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt plans to dole out his millions one at a time. Starr spent
$40 million on a single case.
</P>
<P>
   Each man has the power to ruin politicians. Each can make
millionaires of those whose skills are best described on the pages
of ``Hustler'' or the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   And, both Starr and Flynt reinforce the message that, in
America, the pot of gold we're all looking for isn't located at the
end of a rainbow, but at the bottom of a sewer. &QL;

YELTSIN BECOMES ILL ON TRIP, RETURNS TO RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In another blow to his dwindling authority, President
Boris N. Yeltsin was forced Monday to cut short his first trip
outside Russia in six months, after Kremlin doctors diagnosed him
with bronchitis, and ordered him back to Moscow for rest.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kremlin hoped that the planned three-day swing through
Central Asia would show that Yeltsin was still capable of running
the country, the abbreviated visit to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
appeared to have had the opposite result. The trip was cut back
after a series of mishaps that made the Russian leader look feeble,
ill, and out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   This weakness was displayed a week after a nationwide protest
that united hundreds of thousands of demonstrators under slogans
calling for Yeltsin to resign. Yeltsin has vowed to serve to the
end of his term in 2000, although many observers here doubt that
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy has been in a free fall since August. Yeltsin
has barely commented on the crisis, and has spent most of his time
at his residence outside Moscow in what his aides describe as
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's health scares no longer cause world markets to tumble
and Russians to catch their breath. That would change, however, if
Yeltsin, 67, were to die or become too incapacitated to stay in
office. Russia has no tradition of democratic transfer of power,
and only vague rules for succession.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that may be one reason why the calls for Yeltsin to
resign have been accompanied by little action. An impeachment drive
has been stuck in parliament; Monday, the campaign stalled again
when a commission of lawmakers could not decide whether Yeltsin was
criminally liable for the deaths of some 80,000 Russian citizens
during the war in the breakaway southern province of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin aides insisted Monday that Yeltsin's latest illness was
not serious enough to force the president to go to the hospital or
even change his schedule. A spokesman suggested that Russia's
efforts to halt planned NATO airstrikes against Serbia over its
crackdown in the separatist province of Kosovo would continue. The
Kremlin says Yeltsin has held a number of phone conversations with
leaders of the Western alliance in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis is another cause for concern. Monday,
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov was quoted by Russian news
agencies as saying a NATO attack against Serb positions would be
``equivalent to a declaration of war against Russia,'' and vowed
Russia would ``support Yugoslavia with all our forces.'' Other
officials have not gone so far, but Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
Monday promised unspecified ``tough measures'' in response to
possible NATO airstrikes. While Moscow's threats probably will not
prevent the strikes, the new questions surrounding the Kremlin's
commander-in-chief will probably add to the uncertainty about the
Russian response.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, who accompanied the president
on the trip, was quoted by the news agency Interfax as saying
Yeltsin had a temperature of 99.3 and was being treated with
antibiotics. A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, said Yeltsin
fell ill last week but insisted on going ahead with the trip.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Yeltsin's many bouts with illnesses, including the
heart disease that led to quintuple bypass surgery in November
1996, Kremlin aides have played down the severity of his health
problems, and have described the president as a poor patient who is
raring to get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   In his trip, Yeltsin moved stiffly and with apparent difficulty.
At a welcoming ceremony Sunday in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent,
he stumbled, and had to be steadied and ushered away by
Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov. Yeltsin canceled several
other appearances, and coughed uncontrollably at talks between
Russian and Uzbek officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Kazakhstan Monday, Yeltsin did not look much better in talks
with President Nursultan Nazarbayev. At a signing ceremony,
Yeltsin, his tongue poking out of his lips, took several minutes to
put his signature to six documents, then appeared to stumble again
as he got up briefly. Shortly after an odd, rambling speech,
Yeltsin left the room, leaning on Nazarbayev for support.

ANALYSIS: ARE WE TOO CONCERNED WITH BALANCING THE BUDGET?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The centerpiece of the Clinton administration's
economic policy this year has been a demand that the
Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the
projected federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that proved politically successful in blocking a
key element of the Republican agenda, and it made economic sense
against the backdrop of strong growth and incipient inflationary
pressures. But with the global financial crisis rapidly changing
the economic outlook for the worse, there are growing questions
from both the left and the right about the wisdom of putting fiscal
rectitude ahead of the potentially more pressing need to sustain
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the administration facing the possibility of a
recession for the first time since taking office, the White House
could face a number of tough choices about whether the
market-friendly policies that defined its approach during economic
boom times are the best way to approach a more difficult period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's most memorable legacy apart from his White
House dalliance will be balancing the budget,'' said Robert Reich,
who was labor secretary during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that there's a budget surplus, the administration has
committed itself to saving the surplus for Social Security rather
than succumbing to Republican tax cuts,'' Reich said. ``But this
has put fiscal policy into a veritable straitjacket. It's not
possible for the White House to talk seriously about stimulating
the economy through tax cuts or spending when it has bound itself
so tightly to the idea of fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it is premature to be talking
about a recession and that whatever path the economy takes the
United States will have more flexibility and strength now that the
deficit has been eliminated. In particular, they said, the Federal
Reserve Board now has considerably more leeway to reduce interest
rates to counter any downturn than it did the last two times the
economy slid into recession, in 1990 and 1981, when the deficit was
rising sharply, making inflation worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic momentum of economic expansion should continue,''
said Lawrence Summers, the deputy treasury secretary. ``And with a
budget in surplus and lower inflation expectations than anytime in
more than three decades, the economy is well positioned to respond
to any challenges that may arise.''
</P>
<P>
   But just the possibility of a downturn is likely to unleash
pressures on the administration to re-examine some of the
principles behind its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took office in 1993 planning to give a traditional
Keynesian boost to a still-sluggish economy through a big deficit
spending package. But he soon abandoned the effort under pressure
from his own economic team, which convinced him there would be a
considerable payoff in the form of lower interest rates if he could
convince the financial markets that he was serious about reducing
the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also adopted a hands-off policy towards the Federal
Reserve, showing considerable deference to its chairman, Alan
Greenspan, and refraining from any public jawboning about official
interest rates. Again the intent was to win the confidence of the
markets by establishing that the administration would support
efforts to squelch inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's international economic policies have also
been distinguished by a belief in the benefits of bringing down
barriers to trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The approach, embodied most notably by Robert Rubin, the
treasury secretary, has paid off, in the administration's view.
Interest rates have come down. Inflation expectations have been
dampened. Seeing a stable environment ahead, businesses have
invested heavily in technology and equipment to increase
productivity, helping to create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping the country, the strategy has built
Clinton a base of political support, and the economy has remained
his primary source of political sustenance as he has battled the
threat of impeachment. So administration officials, while not
ruling out a shift if the economy turns sharply down, say that for
now they have no intention of changing course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipe of fiscal discipline and low long-term interest
rates fueling a sustainable pattern of investment-led growth has
been enormously successful,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House
economic policy adviser. ``While one always has to be open-minded
in the face of changing economic circumstances, the strong
presumption should be to stay with the strategy that has worked
over the past five years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the turmoil in world markets has forced the administration
to defend the merits of unfettered flows of money around the world
and left it scrambling to keep the problems from derailing the
domestic economy. And while still hypothetical, the specter of a
recession in the United States already has both parties thinking
about how to respond.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have seized on the economic uncertainty in the last
several weeks as further justification for the big tax cut that
they have been pressing for all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the weakness in the global economy, now is exactly the
right time to cut taxes,'' said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among liberal Democrats in Congress, there is already a pent-up
demand for more spending. A downturn in the economy, they said,
would only increase the pressure to use some of the surplus on job
training, education and other programs to assist the unemployed and
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been growing criticism of the Federal Reserve for
not moving more forcefully to head off the possibility of a
downturn by cutting interest rates more deeply. The criticism has
come from the left and the right, but not from the administration.
If anything, the administration has been working more closely than
ever with Greenspan in addressing the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that it sticks to fiscal austerity and deference
to the Federal Reserve's current cautious approach to reducing
interest rates, the administration would in a sense be taking the
same advice it is giving to countries like Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   To those countries that are doing the right thing economically
but are still being pounded by the financial turbulence that has
swept around the world from Asia over the last year, the United
States has had a consistent if not wholly reassuring message: Ride
out the short-term disruptions and bank on the long-term benefits
that will come from sound policies.
</P>
<P>
   The situations, of course, are not directly comparable; among
other things, the United States is in far better fiscal condition
than almost any country in the world. But that does not mean that
political pressures would not play a role in determining how long
the principles of austerity and silence on monetary policy would
continue to guide the administration if the economy stalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Keynes said, in the long run we're all dead,'' Reich said.
``In the political world the short run is the election cycle. The
Democrats are potentially vulnerable in 2000 if the economy tanks,
even if austerity is the right medicine over the long run.''

3 AMERICANS SHARE NOBEL PRIZE IN MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three American pharmacologists were awarded the Nobel Prize on
Monday for their surprising discoveries of how natural production
of a gas, nitric oxide, can mediate a wide variety of bodily
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Those include widening blood vessels, helping to regulate blood
pressure, initiating erections, battling infections, preventing
formation of blood clots and acting as a signal molecule in the
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   The prize, for physiology or medicine, went to Dr. Robert
Furchgott, 82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr.
Louis Ignarro, 57, of the University of California at Los Angeles,
and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of a significant phase of the discoveries by
two of Monday's winners at a meeting in 1986 ``elicited an
avalanche of research activities in many different laboratories
around the world,'' said the Nobel committee at the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm, which makes the awards. Its citation said
that the research had led to new treatments for treating heart and
lung diseases, shock and impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Ignarro ``discovered the principle that led to the use of Viagra
as an anti-impotency drug,'' said Dr. Sten Orrenius, a professor of
toxicology at the Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide starts the
process by which blood vessels in the penis widen to produce an
erection.
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide, a chemical relative of the anesthetic gas nitrous
oxide, is better known as a common air pollutant formed when
nitrogen burns, such as in automobile exhaust fumes. But scientists
now know it is distributed widely in the body. The discoveries
honored on Monday were made largely during the 1980s at a time when
scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide but did not
think it was important in animals and humans.
</P>
<P>
   The award committee said that ``this was the first discovery
that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism.'' The
discovery was startling because ``nitric oxide is totally different
from any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is
converted to nitrate and nitrite within 10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Recipients of the Nobel Prize, including some who have lobbied
for it for years, often profess surprise on learning of their
award. This year's winners were refreshingly candid.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott said he had planned to sleep late on Monday, a
holiday, but was awakened at 5:30 at his home in Hewlett, N.Y. He
said that he knew that previous Nobel prize winners had nominated
him for the award, but that he still was ``somewhat surprised'' to
receive it. ``I guess I had some good friends voting,'' Furchgott
said. He said he could not get back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Murad said he had ``pondered the odds and thought that maybe I
could win the prize, if not now maybe in a couple of years.'' He
described the award as the culmination of a career and said that
``when it happens, it's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignarro was traveling in Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, the dean of
UCLA, said ``we actually anticipated this day for about four years
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The three 1998 winners never worked together, ``but we talked a
lot of shop talk at meetings,'' Furchgott said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Valentin Fuster, the president of the American Heart
Association and the head of cardiology at Mt. Sinai Hospital in
Manhattan, said that ``the discovery of nitric oxide and its
function is one of the most important in the history of
cardiovascular medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have learned from the prize-winning research that in
heart disease, the endothelium, or inner lining of arteries, makes
less nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, can help
replenish stores of nitric oxide. Now, drug companies are trying to
develop more powerful heart drugs based on newer knowledge of
nitric oxide's role as a signal molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have also learned that nitric oxide produced in the
endothelium rapidly spreads through cell membranes to the
underlying muscle cells in arteries. Then it can shut off muscle
contractions in the arteries, thus widening them and reducing blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Inhalation of nitric oxide gas has saved the lives of some
people with certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have
developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating
the amount of nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much
can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide plays a harmful role in the collapse of the
circulatory system, or shock, resulting from overwhelming microbial
infections. Bacteria can release products that cause white blood
cells to release enormous amounts of nitric oxide. As a result,
blood pressure drops. Scientists are trying to develop drugs that
can block production of nitric oxide in such infections.
</P>
<P>
   White blood cells also play a role in attacking cancerous cells.
The gas can also induce a type of programmed cell death known as
apoptosis. Scientists are studying nitric oxide's effects on the
immune system to stop the growth of cancers. They are also
exploring nitric oxide's possible role in regulating body
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are measuring the production of nitric oxide in the
lungs and intestines to diagnose a number of ailments, including
asthma and colitis, and are studying its role in menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide formed in nerve cells spreads rapidly in all
directions to activate cells in the vicinity and influence many
functions, like behavior and the mobility of the intestinal tract.
Nitric oxide is also being studied for its role in smell and
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide's role is still unfolding; scientists have written
thousands of scientific papers about it in recent years and have
started a journal, Nitric Oxide.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee cited Furchgott for performing in 1980 ``an
ingenious experiment'' that showed that a drug, acetylcholine,
widened blood vessels only if the inner layer, or endothelium, was
intact. Furchgott concluded that blood vessels widen because the
endothelial cells produce a signal molecule that he called EDRF,
for endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relaxes smooth
muscle cells in blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott's findings ``led to a quest to identify the factor,''
the citation said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The citation did not refer to an accident in Furchgott's
laboratory that played a major role in his discoveries. In 1995, in
the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott wrote
that on May 5, 1978, in the first of a series of planned
experiments on arteries from a rabbit, a technician did not follow
directions correctly. The technician performed one step of the
experiment before instead of after he was supposed to wash out a
drug used in an earlier phase of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott expected that the arteries would contract. Instead,
they relaxed. It was the first time he had seen the drugs under
study produce such a reaction, and he used the insight to plan
additional experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott omitted the technician's name in that paper and in
another in 1996 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
On Monday, he said David Davidson was the technician.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The committee cited Ignarro for concluding in 1986, from ``a
brilliant series of analyses'' conducted independently of
Furchgott, that EDRF was identical to nitric oxide. Furchgott said
he and Ignarro made the announcement at the same symposium in 1986
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., but the papers were not
published until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Murad was cited for work conducted over the years while he
worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Stanford
University in Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Murad said he felt fortunate to have heard Furchgott report his
early work on EDRF in 1980. Murad showed that a gas could regulate
important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and
related heart drugs led to the release of nitric oxide.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, Murad worked in the laboratory of Dr. Theodore Rall, who
also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman of the
University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. Gilman said in an
interview that he believed Rall, now retired and living in
Charlottesville, Va., was the first scientist to have trained two
Nobel Prize winners. In addition, Rall worked with Dr. Earl
Sutherland, who also won a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In his early reseach years, Murad worked on a chemical known as
cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out to be
critical in the nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees referred to
the early work as ``dumping experiments'' because all they could do
in the laboratory at the time was crudely add various hormones and
agents to slices of tissue, cell cultures. It took years to develop
the more refined techniques that led to the understanding of nitric
oxide's many roles in the body.
</P>
<P>
   But for many years, most of the scientific community was
skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric oxide to
activate an enzyme, Murad said in 1996 when he and Furchgott shared
the Albert Lasker basic medical research award.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Prizes were created by the will of Alfred Nobel, whose
invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine. The award
committee noted an odd twist to this year's award. When Nobel
developed chest pain from heart disease, it said, he refused to
take the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it
caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit in the
relief of chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel died in 1896. The prize that the three scientists will
share is now worth $938,000.

COMMENTARY: `A TAWDRY HONEY TRAP'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In President Reagan's second term, top officials used the power
of the White House covertly to sell arms to Iran with the aim of
freeing hostages, and to pass the proceeds to the Nicaraguan
Contras in violation of a congressional statute. The conspirators,
conscious of their lawlessness, tried to conceal their scheme with
cold-blooded lies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grave assault on our constitutional structure: exactly
the kind of state wrong for which the Framers of the Constitution
designed the impeachment clause. No one had the heart to invoke it
against Reagan, a man who was generally liked and who was by then
in a state of decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Iran-Contra affair puts in perspective the Republican
attempt to remove President Clinton from office. For his
wrongdoing, no matter how the advocates of impeachment try to color
it, amounts to illicit sex and lying about it. James Fallows,
writing in The Washington Monthly, sums up the distinction from
Iran-Contra:
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we have a president shamelessly deceiving Cabinet
members, staff and the public about a personal matter. That time we
had Cabinet members and the president's national security adviser,
and probably the president himself, deliberately misleading
Congress and the public about important matters of state.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Americans who are quite unwilling to consider such
rational _ such constitutional _ distinctions. They hate Bill
Clinton and want him out of there whatever the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are others, not primordial Clinton-haters, who
are so disgusted at his behavior that they wish he were out of
office. They do not see how they can respect the man who waved his
finger at us and said he did not have sex with that woman.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans seem to be drawing a distinction between
disapproval of what he did and support for the Republican effort to
drive him from office. People think it is about sex, and they don't
want that to occupy all the space in our political life.
</P>
<P>
   The public understands the largely partisan basis of the
impeachment campaign. The partisan character shows in an
interesting way. Impeachment advocates, aware that a majority of
the public does not think lying about sex is a high crime or
misdemeanor, are now suggesting that something else may turn up to
condemn Clinton: the unproved charges known as Filegate or
Travelgate, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a wonderful formula for destroying the
constitutional balance of powers: Start an impeachment process and
hope that something will turn up to justify it. That approach would
devastate the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Most people understand, too, what the impeachment campaign is
doing to this country, and the world, at a time when our leadership
is desperately needed. If it goes on, 100 senators will be spending
the year 1999 holding a trial of the president of the United States
while the global financial system runs down.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Western world sees what is happening here these days
as a kind of madness. House Republicans would not have started the
impeachment process, The Financial Times of London said the other
day, if they ``had the health of their government and the
international community at heart.'' In The Times of London, the
columnist Simon Jenkins wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Defending the American president against his tormentors may
stick in my throat. But ... I cannot see what good is served by
letting disgust get the better of reason, by tearing up fair trial,
corrupting the Constitution with politics and casting proportion to
the winds. And for what? A tawdry honey trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans understand one more thing: how dangerous it is
for all of us, not just for Bill Clinton, to let an unaccountable
prosecutor bend the rules in an obsessive desire to get one
individual.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons I do not understand, many people in Washington seem
to think it does not matter what Kenneth Starr did to make Clinton
a target of impeachment. That is our old friend The end justifies
the means.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in 1928: ``The greatest dangers to
liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning
but without understanding.''

 &HT;    Glenn's return to space makes lodgings scarce
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Still haven't planned your trip to the Kennedy Space
Center to watch John Glenn's historic space shuttle launch? Don't
expect a front-row seat. Or nearby accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who became the first American to orbit Earth in 1962
aboard Friendship 7, is scheduled to blast off aboard the space
shuttle Discovery at 2 p.m. Oct. 29. At 77, he'll be the oldest
space traveler ever.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of a million people are expected to squeeze
into a one-mile area around the space center in Cape Canaveral,
Fla., to witness the launch, with many more watching from rooftops
and roadsides all over Central Florida. Hotel rooms and parking
spaces should be as scarce as Starbucks outlets on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Brevard County Department of Tourism predicts almost all the
hotels within 30 miles of the launch site will be booked, with few
cancellations anticipated. Procrastinators are being steered to
Orlando, about 50 miles west, and even St. Augustine, 118 miles
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sold out for more than a year,'' says Bill
VanEngelenburg, owner of the 126-room Best Western Space Shuttle
Inn, about three miles from the center. ``I haven't seen this kind
of response since the first shuttle launch'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But the Daytona Beach Hilton, 70 miles north, is still taking
reservations for its six-night ``Rocket to the Stars'' package,
which includes lodgings, a view of the launch from the beach and a
champagne toast for $150 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The space center's complimentary parking passes, which are
usually issued to people who ask for them in writing, have been
suspended for this launch to accommodate the large number of
requests from VIPs and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best unofficial places to view the launch are along
the Indian River on U.S. 1 in downtown Titusville and along the
Beeline Expressway, according to the Brevard County Department of
Tourism. But these are expected to fill up very early.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet may be via the space center's $20 launch package,
which includes access to a viewing area in Titusville (about eight
miles from the launch pad), reserved parking and a Glenn space
shuttle T-shirt. More than half the 5,000 packages are still
available, but are expected to sell out by the Oct. 23 ticketing
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting to your viewing destination may be a problem. In
the past, high-profile launches such as the first one after the
Challenger disaster in 1986 have resulted in traffic jams
stretching for miles around the space center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that they can get here an hour or two
before the launch,'' says space center spokeswoman Melissa Tomasso.
``But they need to be here a long time before that.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommends that ticket holders arrive at the Titusville
viewing area by the 6 a.m. opening time. To make the wait more
entertaining, the space center will provide concessions and live
music. And a crew from ``Good Morning America'' is scheduled to be
there, conducting interviews with the Glenn faithful.
</P>

 &HT;    Despite recall, no illnesses attributed to tainted beef
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Students at Clayton and Rockdale county schools may
have eaten beef patties included in a recall because of possible
salmonella contamination, school officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But no illnesses have been reported that could be attributed to
the bacteria, which can cause diarrhea but usually doesn't result
in serious sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we didn't know we couldn't help,'' said Wendy McNamee,
Clayton's director of food nutrition. The school system was unaware
of the recall last week when it served charbroiled beef patties
made at Zartic Inc., a Cedartown, Ga. meat processing company.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Zartic
expanded a recall of meat products made at the plant. The
nationwide recall, initiated Sept. 25, now includes about 2 million
pounds of beef, poultry and pork products that were distributed to
schools, hospitals and prisons in 34 states.
</P>
<P>
   The meat products were precooked, then quick-frozen for
shipping. While salmonella contamination is not rare, especially in
raw meat and unwashed produce, it is unusual to find it in cooked
foods.
</P>
<P>
   As thorough cooking does kill the bacteria, properly reheating
the frozen Zartic products should eliminate any possible danger,
said Jack Harris, Zartic's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectation is that the vast majority of the products we
are recalling are perfectly good, fine products,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the plant had voluntarily closed three production
lines that were implicated in the contaminated paddies.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company was working with USDA to try to find out
what caused the meat to be contaminated with illness-causing
salmonella bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet determined what the source was, but we believe
it is a surface contamination that somehow got on some of the
product after the cooking step.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Rockdale high school students may have eaten tainted
hamburger patties on Monday, said Linda Waters, director of
Rockdale Schools Food Services.
</P>
<P>
   But it is standard procedure in Rockdale cafeteria kitchens to
cook all meat, whether precooked or raw, at 160 degrees or above to
kill contaminants, Waters said. Rockdale has pulled hamburgers from
today's menus.
</P>
<P>
   Other school systems, including Coweta, Fayette, Gwinnett and
Henry counties, also receive meat products from Zartic. Gwinnett
and Henry officials said the Zartic products they have in stock are
not included in the recall. Fayette and Coweta schools have pulled
Zartic products from their menus.
</P>
<P>
   Zartic, meanwhile, is under a ``hold and test'' order, meaning
nothing leaves the plant until a sample is tested from each lot,
said Linda Swacina, spokeswoman for the Food Safety Inspection
Service of the Agriculture Department. The order will stand until
officials determine how the contamination happened, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA has received no reports of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Eating food tainted with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, cq
whose symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to
72 hours after infection. The symptoms usually last 4 to 7 days,
and resolve without medical treatment unless severa diarrhea causes
dehydration. Young children, older adults and those with impaired
immune systems are more likely to get sicker from salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella lives in animal intestines, and is most often
associated with raw or undercooked foods of animal origin such as
poultry, beef, milk or eggs. Thorough cooking kills salmonella, so
people should avoid eating underdone meats, unpasteurized milk and
foods made with raw eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables may also be contaminated, however, so raw produce
should be washed before eating. Cross-contamination also should be
avoided, by washing hands, cutting boads, counters, knives and
other surfaces after handling uncooked foods.

 &HT;    Pilgrims gather for final public message at Fowler's farm
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paulina Varbuena is expecting a miracle today at Nancy
Fowler's farm in Conyers, Ga. So are thousands of other people who
are at the farm to hear what Fowler says will be the final message
that she will publicly share from the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   For Varbuena, who arrived in Conyers on Monday from Bogota,
Columbia, the miracle she expects will only add to what she already
has received.
</P>
<P>
   Varbuena, speaking through an interpreter, said she had a vision
of the Blessed Mother Mary during her bus ride on Monday to the
farm. Friends also said that Varbuena had three rosaries that
changed color.
</P>
<P>
   Experts today will be looking to authenticate experiences such
as Varbuena's. Ricardo Castanon, a Bolivian neuropsychophysiologist
who specializes in stigmata and weeping statues, said the
phenomenon is simple: God is talking to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is saying that he is still alive, but his followers have
forgotten him,'' said Castanon.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people are expected for the message that
Fowler will deliver today at 1:45 p.m. Police are asking local
motorists to avoid using the main north-south county highway.
</P>
<P>
   But locals like Barbara Frazier, a Baptist who said she plans to
attend, won't have much choice. She said she ignored the event in
the past, but wants to be part of today's gathering ``out of
curiosity and for inspiration.'' Meanwhile, human traffic lines
began forming Monday at stores and restaurants, as a steady flow of
buses, motorhomes and cars made their way to the farm.
</P>
<P>
   The event is attracting media attention worldwide. The Catholic
Church, however, has not given its blessings to the claims by
Fowler, a homemaker and former nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church views all apparitions skeptically, said the
Rev. Peter Dora, vicar general and spokesman for the Archdiocese of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of study is detailed, and takes many, many years,''
Dora said.
</P>
<P>
   The last apparition site to have been given papal approval was
at Fatima, Portugal. Three shepherd children reported to have seen
an angel of peace in 1916 and, later, the Virgin Mary, on Oct. 13,
1917, when she told the children three secrets. Vatican approval
took 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tesoriero, an Australian lawyer and television producer, has
been documenting Fowler's claims since 1992. He plans to chronicle
today's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have taken the trouble to examine the story in
detail know that something is happening with Nancy Fowler, and that
it is not something created or the result of any mental imbalance
or fraud by any of her supporters,'' Tesoriero said.

 &HT;    Firms had different means of measuring Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before merging, Media Metrix and Relevant Knowledge
used different methodologies to measure the audience for sites on
the World Wide Web. Just as Nielsen ratings help advertisers
evaluate television programs, these companies created the yardstick
for advertising on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Relevant Knowledge used a randomly selected panel of 10,000
users who downloaded software from a special Web site. The software
let the company track the users' surfing habits as they went from
site to site.
</P>
<P>
   The company pioneered the idea of measuring a site's popularity
by tracking how many separate people visited it rather than the
traditional method of counting how many ``hits'' it received. Under
the older method, one person could visit a site several times and
each ``hit'' by the person would be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company's technology is Web-based, Relevant
Knowledge is able to turn around data for clients faster than Media
Metrix. For example, when the Starr Report was published on the
Internet, Relevant Knowledge was able to release usage figures
several days later.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix uses patented software ``meters'' to measure
Internet and offline usage. The meters capture real-time, actual
behavior of Internet users. Media Metrix asks its panel of 30,000
users to install software that monitors all PC activity, ranging
from surfing the Web to running software to using services such as
America Online, Pointcast and Juno.
</P>
<P>
   Because the disks must be returned to Media Metrix for download
and analysis, the company reports Web usage on a monthly basis
only. The newly-merged company, according to Levy, will be able to
provide new measurement products and services beginning next year.

 &HT;    Web measurement firms to merge
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Relevant Knowledge and Media Metrix, the
two leading Web measurement providers and strong competitors, said
Monday they would merge to form a company that could create an
industry standard for the Web advertising and marketing industry.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will retain the name Media Metrix with the
tagline, ``The Power of Relevant Knowledge.'' Neither Media Metrix
President and Chief Operating Officer Mary Ann Packo nor Relevant
Knowledge founder Jeff Levy would discuss financial terms. Levy
estimated the combined revenue of the new company to be ``in the
low eight figures.'' The companies say the merger of the two
private entities will become final by Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   While company officials called this a true merger of equals, the
top two officers of the new company come from New York-based Media
Metrix. Packo will maintain her title as president of the new
company. Tod Johnson, chairman and chief executive of Media Metrix,
will hold that title in the new company. Levy will be vice chairman
and a board member of the newly created company.
</P>
<P>
   During a one-hour press briefing, company officials said the
newly created firm would not have one headquarters city, but would
split its corporate headquarters near Georgia Tech in Atlanta, New
York City and San Francisco. Packo will remain in New York, while
Levy will continue to be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said there will be no relocation or downsizing. ``We're
here in downtown Atlanta,'' he said. The newly merged company will
have 90 employees evenly split among Atlanta, New York City and San
Francisco. Levy and partner Tim Cobb, also named vice chairman of
the new company, will focus on new product technology and
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not two big, overstaffed companies merging,'' Levy
said. ``It's two small, understaffed companies.'' He said the new
company plans to expand its staff by at least 35 percent in the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The merger) is the starting point of more growth,'' Levy
said, ``Not by cost cutting, but by integration and combining the
best of both companies and providing things to our clients neither
of us have been able to provide on our own. This is what the
industry has been looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the merger, Media Metrix and Relevant Knowledge used
different techniques to measure Web usage. Now, according to Packo,
the merged company will be able to leverage the strengths of both
methodologies and create new products that will serve advertisers,
brands and media buyers. Instead of two companies vying for
supremacy, the new Media Metrix could dictate the way Internet
measurement is done.
</P>
<P>
   Packo and Levy said the combined methodologies will enable the
new company to develop products neither would have been able to
produce on its own. ``We are looking at weekly ratings,'' Packo
said. ``We'll have breadth and depth and speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Packo both said the merger was a result of advertiser
concerns and demands from an industry conference called the Proctor
&AMP; Gamble FAST summit, held in August to discuss the best ways to
accelerate the growth of the online advertising industry.
Advertisers, agencies and Web sites were clamoring for a reliable
measurement standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAST Summit crystallized the need for what we're doing,''
Levy said. ``We have numbers they can understand and believe in.
We'll work closely with the FAST group to make sure what we've got
what the industry wants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good thing for the industry,'' said Richy
Glassberg, senior vice president and general manager of Turner
Interactive Sales and a founding member of the Interactive
Advertising Bureau as well as a member of the FAST Summit steering
committee. ``They've stopped the infighting, and now they can get
down to some of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassberg hopes the company expands its panel of business and
university users.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you only measure home usage you miss a lot of the users
on the Web, and that doesn't do anybody any good,'' he said.
``There should be better measuring of Web usage in the workplace
and at universities. Agencies and clients are very concerned that
nobody is measuring this audience. Just because they've gotten
together doesn't mean they've solved any of the problems. They have
a lot to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Winter, president of Cox Interactive Media, also applauded
the merger. ``These two companies have shown the way for audience
measurement on the Web,'' he said. ``It's also a good thing for the
Atlanta Internet industry. It means the premier audience
measurement company will be based here in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What everyone is crying for in the industry is standards, and
while both companies are highly regarded, it will allow further
unified standards and benchmarks for advertisers, publishers and
vendors,'' said Drew Ianni, online advertising analyst with Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ianni said the new company might have joined forces to be better
prepared for the eventual entrance of Nielsen Media Research into
the Web measurement field. ``The key is for them to come out with
one defined standard and they may become the de facto standard if
nobody else becomes a player in the space.''

IN NBA LABOR DISPUTE, YOU CAN SIDE WITH, AH, IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Somebody asked the other day whether there's ever been
two parties in a public dispute less deserving of sympathy than the
NBA owners and NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure. Here's my short list:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq vs. Iran _ Countries that have established why the rest of
the world moved out of the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr vs. Bill Clinton _ Ravenous egos more unstoppable than
the combined force of the Constitution, the rule of law, the
English language and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp vs. Monica Lewinsky _ A real-life version of Mad
Magazine's old ``Spy vs. Spy,'' only without the wit, originality
or cleverness. Just as tasteless, however.
</P>
<P>
   Don King vs. Mike Tyson _ One has electric hair, one has an
electric stare, both deserve the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as two parties in a sports-labor dispute completely
devoid of sympathy as well as empathy ...
</P>
<P>
   No. Never has been one like this one.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way:
</P>
<P>
   Which one is Beavis?
</P>
<P>
   At least in the modern labor disruptions of baseball, football
and hockey, a plausible argument could be offered that the players'
side had been at one time disadvantaged relative to ownership. That
was particularly acute in baseball, where the reserve clause
virtually bound a player to a team for life, creating little
leverage for players and boundless profitability for owners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the huge union advances made in collective bargaining
and the creation of improved free agency in the past 20 years, the
pendulum has swung. In baseball, it has swung so far that the union
runs the sport and the franchises just tag along.
</P>
<P>
   Great advances happened for basketball, too, except that its
landmark labor peace in 1984 was achieved when the sport was at its
nadir. The crisis was tangible enough that both sides worked from
the same pile of devalued rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Now we see the NBA as victim of its own success. The NBA's
two-decade-long merchandising of the game's individual heroes, as
opposed to teams, has produced a star-driven industry whose stars
make the soundest claim among all sports that league success is
more dependent upon individuals than teams, franchises or the game
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, owners have agreed, not only by lavishly marketing
the players but by paying the highest salaries in sports, rivaling
the biggest in show business.
</P>
<P>
   The owners no longer want to pay those salaries. They want
take-backs _ primarily an end to the Bird exception that allows
teams to pay their own free agents unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is how the Chicago Bulls can have a payroll of
nearly $60 million when the salary cap is less than $30 million.
It's why the league claims up to half its teams are no longer
profitable, a claim the union _ and anyone working with more than a
brain stem _ dismisses as piffle.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is ownership believes the claim sufficiently to
endure a self-imposed shutdown. Owners have two things going for
them _ a huge war chest supplied by TV revenues and the stupidity
of the American sports consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA watched baseball's recovery from the 1994 strike that
cost the World Series and bled into the 1995 season. Disastrous as
it was, the NBA, always mindful of the bigger picture, figured if
it took only four years for the dopes who run baseball to get the
game close to where it was, the basketball slicksters will need
half a season, tops. They're probably right, because of the nearly
infinite capacity of most pro sports consumers to forgive and
forget, as well as their susceptibility to clever apologies and
emotional make-goods (see Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Owners want something more like the NFL's harder salary cap. Yet
22 of the 30 NFL teams, including the Seahawks, exceed the $52
million cap thanks to a variety of loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Caps just don't work as advertised. The NBA is asking for an
artificial limit on labor costs, while there is no cap on their
potential revenues. Nor is there a cap on ticket costs. Unless caps
are agreed to on all fronts, their deployment on one element of the
economic equation will create unfairness that almost always leads
to further labor trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite having the economic points on their side, today's
basketball players are not only not disadvantaged like their
sports-labor predecessors a generation earlier, they are
financially on top of the world while operating behind the
protection of a union that works for its elite instead of its rank
and file _ exactly the opposite of all non-sports unions.
</P>
<P>
   No union member at Boeing can be expected to accept the arcane
arguments about market economics when jewelry-bedecked players roll
up to private jets in limos. Nor can the average basketball fan
accept the notion that there is nothing in the enormous wealth
accumulated by players that can't be surrendered in order to have a
season.
</P>
<P>
   The players are atop a false economy, hiding behind a false
front. The owners are creating artificial crisis and applying
artificial brakes.
</P>
<P>
   In this argument, take Iraq, and give the points.

EYE ON POLLS, GORE STEPS UP CRITICISM OF REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (ll) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Emboldened by recent polls that suggest a backlash
against Republicans for initiating impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore on Monday made his
strongest comments to date on the subject in speeches criticizing
Congress for not passing significant legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At two fund-raisers here for Democratic candidates, Gore lashed
out at what he called a ``do-nothing Congress'' that has focused on
the president's problems at the expense of issues more important to
the American people. The remarks were the most extensive the vice
president has publicly made about the president's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was wrong,'' Gore said at a lunch for
Hubert Humphrey and Roger Moe, who are running for governor and
lieutenant governor of Minnesota. ``He has acknowledged that and
asked for forgiveness. The American people have also concluded that
the proposed process called impeachment is not a punishment that
fits the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They want to move on. They are tired of all these
people on television talking endlessly about something that
everybody knows more about than they ever wanted to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gore made virtually the same points in a speech for
Rep. David Minge and Rep. Bruce Vento, Minnesota Democrats who are
expected to be re-elected without much trouble. Humphrey, the state
attorney general and son of the former vice president and senator,
and Moe, a former state legislator, are in tougher races against
their Republican opponents: Norm Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul,
and Gen Olson, a state lawmaker and former mayor of Minnetrista.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to turn up the heat on the Republicans was
influenced by a number of political developments, aides said, among
them new polls on the Monica Lewinsky matter and the lack of
agreement on a federal budget almost two weeks into the 1999 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are dragging it out in hopes they will gain
some partisan advantage for it, even if it ends up hurting this
country by dragging it on indefinitely,'' Gore said of the
impeachment proceedings. ``And that's why I say again to the
Republican majority in the Congress: Get on with it. Pass a budget.
Pass the appropriations bills. Fund education. Save Social Security
first. Pass a patients' bill of rights. And do the will of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the impetus for the vice president's attack, aides said,
came from internal White House polls showing that Republican gains
in congressional races had peaked in late September, about a week
after the videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony was broadcast
to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings appeared supported by a survey last week by The
Washington Post, which found that public support for Congress, and
for Republican congressional candidates, had slipped in the
aftermath of the vote to begin impeachment proceedings. The House
vote was largely along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to finding that Clinton's approval ratings had
increased, the Post reported, the poll found that support for
Democratic candidates had increased, while support for Republican
candidates had fallen. This reversed a trend of several months
during which Republican candidates had been increasing their leads
over Democrats, the newspaper said.

`SPORTS NIGHT' SUCH GOOD TV IT IS SCARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I grow up, I want to work for Isaac Jaffee.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of ``Sports Night,'' the best new show on television,
know him as the Lou Grant of the new millennium. Portrayed in
down-to-earth, Emmy-worthy style by Robert Guillaume, Jaffee is the
boss we'd all be if management had the sense to put us in charge:
tough but fair, demanding but supportive, unafraid to make a
decision _ any decision _ even under the gaze of second-guessing
corporate types.
</P>
<P>
   For those consigned to the ``Dilbert''-ian working model, guys
like Isaac Jaffee don't exist. But Guillaume makes Jaffee, the
executive producer of a cable-TV sports show, so flesh-and-blood
believable that there may be millions out there who have embraced
new hope these past few weeks that their boss will someday
acknowledge their contribution to the overall effort, will seek
their counsel when appropriate and will remember their name when
passing in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot to expect from a sitcom. But read my blips here:
``Sports Night'' is not a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a half-hour show that comes on right after ``Spin
City'' on Tuesday nights. Yes, it follows the esteemed
situation-comedy format of a brief tease followed by two acts that
add up to about 22 minutes. But ``Sports Night'' is something quite
remarkable among TV series. It's a show that transcends the
pigeonholing that critics have employed since we all started to
love Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a half-hour drama with funny moments, a play that
mixes the pith of Mamet (minus the blue language) with the wit of
Coward (minus the bluebloods). Only one problem for me and some
friends who have become ``Sports Night'' groupies: It always ends
way too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem: The brain trust at ABC has insisted
that ``Sports Night'' have a laugh track, so there is confusion
about what the show is trying to be. Many who hear the laughter
assume it's supposed to be a fall-on-the-floor, chuckle-a-minute
comedy, and they change the channel if 30 seconds go by without a
punch line.
</P>
<P>
   It's their loss. But it may be ours, too, if ABC's dubious
laugh-track decision keeps ``Sports Night'' from attracting the
fans it needs to stay on the air. So, hear me out, please. ``Sports
Night'' is too good to lose. It's so well made (by Ron Howard's
Imagine Television in association with Disney's Touchstone), that
it's scary. Three episodes into the season, it's as polished as
anything that's been on for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Aaron Sorkin, who got the idea for ``Sports Night'' after
repeatedly watching ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' as he worked on the
screenplay of ``The American President'' a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best show on cable, day in and day out,
``SportsCenter'' inspired Sorkin to go behind the scenes of such a
program, to explore what it would be like to work in a highly
charged, pressure-packed atmosphere with people so passionate about
sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' Sorkin's ``Sports
Night'' is very ``inside'' while not being exclusionary, a
compellingly accurate portrayal of the real thing. Unlike
``Sanders,'' though, ``Sports Night'' isn't satire. Sorkin calls it
a ``marriage'' between the comedy of half-hour television and the
drama of one-hour television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really do either of them well enough to only do one of
them,'' Sorkin said last summer, hewing to the sports metaphor.
``My fastball isn't fast enough and my curveball doesn't break
enough. If I'm going to get the batter out, I'm going to have to
mix up the pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what Sorkin has done, to popular effect, in films like
``The American President'' and on stage with ``A Few Good Men,''
which he later adapted for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unusual about this,'' he said of his first TV effort,
``is that it's just simply in a different place.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorable reviews notwithstanding, it hasn't been an entirely
happy place. Sorkin vigorously opposed the laugh-track idea, for
instance, but he hopes viewers can get past the obvious foolishness
of the forced laughter and appreciate his attempt to capture the
dignity of real people in a real work environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show isn't written in traditional sitcom rhythm,'' Sorkin
said. ``Wonderful, wonderful writers ... have written (comedy) in a
rhythm that I simply can't. I have to do what I have to do ... and
I'm not sure this rhythm works when you stick a laugh track on top
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin is right, but every little element of ``Sports Night'' is
powerful enough to overcome such distractions. All-world writing
infuses the performances of a first-string cast, and five cameras
(rather than the three or four of most half-hour comedies) create
dramatic new perspectives in a half-hour setting.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin wanted to create something that spoke to him the way
``SportsCenter'' did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like this is a place I'd like to work, this is a place
where I could meet my best friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Me, too. After three weeks with Dan Rydell (Josh Charles), Casey
McCall (Peter Krause), Dana Whitaker (Felicity Huffman), Jeremy
Goodwin (Joshua Malina) and Natalie Rosen (Sabrina Lloyd), I'm
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jaffee, you know where to reach me.

<P>
   TIANJIN, China _ Every afternoon, in the small courtyard outside
the Machang Street Re-employment Center, small groups of laid-off
workers anxiously scan the day's help-wanted listings. There is a
sad sameness about this ragtag army of job hopefuls, each one
dressed up, ready for an interview at any time: They are all women,
all over 35 and all unskilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our factory everyone who was laid off was a woman,'' said
Sun Jingqi, 41, a former textile worker. ``Look around you,
everyone here is female,'' added Ms. Sun, who had put on heels and
makeup and a smart red sweater outfit for yet another fruitless
trip to check the board. ``Now what can we do? We're not young
enough. We don't have experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As China struggles to convert to a market economy, closing and
shrinking state-owned industries, women over 35 have born the brunt
of the pain: They are far more likely to be laid off and far less
likely to find a new job than any other group in China.
</P>
<P>
   These women were the worker ants who for decades populated
factory floors in an array of state industries that have now shrunk
or mechanized, from textile mills to chemical plants. They learned
few skills despite years of work, and are mostly poorly educated,
belonging to a generation that came of age during the Cultural
Revolution, when most of China's universities were shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But they suffer, too, from outright discrimination and deeply
held cultural biases about the limited abilities of women,
particularly women over 35. Such biases have free play in a country
where want ads often specify sex _ not to mention height, age and
body characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're over 35, it's very hard to find work,'' said a
sad-looking 43-year-old woman at the re-employment center who would
give only her last name, Yang. She said she had been laid off this
year from a food-processing plant and was preparing to go out on an
interview for a part-time job cleaning windows at 60 cents an hour.
``What can you do?'' she asked. ``You have young and old ones to
look after. You're old to learn new skills. You're not attractive
anymore. Nobody wants us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Chinese surveys have found higher-than-normal
rates of depression, family violence and divorce in households
where women have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laid-off working women don't just need jobs, they also need
emotional help,'' said Tan Lin, a population expert at Nankai
University here. ``They lose their chance to be employed, or
re-employed. They sit home lonely and feel depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year women accounted for only 39 percent of China's work
force but nearly 61 percent of its laid-off workers, according to
the Ministry of Labor. What is more, 75 percent of laid-off women
are still unemployed after one year, surveys show, compared with
far fewer than 50 percent of their male counterparts. The problem
is so great that the Chinese have coined a phrase, a kind of
acronym meaning ``laid-off working women,'' to describe this
pitiable group.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly serious in places like Tianjin, a
sprawling coastal manufacturing city of 9 million people that is a
center of the textile industry and so was stung by 320,000 layoffs
in 1997 alone. Since jobs at state industries have historically
come with a wide range of social benefits, laid-off workers often
lose medical care, child care and funeral benefits as well as a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments, and especially the governmental women's
federations that exist in every Chinese city and town, have done
much hand-wringing about the laid-off women, organizing courses to
teach them new skills and operating re-employment bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   But their efforts have been only mildly successful, and have
inevitably stressed a return to unskilled, low-wage labor. ``The
training programs they offer have reinforced stereotypes about
women's work and skills,'' said Ching Kwan Lee, a sociologist at
the City University of Hong Kong: ``beautician, seamstress,
domestic helper, child care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when the government still assigned jobs, the
Communist Party made sure that women were well represented in
companies and factories. But now working women can choose and be
chosen, and market forces have not been so kind. Despite laws
promoting equal opportunity for women in China, companies openly
favor men over women for certain types of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder for women to find work,'' said a law school
graduate in the midst of a job search, who gave only her surname,
Wang, for fear of angering would-be employers. ``When they are
willing to hire a woman, they want someone who's beautiful and
capable, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She said many companies thought jobs were too strenuous for
women if they involved travel or work in rural towns considered too
rough.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are even more reluctant to hire women over 35 since,
in China, they tend to bear full responsibility for both child care
and elder care, researchers say. They add that these women possess
few working skills, even compared with the men from their former
factories, who had tended to hold the technical jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say they expect that most laid-off workers
will find jobs in the service sector _ which is growing as
industries shrink. But they acknowledge that women over 35 have few
prospects in a sector currently obsessed with youth and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ad placed by Jinzhiyuan Garment Co. in Beijing
Youth Daily: ``Secretary, Beijing residents, female, under 30,
above 1.65 meters, must have regular features.'' Or another by
L'Oreal Cosmetics: ``Promotion girl, female, under 28 years old,
above 1.65 meters tall, white skin, skinny, healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Yongping, director of the Machang Street Labor Market,
said: ``We have found it very difficult to get women over 40
re-employed. There are not so many jobs and, of course, the
catering services, department stores and private companies want the
younger ones. They won't take women in their 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said that such women could only find re-employment through
women's federations or ``neighborhood committees,'' small
grass-roots government organizations that in the past focused
mostly on enforcing the one child-per-family policy and reporting
on suspicious political activity. Such committees have recently
branched out, offering dry-cleaning services and help finding jobs,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Gen Wei, an earnest middle-aged woman with a hard-working air,
runs the job placement program at the Sanheli Neighborhood
Committee, which covers 5,000 people in a compound of dreary
five-story concrete apartment blocks linked by a web of huge gas
and water pipes that weave through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at her desk in a spare shack decorated with a huge
poster bearing the names of local Communist Party members, she
shook her head as she flipped through a thick black binder
containing 100 forms from people looking for work, 70 to 80 percent
of them women.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had found part-time work for 40: delivering
newspapers; cooking in a company canteen; helping with child care,
elder care or housework. ``The men are easiest,'' she said. ``They
usually have a skill, like fixing plumbing. The women are harder,
they have no skills, especially women over 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the committee's help, Liu Xiuhong, a quiet 48-year-old
in a frilly cream-colored blouse, has found work as a part-time
nanny for the 18-month-old son of a 30-year-old lawyer and her
husband, a middle-class couple who recently bought an apartment in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu said she was among 100 working women laid off by a small
state-owned sewing machine factory early last year. Although the
factory is supposed to give her a monthly unemployment payment as
well as medical coverage, it is broke and she has received nothing
since January, she said. She makes about $30 a month as a nanny.
</P>
<P>
   The Tianjin Women's Federation has set up something called Home
Service Co., which offers laid-off factory workers jobs as
domestics. Since 1997, 80,000 women have come for help to the
Women's Federation, said Wang Zhiguo, its chairwoman, who estimated
that 10,000 had been retrained.
</P>
<P>
   Xiao Yuhua, 38, a cheerful woman with a broad grin, said she had
tripled her income, to $130 a month, since she started work as a
housekeeper for Women's Federation Home Service Co.; she was laid
off from her job at Tianjin No. 1 Textile Plant three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kang Li, 31, who had coiffed hair, bright red lipstick and a
cell phone, said the federation had helped her start a successful
business selling steamed buns, after she was laid off from her job
at a handicraft company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But such success will be harder to come by now that the number
of unemployed women has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the U.N. Development Program and the Chinese
government announced a $1 million, three-year project to help the
laid-off working women in Tianjin, teaching them technical and
business skills as well as giving them small new-business loans.
Significantly, the program also includes gender-sensitivity
training for employment officials, who are quick to confide that a
woman, at 40, is ``too old'' to learn to use a computer, or ``too
fat'' to be hired.
</P>
<P>
   In China, such biases run so deep that women often seem to share
their culture's low opinion of them. ``Being laid off is difficult
for men and women, but the men recover quickly,'' said Yang Xiyuan,
a retired lawyer in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I met laid-off women workers from a textile factory
who were given new jobs in a bank, but they learned too slowly.
They were all in their 40s, so their reactions were not very quick.
They just couldn't do it fast enough.''

CLOSE RACE FOR OHIO GOVERNOR, DESPITE STORIED NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ There are few names that evoke as much political
resonance in Ohio as Taft. From William Taft, the United States'
27th president and a chief justice, to his son, Robert Taft, a
senator and presidential contender, the family name is one that
helped define Republican politics for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a race in which name recognition has been as much of an
issue as state policy, Bob Taft, Ohio's secretary of state and
great-grandson of the president, is running for governor in a
campaign that is considered a classic Ohio contest.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Taft, 56, the scion of a wealthy Cincinnati
family, hails from the state's southwestern, more conservative,
Republican heartland. His Democratic opponent, Lee Fisher, 47, a
former state attorney general, is a product of Ohio's urban
northeastern Democratic base, having once represented some of
Cleveland's low-income neighborhoods as well as its affluent
suburbs in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taft has enjoyed widespread name recognition, it is
Fisher who has attracted significant attention in recent weeks with
a proposal to reduce property taxes by 15 percent _ or $1 billion _
over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has taken great pains to highlight his plan and win the
attention of voters. A few days ago, for example, he held a news
conference at the home of a family in Toledo that displayed
supermarket items they would buy with the money they would save
under the property tax measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can fund this property tax relief and still increase
per-pupil expenditures,'' Fisher said in an interview in Toledo
after his news conference. ``And we can still have growth of 3 to 4
percent in all other areas of the state budget.''
</P>
<P>
   That tax plan has served as the basis of a series of blistering
television commercials by the candidates in which each attacks the
other for his record on taxes. Taft's commercials dismiss the
proposal by Fisher as unattainable and accuse him of having a
history more closely associated with raising taxes than reducing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his proposal is doable without a tax increase''
in some other area, Taft said, on his way to a community dinner at
a Lebanese Catholic church in Akron. ``It's a reckless proposal,
kind of a last-minute, Hail Mary type of plan that's not in tune
with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft has proposed a far less sweeping tax-reduction plan,
calling for a tax deduction of as much as $2,500, for college
tuition costs for families with annual incomes of $50,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   On subjects other than the tax plan, Taft offers a
bread-and-butter Republican platform. With Gov. George Voinovich
barred from seeking a third consecutive term, and now running for
the Senate, Taft seeks to be the first Ohio Republican to succeed a
Republican governor since 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of Republican women in Akron recently, Taft
talked of both the need to improve the state's schools and his
commitment to being ``tough on crime and tougher on violent,
juvenile offenders'' while looking to develop programs to
rehabilitate young people who commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has tried to portray his Republican opponent as an elite
official who is out of touch with most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Taft does not speak to the concerns of everyday Ohio
families and understands the problems of working families,'' Fisher
said. ``He has stood on the side of large insurance companies that
have arbitrarily cut off thousands of seniors from insurance
coverage. You've got someone from a famous family running against
someone who is standing up for ordinary families.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates offer starkly different views on a number of
issues. Fisher, for example, supports abortion rights, while Taft
is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape or incest. Taft
supports the privatization of the prisons in the state, while
Fisher does not. And Fisher has opposed recent efforts to tighten
the state's workers compensation laws, initiatives supported by
Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue in the campaign has been the matter of a debate.
Fisher is seeking a one-on-one appearance with Taft. The Republican
candidate, on the other hand, has indicated his preference for a
debate with the two minor-party candidates in addition to Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is traditionally a swing state where elections for governor
can go _ and have gone _ either way. But in recent years, the
Republicans have enjoyed something of a heyday, having captured
nearly all the statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, four years ago the Democrat's showing was so weak in the
race for governor that the party surpassed by only a few percentage
points the 20 percent threshold required under Ohio law to hold the
status as a party on the state ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls in recent weeks have placed Taft ahead slightly.
But with most polls indicating that 20 percent to 25 percent of the
voters remain undecided, Fisher and state Democratic leaders
suggest that the race is winnable.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Fisher has been particularly adept at fund
raising, especially for a Democratic candidate in Ohio. While Taft
still commands the fund-raising lead, having taken in more than $8
million, Fisher is not far behind, having raised more than $7
million for the campaign and matching Taft's television presence.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the other statewide race, for the Senate seat being
vacated by retiring John Glenn, Voinovich has outraised his
Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, by more than 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning, Taft urges his core supporters not to become
complacent. At the same time, Fisher said his campaign's internal
polling showed the race to be a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-grandfather,'' Fisher said, ``was an immigrant
sheet-metal worker from Russia, and I am running against a man
whose great-grandfather was president of the United States. But the
wonderful thing about America is that if you speak to the concerns
of everyday people, you can even the playing field.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THERE was a time, less than 20 years ago, when the NBA was not the
hottest marketing success in the pantheon of American sports, when
the fantasy of every kid on the streets was not to wear his _ or
her _ shorts baggy enough to hide a school bus or to have a
smoothly shaved head and star in a cartoon movie with Bugs Bunny,
just like Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Back in those days, the dark ages, the league was a cult sport
made up of free-spirited players and hard-core, devoted owners who
simply loved the rhythm and individual artistry of this distinctly
American game.
</P>
<P>
   At the very best, it was an underground phenomenon toiling on
the outer fringes of obscurity, playing in half-filled arenas with
championship games shown on tape delay around midnight. At worst,
the NBA was a core of splendid athletes surrounded by a collection
of bad actors and druggies, a bad attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, all that has changed. It has crossed
international boundaries, rivaling soccer in worldwide popularity
to the point where every Tom, Dick and Vladimir can recite the
Chicago Bulls' starting lineup. The stars of the game are megawatt
celebrities, journeyman players average nearly $2 million per year
in salary, and shiny new arenas have been erected from coast to
coast to pay homage to the game's marketing success.
</P>
<P>
   But now is the time _ as the current labor showdown begins this
week to wipe out scheduled exhibition games _ for the principals on
both sides of the dispute to be reminded that their fancy houses
and their success are built on a fragile foundation of sand.
</P>
<P>
   We know that NBA players spend much of their time up in the air,
but their brains cannot be so oxygen-depleted that they don't
realize how quickly the fans who support them by buying overpriced
tickets and team jerseys will turn on a labor force that includes
too many whining twentysomethings who are making more than $100
million. We know that NBA commissioner David Stern and the league's
owners believe they will always be able to sell flash over
substance to the American public, but the folks who ultimately foot
the bills for new pleasure palaces and $1,000 courtside seats have
only so many oxen that can be gored.
</P>
<P>
   While raising ticket prices (owners) and demanding
ever-increasing salaries (players), both sides have overlooked one
very salient fact: It ain't baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of the former national pastime finally had enough
with the shutdown of 1994-95 and cut off the sport at the knees, a
bitter reaction that is only now beginning to soften after a
magical summer of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   It took decades of abuse to erode baseball's popularity, because
for decades it was America's only real national game. It was a
shared experience that was lovingly passed down like a sack of
ballpark peanuts from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA success of the '80s and '90s is built on spandex,
3-point shots, fuzzy mascots and exploding scoreboards, the lack of
which will not be mourned in many corners.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming love the public holds for pro basketball is
like that of a one-night stand, no deeper than a wading pool. There
remains a hard-core audience of hoops fanatics whose devotion will
be unswayed by any labor nonsense and who will always come back to
the gym.
</P>
<P>
   The problem will be in keeping the
``we're-here-because-it's-hot'' fans, the ones who would plunk down
$1,000 to sit ringside at a cockfight if the whole experience was
supplemented by loud music, scantily clad dancing girls, a network
TV shill and all of the other little marketing gimmicks of which
the league is so proud. These are the people whom a protracted
labor dispute will send running to the door as if a fire alarm just
sounded, the ones who save their loudest cheers for the dunking
mascot or the fan who shoots to win a car at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The players are following ``union man'' Michael Jordan, who will
never be confused with Samuel Gompers, who was paid $34 million
last season by the Bulls and who is one of the main reasons why the
rank-and-file players are being squeezed on salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are following Stern, the charming lawyer and
marketing Nero who has fiddled at base problems in the game for
years while continuing to foster an atmosphere that would make
Caligula blush.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they stand at the brink, engaged in a staredown. I know of
no one who really cares.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short trip back to the dark ages.

   TOKYO _ Japan's Parliament approved landmark banking legislation
on Monday that will allow the government to nationalize failing
banks, and Japan's political parties announced that they had
reached a new accord to provide several hundred billion dollars in
new money to try to revive the banking system and set the country
on a path toward economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord, reached between Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic Party and most of the opposition forces, could lead to
the injection of huge amounts of public money _ more than $400
billion, or four times as much as is now available _ into the
nation's banks. The Liberal Democrats hope that the political
alliance holds long enough for them to win passage in the
Parliament for the new accord by Friday, when the current session
ends.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a way out of the financial crisis sent stocks
surging on Monday, with shares of the nation's banks jumping an
average of 8 percent. The Nikkei index of 225 shares rose 5.24
percent, to 13,555.01, in a big comeback after last week's sudden
plunge. U.S. markets also rose on optimism about a solution to
Japan's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like the wheels on both sides of a car,'' Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi said at a news conference, referring to the
two pieces of legislation. ``When both of them pass the Parliament,
it will mean that we can send out a clear and strong message to the
world that a global depression will absolutely not begin in
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The law enacted by Parliament on Monday allows the government to
deal with large, failing banks by nationalizing them, liquidating
them or transforming them into publicly owned ``bridge banks,''
which take over the good loans and good borrowers and try to
collect on the bad loans. It would establish a public institution
to buy the good assets to resell them later and to collect the bad
loans in a process also used by the American Resolution Trust
Corp., which helped clean up the savings and loan crisis in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The accord announced on Monday night by the political parties,
if enacted and carried out, would amount to a bold attempt to
revive lending by cash-strapped banks and thus bolster an economic
recovery. With Japan's economy in its deepest recession since World
War II, the recent wild gyrations in the stock market and the
recent sudden and sharp surge in the yen against the dollar,
politicians have become a bit jittery that the financial crisis
both here and abroad could worsen and that the economy could sink
even further.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton administration officials said they were
encouraged by the new legislation, but were still waiting for the
Japanese government to carry out the steps and deal forcefully with
its economic and financial problems. The United States has grown
increasingly impatient with Japan for failing to clean up its
banking system and revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were also skeptical, partly because Japan has
announced agreements in the past, only to have them collapse later.
One key criticism has been the worry that Japan's major banks will
not apply for an injection of taxpayers' money, particularly if it
means they will be punished through controls on management or
reductions in shareholder capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, the main opposition to the new accord, has
demanded that the government force the banks to take public money.
Politicians did not disclose details of the new accord, but after
the Democratic Party protested, the Liberal Democrats decided to
bolster the amount of the bailout.
</P>
<P>
   For many, Japan is at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japan is able to adjust, it can become a locomotive to pull
Asia out of its troubles,'' said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist
at Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific, at a conference on Monday in
Singapore. ``Otherwise, it could become a Titanic that pulls the
rest of Asia under.''
</P>
<P>
   The new accordis intended to provide banks with sorely needed
new capital. Though no amounts were specified, politicians say the
accord could provide between $435 billion and $520 billion, or
about 10 percent of annual economic output. The money would not
necessarily be spent all in one year. International banks could
receive taxpayers' money if they agree to absorb another failing
institution, if there is a severe credit contraction or if more
capital is needed for a merger.

NATO FORCES PAYING MILLIONS IN UNNECESSARY RENT FOR BASES  
(JT)

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ NATO forces in Bosnia and Croatia
are needlessly paying millions of dollars in rent that is winding
up in the coffers of the governing political parties, say financial
experts who have studied the two governments. And diplomats say
those parties are often the principal obstacles to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Dayton accord, which ended the war in Bosnia and
authorized NATO's presence, required Bosnia and Croatia to provide
buildings and land to NATO troops without charge.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, Britain, France, Germany and other
countries may be spending as much as $40 million a year in rent for
their bases in Bosnia and Croatia, a senior NATO financial officer
said. The exact figures could not be determined, because many of
the armies involved refused to disclose how much they pay. In
addition, NATO financial officers said their records were in
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officers, defending the payments, said the rent was paid to
private companies for use of their property. But while many of the
companies receiving the money portray themselves as privately
owned, they appear to be government-owned and controlled by
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with company and local government officials, as well
as financial experts working for Western governments in Bosnia and
Croatia, indicate that much of the money is in fact going to the
Bosnian and Croatian governments, which funnel it to political
parties. Foreign diplomats suggested that in Bosnia, the money
effectively buys good relations between NATO forces and local and
national leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three years after fighting ended, Bosnia continues to be
governed by ethnic-based parties that effectively dominate three
ministates. Croatia is governed by a nationalist party that
virtually controls Croat-held parts of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats say they blame those parties for blocking the
Western goal of a unified and stable country with effective
national government.
</P>
<P>
   On being told about the payments, the chief international
civilian official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, said they
undermined Western efforts. ``How can they pay money to these
people when we are supposed to be here promoting democracy?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Each foreign military force in Bosnia pays the costs of
maintaining its soldiers here, while NATO pays the costs of the
large headquarters that directs the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The British army says it will spend about $16.5 million this
year to rent its eight bases in Bosnia and Croatia. The U.S. Army
says it pays rent only for bases on private land. A spokesman said
the Army had spent ``several million dollars'' for rent during the
last three years, including about $1.5 million a year for a single
base in Croatia, but he could not detail all rents paid.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army insists that great efforts are made to ensure it
pays no rent to government-controlled companies. But at many places
where the United States has or had troops, it is not clear the Army
has always succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   A pattern emerged in interviews with local officials, and with
managers of companies whose property is being used by American
troops and other NATO forces. It was clear that payments were being
made to companies that managers admitted are government-owned.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Bosnian company that received the most rent
from the United States, according to Army records, was paid $1.4
million to allow soldiers to put a base at its coal processing
plant for nine months. The company director, Pasaga Muratovic, said
the company had always been wholly owned by the Bosnian government.
</P>
<P>
   Another coal mine operation used for an American camp was paid
about $744,000, according to the Army. But Sakib Dizdarevic, the
mine's director, said that it, too, was owned by the Bosnian
government, and that the payment was nearly three times what the
Army reported.
</P>
<P>
   For most of 1996, the Army base named Pat was located on
farmland controlled by the most radical Bosnian Serb political
party, whose founder, the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan
Karadzic, has been indicted on war-crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Army records show no rental payment for the camp, a spokesman
said. But the mayor of the nearest town, Sekovici, said his office
was paid more than $26,000 a month by the Army. The money is used
for Bosnian Serb government expenses, he said. Local farmers said
that although the land belonged to them, they received none of the
rent.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the British army in Bosnia is in a large,
unused sheet-metal factory near the Bosnian Serb-controlled town of
Banja Luka. The financial director of the factory, Milo
Milovanovic, said that to qualify for rent, company officials had
told British officers that the factory was privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an interview he conceded that the factory was
controlled by Bosnian Serb officials. All the directors of the
company, he said, are appointed by government officials.
Milovanovic said the money received for rent was turned over to the
government for what he described as taxes and insurance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added that although relations between British forces and
local authorities had been tense initially, matters improved after
the British agreed to pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came to this office to talk about using our
factory,'' Milovanovic said, ``the soldiers were pointing guns
everywhere. Now they are our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Sipovo, the deputy mayor, Mile Bosnjak, said
earlier this year that all the rent paid by British forces for an
abandoned textile factory was transferred directly from the
factory's bank account to the Bosnian Serb government.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and France also pay rent. A spokesman for the French
army refused to provide details, while the German army's records
showed it paid $2.5 million last year to rent warehouses from a
Bosnian government company in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Rent money from government-controlled businesses goes to the
political party in control in that area, said foreign financial
experts studying the Bosnian economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every important manager of these companies is appointed by the
political parties,'' said Didier Fau, chief of the economic
department at Westendorp's office. ``They do what they are told.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no accounting, no transparency in the companies or
the government. There is just control by the parties,'' Fau added.

6 KILLED BY TRAIN WHILE SLEEPING ON TRACKS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Six people believed to be illegal immigrants from
Mexico were hit and killed early Monday by a freight train as they
slept on a desolate stretch of tracks in southern Texas. Officials
said they believed the immigrants may have been victims of a
superstition that the rails would keep them safe from snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth that if you sleep between the rails that snakes
will not get you,'' said Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific.
``You go down the railroad tracks, you'll see snakes cut in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the driver of the train blew the whistle repeatedly
when he noticed the people on the tracks. Although a couple of the
victims raised their heads, no one got off the tracks. Davis said
he was uncertain how far the train was from the victims when the
driver saw them. But, he added, it would have taken a mile to stop
the 105-car train, which was traveling between 45 and 49 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The vast ranchlands of South Texas that stretch between the Rio
Grande and San Antonio are among the most remote in the state, mile
after mile of mesquite, prickly pear, citrus farms and grazing
lands that are a prime avenue for illegal immigrants trying to make
their way from the Mexican border to San Antonio or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While illegal immigrants have been killed while sleeping on
railroad tracks before, Fred Borrego, patrol agent in charge of the
U.S. Border Patrol in Kingsville, said never had so many been
killed in one accident. Between 2,000 and 3,000 illegal immigrants
pass through his 2,600-square-mile patrol area each month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent victims, who were badly mutilated, have not been
identified. They were taken to Corpus Christi where authorities
will try to use fingerprints to determine their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego had another possible explanation for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another theory I've been told is that in Mexico the trains
don't run at night,'' Borrego said. ``They say they sleep up there
because they feel a lot safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems implausible that people could sleep with the
noise of a train running toward them, Davis said, ``a train
operating when you're in front of it is very, very quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The engine noise is primarily to the side, he said, and there is
very little friction on the rail itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know its hard to believe,'' Borrego said. ``I've experienced
this myself. If it's coming toward you it's as quiet as a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in the Kenedy County sheriff's office speculated
that the hard traveling conditions confronted by the immigrants
could also have played a role. The terrain in the area is very
rugged, with most of it being brush covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think, `I'd never fall asleep there' or `Why wouldn't they
wake up?''' said Hopy Alines, a secretary in the sheriff's office.
``But it just doesn't happen. These people travel three, four and
five days without eating, without sleeping. They're just completely
exhausted and they don't wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally the illegal immigrants traveling through the county go
unnoticed aside from the trail of odds and ends they leave behind,
Ms. Alise said. ``You'll see empty bottles, sometimes bags of
clothes,'' she said. ``We get a lot of calls where they break in
and all they ever take is food and water.'' It is generally when
people get sick or have problems that officials hear stories like
the ones about people sleeping on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Davis estimated that four to six people a year are injured or
killed while sleeping on railroad tracks. In fact, he said, there
have been cases where people sleeping on tracks have been run over
and survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, or fortunately, they're intoxicated,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The train, which was carrying a variety of freight like scrap
paper and metal automobile parts, was traveling from Houston to
Brownsville, Texas, when the accident occurred about 3:15 a.m. near
the tiny town of Norias, which is 60 miles north of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Texas there were 38 fatalities and 80 injuries
involving what railroad officials call ``trespass accidents,''
Davis said, cases where people were struck on or near tracks or
trying to get on a railroad car.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego said the last time he could remember a large group of
illegal immigrants being killed on train tracks was in 1983 or 1984
when 14 people were killed trying to cross a railroad trestle.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials along with Union Pacific officials
caution illegal immigrants about sleeping on railroad tracks as
part of general information they provide on the dangers of crossing
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they don't get the word,'' Borrego said. ``The
conditions out here are rigid. You've got cactus, mesquite. It's no
fun walking through the territory. They run out of water, they get
bit by snakes.''

   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ Matthew Shepard, the gay college student
who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days
after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been
left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the
outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning
nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes
legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such
laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have
resisted them.
</P>
<P>
   From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to
honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman
at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of
anti-gay violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a
passerby. Two men and two women have been charged in the case. The
men were charged with attempted murder and are expected to face
first-degree murder charges that could bring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence,''
said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force in Washington. ``People have likened it to a
scarecrow. But it sounded more like a crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear _ that
Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to
pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives
generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights
over another.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia
have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are
committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national
origin, and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual
orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including
Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton responded to news of Shepard's death by
urging Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act,
which would make federal offenses of crimes based on sex,
disability and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has been one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three
hate crimes bills since 1994, most recently in February. But
Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to
lawmakers to reconsider their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate
legislation that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for
their consideration in January,'' Geringer said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor met Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain
student's father, and said that the elder Shepard did not want his
son's death to become ``a media circus'' and that ``we should not
use Matt to further an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into
just passing all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of
any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in
the process to race to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would
respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper,
Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped the death would
have an impact on legislators around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper
understanding of hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights
group that has 250,000 members. ``Matthew's death may lead to an
awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need
for this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States
because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern
Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against
minorities. According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor
in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use
Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom
of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of
violent crime and everything to do with silencing political
opposition,'' said Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family
Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to defending
``faith, family and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would criminalize pro-family beliefs,'' Schwalm said.
``This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the
political message of homosexual activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in
a series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne,
``overcame'' homosexuality through religious conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is
contrary to Biblical norms,'' said Paulk, who describes himself as
a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian
group in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Because we are standing up and
opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon as
advocating violence against homosexuals, when we categorically
reject violence against homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of
television advertisements that preach the ``healing'' of
homosexuality through religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that
these advertisements help create a hostile climate for homosexuals,
a climate that can lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states have not
impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice
professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton
College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send a
clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before
they escalate,'' he said. Referring to murders of homosexuals, he
added: ``These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if
they are not punished the first time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered
higher rates of violent crime than the population at large. He also
said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals are
male, aged 22 or younger. The two men charged in the killing of
Shephard are both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney,
22.
</P>
<P>
   ``With other crimes, violence is a means to an end. With hate
crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin said.
Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, as
well as a massive blow to the back of his skull.

   ``Because their social stature in society, gays are often viewed
as appropriate targets,'' Levin added. Citing the need for hate
crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said:
``The discourse in society leaves many of these people to believe
that what they are doing is socially acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's
death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of
nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This University of Wyoming student was beaten and left to die,
tied to a fence like an animal because he was honest and open about
being gay,'' Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, said Monday,
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be
dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals.
His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly hear
the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic equal
treatment,'' Ms. Dorhn said.

   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ Matthew Shepard, the gay college student
who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days
after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been
left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the
outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning
nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes
legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such
laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have
resisted them.
</P>
<P>
   From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to
honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman
at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of
anti-gay violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a
passerby. Russell Anderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, were
charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree
murder charges that could bring the death penalty. Their
girlfriends, Chastity Pasley, 21, and Kristen Price, 18, were
charged as accessories.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of
national Gay Awareness Week. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag
that symbolizes the gay rights movement was lowered to half-staff
in the Castro district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence,''
said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force in Washington. ``People have likened it to a
scarecrow. But it sounded more like a crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Laramie, Wyo., where the beating took place, have said
they believed robbery was the primary motive for the attack against
Shepard, which occurred outside a bar in the town of 27,000. But
investigators also said Shepard's sexuality may have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by
saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriends said Shepard
had embarassed one of the men by making a pass at him.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied to the
fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a street
corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy
Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the
brawl; McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same
hospital where Shepard died.
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear _ that
Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to
pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives
generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights
over another.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia
have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are
committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national
origin, and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual
orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including
Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton responded to news of Shepard's death by
urging Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act,
which would make federal offenses of crimes based on sex,
disability and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has been one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three
hate crimes bills since 1994, most recently in February. But
Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to
lawmakers to reconsider their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate
legislation that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for
their consideration in January,'' Geringer said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor met Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain
student's father, and said that the elder Shepard did not want his
son's death to become ``a media circus'' and that ``we should not
use Matt to further an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into
just passing all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of
any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in
the process to race to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would
respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper,
Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped the death would
have an impact on legislators around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper
understanding of hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights
group that has 250,000 members. ``Matthew's death may lead to an
awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need
for this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States
because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern
Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against
minorities. According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor
in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use
Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom
of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of
violent crime and everything to do with silencing political
opposition,'' said Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family
Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to defending
``faith, family and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would criminalize pro-family beliefs,'' Schwalm said.
``This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the
political message of homosexual activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in
a series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne,
``overcame'' homosexuality through religious conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is
contrary to Biblical norms,'' said Paulk, who describes himself as
a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian
group in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Because we are standing up and
opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon as
advocating violence against homosexuals, when we categorically
reject violence against homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of
television advertisements that preach the ``healing'' of
homosexuality through religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that
these advertisements help create a hostile climate for homosexuals,
a climate that can lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states have not
impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice
professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton
College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send a
clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before
they escalate,'' he said. Referring to murders of homosexuals, he
added: ``These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if
they are not punished the first time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered
higher rates of violent crime than the population at large. He also
said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals are
male, aged 22 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``With other crimes, violence is a means to an end. With hate
crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin said.
Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, as
well as a massive blow to the back of his skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because their social stature in society, gays are often viewed
as appropriate targets,'' Levin added. Citing the need for hate
crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said:
``The discourse in society leaves many of these people to believe
that what they are doing is socially acceptable.''
</P>

   While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's

REPUBLICANS SAY BUDGET DEAL IS NEAR

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republican leaders said on Monday
night that they were close to an agreement with the White House on
the federal budget, but administration officials were more cautious
and both sides agreed to postpone the Monday midnight deadline to
midnight Wednesday to work out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have most items closed tonight,'' Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., the majority leader, said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said he expected to wrap up negotiations
with the White House late Monday night, but added, ``We've reached
many tentative possible agreements, none of which count until we
finish up the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Gingrich both predicted that the House and Senate would
vote by Wednesday to approve the final package reached with the
White House on the $1.7 trillion budget, of which about $500
billion has been in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials cautioned that major issues,
including President Clinton's education initiatives, remained on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our two key priorities have not been resolved,'' said Linda
Ricci, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget. ``It
would be premature to predict any immediate resolution until those
are addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the stakes by pushing Congress publicly to pass
the education initiatives. One would provide $1.1 billion as a
downpayment on 100,000 teachers, the other would leverage billions
of dollars worth of bonds to upgrade scool buildings throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and congressional leaders agreed to provide
money for the teachers, but were debating whether it could be used
only for hiring new teachers, as the administration wanted, or
whether local school districts would have some leeway over the
spending, as Republicans proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Other big issues remain unresolved. These include a major battle
between Democrats and Republicans over how to conduct the census,
which Gingrich has suggested be postponed for six months, and the
conditions under which Republicans would finance the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's extension was the third time that Congress and
the White House pushed back their deadline since the fiscal year
began on Oct. 1. But there is still little sense of what the final
package will look like and what extraneous issues it might contain.
Possibilities include a tiny tax break that the House passed on
Monday. The tax break, in the form of extensions of various
business tax credits, is so small _ $9.2 billion over 10 years _
that its Republican backers say it will cost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Other items under discussion for the final package ranged from
the global, like money for a Star Wars missile defense system, to
the local, like extending the duck-hunting season in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is angling for at least a $7.5 billion increase in
emergency military spending. Arguing that it would be
``irresponsible'' not to beef up the Pentagon, Gingrich said he
wanted a dollar-for-dollar match of the Clinton Administration's
request for domestic emergency measures.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, is seeking $1 billion as a downpayment for a Star Wars
missile defense system. Livingston is also seeking language to
block a plan for the national allocation of human organs for
transplant, prefering to keep such allocations under local control.
</P>
<P>
   Lott wants to extend the duck-hunting season in his home state
and five others. Lott, himself a hunter, is concerned that because
ducks tend not to fly as far south as Mississippi during the
migratory season, it was only fair to extend the season an extra 11
days to give Southern duck hunters more of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, is insisting that a seven-mile road and utility lines be
constructed through the Izembeck National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens says that the remote community of King Cove needs a land
link to allow for emergency medical vehicles. Opponents say this
construction would violate pristine wilderness and is a thinly
disguised attempt to promote business development and help link
North America's largest salmon cannery in King Cove with one of
Alaska's premier airstrips at Cold Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some proposals had the support of both parties, like an $86
million request by several Senators to refinance a loan for the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was irked that the Administration was still seeking
several small-sum items in the billion-dollar final package, and
that these demands were made in the top-level meetings instead of
being resolved at the staff level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about a multi-billion-dollar budget, as
much as a third of the full budget,'' he said, ``for us now to be
arguing over the smallest amount of funds for various and sundry
programs is not a good use of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricci of the Office of Management and Budget said that
including such items was a normal part of the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats were not alone in the small-sum game. Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., who is locked in a tight re-election campaign, is
seeking $6 million toward a reconstructive surgery program for
women with breast cancer.

 &HT;    Can Cleveland afford not to start Justice, Alomar?
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the situation is so hopeless that St. Jude, the
patron saint of lost causes, laughs in your face, baseball players
turn to the comfort of mumbling bromides and cliches. In the
current case of Cleveland vs. New York, 1998, the Indians are
compiling The Neophyte's Glossary of Cliches &AMP; Bromides.
</P>
<P>
   If the Tribe holds a team meeting before Game 6 of the American
League Championship Series in Yankee Stadium tonight, there will be
25 guys lined up against the wall, their backs against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians didn't spend their off day Monday in the vicinity of
the Empire State Building looking for The Miracle on 34th Street.
If they did, they could have read the graffiti on the wall. They
are in trouble. Deep trouble. Deep Six trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a shocking two games to one lead in the
best-of-seven ALCS, the Tribe lost two straight at home in Jacobs
Field _ The Wake at the Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Now they trail three games to two and must win two straight to
advance to the World Series. The ball is in the palm of righty
Charles Nagy tonight, the Tribe's hottest pitcher, against David
Cone.
</P>
<P>
   If they survive, 23-year-old Bartolo ``Pancho'' Colon gets the
baseball Wednesday in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the reality, it's going to be difficult,''
Tribe first baseman/designated hitter Jim Thome said. ``But you
know what? We're going to be very confident. And if it works out,
it works out. If it don't, it don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can argue with that . . . except the English.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the misery is the status of catcher Sandy Alomar Jr.
and left fielder/DH David Justice. Neither started Game 5 and while
both say they'll play tonight, the question is, ``How well?''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove had Justice in the lineup Sunday, but
Justice asked out, saying his forearm was too sore. Justice was hit
on the arm with a pitch Saturday. He did pinch-hit Sunday and
grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar is fighting a bad back. Knowing this, the Yankees are
running full-bore on the basepaths. And Alomar is 1 for 13 (.077)
in the five games he has played.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, knowing Alomar's importance, shortstop Omar
Vizquel said, ``I hope Sandy takes some drugs and plays.'' Alomar's
replacement, Einor Diaz, a late call-up from Triple-A Buffalo,
played only 17 games for the Tribe this season.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't likely rookie first baseman/DH Richie Sexson will
emerge from the visitor's dugout tonight, despite a sensational run
after a late-season call-up from Buffalo. Since Since Sept. 19,
Sexson is 0 for 24 with 13 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Joey Cora, obtained last this season in a trade
with Seattle for David Bell because Cora is an alleged Yankee
Killer, has been benched in favor of another guy who spent most of
the season at Buffalo, Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, who could be ALCS MVP if the Tribe comes back to win _
otherwise hand the trophy right now to zany Yankee left-hander
David Wells _ is 10 for 20 in the five games, although he has not
driven in a run and scored only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our pitching match-ups,'' Vizquel said. Both Nagy and
Colon won games against Boston in the Division Series and they won
the two games the Tribe has won against the Yankees. ``We're using
our two best pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome sounded like a guy being handed a blindfold, a cigarette
and asked if he had any last words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go in there confident,'' he said. ``We ain't
hanging our heads. We're not going to lay down and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's check. Nope. Nobody named Daniel on this team. So the
Indians have to walk into the Yankees' lion's den on their own. And
if Tribe pitchers walk 11 and hit two batters, the way they did in
Game 5 Sunday, even Daniel can't help.

 &HT;    Despite top ranking, OSU's flaws exposed against Illinois
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ It's not easy to find flaws with No. 1-ranked
Ohio State, but last Saturday vs. Illinois one was readily apparent
in the Buckeyes short-yardage running game.
</P>
<P>
   OSU was stopped twice on third and one by an inferior Illinois
team, which fell, 41-0, to the Buckeyes. The first stalemate came
in the first quarter when they were on the Illini's 2-yard line
poised to score. It took them five plays, including a
fourth-and-short effort, to get the ball into the end zone. And
that score came not on a run but on a 1-yard pass to tight end John
Lumpkin of Trotwood.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the second half, the Buckeyes again were foiled in a
short yardage situation, failing to convert on second-and-1 and
then third-and-1 inside Illinois territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We end up punting the ball,'' OSU coach John Cooper said. ``To
me, that was the most discouraging thing that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper also expressed displeasure that five-play goal line
effort, when his offense failed to gain two or fewer yards on four
straight attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Michael Wiley, who carried the ball three of those four
times, shares the blame for the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of a couple of bad runs by the tailback,
which is me, and a couple of missed blocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Rob Murphy, too, admitted there were a couple
of ``breakdowns'' on the line but said, ``We scored, so I don't
understand why everyone's complaining about this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're No. 1,'' he said. ``We wracked up 500 yards of offense.
But I turn on the radio this morning and they're saying we don't
have a rushing game, blah, blah, blah.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's some nit-picking going on as the top-ranked
Buckeyes (5-0, 2-0 Big Ten) prepare to face another unranked
opponent this week when Minnesota (3-2, 0-2 Big Ten) visits Ohio
Stadium on Saturday. But Cooper and several players agree that the
Buckeyes short-yardage rushing game is a legitimate concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really shocked and kind of upset it took us that long,
third and short, then third and goal (to score),'' wide receive Dee
Miller of Springfield said. ``We should be able to punch it in
anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Said quarterback Joe Germaine: ``It's definitely something we
need to improve on. In big games, we need to be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be the Buckeyes lack of an experienced,
true fullback. Starter Matt Keller was stopped on first and goal,
although Cooper said he thought the fullback's upper body got into
the end zone for the score. The coach didn't point the finger at
the offensive line, a frequent target of criticism last year,
saying it continues to progress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murphy takes it as a personal affront when the running
game is criticized and he vows to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse,'' Murphy said. ``I'm sure there's going to
be a lot of time this week devoted to short yardage and goal line
(plays).''

 &HT;    After QB shakeup in 1997, O'Donnell settles in
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Jeff Blake gave way to Boomer Esiason, who gave way
to Neil O'Donnell. When it comes to starting quarterbacks, Bengals
management makes no apologies for the upheaval of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   All it knows is that O'Donnell is the No. 1 passer in the AFC
with a 103.2 rating, thanks to his performance in the Bengals'
25-20 victory over Pittsburgh on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell completed 20 of 26 passes for 298 yards and three
touchdowns _ two to Darnay Scott and the 25-yard, game-winner to
Carl Pickens that authored what team president Mike Brown called
``a storybook ending.''
</P>
<P>
   With no timeouts remaining for Cincinnati, O'Donnell launched a
50-yard desperation pass to Pickens on fourth and 12 from the
Bengals' 15-yard line with 48 seconds to go, which Pickens caught.
</P>
<P>
   After two Corey Dillon runs netted a first down at the Steelers'
25, O'Donnell approached the line of scrimmage and yelled ``Clock
Clock'' _ a play in which he has the option to spike the ball to
stop the clock or throw a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to throw it to Darnay (on the right side),'' head
coach Bruce Coslet said. ``But (cornerback) Carnell Lake jumped in
front of the slant pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl came off the line, watched Neil look the other way and
geared it down. When Neil looked back at Carl, he took back off. He
laid it up and they made a play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught us off-guard,'' Steelers linebacker Levon Kirkland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coslet said the team has two variations of the spike-the-ball
play. On the first, the quarterback must fling the ball down. On
the second, he has the choice of either downing the ball or
throwing downfield if the defense is lax because it's expecting the
spike. That's exactly what happened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yell a certain word and a lot of people think it's something
else,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Coslet called O'Donnell's effort another step on the learning
curve for the quarterback who joined the team July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil's in a real learning process and so are the coaches with
him,'' Coslet said. ``We're learning what he does best and what he
likes to do in certain situations. He's doing a real good job. He's
way farther along than he was two, three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's learning his receivers. He's figured out that he
cannot overthrow Darnay, and if he throws it up high to Carl,
chances are we're going to come down with a play. He's established
himself now. He knows what's going on good enough to make us
function. He's just got to keep working on little details.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet said O'Donnell ``came in here with a no-nonsense work
ethic from day one'' and earned his teammates respect _ just as
Esiason did when he replaced Blake after a 3-8 start and engineered
a 4-1 finish that highlighted a 7-9 record in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said O'Donnell and the retired Esiason ``are both very
poised players'' with radically different personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a much quieter, more subdued and introspective
personality,'' Brown said about O'Donnell. ``Boomer is outgoing and
brash. They both are attractive people, just different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer walks in and is ready to assume command immediately and
lets everyone sort of know that's how he thinks. That doesn't mean
the way Neil goes about things is less than right. He's just
quieter. When players see him play well, they will react to that.''

 &HT;    Running game key to Falcons win, Reeves says
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were a lot of good things from the Atlanta
Falcons' 34-20 victory Sunday night against the New York Giants,
but coach Dan Reeves on Monday praised the success of the running
game.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson, a fifth-year player from Utah taken as the 24th
running back in the 1994 draft, rushed 29 times for 110 yards to
become the third back in Falcons history to rush for more than 100
yards three games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Riggs did it twice (once doing it four games in a row),
and William Andrews did it once.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't have a time of possession unless you can run the
ball,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is second in the NFL in average rushing yards per game
(102.4), trailing only Denver's Terrell Davis (144.2). The Falcons
also are second in the NFL in average time of possession at 33:20.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big help to the Falcons' defense. ``When we came here
(before last season) . . . we felt one of the biggest things we
could do to help our defense was be a ball-control team,'' Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear the Falcons had any serious injuries Sunday
night. Reeves knocked on wood, literally, when he said that reserve
CB Randy Fuller's strained hamstring was the greatest concern, and
that he was questionable for practice Wednesday. . . . The bursa
sac in QB Chris Chandler's left _ non-throwing _ elbow was swollen
after hitting the turf several times. It was drained after the
game. . . . Reeves also said reserve CB Michael Booker, who hasn't
played since straining a thigh muscle in the Wednesday practice
after the 49ers game, probably will be able to play Sunday against
the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Upon review
</P>
<P>
   When Giants WR David Patten scored on a 39-yard post pattern 33
seconds before halftime, the blame was split between rookie CB
Elijah Williams, who was beaten on the play, and assistant head
coach/defensive coordinator Rich Brooks. The play pulled the Giants
to within 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was playing in the dime because of Booker's
absence, appeared to give up on Patten as soon as the WR got a
couple steps on him, perhaps thinking dime safety Devin Bush was
going to help deep. But the defensive call was for Bush to
``bracket'' the slot receiver on the left side, not the outside
receiver, Patten.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (defensive) call is on me,'' Brooks said. ``We should
have bracketed the outside receiver. The disappointing thing is
that he just kind of stopped. (Williams) was supposed to trail him
all the way regardless of what the call was. It was a rookie
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Players of the game were Anderson and Chandler (14-of-27, 266
yards, two TDs, no interceptions, one rushing TD) on offense,
rookie WR Jammi German on special teams (two tackles on kickoff
returns, an assist on a punt return), and DE Lester Archambeau
(five tackles, 1.5 sacks) and CB Ronnie Bradford (12 tackles) on
defense. . . . LB Keith Brooking, the team's first-round draft
choice, forced the first fumble of his career when he stripped New
York TE Howard Cross after a 5-yard pass. He also had a tackle on
special teams, and one at LB. ``My (strained thigh muscle) still
isn't 100 percent, so I can't burst or plant like I want to,''
Brooking said. ``I over-pursued, and when I knew I couldn't make
the tackle I reached back. That felt good.'' . . . Billy Joe
Tolliver will start for the Saints on Sunday, replacing Danny
Wuerffel. Tolliver played with the Falcons on two occasions, from
1991-93 and '96-97.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping
</P>
<P>
   P Dan Stryzinski, who signed a three-year, $1.98 million
contract in the offseason, remains ranked last in the NFL with a
37.7-yard average after averaging 34.3 yards against the Giants.
But New York returned just one of his punts, for 6 yards, and just
eight of Stryzinski's 30 kicks have been returned this season.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said part of the reason Stryzinski's average has slipped
is because he kicked several pooch punts in opponents territory.
``Dan again punted the ball well at times, but we aren't as
consistent as we need to be,'' Reeves said. ``He's just in a slump,
like a hitter, and he's got to work himself out of it.''

 &HT;    Falcons learn about life in the limelight
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons got a rare off day on Monday, a
reward of sorts for their 34-20 road victory on Sunday night
against the New York Giants and the franchise's third 4-1 start in
its 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Players normally run, lift and watch film on Monday, but only
about 15 came to the Suwanee, Ga. headquarters, most for injury
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But while players were plodding along, and not thinking much
about Sunday's home game against New Orleans (3-2), coach Dan
Reeves, the media relations staff and ticket office were busy.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves taped an interview with EPSN's Chris Myers for an ``Up
Close'' special. CNN/SI was in Suwanee. Terry Bradshaw of Fox
called to say he's stopping by on Friday, and reporters from ESPN
and USA Today plan to visit today.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket manager Jack Ragsdale said the Falcons sold approximately
3,000 tickets on Monday for upcoming games, including about 2,000
for the Saints game. A crowd of 60,000 _ bigger than any in two
years _ appears possible.
</P>
<P>
   Life certainly is a whole lot better than this time last year,
when the Falcons were 0-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a night and day difference,'' center Robbie Tobeck
said. ``It was miserable (last year). It feels good that we're
getting some attention around here. That's something we haven't had
_ ever. Even a couple years back, when we went to the playoffs
(with a 9-7 record in 1995), everybody thought we were a
pretender.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory against the Giants was the 10th for Atlanta in 13
games, leaving the Falcons tied with the 49ers for first place in
the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday's game against the Saints, whom the Falcons have
beaten six straight times, offers Atlanta a chance to beat a team
with a winning record for the first time since a 20-17 upset of
Carolina in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other than back-to-back games on Nov. 8 and 15 against a pair of
4-1 teams, the 49ers and Patriots, future opponents are 18-28.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta put forth a strong performance against New York, scoring
on four of its first five possessions in the second half. Jamal
Anderson became the third back in Falcons history to rush for more
than 100 yards three games in a row, and Chris Chandler threw for
two touchdowns and ran for another. An offensive line that allowed
16 sacks the first three games gave up two for the second game in a
row. Nevertheless, Reeves is cautious. He knows the Falcons'
victories have come against teams with a combined record of 3-19.
After 4-1 starts in 1986 and '95, Atlanta finished the seasons
3-7-1 and 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have never started a season 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we . . . get big heads or whatever, or get overconfident .
. . we'll be 4-2,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen to anybody. If you get some people hurt, all of
a sudden you can be real mediocre real quickly. We've got to be
fortunate to be healthy, and . . . keep things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith said this team has that perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all feel more confident,'' he said. ``I talked to
(Giants defensive end Michael) Strahan, and he said, `Man, those
guys came at me.' He said he was really surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobeck didn't sound surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to win, or saying, `We think we can win,'''
he said, ``we expect to win, and that goes a long ways.''

 &HT;    Falcons notes: Coaches find loyalty sometimes backfires
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Loyalty is a wonderful quality to possess as a head
coach and, in fact, might be the attribute players most desire in a
sideline boss. That said, after the events of this weekend, Bill
Parcells and Marty Schottenheimer may want to review their policies
that starters do not lose their jobs because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unofficial rule, rooted in loyalty. In most cases, it
works. In the case of quarterbacks, however, it often backfires.
There comes a time when loyalty turns to blind trust, and that time
came Sunday for the Jets and Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Vinny Testaverde's 2-0 record as a starter, Parcells
went back to Glenn Foley. Give ``The Tuna'' high marks for loyalty
and a failing grade for not acknowledging that Testaverde is one of
the great streak shooters in recent memory. You ride him while he's
hot and, when he inevitably goes frigid, you make a switch.
</P>
<P>
   The irony now is that Parcells spent 25 minutes Monday morning
discussing with his assistants the possibility of trading for
Carolina's Kerry Collins. Such a move probably would mean cutting
Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer should have learned his lesson in last year's AFC
semifinal defeat to Denver. In his biggest game of the year, he
went with Elvis Grbac, who was returning from injury. Chiefs
veterans who recall how Grbac squandered away precious time in the
final two minutes of that game how their excellent season ended on
a desperation pass for Lake Dawson into double coverage still feel
Rich Gannon would have been the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Schottenheimer again chose Grbac over Gannon. No
matter who played, it might not have been enough to beat the
Patriots. But the majority of players realize the quarterback
position is different from any other. Most guys admire coaches who
stick to their rules, who remain consistent.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that when it comes to the hot quarterback, rules
are made to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   Hat trick
</P>
<P>
   The trio of former University of Georgia tailbacks starting in
the league _ Terrell Davis (Denver), Garrison Hearst (San
Francisco) and Robert Edwards (New England) _ all reached the end
zone. They combined for 383 rushing yards and two scores on 75
carries and added five catches for 98 yards and two touchdowns.
Davis has 865 rushing yards and is on pace for a 2,307-yard
performance. In Mark McGwire-type fashion, that would smash the
record of 2,105 yards established by Eric Dickerson in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina bluer
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed things couldn't get any worse for the
Panthers, starting tailback Fred Lane missed the Saturday charter
to Dallas and coach Dom Capers held him out of the loss to the
Cowboys. Although he should have known better, Lane was victimized
by an ambiguous itinerary handed out to players. Still, no one else
missed a flight that was moved up a few days earlier from 3 p.m. to
2:30 p.m. Lane arrived at the Charlotte airport at 2:25 and, with
teammates chanting ``Freddie! Freddie!'' chased the plane down the
tarmac. Capers instructed the pilot not to halt the takeoff
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was working against Pittsburgh cornerbacks like Rod
Woodson and Willie Williams, Cincinnati wide receiver Carl Pickens
annually tormented the Steelers secondary. So it shouldn't have
been a shock when he torched suspect cornerback DeWayne Washington
for 13 catches, 204 yards and the game-winning score. A bigger
shock was coordinator Jim Haslett and secondary coach Tim Lewis,
both highly regarded coaches, leaving Washington man-to-man with
Pickens on fourth-and-12 with a minute to play. The result was a
50-yard reception.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Doleman left Suwanee after the 1995 season, there
were a lot of people in Falcons management convinced he was
finished. But at age 36, the 14-year pro proved again Sunday that
sacking the quarterback is as much science as skill. Doleman netted
four sacks in the 49ers' shutout at New Orleans, three of them
coming against star tackle William Roaf, to move into fifth place
all-time. Since he left, Doleman has 30 1/2 sacks in 37 games. Over
the same period, Chuck Smith, the Falcons leader, has 21 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   Oakland punter Leo Araguz, who earns $15,294.12 per game, should
get overtime pay for Sunday's effort. In one of the least aesthetic
games in recent history, Araguz punted a league-record 16 times
against San Diego. He and Chargers counterpart Darren Bennett
combined for 27 punts, 1,231 yards and seven kicks inside the
20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . .
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati strong safety Sam Shade, a starter in '97 who is
splitting time this season with free agent acquisition Myron Bell,
relinquished the No. 1 job for Sunday's game but still came up big
against the Steelers. The former Alabama standout, who will attract
attention in the '99 free agent market if the Bengals can't sign
him to a contract extension, had three of his seven tackles in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend worsts
</P>
<P>
   Almost as bad as Pittsburgh's gaffe was the collapse by the San
Diego secondary that allowed Oakland backup Wade Wilson to throw a
68-yard touchdown pass to James Jett in the Raiders' 7-6 victory. .
. . After rushing for 173 yards in his debut as a starter for
Baltimore, tailback Priest Holmes was held to 29 yards on 14
carries by Tennessee. . . . Ryan Leaf continues to struggle in San
Diego and likely will be replaced this week by Craig Whelihan.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   When he was dumped for a 5-yard loss by Seattle linebacker Chad
Brown late in the second quarter, John Elway became the first
quarterback to be sacked 500 times. Proving that mobility isn't
everything, however, Dan Marino had been sacked only 243 times in
16 seasons going into Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Wilson likely gets the start this week in place of
Donald Hollas as Jeff George (groin) remains out of the Oakland
lineup. . . . Cardinals rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth, who
had four sacks the previous two games, didn't even have a ``hurry''
against Chicago.

<P>
   ROME _ Young American men entering the priesthood today are far
more conservative and tradition-bound than many of their elders and
most American Roman Catholics, according to bishops, priests and
church surveys.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp swing of the pendulum, seminarians are rejecting the
liberalism and rebellion that swept the Catholic Church after
Vatican II and American society in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation was reacting against the tight, ritualized
church of the '50s,'' said Monsignor Timothy Dolan, the 48-year-old
rector of the Pontifical North American College of Rome, a seminary
for Americans preparing for the priesthood. ``These kids are
reacting against the '60s and '70s, the psychedelic vestments, the
Coke and pretzels at Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, who was himself a seminarian at the college in the
mid-'70s, added: ``Now the bias is only in favor of tradition and
authority. When I was taught, the bias was against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift back to orthodoxy is welcomed by many church leaders
after decades of confusion and conflict. Others worry that if the
trend continues, it could create a rift between a more rigid,
conformist clergy and the majority of American Catholics, who
routinely ignore Rome's teachings on church attendance, sex, birth
control and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The North American College, sometimes described as a West Point
for priests, is in some ways at the vanguard of this
counterrevolution. At the solemn stone seminary overlooking the
Vatican, 171 students are enrolled this year, more than at any time
in the past quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   The surge is not a reflection of a sudden rise in vocations in
the United States. While the plunge in seminary enrollments, from
37,383 in 1967 to 5,527 in 1997, has leveled off, according to the
Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown
University, there has been no rise in enrollments in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the seminary's record numbers signal a renewed respect
for the ancient rituals and rich traditions of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   And at the seminary in Rome, as in seminaries throughout the
United States, a generation gap can be detected in the most basic
course work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Cameron, 40, teaches seminarians to begin their
homilies with a homespun personal anecdote _ involving a shopping
mall visit or a childhood toy _ that will entice easily distracted
parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   When Stephen Hero, 28, stood up in a recent workshop, he
delivered a practice homily closer to his own heart. ``On Oct. 16,
1978, a new pope, John Paul II, was elected,'' he began.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron sighed. On leave from St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers,
N.Y., to teach a two-week course in Rome, he is a Franciscan who
also studied screenwriting at the University of California at Los
Angeles. He was too tactful to criticize his student's homily
directly, but later he explained to a reporter that the pope might
be too remote a reference for many American churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students today are zealous _ they want to be promoters of the
faith,'' he said. ``But they don't always know how best to
communicate with the laity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hero, a third-year seminarian from Toronto, is of a
different generation, one that is mainly worried that Sunday Masses
in many parishes are being diluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the church should be too mundane,'' he said
quietly. ``It's OK to make the liturgy accessible, but there is a
danger of making it so ordinary that people lose the transcendent
experience of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56 members of the 1998 freshman class, known at the seminary
as the New Men, make up the largest such group in 29 years, and
they show the same kind of fervor. Selected by their bishops to
train in Rome, they seek to bring a restored church back to a
rather lax American laity. They speak of the deep mystery of the
church, the awe they feel in experiencing 2,000 years of tradition,
the chills they get in St. Peter's.
</P>
<P>
   Their heroes are John Paul II and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,
head of the Vatican's powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith. Ratzinger is a contentious figure to many American
Catholics, who view him as the guardian of strict orthodoxy and the
leader of the Vatican's clampdown on dissent. Even some seminary
professors take his rock-hard teachings with a grain of salt. Among
seminarians he is revered.
</P>
<P>
   Tad Oxley, 22, a first-year seminarian from Toledo, Ohio, took
Ratzinger's theological treatise ``Salt of the Earth'' to a beach
outing. ``He is a brilliant theologian and also a great pastor,''
Oxley said. ``Someone has to be in a position of authority and keep
a watch on what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   David Espinal, 22, from New York, agreed. ``We really believe
that he was chosen for his position by the Holy Spirit to explain
Christ's teachings,'' Espinal said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago seminarians challenged everything, from the way
theology was taught to being required to study Latin. They even
questioned priestly celibacy. A 1994 report prepared for the
National Federation of Priests' Councils found that although in
1970 a total of 85 percent of diocesan priests under 35 said
celibacy should be optional, by 1993 only 38 percent agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley said he and his classmates were appalled when a fellow
seminarian was accosted at a party by a Catholic lay activist who
told him, ``I'm really rooting for you guys to be able to get
married.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxley said he found the guest's remark wounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view celibacy as a gift, a deep personal commitment to our
Lord,'' he said. ``It would be like me going up to a married person
and saying, `I'm really rooting for you to be allowed polygamy.'''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some older priests who ran parishes in the experimental 1960s
worry that if young priests are too tightly bound to orthodoxy,
they will lose their ability to lead a less disciplined flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for tradition and greater piety,'' said Monsignor
Lorenzo Alcabete, 57, a professor of theology at St. Joseph's
Seminary and a frequent visitor to Rome, who has seen the
conservative shift in both places.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it turns into a moral legalism, a lack of sympathy or
experience of how life is perceived today, it becomes an
obstruction to faith: They will not be listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan said he often heard such concerns from alumni and other
older priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say young priests are conservative, people often tell
me, `Oh, they are pastorally insensitive, all head and no heart,'''
he said. ``These kids do have a great love for the magisterium and
the traditions of the church, but they also ask, `How do I preach
and bring it to the people?' It is not a haughty, heartless
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The seminarians describe themselves more as missionaries. ``It
hurts me when I see dissension in the church,'' Oxley said. ``But
my objective is not to condemn people who do not fully accept the
church's teaching. I don't want to alienate them, I want to bring
them closer to the truth.''

   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ Matthew Shepard, the gay college student
who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days
after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been
left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the
outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning
nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes
legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such
laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have
resisted them.
</P>
<P>
   From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to
honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman
at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of
anti-gay violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a
passerby. Russell Anderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, were
charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree
murder charges that could bring the death penalty. Their
girlfriends, Chastity Pasley, 21, and Kristen Price, 18, were
charged as accessories.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of
national Gay Awareness Week. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag
that symbolizes the gay rights movement was lowered to half-staff
in the Castro district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence,''
said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force in Washington. ``People have likened it to a
scarecrow. But it sounded more like a crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Laramie, Wyo., where the beating took place, have said
they believed robbery was the primary motive for the attack against
Shepard, which occurred outside a bar in the town of 27,000. But
investigators also said Shepard's sexuality may have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by
saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriends said Shepard
had embarassed one of the men by making a pass at him.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied to the
fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a street
corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy
Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the
brawl; McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same
hospital where Shepard died.
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear _ that
Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to
pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives
generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights
over another.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia
have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are
committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national
origin, and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual
orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including
Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton responded to news of Shepard's death by
urging Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act,
which would make federal offenses of crimes based on sex,
disability and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has been one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three
hate crimes bills since 1994, most recently in February. But
Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to
lawmakers to reconsider their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate
legislation that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for
their consideration in January,'' Geringer said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor met Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain
student's father, and said that the elder Shepard did not want his
son's death to become ``a media circus'' and that ``we should not
use Matt to further an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into
just passing all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of
any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in
the process to race to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would
respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper,
Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped the death would
have an impact on legislators around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper
understanding of hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights
group that has 250,000 members. ``Matthew's death may lead to an
awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need
for this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States
because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern
Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against
minorities. According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor
in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use
Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom
of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of
violent crime and everything to do with silencing political
opposition,'' said Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family
Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to defending
``faith, family and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would criminalize pro-family beliefs,'' Schwalm said.
``This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the
political message of homosexual activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in
a series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne,
``overcame'' homosexuality through religious conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is
contrary to Biblical norms,'' said Paulk, who describes himself as
a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian
group in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Because we are standing up and
opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon as
advocating violence against homosexuals, when we categorically
reject violence against homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of
television advertisements that preach the ``healing'' of
homosexuality through religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that
these advertisements help create a hostile climate for homosexuals,
a climate that can lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states have not
impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice
professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton
College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send a
clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before
they escalate,'' he said. Referring to murders of homosexuals, he
added: ``These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if
they are not punished the first time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered
higher rates of violent crime than the population at large. He also
said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals are
male, aged 22 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``With other crimes, violence is a means to an end. With hate
crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin said.
Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, as
well as a massive blow to the back of his skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because their social stature in society, gays are often viewed
as appropriate targets,'' Levin added. Citing the need for hate
crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said:
``The discourse in society leaves many of these people to believe
that what they are doing is socially acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's
death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of
nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This University of Wyoming student was beaten and left to die,
tied to a fence like an animal because he was honest and open about
being gay,'' Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, said Monday,
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be
dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals.
His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly hear
the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic equal
treatment,'' Ms. Dorhn said.

SERBS MAKE CONCESSIONS AS NATO ALLIES APPROVE BOMBING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: An expanded version is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(See also KOSOVO-RUSSIA)

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The United States and its allies early
Monday approved an order opening the way for NATO to begin a
bombing campaign in the Serbian province of Kosovo in four days
time. But with the threat looming, the Serbs on Monday made
important concessions and appeared close to an agreement that could
end the threat of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American and NATO officials said Monday that America's
special envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, had made
significant progress with Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic and
``has much of what we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to avoid a potentially devastating bombing campaign in
the Serbian heartland, the Yugoslav president has agreed to end all
police and military operations in Kosovo, withdraw forces in a
verifiable way, and make a unilateral statement pledging partial
autonomy to the province, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats said the chief stumbling blocks to an agreement
were differences over what form of international mission should be
allowed into Kosovo to verify that any accord was respected, and
Milosevic's reluctance to promise cooperation with international
war-crimes investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The principal aim of the ``activation order,'' passed at a
meeting of NATO ambassadors, appeared to be to bring a maximum
amount of diplomatic pressure to bear on Milosevic rather than to
embark on military action.
</P>
<P>
   The order stipulated that 96 hours had to elapse before a first
phase of military action could begin. Earlier drafts had spoken of
48 hours, and Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, said the
extension reflected the fact that, ``After analysis of the progress
made, we wanted to give a longer chance to negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO decision was made after Holbrooke unexpectedly
interrupted his marathon negotiations with Milosevic to come to
Brussels and brief NATO officials. Diplomats said Holbrooke had
made substantial progress in his talks, but a few obstacles
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed more clout behind the negotiating process, and this
NATO decision provides it,'' one NATO diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   After briefing NATO, Holbrooke returned immediately to Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, to continue his talks with Milosevic, whose crackdown
on ethnic-Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo has driven
the Clinton administration to the conviction that only the credible
threat of force could end the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not NATO does use force, an important precedent
appears to have been set by Monday's decision. In effect, NATO
implied that, without an explicit U.N. Security Council resolution
authorizing force, it has the right, in certain circumstances, to
intervene in the internal affairs of a European state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NATO order approved Monday, command of more than 400
aircraft and other materiel that might be used against Yugoslavia
was formally transferred from NATO member countries to the
alliance's commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark. Technically,
NATO is now ready to begin a campaign.

STOCKS RISE ON TOKYO BANKING NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rose Monday after Japan's Parliament
approved legislation to revive its moribund banking system, setting
off rallies in Asian and European markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 101.95 points, or 1.29
percent, to 8,001.47. It was the first close above 8,000 for the
Dow since Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Volume in the United States was light, and the bond market was
closed for Columbus Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good rally and a continuation of what went on
Friday,'' said Bill Allyn, head of stock trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
``But because the bond market was closed and volume was down,
Tuesday's session might be more telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes also registered sharp gains. The Nasdaq
composite index, which has been pounded recently, completed its
biggest two-day advance since October 1987. It climbed 53.59 points
Monday, or 3.59 percent, to 1,546.08, after gaining 73 points on
Friday. Still, the two gains have not completely reversed the
nearly 200-point decline recorded earlier in the week. And for the
year, the index is still down 1.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.32 points, or 1.35
percent, to 997.71. The New York Stock Exchange composite index
increased 6.25, to 492.95. And the Russell 2,000 index of smaller
companies rose 7.22 points, to 325.62.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the Big Board was 691 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about a solution to Japan's financial and economic
problems had sent stocks in Tokyo up 5.24 percent. Revitalized
banks in Japan could lift the world's second-largest economy out of
recession, helping the rest of Asia in the process and easing the
world financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The news spurred Hong Kong's Hang Seng index higher by 5.68
percent. In London, stocks in the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100 index rose 4.4 percent. German stocks climbed 7.5 percent. And
equity prices on major exchanges in Latin America also registered
big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some traders said they were not convinced about the
Japanese plan, adding that with companies reporting third-quarter
earnings, U.S. stock prices are vulnerable. ``I think the Japanese
plan is a Band-Aid,'' said one block trader who asked not to be
identified. ``What has happened over the last couple of days is
nice, but we are not out of the woods. If we get more bad news, we
will be back in the doldrums again.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said recent developments had raised their hopes
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Canelo, a U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co., said a global move toward lower interest rates
started by the Federal Reserve Board should help reliquefy the
international economy. Nearly as important, he added, has been the
recent decline in the value of the dollar, a drop that should help
emerging-market countries whose currencies are tied to the dollar.
The reforms in Japan should also help, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that the Dow would have a tough time moving
above 8,400,'' he said. ``I am feeling a little bit better about
things than I was a week or so ago. But third-quarter earnings
numbers are going to be very, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp. helped to bolster optimism about third-quarter
earnings when it surprised industry analysts with a profits report
that exceeded expectations. Shares of the company, which is being
bought by Daimler-Benz AG of Germany, gained 2{, to 44\, after it
said it had earned $1.02 a share in the quarter, up sharply from 65
cents in the period a year earlier. The consensus estimate among
analysts polled by First Call Corp. was 87 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that earnings at technology companies might have bottomed
out helped to fuel gains among a number of the industry's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., which is expected to report third-quarter results
after the market closes on Tuesday, rose 1 5/8 Monday, to 85 7/16.
Microsoft gained 2 7/8, to 99}. And Dell Computer jumped 3\, to 56
1/16.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Worries about the stability of the financial system persist,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of many bank and brokerage stocks rose again Monday, but
there were some notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, which is expected to release third-quarter
earnings on Tuesday, fell 1}, to 43 7/8. Citigroup lost {, to 34
15/16. And Bankers Trust Co. slumped 4 5/8, or nearly 8 percent, to
54\, after Fitch IBCA, the debt rating agency, lowered its rating
on the company, citing concerns about its earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector was also the venue for the session's most
spectacular trade, a 2.5-million-share block of Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which is completing its $30.7 billion merger with
Norwest Corp. and is expected to report third-quarter earnings next
week, saw its stock price plummet 16} Monday, to 319 15/16. The 2.5
million shares were sold when the stock was trading at 315 a share.

   Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank of Japan, the nation's
central bank, warned officials in Washington recently that all the
banks were short of capital and that the resulting credit squeeze
had helped stifle economic recovery. With a weak capital base,
large international Japanese banks have been trimming their lending
to meet capital requirements set by the Bank for International
Settlements. Banks with only domestic business must conform to
government rules.
</P>
<P>
   The international banks say they currently meet those standards,
but just as troublesome is the level of equity capital _ a narrower
measure of capital _ that could absorb real losses arising from
writing off unrecoverable loans. The amount of the nation's bad
debt could be anywhere from $670 billion to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tumbling stock market, which is flirting with
13-year lows, hurts the level of capital at the banks. Recent
banking proposals by politicians highlight just how low the levels
of capital could tumble at the banks if their bad loans were dealt
with right away.
</P>
<P>
   According to the guidelines in one proposal, the core amount of
equity capital at the banks could fall by nearly one half if the
top 19 banks disposed of problem loans in line with internal
findings of the Bank of Japan. The Democratic Party and others have
demanded that the banks address these problem loans by setting
aside a portion of profits to absorb losses in the expectation that
one-fifth of these loans go bad, a proportion based on the findings
by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty, however, is that most banks contend that these
loans are currently in fine shape, and they have created virtually
no cushion of profits for them.
</P>
<P>
   The precarious level of capital is why many analysts are calling
on the politicians to put the money in first and then tackle the
rebuilding of the sticky principles that govern the system. For
years, analysts and economists here and abroad have been demanding
greater financial disclosure, tougher accounting standards and more
market-oriented rules in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for disclosure,'' said Ryuji Konishi, a former bank
executive who now teaches economics at Tokyo University. ``But this
is not a time of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikara Sakaguchi, a member of Parliament and a leader in the
New Peace Party, has said that his party supports the Liberal
Democrats' bill. Yoshio Suzuki, a senior member in the Liberal
Party, which was instrumental in Monday night's agreement, said
that the Liberal Party would also vote to pass the bill and that
the bill was assured passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have finally succeeded in establishing a scheme which is
essential to overcome the present financial crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with the bills, though. Some senior
bankers say that Japan may be passing up the chance to make the
financial system and its institutions much more competitive through
the kind of change that can only emerge from a crisis. In the words
of one Japanese banker, Japan needs ``hands of the devil and the
heart of a Buddha,'' so that painful revamping may be done now to
bring long term benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the Liberal Democrats' version is barely
different from the plan that is being replaced because of
opposition from the Democratic Party. Under that plan, Japan's
banks received public money worth about 1.8 trillion yen, or $15.7
billion, in March, but the plan failed to inspire worldwide
confidence in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pessimistic,'' said Katsuya Okada, a parliamentary
member for the Democratic Party, the main opposition whose views
are being edged out of the second set of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy and the method are not so clear yet. It seems
as though the government is forcing the vote.''

   CHANEL TO START CASUAL LINE
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ Karl Lagerfeld, who is not about to let Chanel become a
fashion relic _ a fate that has befallen many French houses _ will
introduce the Chanel Beige label collection for fall and winter
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld said he hopes to bring a fresh, casual spin to the
Chanel line. ``Today, you need sportswear-looking things,'' he
said. ``It's for another way of dressing. I wanted to do a sports
line because I want to use modern materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Chanel has stood alone among major labels without a lower-price
category; this move is sure to attract the attention of retailers
and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with Daryl Kerrigan, who is based in New York, to
collaborate on the line, fell through, Lagerfeld said. But another
collaborator has been engaged, and Lagerfeld said he would announce
the name after the Chanel show scheduled here for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction comes at a moment when several designer
collections are lowering prices to cope with the economic turmoil
in Asia. This line will help expand Chanel's price range, which is
typically well over $1,000 for an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The name Beige grew out of the lore of Coco Chanel. ``It's Beige
label because Chanel in the 20's was called the queen of beige,''
Lagerfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it's second,'' he added. ``I hate everything
that's second _ second in line, second rate. It's a sport line.''
</P>
<P>
   MARCEL MARONGIU BOUTIQUE
</P>
<P>
   Up the street from the hip store Colette, and the hipper still
Hotel Costes, Marcel Marongiu has opened his first shop at 203 rue
St.Honore. Marongiu has been a reliably innovative designer on the
French fashion landscape for almost 10 years, even if his name has
not zoomed to its uppermost reaches.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, his clothes are carried in If boutique in
Manhattan. His new store, which opened Monday, gives Marongiu the
opportunity to present his whole vision, including ready-to-wear,
sleek architectural handbags, shoes and CD wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Marongiu's clothes fall within that hard-to-find middle ground
of urban edginess and utter wearability. Early on, he made stretch
sportswear one of his signatures, and the store features ink-black,
body-conscious sleeveless sweaters and asymmetrically cut
accordian-pleated skirts with diagonal zippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a shop is really important for a designer line,''
Marongiu said. ``Everything becomes clearer to the customer.
Otherwise, you just have a few racks in the corner of a store
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW PHOTOGRAPHER AT KLEIN
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein has hired Mario Testino, the photographer best
known for his sexually charged work with the Gucci advertising
campaigns, to shoot the Calvin Klein spring 1999 campaign for his
top collection, as well as for CK and the jeans' line for men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the designer, whose campaigns are often a
fashion and cultural bellwether, will work with Testino.
</P>
<P>
   Their new alliance ends, at least temporarily, a long-running
collaboration between Klein and the photographer Steven Meisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to communicate the feeling of sensuality of
the woman in this campaign,'' Klein said. ``I felt this is a moment
when I can say what I want to say with Mario.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he has been deeply involved with the new ads,
speaking with Testino almost daily and flying to the set in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he did not go on shoots with Meisel, who is well
known for making his sets off-limits to designers. ``I've always
found it best if I'm on the shoot,'' Klein said. ``I'm involved
with the photography, the styling. This is the way I worked with
Irving Penn and Dick Avedon.''
</P>
<P>
   Testino's star has been rising in fashion circles in the last
two years, shooting first Gucci and then several spreads for Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Calvin Klein campaign, which is being styled with Carine
Roitfeld, a frequent collaborator of Testino's, is something he was
eager to work on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said to my brother, who is my agent, that I wanted
to work with Calvin because he likes modern, sexy girls,'' Testino
said. ``When I think of Calvin, I always think of Brooke Shields.''

DEAL NEAR ON MONEY FOR IMF, WITH CONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Republican congressional
leaders are close to an agreement to provide $18 billion to the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for new conditions on the
fund's loans to foreign governments, Clinton administration and
congressional officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the deal, which they expect to be announced
this week as part of an overall budget settlement, would require
that the IMF raise the interest rates on most loans and shorten the
repayment periods.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said that although some details of the
legislation were under negotiation, the package would probably
require loans to be repaid in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The lending conditions had been sought by House Republicans, who
opposed the full $18 billion in financing that the administration
had requested to help the fund as it tries to avert a global
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The money would go to replenish accounts that were depleted by
efforts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republican lawmakers have contended that billions of
dollars that went to the bailouts were squandered and that liberal
lending had encouraged some nations to pursue reckless policies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is widely expected to single out South Korea,
one of the three Asian nations that received a bailout, and to
demand that the IMF bar further loans to South Korea if the
government tries to use any of the money to underwrite specific
domestic industries that have been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has begun to consult other nations
that are large shareholders in the IMF about what lending
conditions to impose.

VICTIM OF GAY BEATING DIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ Matthew Shepard died Monday, leaving a personal
legacy of peace and tolerance that his family, friends, and
President Clinton said should inspire others to fight the kind of
blind hatred that apparently incited his brutal murder.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, 21, a student and gay activist at the University of
Wyoming, died in a Colorado hospital with his family by his side,
five days after he was savagely attacked in an apparent hate crime
that shocked much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that in the grief of this moment for Matthew Shepard's
family and in the shared outrage across America, Americans will
once again search their hearts and do what they can to reduce their
own fear and anxiety and anger at people who are different,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our shock and grief, one thing must remain clear,'' Clinton
added. ``Hate and prejudice are not American values.''
</P>
<P>
   As the flags in Laramie flew at half-staff and many in this
cowboy college town donned yellow armbands in mourning for Shepard,
Clinton and lawmakers called on Congress to expand the federal
hate-crime law to cover attacks motivated by prejudice against a
victim's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's death also caused Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer to say
he will reconsider his lack of support for a state hate-crime law,
but he continued to express doubt about its necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects in Shepard's slaying _ Aaron J. McKinney, 22,
and Russell A. Henderson, 21 _ could face the death penalty if they
are convicted of first-degree murder. They also face charges of
kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If capital punishment is the result, how do you enhance
that?'' Geringer said. ``You can only do it once.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for gay rights said the failure of the federal
government and five states, including Wyoming, to extend hate-crime
protections to homosexuals has provided cover for promoters of
anti-gay bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the two suspects, planning to rob Shepard,
lured him from a Laramie bar to their pickup truck last week by
telling him they were homosexuals. Kidnapping him, the suspects
allegedly pistol-whipped Shepard with a .357 Magnum as they drove
him to a remote bluff on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, who was 5-foot-2 and weighed less than 110 pounds,
begged for his life, prosecutors said, as the suspects allegedly
lashed him to a wooden fence, continued to beat him, stripped off
his shoes, and then left him for dead in near-freezing
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 18 hours elapsed before a passerby discovered Shepard. He
was unconscious, hypothermic, and his brain was severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard never regained consciousness, and he died while he was
on ``full life-support measures'' at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort
Collins, Colo., according to the hospital president, Rulon Stacey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family was grateful they did not have to make a decision
regarding whether or not to continue life support for their son,''
Stacey said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Shepard ``came into the world premature and left the
world premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacey also said Shepard's mother, Judy, asked him to convey a
message to the public: ``Go home, give your kids a hug, and don't
let a day go by without telling them you love them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sandstone buildings at the University of Wyoming, where
Shepard was a political science major, his friends grieved as they
organized an impromptu outdoor memorial service last night. Shepard
died as the school began ``gay awareness week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt came to Laramie because he thought he would be safe,''
said Erik Abbott, 25, a junior and a friend of Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said bias against homosexuals is not uncommon in Wyoming.
``Why is it that the nice people are the ones who get killed?''
Abbott said. ``I hope his legacy will carry on and stop this kind
of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's president, Philip L. Dubois, said the flags on the
Laramie campus would remain at half-staff until Shepard's funeral,
which is sheduled for Friday at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in
Casper, where Shepard grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are heartsick to believe that anyone could have acted
against Matthew with such unimaginable violence, motivated by
irrational personal prejudice and hate,'' Dubois said. ``His
suffering is over. Ours, as a community, endures.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Shepard's parents, who last spoke to him from their
home in Saudi Arabia, where they work for an oil company, said they
would take comfort in his last words to them, according to Stacey.
He said Shepard told them: ``I love you.''

IN NBA LABOR DISPUTE, YOU CAN SIDE WITH, AH, IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Somebody asked the other day whether there's ever been
two parties in a public dispute less deserving of sympathy than the
NBA owners and NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure. Here's my short list:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq vs. Iran _ Countries that have established why the rest of
the world moved out of the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr vs. Bill Clinton _ Ravenous egos more unstoppable than
the combined force of the Constitution, the rule of law, the
English language and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp vs. Monica Lewinsky _ A real-life version of Mad
Magazine's old ``Spy vs. Spy,'' only without the wit, originality
or cleverness. Just as tasteless, however.
</P>
<P>
   Don King vs. Mike Tyson _ The sub-basement below hell's bottom
floor is reserved in the names of these gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as two parties in a sports-labor dispute completely
devoid of sympathy as well as empathy ...
</P>
<P>
   No. Never has been one like this one.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way:
</P>
<P>
   Which one is Beavis?
</P>
<P>
   At least in the modern labor disruptions of baseball, football
and hockey, a plausible argument could be offered that the players'
side had been at one time disadvantaged relative to ownership. That
was particularly acute in baseball, where the reserve clause
virtually bound a player to a team for life, creating little
leverage for players and boundless profitability for owners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the huge union advances made in collective bargaining
and the creation of improved free agency in the past 20 years, the
pendulum has swung. In baseball, it has swung so far that the union
runs the sport and the franchises just tag along.
</P>
<P>
   Great advances happened for basketball, too, except that its
landmark labor peace in 1984 was achieved when the sport was at its
nadir. The crisis was tangible enough that both sides worked from
the same pile of devalued rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Now we see the NBA as victim of its own success. The NBA's
two-decade-long merchandising of the game's individual heroes, as
opposed to teams, has produced a star-driven industry whose stars
make the soundest claim among all sports that league success is
more dependent upon individuals than teams, franchises or the game
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, owners have agreed, not only by lavishly marketing
the players but by paying the highest salaries in sports, rivaling
the biggest in show business.
</P>
<P>
   The owners no longer want to pay those salaries. They want
take-backs _ primarily an end to the Bird exception that allows
teams to pay their own free agents unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is how the Chicago Bulls can have a payroll of
nearly $60 million when the salary cap is less than $30 million.
It's why the league claims up to half its teams are no longer
profitable, a claim the union _ and anyone working with more than a
brain stem _ dismisses as piffle.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is ownership believes the claim sufficiently to
endure a self-imposed shutdown. Owners have two things going for
them _ a huge war chest supplied by TV revenues and the stupidity
of the American sports consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA watched baseball's recovery from the 1994 strike that
cost the World Series and bled into the 1995 season. Disastrous as
it was, the NBA, always mindful of the bigger picture, figured if
it took only four years for the dopes who run baseball to get the
game close to where it was, the basketball slicksters will need
half a season, tops. They're probably right, because of the nearly
infinite capacity of most pro sports consumers to forgive and
forget, as well as their susceptibility to clever apologies and
emotional make-goods (see Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Owners want something more like the NFL's harder salary cap. Yet
22 of the 30 NFL teams, including the Seahawks, exceed the $52
million cap thanks to a variety of loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Caps just don't work as advertised. The NBA is asking for an
artificial limit on labor costs, while there is no cap on their
potential revenues. Nor is there a cap on ticket costs. Unless caps
are agreed to on all fronts, their deployment on one element of the
economic equation will create unfairness that almost always leads
to further labor trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite having the economic points on their side, today's
basketball players are not only not disadvantaged like their
sports-labor predecessors a generation earlier, they are
financially on top of the world while operating behind the
protection of a union that works for its elite instead of its rank
and file _ exactly the opposite of all non-sports unions.
</P>
<P>
   No union member at Boeing can be expected to accept the arcane
arguments about market economics when jewelry-bedecked players roll
up to private jets in limos. Nor can the average basketball fan
accept the notion that there is nothing in the enormous wealth
accumulated by players that can't be surrendered in order to have a
season.
</P>
<P>
   The players are atop a false economy, hiding behind a false
front. The owners are creating artificial crisis and applying
artificial brakes.
</P>
<P>
   In this argument, take Iraq, and give the points.
</P>

MARKET PLACE: ANOTHER HEDGE FUND SEEMS TO BE IN PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Turbulence in the bond markets continues to wreak
havoc among some of the most sophisticated investors. Ellington
Capital Management, an Old Greenwich, Conn., investment firm
created by a star mortgage bond trader, has unloaded hundreds of
millions of dollars in mortgage-related securities in the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
   In response to margin calls from its lenders, the firm appears
to have been forced to liquidate much of the holdings in its hedge
funds, while developing a plan with some of its lenders that would
allow it to remain in business.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington manages about $1 billion in capital, although it
invests more by borrowing additional funds. Like other hedge funds,
which are aimed at wealthy individuals and large investors like
pension funds, Ellington is highly secretive about its investment
strategy and has tended to disclose little about how it achieves
its results.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in late 1994 by Michael Vranos, a former senior managing
director at Kidder Peabody &AMP; Co., the firm specializes in investing
in mortgage-related securities. Vranos' skill at trading mortgage
bonds earned him fame and a staggering pay package of about $15
million in 1993, before higher interest rates the following year
helped cause sizable losses at the firm. Kidder was later sold to
Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington, which declined to comment specifically on the events
of the last few days, confirmed that it had been selling many of
its holdings. A spokesman said the firm was ``involved in a
concentrated effort to respond to liquidity constraints in the
mortgage-backed securities markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellington ``conducted an orderly sale of certain of its holdings
that will produce proceeds far in excess of dealer-financing claims
on those securities, when cleared,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Vranos, who did not comment on the recent events, did say that
the firm's partners were ``doing everything we can to protect our
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other high-profile managers, including John Meriwether of
Long-Term Capital, the hedge fund that was the recent subject of a
multibillion-dollar bailout, Vranos has proved no match for a rough
ride in the bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   By borrowing money in the hope of enhancing returns, many of
these managers have instead amplified their losses at a time when
skittish investors have retreated to treasuries. That has caused
the value of a variety of bonds, whether in emerging markets or
tied to mortgages, to slide sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington's sale appears to have been conducted under pressure
from lenders; margin calls were made last Friday after the price of
the firm's holdings dropped earlier in the week. In order to meet
those calls, and prevent future ones, the firm began selling some
of its holdings and held three auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The list of securities offered for sale was extensive and seemed
to be widely distributed, according to Steven R. Point, a bond
manager at Glenmede Trust Co. in Philadelphia. ``There was
everything, including the kitchen sink, in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders, like banks and brokerages, which normally might lend a
hand in scooping up some of these investments, seemed anxious to
find other buyers, he noted. ``Dealers are nervous about the
extension of financing to these institutions,'' Point said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington's crisis appears to have developed suddenly. One of
the firm's funds, Ellington Mortgage Partners, which accounts for
roughly a third of its capital, had been reporting a gain of about
8 percent through September, according to Hedge Fund Research, a
Chicago consulting firm. It had returns of about 22 percent last
year and 48 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage bond area has been among those hardest hit as
interest rates have plunged. The possibility that Long Term
Capital, which has also been forced to sell many of its holdings,
could unload an additional several billion dollars' worth of
securities is further depressing the market, according to George P.
Van, the chairman of Van Hedge Fund Advisors International in
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Like Meriwether at Long-Term Capital, Vranos had been through
difficult times in the bond market before. But during previous
tough times both men worked for huge brokerage firms, which had
substantial resources at their disposal, perhaps allowing them to
weather rockiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firm's capital surrounded them like a comforting cocoon,''
Van said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, there is precious little protection in the current
market environment, where worried lenders and investors alike are
forcing managers to sell, forcing prices lower. ``It is not over,''
Van said. ``We have a domino effect.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BOOMER TELLS YANKEE FANS TO COOL IT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Wells' idol, the esteemed George Herman Ruth, once tried
to fight a couple of opposing players. Asked about it later, the
Babe said he didn't mind being called a blankety-blank or a
bleepety-bleep; he just didn't like it when they got personal.
</P>
<P>
   So you see, there have always been standards in baseball. It
just happens that the standards keep getting lower. Wells said he
heard adults and children in Cleveland making remarks about his
late mother on Sunday evening, and that made him so angry, he beat
the Indians without his good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any fan who reads the papers,'' Wells said, perhaps referring
to an enlightened minority, ``knows I buried my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans who read, or absorb the information flying through the
airwaves, may also know that Wells has great devotion for the way
his mother raised him in a Hell's Angels milieu.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is sacred these days. (``Life in the 90s,'' said
Chili Davis of the Yankees. ``I hear words on television I never
used to hear.'') As the Yankees and the Indians go into the sixth
game Tuesday night, it would be nice if Yankee fans showed a little
couth and just called the Indians the usual scatological mix
without, as the Babe put it, getting personal. But I wouldn't
expect it, not in Yankee Stadium, not Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go way back with David, all the way to Venezuela on the same
winter ball team,'' David Justice of the Indians said at a news
conference Monday. ``When he said it, it hurt me, too, because the
loss of a mother will hurt everybody in this room deeply when it
happens to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice added: ``I hated that he had to go through that. But I
mean, come on now. We are talking about the Yankee fans. I have
heard everything about my mother, everything about my history,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``history'' includes a stormy divorce from the actress Halle
Berry, now memorialized in the chant, ``Hal-le, Ber-ry,'' that
wafts from the Yankee Stadium stands, almost as good as the classic
Potvin Chant in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, the Yankees are not necessarily immune from
Bronx viciousness, either. The players have legitimate concerns
about whether the fans will still remember Chuck Knoblauch's mental
freeze last Wednesday that allowed a vital run to score. The fans
were booing Knoblauch when he batted in the bottom of that 12th
inning, and that was before they were primed by all-screech radio
and tabloid headlines that called him a ``Blauch Head.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Yankees are back in command, the fans may be
forgiving, but Tino Martinez raised the issue Monday: ``The guy's
played his butt off and he made one mistake, although granted it
came at a bad time. He showed great character in dealing with it.
They should get behind him, and give him more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch wouldn't bite Monday when a troublemaker asked if his
old fans in Minnesota would have given him a warm reception in a
similar situation. He didn't want to inflame the locals, and who
can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   ``But Yankee fans, everybody in this room knows how rough they
can be,'' Justice said Monday. ``So they can't get any rougher on
us unless they show up with Uzis.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers' vocal cords could be legally categorized as lethal
weapons. Wells, who grew up a Yankee fan out of sheer perversity in
San Diego, recalls his first trip to the Stadium as a member of the
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greatest feeling walking into the ball park,'' Wells recalled
Monday. ``Then I started pitching, and they really got bad.
Abusive. I said, `Who needs this stuff?' Then I said, `Hey, that's
cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wells understands that the fans just want to help. He said the
Justice chant is ``a different situation. Dave understands. She's a
celebrity.'' Justice came close to agreeing with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an eye-for-an-eye guy,'' Wells continued. ``The fans
should try to ride the stuffing out of the Indians. But they
shouldn't throw things, or yell things at players' wives, which
some people did in Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, who pitches Tuesday night, said: ``It is kind of
ironic to hear Yankee players talking about opposing fans. I don't
know what was said on a personal note, and there is no place for
that in any ball park, but they have an incredible run going on
there with all the sellouts, and the way they support their team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee fans make up in detail and volume what they lack in
numbers. They will surely be prodding the Indians for any
weaknesses, which is fine, as long as they don't get personal.
</P>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Six people believed to be illegal immigrants from
Mexico were hit and killed early Monday by a freight train as they
slept on a desolate stretch of tracks in southern Texas. Officials
said they believed the immigrants may have been victims of a
superstition that the rails would keep them safe from snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth that if you sleep between the rails that snakes
will not get you,'' said Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific.
``You go down the railroad tracks, you'll see snakes cut in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the driver of the train blew the whistle repeatedly
when he noticed the people on the tracks. Although a couple of the
victims raised their heads, no one got off the tracks. Davis said
he was uncertain how far the train was from the victims when the
driver saw them. But, he added, it would have taken a mile to stop
the 105-car train, which was traveling between 45 and 49 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The vast ranchlands of South Texas that stretch between the Rio
Grande and San Antonio are among the most remote in the state, mile
after mile of mesquite, prickly pear, citrus farms and grazing
lands that are a prime avenue for illegal immigrants trying to make
their way from the Mexican border to San Antonio or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While illegal immigrants have been killed while sleeping on
railroad tracks before, Fred Borrego, patrol agent in charge of the
U.S. Border Patrol in Kingsville, said never had so many been
killed in one accident. Between 2,000 and 3,000 illegal immigrants
pass through his 2,600-square-mile patrol area each month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent victims, who were badly mutilated, have not been
identified. They were taken to Corpus Christi where authorities
will try to use fingerprints to determine their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego had another possible explanation for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another theory I've been told is that in Mexico the trains
don't run at night,'' Borrego said. ``They say they sleep up there
because they feel a lot safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems implausible that people could sleep with the
noise of a train running toward them, Davis said, ``a train
operating when you're in front of it is very, very quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The engine noise is primarily to the side, he said, and there is
very little friction on the rail itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know its hard to believe,'' Borrego said. ``I've experienced
this myself. If it's coming toward you it's as quiet as a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in the Kenedy County sheriff's office speculated
that the hard traveling conditions confronted by the immigrants
could also have played a role. The terrain in the area is very
rugged, with most of it being brush covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think, `I'd never fall asleep there' or `Why wouldn't they
wake up?''' said Hopy Alines, a secretary in the sheriff's office.
``But it just doesn't happen. These people travel three, four and
five days without eating, without sleeping. They're just completely
exhausted and they don't wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally the illegal immigrants traveling through the county go
unnoticed aside from the trail of odds and ends they leave behind,
Ms. Alines said. ``You'll see empty bottles, sometimes bags of
clothes,'' she said. ``We get a lot of calls where they break in
and all they ever take is food and water.'' It is generally when
people get sick or have problems that officials hear stories like
the ones about people sleeping on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Davis estimated that four to six people a year are injured or
killed while sleeping on railroad tracks. In fact, he said, there
have been cases where people sleeping on tracks have been run over
and survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, or fortunately, they're intoxicated,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The train, which was carrying a variety of freight like scrap
paper and metal automobile parts, was traveling from Houston to
Brownsville, Texas, when the accident occurred about 3:15 a.m. near
the tiny town of Norias, which is 60 miles north of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Texas there were 38 fatalities and 80 injuries
involving what railroad officials call ``trespass accidents,''
Davis said, cases where people were struck on or near tracks or
trying to get on a railroad car.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego said the last time he could remember a large group of
illegal immigrants being killed on train tracks was in 1983 or 1984
when 14 people were killed trying to cross a railroad trestle.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials along with Union Pacific officials
caution illegal immigrants about sleeping on railroad tracks as
part of general information they provide on the dangers of crossing
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they don't get the word,'' Borrego said. ``The
conditions out here are rigid. You've got cactus, mesquite. It's no
fun walking through the territory. They run out of water, they get
bit by snakes.''

CLINTON TOUTS THE SENATE CANDIDACY OF AN ABSENT SCHUMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton flew into New York on Monday night
to raise $1 million for one of the most fiercely contested Senate
races in the nation _ Charles Schumer's challenge to Alfonse
D'Amato _ and to draw emotional sustenance from a place where
Clinton has been admired, even during his worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing was missing: Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was preparing to head to Air Force One from the
White House, Schumer, a Democratic congressman from Brooklyn, was
boarding the 2:30 p.m. Delta Shuttle for Washington for a series of
session-ending votes on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an odd scene in which Clinton spoke to a hotel
ballroom filled with Schumer signs, Schumer supporters, and
Schumer's wife, Iris _ but no Schumer, aside from three minutes of
videotaped remarks that the congressman had prepared Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's absence from his own blue-chip fund-raiser was due to
a tangle of governmental and political obligations _ and suggested
that D'Amato had captured Schumer's attention with his latest line
of attack in the campaign. D'Amato's escalating criticism of
Schumer for missing votes this year left the congressman with a
choice between staying in New York with Clinton and risking new
criticism from D'Amato, or going to Washington and leaving Clinton
alone to do his financial favor. Schumer chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chuck Schumer when he decided to take on this herculean
task that if he ever needed anyone to fill in for him, just to call
me,'' Clinton said after being swept with applause that lasted two
minutes and was quieted only when the congressman's wife raised her
hand. ``So here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, for 21 minutes, the president, standing alone on a
stage at the New York Hilton, laid out a case for Schumer that went
notably beyond the president's usual generic case for Democratic
candidates in his frequent trips across the nation. Clinton
assailed Republicans for questioning Schumer's attendance record in
a congressional session that he said was notable for its lack of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, he said, Schumer could at once fill the
constituent-service role that D'Amato has traditionally played in
New York _ which has earned him the nickname ``Senator Pothole'' _
and perform the grander policy duties normally associated with
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York deserves a senator who is both tied to the specific,
concrete needs of individuals and their communities, and a senator
who will vote in the interests of this state and the nation over
the long run, and finally give voice to what makes America a great
nation,'' Clinton said. ``This is a time when we need people who
are both practical and visionary.''

WHITE HOUSE APPEALS RULING ON NEW RIGHTS FOR MEDICARE
BENEFICIARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is asking a full appeals
court to overturn an August ruling that gave new rights and
consumer protections to six million Medicare beneficiaries in
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly had hailed the earlier ruling, by a
three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San
Francisco, as an important victory. The panel said that decisions
by Medicare HMOs amounted to government actions, so that patients
denied specific services were entitled to ``due process of law,''
including hearings and other protections.
</P>
<P>
   But in seeking to overturn the ruling, the Department of Health
and Human Services said on Monday that the government should not be
held accountable for the actions of HMOs that sign contracts with
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are predominantly medical decisions that turn on
independent professional judgment,'' the Clinton administration
said. ``They are not in any way dictated by the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore have been waging a campaign to promote ``patients' rights.''
In challenging the appeals court decision, the Administration
invoked many of the arguments made by HMOs and health insurance
companies that oppose new Federal laws, rules and standards.
</P>
<P>
   Just as HMOs argue that patients should not be able to sue them
for the actions of their doctors, so the administration argues that
the government should not be held accountable for the decisions of
Medicare HMOs to deny care to the elderly. Just as HMOs try to fend
off new Federal regulations as onerous and costly, so the
administration opposes court-imposed standards for patients'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In its legal brief, the administration complains that the
appeals court imposed ``highly detailed, burdensome and, in many
instances, wholly unnecessary procedural requirements on HMO
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arises from a class action lawsuit filed in Arizona
on behalf of the six million Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs around
the country. Judge Alfredo Marquez of the U.S. District Court in
Tucson ruled for the patients in October 1996. Health Secretary
Donna Shalala, then filed an appeal, saying the judge had usurped
her authority and gone further than necessary in protecting
patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a three-judge panel of the appeals court issued a
unanimous ruling for the patients and against Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said the decisions of a Medicare HMO amounted to
``government action'' because the HMO was operating as ``a
governmental proxy.'' Moreover, it said, Medicare officials have
not lived up to their duty to guarantee due process of law, as
required by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the panel's decision was ``patently incorrect,''
because ``Medicare does not superintend medical decisions
concerning the appropriate treatment of a beneficiary.'' She asked
the full appeals court to overturn the panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala complained that the ruling by Judge Marquez would
provide Medicare patients with ``the full panoply of hearing and
appeal rights for even minor disagreements over reductions or
changes in medical treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Clinton has repeatedly urged Congress to pass
legislation setting detailed standards for HMOs and other health
plans. But in contending that the government should not be held
responsible for the performance of Medicare HMOs, the
administration said, ``Great care must be taken to avoid
inappropriately extending the reach of federal law and judicial
power.''

FORECAST IS MOSTLY CLOUDY AT HEDGE FUND CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda _ Julian H. Robertson Jr., who runs Tiger
Management LLC, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, said
Monday that the global financial markets remained precarious and
that he did not expect things to get much better anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a rough spot now,'' Robertson told a
meeting here, where hundreds of professionals are gathered for the
largest hedge fund conference of its kind. ``I kind of feel like a
batter who hasn't had a hit in 15 at bats. It's not a good
period.''
</P>
<P>
   With global markets facing one of the most turbulent periods in
a decade, global investors everywhere have been hurt, many because
of ill-fated bets in Russia and other emerging markets. Hedge
funds, which manage money for wealthy individuals and institutions,
have been known to make the riskiest of bets, and lately those
bets, many here acknowledge, have turned calamitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the liquidity in the global markets has deteriorated
markedly,'' Robertson said Monday in a televised linkup from New
York to a packed auditorium of hedge fund aficionados and others
who manage investments for the affluent. ``I do not see a clear
indication it is turning the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's comments are particularly noteworthy because he
manages one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and hedge
funds have come under increasing public scrutiny in the last month
because of huge losses among a fabled few, including Long-Term
Capital Management, which narrowly escaped bankruptcy last month
when the Federal Reserve orchestrated a rescue backed by Wall
Street's leading investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   In August, hedge funds suffered their sharpest losses in more
than a decade, and Robertson's own fund, Tiger Management, which
has about $20 billion under management, said it had lost about $600
million because of investments in Russian debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thought the Russian bet was one of the better ones
we made this year,'' he said. ``I guess I've learned that the best
laid plans of mice and men can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question and answer format, conference attendants lined up
here at the Southampton Princess Hotel to ask Robertson his
thoughts on the market and the future of hedge funds. Robertson's
answer? In the short run, he said, things do not look good. ``Only
a wild optimist could not expect more redemptions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 900 people are attending the conference, which is
sponsored by Hedge/MAR, a New York publishing concern that tracks
the hedge fund industry. The conference comes at a time when hedge
funds are front and center, and the tone reflects how much the
industry has been altered in recent months. For example, the topics
include ``Crisis and Corrections: Implications for Hedge Funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Although few attendants appear to favor government regulation of
hedge funds, which they say would be costly and cumbersome,
Robertson said that some regulation, particularly of leveraging,
would not be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be some regulations and some regulation
would be good; too much would be really bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants, however, insist that the rescue of
Long-Term Capital, based in Greenwich, Conn., has cast a pall over
the industry, one that is largely unjustified, they argue,
particularly in light of the strong performance of most hedge funds
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   While the average hedge fund was down 5 percent in the third
quarter, the average stock fund was down 13 percent, the hedge fund
faithful point out.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest fear here appears to be that the wealthy will pull
out of hedge funds and redeem their money, causing greater trading
havoc.
</P>
<P>
   And like Wall Street, the latest bets here, or at least hopes,
is that the industry will ride out the storm and then resume its
growth. Many here say Robertson struck the right tone when he was
asked for a forecast of the hedge fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened here will cause some fallout in the
industry, and will cause some regulation in the industry,'' he
said. ``But 10, 20 years later, the industry will be even
stronger.''

 CHRYSLER NET RISES 54 PERCENT, BEATING FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Chrysler Corp. posted a much-better-than-expected 54.6
percent increase in third-quarter net profits Monday as the turmoil
in global financial markets seemed to be having surprisingly little
effect on the Big Three auto makers' domestic sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler announced that it had earned $682 million in the third
quarter, or $1.02 a share, up from $441 million, or 65 cents a
share, a year earlier. According to First Call, which tracks
earnings estimates, the consensus forecast was for Chrysler to earn
87 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Gary C. Valade, Chrysler's chief financial officer, said that
with the auto markets strong the company had spent less than
expected on discounts. Warranty expenses and other costs also
dropped, he added, and the introduction of the redesigned Jeep
Grand Cherokee went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler benefited little from a strike last summer that left
General Motors dealers with few cars and light trucks to sell, said
Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's president. Chrysler was already
selling its popular sport utility vehicles as fast as it could
build them and had little ability to increase production, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler executives said Monday that the stock market's
contraction had not yet hurt auto sales. James P. Holden, the
company's executive vice president for sales and marketing, said at
a luncheon last week that he had begun racing the company's
chairman, Robert J. Eaton, to the fax machine each morning for the
daily sales report and had found no weakness yet in sales.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. is expected to announce strike-depressed
earnings on Tuesday. Ford Motor Co. is widely expected to post an
increase in profits on Wednesday. At a lunch with reporters Monday,
John G. Middlebrook, the general manager of Chevrolet, GM's biggest
division, said that Chevrolet had found no correlation so far
between sharp drops in the stock market and the level of auto sales
in the following days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an extremely strong close to the month of September
right in the middle of the turmoil in the market,'' Middlebrook
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, the New York investment bank, said that while the market
turmoil may be causing some people on Wall Street to worry about
their jobs, overall employment is high across the nation and people
are spending money on cars accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any evidence of a slowdown,'' Mrs. Needham said.
``You keep thinking it has to change, but there hasn't been any
change yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's sales outside the United States and Canada tumbled 21
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. But that barely
hurt the company because only 7 percent of its sales are overseas.
Chrysler's total sales rose to $15.0 billion in the third quarter
from $13.2 billion in the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Although the average discount per vehicle in the United States
rose to $1,280 from $1,140 a year earlier, it was down from earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler is scheduled to merge next month with Daimler-Benz AG,
which would make Monday's earnings report Chrysler's last as an
independent company. Some version of Chrysler's profits will still
be calculated, though, because the company's profit-sharing plans
require it, Valade said.
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp said that Chrysler had focused on further cost
reductions and new model introductions, ``even while the three-ring
circus of the merger is going on around us.''
</P>
<P>
   With fierce competition preventing auto makers from raising
prices in line with inflation, the Big Three have all been cutting
costs vigorously. Valade said during a conference call with
reporters that Chrysler had cut pretax costs by $300 million in the
third quarter from the second quarter, notably through lower
warranty expenses and lower costs for raw materials and other
outside purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's profits in the third quarter of last year were
depressed by a $25 million after-tax charge for the closing of its
Eagle car brand. Excluding that charge, profits would have risen
during the third quarter of this year by 46.4 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which is also expecting strong profits, announced Monday
that it would develop one of the broadest programs ever to link
employees' compensation to their personal performance and the
attainment of various companywide goals, as well as the
corporation's overall results.
</P>
<P>
   Ford already gives bonuses linked to performance and profits to
its 5,000 top executives. Existing profit-sharing plans for an
additional 50,000 white-collar employees will now vary as well with
the attainment of individual and corporate targets, such as quality
and customer satisfaction, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's blue-collar employees already have a profit-sharing plan,
the details of which are specified by a contract with the United
Automobile Workers union.

NOW THE BUDGET PROCESS HAS BECOME THE CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the almost two weeks that the federal
government has operated without a budget, Congress and President
Clinton have said they want to finish work on a spending plan for
the year and head out to campaign for the mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it has become clear that the election itself is keeping
the lawmakers in Washington. Amid the Monica Lewinsky affair and
the possible impeachment of President Clinton, voters are expected
to head to the polls next month in such low numbers that the budget
process has become an exercise for each party in motivating its
core supporters.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, that means holding out for provisions on
abortion and contraceptives that conservative voters favor. For
Democrats, it means a last-minute campaign for new programs aimed
at rebuilding schools and hiring teachers. Democrats escalated
their education campaign on Friday, one day after the House voted
to proceed with the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   And for the nation, it means that federal officials have once
again allowed the fiscal year to begin without a formal spending
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate approved a bill Monday to keep &UR;  &LR; the
government running until midnight Wednesday while they finish work
on a budget for the full fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. A
previous extension funded government operations only through Monday
night. Clinton was expected to sign the extension last night.
</P>
<P>
   As budget talks continued Monday, progress was reported on
several fronts. Lawmakers and the White House were close to a deal
to send $18 billion to the International Monetary Fund, the agency
aiding nations hurt in the global economic crisis, in return for
White House promises to demand that the 182-nation IMF change the
way it operates.
</P>
<P>
   The House Monday night approved legislation to extend several
expiring tax credits, which would cost $9.2 billion over 10 years.
But the Senate had its own plan, and the White House complicated
matters with a last-minute tax proposal and a plan to spend $7.9
billion over 10 years on incentives for school construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last thing Congress will do before it adjourns,
and I don't think either the Democrats or Republicans want to give
the other party the last word,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic
pollster with the firm Garin-Hart-Yang. ``This is going to be a
close election, and so the little things do matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are particularly high in the budget talks for Democrats,
who want a rallying cry to carry into a fall campaign dominated so
far by news of White House sex. ``Many Republicans have felt that
the Democrats are searching for a theme to unite around, and they
haven't found one,'' said Jeffrey Taylor, a lobbyist for the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, many Democratic lawmakers backed a sweeping
bill that aimed to raise tobacco taxes and reduce youth smoking,
but the Republican-led Congress killed the legislation. Democrats
also rallied behind a minimum wage hike and the ``Patient Bill of
Rights,'' which would have given patients new powers when seeking
treatment through health-maintenance organizations. But those
measures died, as well.
</P>
<P>
   A new prospect arose three weeks ago, when House Republicans
approved a five-year, $80 billion tax cut, funded by future budget
surpluses. Democrats have argued that all surpluses should be
reserved until a plan is found to shore up the finances of the
Social Security program, and they argued that the Republican tax
cut would harm the popular retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans soon killed the tax plan, depriving Democrats
of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Democrats are trying to energize their base in the
election and find anything to change the subject away from the
impeachment issue,'' said Marty Dannenfelser of the Family Research
Council, a social-conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups, for their part, are pressuring Republicans
to fight during the budget talks for a House-backed provision that
would require many family planning clinics to notify parents when
minors seek abortions or contraceptives. They also want Republicans
to block a proposal that federal-employee health plans cover the
cost of contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Some lobbyists said GOP lawmakers felt increased pressure to win
on these points because Republicans have walked away from one of
their top promises to conservative groups: a cut in the so-called
``marriage penalty.'' The penalty is a feature of the tax law that
requires many married couples to pay more in income taxes than they
would if they merely lived together as two single people. A measure
to reduce the marriage penalty was part of the House's now-dead $80
billion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are hoping that they haven't disappointed
conservatives so much that they end up suppressing their vote,''
said Taylor of the Christian Coalition. ``There's no marriage
penalty relief whatsoever, and they made promises that they would
have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why budget talks have dragged on, Democratic pollster
Celinda Lake said: ``The Republicans have wanted to concentrate on
scandal ... because they thought if the election was about Bill
Clinton and morals, they were on winning issues.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the Nov. 3 balloting, lawmakers also took budget
politics to the House floor Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Republicans had led a ``do-nothing Congress''
that failed on its most basic task: approving a budget.
Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, brought a
chart to the House saying the 105th Congress featured ``the least
number of work days in decades'' and ``the least number of bills
enacted in decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, complained that Clinton has been out
raising money and disengaged from the process. Representative Mark
Souder, Republican of Indiana, said the president's team has spent
its time ``drafting apology statements'' over the Lewinsky affair,
and he read aloud Clinton's schedule Monday for a New York
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of all days since the first of the year, he wasn't
at the White House,'' said Representative Bob Livingston, chairman
of the House Appropriations Committee. ``He was concentrating on
other things, and the legislative agenda was the furthest thing
from his mind.''

A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER WHO WORKS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BROOKLYN
BRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
   (With SCI-NOBEL-MEDICINE) 
(sw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The State University of New York Health Science
Center at Brooklyn has always been a bit of an underdog among the
city's medically elite institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its groundbreaking work in the study of AIDS,
alcoholism and other illnesses, kudos most often went to hospitals
and research centers on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, like
Mount Sinai and New York University.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, SUNY Downstate, as the science center is known,
earned its boasting rights over Manhattan when Dr. Robert
Furchgott, a distinguished professor of pharmacology there,
received a Nobel Prize in Medicine, the highest recognition
possible for a body of work that most Americans would recognize
only in the form of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott, 82, is in many ways a quintessential representative
of Downstate, which had never received a Nobel Prize in Medicine
and is better known to most New Yorkers as the college that
provides doctors to Kings County Hospital Center, one of the city's
busiest and perhaps most embattled hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Several colleagues described Furchgott as modest, spending
nearly every day nibbling sandwiches and eating yogurt in his
office while poring over scientific journals, or toiling in his
laboratory, pondering the mysteries of nitric oxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal modesty stands in marked contrast to his
magnificent achievement,'' said Dr. Eugene Feigelson, the college's
dean of medicine. ``It is a source of pride for the entire
institution and to Brooklyn and is a further distinction for us and
for the State University of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to reflect on his honor, Furchgott seemed almost
dismissive. ``I was kind of surprised,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his home in Hewlett, N.Y. ``My work is sort of
old-fashioned pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it the highlight of my career?. I guess in a way, though
you don't do research to win prizes. You do it because you're
curious about what makes things tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, international attention, television cameras planted on the
front lawn, phone ringing off the hook with calls from reporters
struggling mightily to understand the subtleties of his work _
these things have tickled him.
</P>
<P>
   But his favorite moment in his entire career, he said, ``was
when we discovered that endothelial cells were necessary for
relaxation of arteries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``it was finding that the endothelium-derived
relaxing factor was nitric oxide. There have been lots of fun
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, by admission of his admirers, a serious man of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lectures were dull, onerous and droning on,'' said Eli
Friedman, a distinguished professor of medicine at SUNY Downstate
and a former student of Furchgott. ``But the content of his work
was profound and inspiring. So if one could get past the fact that
he was less than electric competition for Jackie Gleason on
television, he was very exciting and moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry and is a
professor emeritus at Downstate, won his prize for discoveries of
new properties of nitric oxide. With colleagues, he was able to
demonstrate that the gas nitric oxide can act as a messenger
molecule that tells blood vessels to relax and dilate, which lowers
blood pressure. The discovery was vital to developing the
anti-impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he won an Albert Lasker Award in basic medical
research, which is often a precursor award to the Nobel Prize.
``Everyone here will walk a little straighter and hold their head a
little higher because he is here,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Students also said Furchgott brought more credibility to their
institution. ``This will really put us on the map,'' said Matt
Kelly, 23, a Ph.D. student.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott was born in Charleston, S.C., and received a
bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of North
Carolina in 1937 and a doctorate in biochemistry from Northwestern
University in 1940. He plays golf (``not well,'' he said) and likes
to bird-watch in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what else he would like known about his career,
Furchgott said: ``Nothing really. I would like to get myself some
lunch now.''

 &HT;    Baseball's great paradox on brink of usual (dubious) greatness
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ No team has had the success of the Atlanta Braves in
the '90s, nor the failure.
</P>
<P>
   They are baseball's great paradox.
</P>
<P>
   And now they seem about to do it again: Regular-season success.
Post-season failure.
</P>
<P>
   They have won more games than any other team in the decade;
their 106 victories set a franchise record this year; yet they sit
on the edge of extinction again as this is written, down 3-1 to San
Diego in the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   In a way _ not exactly, but in a way _ they're like the football
Buckeyes. Winningest team in the Big Ten in the '90s, but
Michigan's go-fer and just one Rose Bowl in the trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has made it to the post-season every year starting in
1991, has been in four World Series, but has won once _ 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of all this, general manager John Schuerholz,
addressed the mixed blessings before Monday's Game 5 of the NLCS,
or the ``perceived lack of success,'' as he called it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' Schuerholz said. ``I don't know that
anyone can.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, he tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short series,'' he said, ``sometimes the depth and
breadth of your club isn't shown. Sometimes teams outplay you in
short series. Sometimes you don't play at your very best.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you have Lonnie Smith running the bases.
</P>
<P>
   If Lonnie Smith knew fundamental baseball, Atlanta has two World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Score tied 0-0, eighth inning, Game 7, '91 Series, Smith on
first, Terry Pendleton at the plate. Hit-and-run. Smith takes off
for second, head-down. Pendleton rips one off the fence in left
center. Smith should score easily. But he stops at second because
he isn't watching the ball and is scammed by Minnesota's middle
infielders, who are looking straight up and calling for it as if
it's a pop fly. Smith reaches third, but no farther.
</P>
<P>
   Still tied 0-0, the game goes to the 10th and the Twins win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball teams can sometimes be at their best for a short
period of time or extended period of time, 10 games, 15 games, then
all of a sudden hit a wall,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking here about this post-season. The Braves won the
last seven games of the regular season, swept the Cubs in three _ a
10-game winning streak _ then scored three runs in losing the first
three games to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've gotten to a point, and you haven't gotten over that
hump very often,'' a writer said. ``Do you feel you've done all you
can do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to that is yes,'' Schuerholz said. ``The answer to
that is yes. The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud that we've put ourselves in that position each
year,'' he said, ``which is remarkable when you think about this
crazy economic system in which we work.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is crazy enough that the Braves have $122.5 million
committed to their Big Four starting pitchers through the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
   And they're counting on those four to escape their current
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle already came through Sunday. If John Smoltz
survived Monday, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux waited for Games 6
and, possibly 7, back in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If not, the phrase ``Flop of the '90s'' will be written about
Atlanta as often as ``Team of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz had a different way of putting it. If they don't
crawl out of this hole, he'd rather the Braves' annual October
plunge be called ``The Unfinished Symphony.''

 &HT;    Alta Vista concentrates on searching vast Internet
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For now, Alta Vista is sticking with its roots
as a powerful Internet search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp., which acquired Alta Vista when it bought
Digital Equipment Corp. in June, announces today new features
designed to make it easier for PC users to get around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One new feature, called ``Ask Alta Vista,'' allows users to
phrase simple questions, such as ``Who has the cheapest air fare to
Hawaii?''
</P>
<P>
   That question will return pages of travel agencies and ticket
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said Alta Vista also recognizes common phrases or word
combinations such as ``New York,'' so searches don't return
possible cites for just one of the words.
</P>
<P>
   What Alta Vista won't be is a flashy World Wide Web portal like
Yahoo, Lycos and Excite, which have added games, stock updates and
chat to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for information and data is one of the main
reasons people go on the Internet, the growth of the medium to
include tens of millions of Web sites has made that more difficult,
Compaq senior vice president Rod Schrock said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only company still investing heavily in making
navigation more usable,'' Schrock said.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition is Alta Vista's Photo Finder's database of 10
million images, the largest available on the Web. For example, a
search Monday for ``Golden Gate Bridge'' offered more than 13,000
images, while ``Texas Capitol'' offered 4,900.
</P>
<P>
   Family Filter allows PC users to screen out objectionable
material.
</P>
<P>
   Schrock said Alta Vista averages about 12 million distinct users
a month, ranking it No. 10 among top World Wide Web sites. The goal
is to be in the top five within three years, but to reach that
level, Alta Vista will have to have broader appeal, such as news,
sports, entertainment, similar to Yahoo and other sites, Schrock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista is at www.altavista.com.

 &HT;    System scientist shares Nobel Prize
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Twenty-two years after his heretical discovery
that the common air pollutant nitric oxide is produced by almost
every cell in the body, Dr. Ferid Murad was awakened Monday at 4
a.m. at his home in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The caller was the secretary of the Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm, Sweden, who told Murad that the Nobel Prize committee
had just finished voting and had decided that Murad would share the
1998 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a delightful surprise,'' said Murad, 62, the son of an
Albanian immigrant to the United States and a professor and
chairman of the Department of Integrative Biology, Pharmacology and
Physiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Murad will share the prize, to be presented Dec. 10 in
Stockholm, with Robert Furchgott, 82, a pharmacologist at the State
University of New York at Brooklyn, and Louis Ignarro, 57, a
pharmacologist at the University of California at Los Angeles. They
also will share $978,000.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the discovery, by Murad in 1976, and the other
scientists in 1979 and 1980, that colorless, odorless nitric oxide
is essential for the relaxation of muscles and blood vessels in the
body, was highly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People then viewed the gas only as a toxic substance,'' Murad
said. ``So the work was not well received.''
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, however, the discovery has stimulated
a wide range of drug investigations for new treatments for
disorders from heart disease to cancer. The gas also plays a key
role in the wildly popular anti-impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide is not to be confused with nitrous oxide, or
laughing gas, a popular painkiller used by many dentists.
</P>
<P>
   If news of the award caught Murad in bed, it was a shocker at
the UT medical school, one of 6 health-related schools in the
15-school UT System and the home of Texas' only school of public
health. Murad's was the first Nobel Prize awarded to a tenured
faculty member in the Houston school's history.
</P>
<P>
   The school's public relations department quickly assembled an 11
a.m. news conference but, by mid-afternoon, was still laboring on
their first written news release of the day. They finally got it
out and sat Murad down for a series of telephone interviews with
out-of-town reporters about an hour before he was expected at a
faculty reception.
</P>
<P>
   The Webmaster at the school's graduate department of biomedical
sciences was quicker, getting a ``Congratulations Dr. Ferid Murad''
on the department's Internet home page well before noon.
</P>
<P>
   Murad became the eighth faculty member in the UT System to win a
Nobel Prize, since biologist H.J. Muller won the first one in 1946,
also for physiology or medicine, for work he did in the 1920s at
UT-Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are overjoyed on behalf of Dr. Murad,'' UT System
Chancellor William Cunningham said. ``He joins a distinguished
group of colleagues accross the UT System who have been similarly
recognized. (It) is a clear signal of the important stature
attained by the UT Health Science Center in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   But, although the UT System is expected to benefit in terms of
attracting new financing for research, there are limits to what it
can do. So there were no plans Monday to light the UT tower in
Austin, which is generally lit with orange lights when one of the
school's sports teams wins, said Peggy Kruger, associate director
for public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Murad, whose parents owned a restaurant in Whiting, Ind., where
he grew up, came to UT Houston from Stanford University in 1997. He
made his discovery in 1976 while on the faculty of the University
of Virginia, but he still does research on the ways in which nitric
oxide is important to health.
</P>
<P>
   He said he originally was studying the muscles of the lungs,
rather than the blood vessels, when he found that the gas, which
was then known only as a byproduct of anything that was burned, was
involved in relaxing the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked out the biochemical reactions,'' said Murad, ``and
we showed the gas's biological effects.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Furchgott and Ignarro have since then independently shown
that the gas, which is produced by most of the body's cells, acts
as a messenger carrying nerve signals that tell muscles to relax
and blood vessels to relax and widen, which lowers blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The blue, diamond-shaped Viagra pills, for instance, work by
boosting the gas's effects in the blood vessels of the penis,
triggering an erection. But the research also has permitted many
drug companies to develop common treatments for hypertension, heart
disease, shock and hardening of the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have shown that white blood cells also use the
gas to kill infectious invaders, raising hopes for new treatments
for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The work even touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish inventor of dynamite who established the prizes in his
will. Nobel had heart trouble and his doctor prescribed
nitroglycerin, an ingredient of dynamite, as a treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the Nobel Prize
citation noted.
</P>
<P>
   On average, more than 10 years passes from prize-winning
research to the receipt of the prize. So Murad's, Furchgott's and
Ignarro's prize was not unusual in that sense.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in one way. Analysts have long argued whether the
Nobels awarded for science more often honor work with practical
results or work that makes for fundamental, but not immediately
practical, advances in a particular field.
</P>
<P>
   The nitric oxide findings were both practical and fundamental
and Murad, who has a medical doctor's degree and a doctorate in
pharmacology, has a foot in each area.
</P>
<P>
   Now all he has to do is adjust to his new fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly been an exciting day,'' Murad said.

CLINTON HELPS RAISE FUNDS FOR NEW YORK DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
 YORK-CLINTON-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton came to Manhattan again Monday
night, for his third visit in the past month, this time, to raise
money for Representative Charles Schumer, who is running a
dead-heat race for the US Senate against three-term Republican
incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubles, Clinton is still a popular man in New
York. Polls show his job performance rating at 69 percent, up from
63 percent a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   At a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the New York Hilton, and earlier
at an event at a private residence, Clinton raised $1.1 million for
Schumer, which should help enormously in the three weeks left of
his media-heavy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may have a special interest in this race, as suggested
by the fact that Hillary Rodham Clinton also came here last month
to speak at a Schumer luncheon, passionately denouncing D'Amato's
voting record on health, education and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, ran the
first congressional inquiry into the Whitewater scandal, though
dropped it after nothing turned up.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more pertinent, Schumer sits on the House Judiciary
Committee, which will take the first vote on Clinton's impeachment,
if things go that far.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Labor Day, Schumer was still sitting on the fence
when it came to assessing Kenneth Starr's report, telling anyone
who asked that nobody should ``rush to judgment.'' Since then, he
has joined the vast majority of Democrats to take Clinton's side,
which, given public opinion here, may not be much of a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was absent from his own fund-raiser Monday night,
explaining via video hook-up that he had to remain in Washington to
vote on the budget and on other bills involving sexual predators
and giving tax incentives to businesses that hire welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been running TV ads that attack Schumer for, as the
ads put it, missing more votes the past 12 months than D'Amato has
missed in the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has responded to the ads, saying he had to campaign in
the hard-fought Democratic primary, but adding that he has voted
over 90 percent of the time in his 18 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that Schumer would miss a chance to stand by the
president, while raking in more than $1 million in additional
campaign funds, suggests D'Amato has struck a sensitive chord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke for 25 minutes before a crowd of 600 at the Hilton
dinner, defending Schumer's record, attacking the Republican
Congress, and urging Democrats to vote in what he called ``a
profoundly important election.''
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of his personal troubles or the impeachment
probe, though there may have been an oblique reference when he
reported having told Elliot Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for
New York attorney general, that holding that post in Arkansas ``was
the best job I ever had. I never had to hire people, fire people,
appoint them or disappoint them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing his message that he was on the job, Clinton told the
crowd that he had talked earlier in the day with Richard Holbrooke,
his emissary to Bosnia, and to Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu
and PLO chief Yasir Arafat about the peace promises in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee, however, derided this effort,
releasing a statement of sardonic congratulations to Clinton:
``Today you have hit a grand total of 100 fund-raisers for 1998. No
president in American history has spent so much time
fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, in
response, ``I'd suggest there are probably members of the
Republican leadership campaigning for Republican members of the
House Judiciary Committee.''

   Nitric oxide formed in nerve cells spreads rapidly in all
directions to activate cells in the vicinity and influence many
functions, like behavior and the mobility of the intestinal tract.
Nitric oxide is also being studied for its role in smell and
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide's role is still unfolding; scientists have written
thousands of scientific papers about it in recent years and have
started a journal, Nitric Oxide.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee cited Furchgott for performing in 1980 ``an
ingenious experiment'' that showed that a drug, acetylcholine,
widened blood vessels only if the inner layer, or endothelium, was
intact. Furchgott concluded that blood vessels widen because the
endothelial cells produce a signal molecule that he called EDRF,
for endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relaxes smooth
muscle cells in blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott's findings ``led to a quest to identify the factor,''
the citation said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The citation did not refer to an accident in Furchgott's
laboratory that played a major role in his discoveries. In 1995, in
the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott wrote
that on May 5, 1978, in the first of a series of planned
experiments on arteries from a rabbit, a technician did not follow
directions correctly. The technician performed one step of the
experiment before instead of after he was supposed to wash out a
drug used in an earlier phase of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott expected that the arteries would contract. Instead,
they relaxed. It was the first time he had seen the drugs under
study produce such a reaction, and he used the insight to plan
additional experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Furchgott omitted the technician's name in that paper and in
another in 1996 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
On Monday, he said David Davidson was the technician.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The committee cited Ignarro for concluding in 1986, from ``a
brilliant series of analyses'' conducted independently of
Furchgott, that EDRF was identical to nitric oxide. Furchgott said
he and Ignarro made the announcement at the same symposium in 1986
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., but the papers were not
published until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Murad was cited for work conducted over the years while he
worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Stanford
University in Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Murad said he felt fortunate to have heard Furchgott report his
early work on EDRF in 1980. Murad showed that a gas could regulate
important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and
related heart drugs led to the release of nitric oxide.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, Murad worked in the laboratory of Dr. Theodore Rall, who
also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman of the
University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. Gilman said in an
interview that he believed Rall, now retired and living in
Charlottesville, Va., was the first scientist to have trained two
Nobel Prize winners. In addition, Rall worked with Dr. Earl
Sutherland, who also won a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In his early reseach years, Murad worked on a chemical known as
cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out to be
critical in the nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees referred to
the early work as ``dumping experiments'' because all they could do
in the laboratory at the time was crudely add various hormones and
agents to slices of tissue, cell cultures. It took years to develop
the more refined techniques that led to the understanding of nitric
oxide's many roles in the body.
</P>
<P>
   But for many years, most of the scientific community was
skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric oxide to
activate an enzyme, Murad said in 1996 when he and Furchgott shared
the Albert Lasker basic medical research award.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Prizes were created by the will of Alfred Nobel, whose
invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine. The award
committee noted an odd twist to this year's award. When Nobel
developed chest pain from heart disease, it said, he refused to
take the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it
caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit in the
relief of chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel died in 1896. The prize that the three scientists will
share is now worth $938,000.

   Iran: Campaign Against Rushdie

<P>
   LONDON _ Salman Rushdie's chances of returning to a more normal
life were dealt a blow when an Iranian religious foundation
increased the bounty on the British author. The group, the 15th of
Khordad Foundation, said it was adding $300,000 to the $2.5 million
bounty for anyone who carried out the religious decree to kill
Rushdie, who was accused of blasphemy in his book ``Satanic
Verses.'' Last month, Iran officially dropped the threat, prompting
the British government to say it would restore diplomatic
relations.

   HOUSTON _ Six people believed to be illegal immigrants from
Mexico were hit and killed early Monday by a freight train as they
slept on a desolate stretch of tracks in southern Texas. Officials
said they believed the immigrants may have been victims of a
superstition that the rails would keep them safe from snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth that if you sleep between the rails that snakes
will not get you,'' said Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific.
``You go down the railroad tracks, you'll see snakes cut in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the driver of the train blew the whistle repeatedly
when he noticed the people on the tracks. Although a couple of the
victims raised their heads, no one got off the tracks. Davis said
he was uncertain how far the train was from the victims when the
driver saw them. But, he added, it would have taken a mile to stop
the 105-car train, which was traveling between 45 and 49 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The vast ranchlands of South Texas that stretch between the Rio
Grande and San Antonio are among the most remote in the state, mile
after mile of mesquite, prickly pear, citrus farms and grazing
lands that are a prime avenue for illegal immigrants trying to make
their way from the Mexican border to San Antonio or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While illegal immigrants have been killed while sleeping on
railroad tracks before, Fred Borrego, patrol agent in charge of the
U.S. Border Patrol in Kingsville, said never had so many been
killed in one accident. Between 2,000 and 3,000 illegal immigrants
pass through his 2,600-square-mile patrol area each month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent victims, who were badly mutilated, have not been
identified. They were taken to Corpus Christi where authorities
will try to use fingerprints to determine their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego had another possible explanation for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another theory I've been told is that in Mexico the trains
don't run at night,'' Borrego said. ``They say they sleep up there
because they feel a lot safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems implausible that people could sleep with the
noise of a train running toward them, Davis said, ``a train
operating when you're in front of it is very, very quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The engine noise is primarily to the side, he said, and there is
very little friction on the rail itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know its hard to believe,'' Borrego said. ``I've experienced
this myself. If it's coming toward you it's as quiet as a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in the Kenedy County sheriff's office speculated
that the hard traveling conditions confronted by the immigrants
could also have played a role. The terrain in the area is very
rugged, with most of it being brush covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think, `I'd never fall asleep there' or `Why wouldn't they
wake up?''' said Hopy Alines, a secretary in the sheriff's office.
``But it just doesn't happen. These people travel three, four and
five days without eating, without sleeping. They're just completely
exhausted and they don't wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally the illegal immigrants traveling through the county go
unnoticed aside from the trail of odds and ends they leave behind,
Ms. Alines said. ``You'll see empty bottles, sometimes bags of
clothes,'' she said. ``We get a lot of calls where they break in
and all they ever take is food and water.'' It is generally when
people get sick or have problems that officials hear stories like
the ones about people sleeping on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Davis estimated that four to six people a year are injured or
killed while sleeping on railroad tracks. In fact, he said, there
have been cases where people sleeping on tracks have been run over
and survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, or fortunately, they're intoxicated,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The train, which was carrying a variety of freight like scrap
paper and metal automobile parts, was traveling from Houston to
Brownsville, Texas, when the accident occurred about 3:15 a.m. near
the tiny town of Norias, which is 60 miles north of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Texas there were 38 fatalities and 80 injuries
involving what railroad officials call ``trespass accidents,''
Davis said, cases where people were struck on or near tracks or
trying to get on a railroad car.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego said the last time he could remember a large group of
illegal immigrants being killed on train tracks was in 1983 or 1984
when 14 people were killed trying to cross a railroad trestle.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials along with Union Pacific officials
caution illegal immigrants about sleeping on railroad tracks as
part of general information they provide on the dangers of crossing
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they don't get the word,'' Borrego said. ``The
conditions out here are rigid. You've got cactus, mesquite. It's no
fun walking through the territory. They run out of water, they get
bit by snakes.''

 COMPANY IN INQUIRY DONATES TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first complaints streamed in a decade ago: A
large car-leasing company on Long Island called Oxford Resources
was habitually overcharging customers. Robert Abrams, then the New
York Attorney General, accused Oxford of deceptive practices, and
the company settled in 1990 by issuing refunds, paying a $10,000
fine and pledging to change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the current Attorney General, Dennis Vacco,
investigated 10 new complaints about Oxford. This time, the inquiry
ended differently. Declining to make any allegations, Vacco chose
to settle the complaints through mediation, and his aides say that
as a result, Oxford has returned some of the money in dispute. But
the company was not forced to pay restitution or face other
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those were not Vacco's only dealings with Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, Oxford executives and a company
subsidiary gave $8,500 to Vacco's re-election campaign, according
to campaign records. And less than three weeks after Vacco closed
the investigation on Nov. 4, 1997, his campaign received an
additional $37,500 from nine Oxford subsidiaries, all on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford has close ties to Republican leaders on Long Island, but
these contributions were far larger than anything the donors had
given to Vacco or any other candidate for state office in this
decade, records show. Before 1997, the donors had given a total of
$4,750 to Vacco's re-election campaign and had not contributed to
his 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, a Buffalo-area Republican who is seeking his second term,
did not respond to several requests for an interview about Oxford,
which is now owned by Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., and called
Nationsbank Auto Leasing. Vacco is facing Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat
who is a former state prosecutor, in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions linked to Oxford are legal, unless it can be
shown that official actions were taken explicitly in return for
campaign money. Aides to Vacco said there was no connection between
the donations and the handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vacco's inquiry and the one by his predecessor, Abrams, a
Democrat, focused on similar accusations: that Oxford was assessing
excessive charges for damage to vehicles when leases expired. And
the complaints have continued. In all, Vacco's office received 48
complaints about the company in 1997, including the 10 that touched
off his inquiry. This year, with the investigation closed, the
office has received 45.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those statistics, Vacco's aides acknowledged that
Oxford had a higher rate of complaints than other car leasing
companies in the state and that the new complaints differed little
from the earlier ones. But they said Vacco's investigation had
determined that Oxford was not breaking the law, so he was limited
in the actions he could take.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid an appearance of impropriety, the attorney general has
said he has a policy of not accepting contributions from companies
under investigation by his office. Michael Zabel, a spokesman for
the Vacco campaign, said the donations linked to Oxford did not
violate that rule.
</P>
<P>
   Zabel noted that the $8,500 given during the investigation was
from Oxford's chairman, other executives and a subsidiary, not from
the company itself. He said Vacco's campaign and office did not as
a rule try to determine whether such related donors were linked to
companies under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have no way to check the list of all the
employees of various corporations, to check for the subsidiaries of
corporations,'' Zabel said. ``That's not feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money, he said, arrived after the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, corporations can give a total of no more than
$5,000 annually to all state and local candidates and party
committees, with few exceptions. By donating through its
subsidiaries, Oxford was able to get around the law, a common
strategy that many corporations follow. The Oxford subsidiaries
have names like Centrex Capital Florida and Linden Tree
Development, so their ties to the company are not readily apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pascucci, Oxford's chairman, did not respond to three
telephone messages left at his office. Gordon Turner, a spokesman
for Nationsbank, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher McKenna, a spokesman for Vacco, said the people who
complained about Oxford last year and then went to mediation under
the auspices of the attorney general's office had received money
back from the company _ on average, half of the amount in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous victory for consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McKenna declined to give more details on the settlements or
to release the names of customers who complained.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Mindell, an assistant attorney general who was one of the
officials involved in the 1997 and 1990 investigations, said Oxford
did not receive special treatment from Vacco's office. ``There was
never any pressure on me,'' Mindell said. ``I was not aware of any
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when the office began the investigation in March
1997, it believed that Oxford was violating the consumer protection
law, which requires auto leasing companies to tell customers about
their rights in challenging charges. But he said the office later
determined that its original impression was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   All Oxford's new leases are governed by the state's 1995 car
leasing statute, but to resolve the case, the company agreed that
leases signed before the law took effect would also be subject to
it, he said. Without the investigation, customers with pre-1995
leases would not have the protections in the statute, which include
the right to seek an outside arbitrator in disputes, he said. The
company also agreed that one of its executives would act as
Oxford's liaison to the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Mindell and McKenna both said they did not know why Oxford had a
higher level of complaints than other auto leasing companies in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are troubled that they have the large number of complaints
that they have,'' McKenna said. ``But looking at it carefully and
examining what they have done, we have not found anything illegal.
Maybe people from New Jersey who lease these cars happen to
complain more. What can we do? We can't go after people who are not
breaking the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vacco never publicized his inquiry and settlement with Oxford, a
national leasing and finance company with operations in many
states. The Better Business Bureau, which provides consumers with
information about companies' reputations, said it did not know that
Oxford had been investigated. Since the inquiry ended, the bureau
has received roughly 20 complaints about Oxford in New York,
officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna said he did not know why the attorney general had not
publicized the Oxford case.
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessors, Vacco has enthusiastically promoted many
of his consumer investigations and settlements. A few months before
the Oxford case ended, for example, Vacco distributed a news
release announcing that he had ``put the brakes'' on misleading
auto lease advertising by BMW of North America. In that instance,
the company settled with the attorney general by agreeing to pay a
$25,000 fine and stop the advertising in question.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has contended that his predecessors at times created a
hostile climate for businesses. He has declared that he can act as
an effective watchdog for consumers without overregulating
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, he has collected nearly $50,000 from
political action committees representing New York auto dealers, far
more than any other current candidate for statewide office,
including Gov. George Pataki, according to campaign records.
</P>
<P>
   Pascucci, Oxford's chairman, is also the owner of WLNY-TV
(Channel 55), a commercial TV station on Long Island. He has often
contributed to Republican candidates on the island, including Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, who is from Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   About six weeks after the Oxford settlement in November 1997,
Pascucci contributed $15,000 to a political action committee, New
York Salute 1998, that is controlled by D'Amato. And earlier this
year, Pascucci and other executives at Oxford gave a total of
$36,000 to another D'Amato PAC, Renew America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Pascucci and other Oxford executives gave nearly
$40,000 to D'Amato's senate campaign committee, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Lisette McSoud Mondello, a spokeswoman for D'Amato, said the
senator was a personal friend of Pascucci but was not aware of the
settlement.

EVIDENCE TO DENY 6 IRAQIS ASYLUM MAY BE WEAK, FILES SHOW
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newly declassified government documents show that
the United States has relied on weak and unsubstantiated evidence
that has never been fully investigated to imprison six Iraqi
dissidents who worked with the CIA against President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The six dissidents have been jailed for more than a year and a
half based on circumstantial accusations of espionage that the
government has never even tried to prove, according to hundreds of
pages of declassified FBI interviews and reports, as well as
formerly secret court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, removed in August 1996 by the Clinton administration
along with 600 other CIA-supported dissidents and an additional
5,000 Iraqis and Kurds as Hussein's forces attacked opposition
groups in northern Iraq, have been in legal limbo in an Immigration
and Naturalization Service center in Los Angeles since early last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In March they were denied asylum and ordered deported in a
secret hearing in which they were not allowed to see the evidence,
hear the testimony or even know the charges that were keeping them
in prison indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   But their appeal has forced the government to declassify much of
the evidence in the case, and those files show that many of the
charges stem from unsubstantiated accusations made to the FBI by
rival Iraqis combined with other fragmentary evidence like family
connections to other suspected foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
   In the documents, the FBI agents who were working on the case
acknowledged that comprehensive investigations of the accusations
were never conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying against the six, FBI agent John Cosenza said the
bureau had conducted ``interviews'' in a refugee-processing center
on Guam, where the men were first held after the evacuation, and
had not conducted formal investigations of any of the men.
</P>
<P>
   The six are Adil Hadi Awadh, Ali Yassin Mohammed Karim, Safa
Batat, Ali Jahjoh Saleh and Mohammed Jassin Tuma.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Batat, Cosenza said he might pose a security
threat to the United States, but conceded that ``without an
investigation, I would never say I was certain or uncertain,''
according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Cosenza said the FBI agents on the case had received ``source
information that, because we didn't have an investigation, we were
unable to corroborate.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI turned its files over to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, but the INS never pursued the tips passed
on by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do investigations,'' Paul Virtue, the INS general
counsel, acknowledged. ``There is a low evidentiary threshold for
finding whether someone is eligible for asylum here. It is wholly
unlike a criminal case where the burden is on the government to
prove someone has committed an offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS asserts that it has the right to deny the Iraqis asylum
without the normal due process required under law because they
arrived here without visas and have never been officially allowed
to enter the United States. The lawyer for the Iraqis, R. James
Woolsey, a former director of Central Intelligence, counters that
the six men were brought to this country in an airlift sponsored by
the U.S. government, and so should not be treated as if they were
illegal immigrants caught sneaking across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents came from two crushed CIA-backed groups, the
Iraqi National Congress and the Iraqi National Accord, that had
been involved in United States-backed covert action programs. The
CIA suspected that both groups had been thoroughly penetrated by
Iraqi double agents, and passed on some evidence against the six
men to the immigration court that remains classified. But the
agency never insisted that the FBI and INS conduct thorough
investigations to determine if they had identified the right
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Karim, for example, seems to have been a victim of guilt by
association. An FBI report notes that his cousin, Aras Habib
Muhamad Ufayli, who had been the chief of intelligence for the
Iraqi National Congress, had a ``well-documented connection to
Iranian intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Dec. 30, 1996, FBI report documenting the connection said
that ``no further review by the FBI will be conducted'' to
determine whether Karim was a spy himself.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the government simply did not believe the alibis offered
by the Iraqis, the documents show. To prove that he was a true
enemy of Hussein, Batat told the FBI that he had been poisoned with
thallium, a rat poison, by an Iraqi spy, and had been hospitalized
in London. But FBI agent Thomas Graney testified that Batat's
treatment for thallium poisoning might have been a sham, and that
``trace information'' provided to the FBI suggested that his use of
rat poison ``appears to be recreational.'' Graney added that ``a
number of walk-ins'' in the refugee processing camp in Guam had
identified Batat as an Iranian agent.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Marik, a former CIA officer who worked in the agency's
covert programs in Iraq, warns that the case is certain to damage
the CIA's ability to recruit foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of the six,'' Marik said, ``is this: if the going
gets tough, the friends of the U.S. could well end up in a U.S.
jail.''

UPCOMING BOOK TO PROVIDE GRIST AT MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wash.)   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by
two business school professors will be a crucial part of its
defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week. But
judging from an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice
Department and 20 states that are suing the software giant will
find support for their arguments in the book as well.
</P>
<P>
   To cite one example, Microsoft contends that its
industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet
Explorer browser are a single integrated product. In its suit, the
government asserts that they are two separate products that
Microsoft bundled together to get an unfair edge over its rival,
Netscape Communications Corp., in the market for software used to
browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its
Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management
and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a
Microsoft executive as saying that only with the third version of
Microsoft's browser was it integrated with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hurried its first browser offerings into the market,
the book says, in its race to catch up with Netscape, then took a
more ambitious approach with Internet Explorer 3.0, which was
introduced in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In that version it changed its software design to use
programming modules, or components, that could be put together and
rearragned like building blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, is quoted
as saying, ``IE 3.0 was the key thing because we did the
componentized browser,'' He added, ``We really made Internet
Explorer part of the Windows platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing could be legally significant because in its suit the
government cites as evidence requests before August 1996 by
personal computer makers that wanted to load Netscape's browser on
their machines instead of Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied the
requests, insisting its browers and Windows were a single,
integrated product.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new
book last month, by issuing a subpoena to a Netscape executive who
was given a confidential copy by the authors to review. Microsoft
has also sought the transcripts of 44 current and former Netscape
employees interviewed by the authors.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Boston last week denied Microsoft access to
that research materials, but the company may appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The new book, published by the Free Press imprint of Simon &AMP;
Schuster, is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within
days of the start of the Microsoft trial on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   But already, a few quotes from Netscape executives have leaked
out. The authors decided to send the complete manuscript to The New
York Times and three other news organizations Monday, so that the
material could be read in context.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that
Netscape's troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather
than from any alleged predatory practices by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The book does detail where Netscape stumbled, shifting its
strategy too often and running into obstacles in its software
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In private antitrust suits, the argument that the competitor was
his own worst enemy is an established defense. But legal experts
say that defense may well be far less effective in a federal case
in which the government is seeking court-mandated changes in
Microsoft's business practices rather than the monetary damages
that are the goal of plaintiffs in private cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes is a
total sideshow,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in
the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the
Brookings Institution. ``But Microsoft has a big legal team, and it
seems they are working on every defense they can find.''
</P>
<P>
   The book quotes a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as
saying the company bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the
browser business from America Online Inc. But that was a
second-chance to do a deal with America Online, the leading online
service.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996,
when America Online chose Internet Explorer as its preferred
browser; in that bargain Microsoft agreed to place a startup icon
for the online service on the main Windows desktop screen _ the
prime real estate in computing.
</P>
<P>
   For a book entitled ``Competing on Internet Time,'' it is
intriguing that one of its central themes is that Netcape got too
wedded to the notion that the Internet revolution would change
everything quickly. Microsoft, by contrast, stuck to its three-year
planning horizon that enabled the company, the authors write, to
``mesh its short-run tactical plans with a broader strategic view
of how to win the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The book quotes Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, as saying,
``The fact of the matter is that customers can't take cataclysmic
change every three months. The organization also can't. You can
ship products quickly. But you can't say, `Oh, we have a radically
new strategy' every three months.''

2 TOP EXECUTIVES OF TRIARC SEEK TO TAKE COMPANY PRIVATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move that surprised many on Wall Street, two top
executives of Triarc Cos., which owns Snapple and Mistic beverage
lines as well as several restaurant franchises, have made a bid to
take Triarc private.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Monday that it had formed a committee to
evaluate the proposal. It will consist of three outside directors,
who had not been chosen late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives, Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May, who together
control about six million Triarc shares, or 26 percent of the
total, offered $18 for each outstanding share. Triarc's stock
closed at $13.1875 on Friday, and the news Monday pushed the price
up $3, to $16.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they thought that Peltz, Triarc's chairman
and chief executive, regarded the stock as undervalued, and because
of that, decided to take it private with a new share offering
likely several years from now. May is the president and chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be enormous frustration,'' said Andrew Conway, a
beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who has
recommended Triarc to clients. ``Nelson and Peter bought into this
company five years ago at about $12 a share, and the stock on
Friday was a dollar above what it was when they bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   All that was despite significant changes at Triarc in the last
couple of years. In May 1997, Triarc acquired Snapple for $300
million from the Quaker Oats Co. Quaker had paid $1.7 billion for
the brand in 1994, which had a wide following among young people in
particular. The momentum reversed under the new management, and
Quaker put it up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a very astute purchase with Snapple, and they have
halted the decline there and are repositioning Snapple to grow,''
said Martin Romm, a beverage analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Triarc also disposed of certain assets to clean up its balance
sheet. Among those were 355 Arby's restaurants, sold to a unit of
RTM of Atlanta for $73 million last year. Triarc then became
strictly a franchiser of restaurants, collecting $39 million in
operating income this year from royalties on meals sold, Conway
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Triarc issued an earnings warning last month saying its
third-quarter income would be lower because of higher taxes and
other unusual factors.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock price soared to $27 in May and fell back to $21 in
July. But it was the most recent drubbing that led to the
announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got very low interest rates, you've got an environment
which is not fully reflecting the value of Triarc, and they are
entrepreneurs,'' Romm said. ``They are trying to drive value.''

MEDIA METRIX PLANS MERGER WITH RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ga.)   (af)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another sign that even cyberspace may not be big
enough for all of the companies that have sprouted up hoping to
profit from the Internet, the two largest companies that measure
the audience size of World Wide Web sites have agreed to merge.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix, based in New York, will take over Relevant
Knowledge, its Atlanta-based archrival. Both companies are
privately held, and the financial terms of the all-stock deal were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Each company publishes a list of the 25 most heavily trafficked
Web sites and sells detailed information to advertisers and
Internet publishers for $50,000 a year and up.
</P>
<P>
   But the services created as much confusion as insight, because
their ratings were often vastly different from each other and from
the internal measurements taken by the Web sites themselves. And
with both companies spending heavily to install their measurement
software on the computers of thousands of Internet users, neither
has been profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we have gotten into this business, the more we
understood that neither company was going to beat the other into
submission,'' said Jeff Levy, the chief executive of Relevant
Knowledge, who had been steering his company toward a public stock
offering. ``This would have been a long and bloody battle that
would not be good for either company or the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes as other recent mergers suggest that a falling
market for technology stocks is making success on the Internet
harder than it once seemed. Last week, Bertelsmann AG agreed to buy
half of Barnes &AMP; Noble's Internet book store rather than start its
own. N2K and CDNow, the two largest online music stores, are
expected to announce a merger soon.
</P>
<P>
   As smaller Internet firms merge to remain viable and to
eliminate competition, a few of the largest online companies are
using acquisitions to extend their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for example, Yahoo agreed to exchange $29.6 million in
stock for Yoyodyne, an Irvington company that specializes in e-mail
contests and other promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Mallett, Yahoo's chief operating officer, said that the
fall of tech stocks has created a buyer's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has brought a lot of things to our front door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers and publishers alike praised the rating-services
merger, saying it would help reduce the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard to understand why 10 of the top 25 sites
rated by Media Metrix weren't on Relevant Knowledge's Top 25
list,'' said Rich Lefurgy, the chairman of Internet Advertising
Bureau, a trade group. ``By bringing together the two companies we
will have more credible information.''

 Following Their Destiny: Lucas Proteges Leave Empire, Start
Own  Firms   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A long time ago, a filmmaker named George Lucas made a movie called
``Star Wars.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' begat sequels, and toys and books. And the ``Star
Wars'' empire begat a corporate kingdom for Lucas, a constellation
of companies that he established in rural Marin County, far from
the Hollywood madness.
</P>
<P>
   And as Lucas hired people who shared his vision, his Lucasfilm
Ltd. begat corporate spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the spin-offs are the traditional sort _ business units
that split off to form new companies, such as Pixar, a division
that Lucas sold to Steve Jobs, which is now a publicly traded
animation studio. But most of the spin-offs are led by
entrepreneurs, hired and inspired by Lucas, who then go on to
establish their own companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``George and the company want to encourage people to find their
destiny,'' said Gordon Radley, president of Lucasfilm.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm is the umbrella organization for Lucas' various
enterprises including Skywalker Sound, Industrial Light and Magic
(special effects), THX (theater sound systems), LucasArts
Entertainment (computer games) and Lucas Learning (educational
software).
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every division of Lucasfilm has spawned spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   The people who once led DroidWorks, which has since evolved into
Lucas' post-production facility, Skywalker Sound, ultimately
started Sonic Solutions, a public company in Novato that makes the
technology to produce digital video discs _ an alternative to
videocassettes and CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucasfilm is a great seeding ground for people,'' said Bob
Doris, a co-founder and the chief executive of Sonic Solutions.
``Lucasfilm is primarily a film production company. If you're
interest is, as ours was, developing technology, developing tools,
it's better not to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. Chairman and chief executive Bill Gates sparked
a similar phenomenon in the Seattle area, where many former
Microsoft employees have started companies known as ``Baby Bills.''
Lucas' progeny are strewn up and down the West Coast, but many make
their home in Marin and elsewhere around the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are self-employed and tap into a network of fellow
Lucas alumni. Noah Falstein, one of the early employees at
Lucasfilm's games division, says his business, the Inspiracy,
sometimes hires other Lucas alumni and is sometimes hired by other
alums.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gilbert, whom Falstein hired at the game division that
ultimately became LucasArts Entertainment Co., went on to found
Humongous Entertainment, a Seattle software company, with fellow
LucasArts alum Shelley Day.
</P>
<P>
   GT Interactive Software Corp. bought Seattle's Humongous in 1996
for $76 million, and Day and Gilbert still run it _ and have hired
Falstein on certain projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a typical science fiction nerd,'' said Falstein, 41,
whose home office in Greenbrae features posters from his Lucasfilm
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood in line for six hours when `Return of the Jedi' opened
at one minute after midnight. The chance to work there was an
incredible dream, and really exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Addicted to Yoda
</P>
<P>
   For many star-struck ``Star Wars'' fans, the notion of leaving
Lucasfilm is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Gresko, who left the LucasArts Entertainment Co. with some
colleagues to form Nihilistic, a Novato computer games company,
said there was a phrase for workers who were particularly rabid
devotees of Lucas. ``We'd say, `He's got his Yoda jammies,' ''
Gresko said.
</P>
<P>
   Working at Lucas companies does have its perks. Skywalker Ranch,
set amid the hills of western Marin, has four top-notch dining
halls for employees and visitors, a health club, jogging trails and
a trophy case stocked with stunning memorabilia, such as Indiana
Jones' famous bullwhip. Walk into Industrial Light and Magic's
central San Rafael offices, and the first thing you see is a
life-size ``Star Wars'' storm trooper standing sentry at the front
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Many star employees stay with Lucas for years, including
legendary effects wizard Dennis Muren and sound designer Ben Burtt,
who worked on the first ``Star Wars'' movie. ``In terms of major
production studios, Lucas probably has a much tighter, close-knit,
stay-with-the-family program than any other studio around,'' said
Michael Moon, who heads a research firm, Gistics, in Larkspur.
</P>
<P>
   New Worlds to Conquer
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Luke Skywalker struck out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do at Lucasfilm is under the shadow of George
Lucas, and sometimes you have the desire to go off and do something
yourself,'' said Falstein, the game-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Williams, who was one of ILM's star computer animators,
said he left when the films no longer seemed fresh and new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to work on any more Muppet movies,'' Williams
said. ``I saw it deteriorating when it turned into a sequel
factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was known as a colorful character at ILM, with a bad
boy biker persona and a reputation for pushing the special effects
envelope on films like ``Terminator 2,'' ``Jurassic Park'' and
``The Mask.''
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the few who talk about ILM with any bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't room for rebels any more,'' Williams said of
ILM's evolution into a 1,000-person company. ``It'll take a rebel
movement to shake them out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Williams left with Clint Goldman and Mark Dippe, forming a
cheekily named production firm, Pull Down Your Pants Pictures, in
San Francisco. The trio collaborated on last year's hit ``Spawn,''
and between movies they work on commercials at Complete
Pandemonium, a San Francisco film and video production company.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Jim Morris, president of Lucas Digital, which includes ILM,
shrugged off Williams as one of many people who left to ``pursue
other stuff we don't really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Lucas legend now in business for himself is Tomlinson
Holman, the man who led Lucas' theater sound company, THX. The Web
site for Holman's Southern California company, TMH Corp., maintains
that the initials THX stand for ``Tomlinson Holman's Experiment,''
although a THX spokeswoman says they refer to Lucas's first feature
film, the obscure ``THX 1138.''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders in the effects industry who made their names at
ILM include Scott Ross, one of the co-founders of Digital Domain in
Southern California; Richard Edlund, whose Boss Film Studios went
belly up last year; and Phil Tippett, whose Berkeley company
Tippett Studios employs 125 people and continues to work with ILM
on select projects.
</P>
<P>
   For Tippett, working at ILM was a ``dream come true.'' In his
telling, ``a 35-year-old millionaire gave us carte blanche,'' and
the young wild-eyed effects whizzes created some of the most
popular movies in history.
</P>
<P>
   Another ILM spin-off was formed 10 years ago by Craig Barron,
Mike Pangrazio and Christine Demkowicz, who made matte paintings
that serve as backgrounds in films. Their 12-person company, Matte
World, is tucked in a Novato office park.
</P>
<P>
   Hatching New Firms
</P>
<P>
   Lucas likes to incubate companies, Radley said. Sometimes those
companies stay in the fold, like the Lucas Learning division that
formed last year and is now releasing its first educational
software products.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes those companies don't fit and spin off on their own.
Tom Kobayashi was the general manager of Skywalker Sound when he
hit on a new business idea, setting up fiber optic networks to send
high-quality video and audio great distances.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was used to record Frank Sinatra's ``Duets''
album, even though Sinatra wasn't in the same studio as most of his
musical partners.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas didn't want to be in that business, but he let Kobayashi
form his own company to exploit the technology while he was still
running Skywalker Sound.
</P>
<P>
   About nine months later, Kobayashi left Skywalker and took his
company, EDNet, to San Francisco. EDNet is traded on Nasdaq,
employs 25 people and had sales of $4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling there was, you should move on,'' Kobayashi said.
``Lucasfilm will always be (Lucas') company. If you want to do it
on your own, that's encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   ILM has retained two of its brightest stars by letting them
follow their inner entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   John Knoll and Scott Squires are two of the three visual effects
supervisors working on ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' Lucas' forthcoming prequel. They're also software
wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll and his brother Thomas Knoll developed the best-selling
Photoshop imaging software, which they licensed to Adobe Systems.
They continue to create products under the Knoll Software label.
</P>
<P>
   Squires, 41, who developed a software called Commotion that
simplifies special effects work so it can be done on inexpensive
computers, started Puffin Designs, a 22-person company in
Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   Squires offered the software to Lucasfilm, but it didn't really
fit with other company offerings, so _ with Lucas's blessing _ he
formed his own firm.

SERBS MAKE CONCESSIONS AS NATO ALLIES APPROVE BOMBING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite and expand by 1200 words)  (Eds: See also KOSOVO-RUSSIA) 
(mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The United States and its allies early
Monday approved an order opening the way for NATO to begin a
bombing campaign in the Serbian province of Kosovo in four days'
time. But White House officials said an agreement with the Yugoslav
president appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The ``activation order'' passed here Monday at a meeting of NATO
was clearly aimed more at keeping maximum diplomatic pressure to
bear on President Slobodan Milosevic, than at preparing for
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American and NATO officials said Monday that America's
special envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, had made
significant progress with Milosevic, and ``has much of what we're
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president has agreed to end all police and military
operations in Kosovo, withdraw forces in a verifiable way and make
a unilateral statement pledging partial autonomy to the province,
American officials said. He also appears ready to allow a force of
2,000 monitors, mostly civilian, into Kosovo. NATO diplomats,
however, said that some differences remained over the exact makeup
of the international mission that would go into Kosovo to verify an
agreement. Milosevic's reluctance to promise cooperation with
international war-crimes investigations was also an outstanding
issue, they said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded with guarded optimism to the latest
offer of commitments from Milosevic. ``As I have said before, we
would prefer to resolve this crisis peacefully,'' he said on Monday
night. ``If fully implemented _ and that is a critical and very big
if _ these commitments could achieve the international community's
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Balkan graveyards are filled with Milosevic's broken
promises,'' Clinton said in New York after a fund-raising event.
``We will remain ready to take military action if Milosevic fails
to make good on his commitments this time.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO stipulated that 96 hours had to elapse before a first phase
of military action could begin. Earlier drafts had spoken of 48
hours, and Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, said the
extension reflected the fact that ``after analysis of the progress
made, we wanted to give a longer chance to negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO decision was made after Holbrooke unexpectedly
interrupted his marathon negotiations with Milosevic in Belgrade to
come to Brussels and brief NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed more clout behind the negotiating process, and this
NATO decision provides it,'' a NATO diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   After briefing NATO, Holbrooke returned immediately to Belgrade
to continue his talks with Milosevic, whose crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo has driven the Clinton
administration to the conviction that only the credible threat of
force could end the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not NATO does use force, an important precedent
appears to have been set by Monday's decision. In effect, NATO
implied that without an explicit U.N. Security Council resolution
authorizing force, it has the right, in certain circumstances, to
intervene in the internal affairs of a European nation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NATO order approved Monday, command of more than 400
aircraft and other materiel that might be used against Yugoslavia
was formally transferred from NATO member countries to the
alliance's commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark. Technically,
NATO is now ready to begin a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But any military strike _ likely to begin with cruise missile
attacks on Yugoslavia's air defenses _ would be delayed at least 96
hours. This four-day period was favored by several European nations
in NATO that remain deeply uneasy about the idea of air strikes
against Yugoslavia, NATO diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The two outstanding issues _ the make-up of a monitoring force
and war crimes _ are very sensitive to the the Serbian leader. His
rise to power a decade ago was based on his clamorous crusade on
behalf of the Serbs of Kosovo, who are far outnumbered in a
province that is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   If a Western military force is allowed into Kosovo, the
sovereignty of Serbia will appear compromised in the very place
that many Serbs regard as the heart of the nation's being because
it was the center of its medieval empire.
</P>
<P>
   If war crimes investigators are allowed into Serbia, the huge
police force that forms the core of Milosevic's power and has been
central to the repression in Kosovo would be enraged. It is unclear
whether Milosevic could afford to lose so important a buttress of
his power.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke declined to address those issues publicly during his
brief stay in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   But he held talks here with the Polish foreign minister,
Branislaw Geremek, on the possibility that the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe might organize the monitors to
be deployed in Kosovo in the event of an agreement. Poland holds
the rotating presidency of the 29-nation organization.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Holbrooke is discussing a group of about
2,000 international monitors, overwhelmingly civilian, largely
unprotected and under the auspices of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation, whose members include Russia. Such an arrangement
might placate Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of NATO troops would also be engaged, largely in
intelligence-gathering and in flight duties, and some of them would
be on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   American troops would play a role in that monitoring by NATO, a
senior American official said, but largely from the air. ``No one
anticipates American troops on the ground at this point,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   How an unarmed group of civilians could effectively verify
Serbian compliance with an promise to end its crackdown in an
atmosphere charged with violence and resentment was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected visit to NATO headquarters by Holbrooke appeared
to reflect a growing concern and irritation among America's allies
that they had not been sufficiently briefed on the talks in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1995 Dayton negotiations that ended the Bosnian war,
European governments were infuriated by what they saw as
Holbrooke's failure to keep them sufficiently informed or involved.
Diplomats here said similar irritation had begun to emerge before
Holbrooke's visit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Albanians, whose autonomy was quashed by
Milosevic in the late 1980s, now want independence from Serbia and
a guerrilla army has been fighting with limited but often ruthless
means to press this demand. The United States has said that it
favors restored autonomy for the Albanians but that it does not
support their independence.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday that Milosevic was ready to agree
to a unilateral statement granting limited autonomy to ethnic
Albanians in the areas of local government, schools and policing
and promising a full review of the province's status in three
years' time.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the Albanians would respond to such a
statement, but it appeared well short of their aims. About 250,000
ethnic Albanians have been driven from their homes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said the ``activation order'' approved Monday
might remain in place for some time, even if an agreement is
reached, because it would serve as important backing for Western
attempts to monitor the pledges made by Milosevic in any accord.
</P>
<P>
   The demands on Milosevic were spelled out in a U.N. Security
Council resolution passed on Sept. 23, but the resolution did not
refer specifically to the use of force in the event of Milosevic's
failure to comply.
</P>
<P>
   This omission, necessary because Russia would does not support
the use of force against its Eastern Orthodox allies in Serbia, has
caused concern among some European nations as to the legal basis
for a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany and Italy, both between governments, gave formal
backing Monday to NATO's move toward the use of force. Like other
Western governments, however, they would prefer a peaceful
resolution to a crisis that risks undermining painstaking efforts
by NATO to establish a cooperative relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia reiterated its opposition Monday, saying any attack on
Yugoslavia would be a ``tragic mistake.'' The Russian
representatives to NATO was called back to Moscow for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO put the last political piece in place for a bombing
campaign, its military preparations continued. At the Aviano NATO
air base in Italy, A-10 Thunderbolt ground-attack aircraft arrived
Monday, the latest in a buildup of 260 American planes. NATO allies
have pledged 170 planes, making a total force of 430.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has said the first targets would be Yugoslavia's air
defenses, which would almost certainly be attacked by cruise
missiles launched from B-52 bombers that have already arrived in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's air-defense system is extensive, a reflection of
its obsession during the Cold War with possible attack by either
the Soviet Union or the West. Its arsenal includes 1,850
anti-aircraft guns and a variety of Soviet-made surface-to-air
missiles, some of which were used against allied planes during the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here said any military campaign would be calibrated to
leave open to Milosevic the possibility of compromise at any
moment. Initial strikes would be limited, but the campaign could
extend in phases to target strategic roads and bridges, military
garrisons, key roads and bridges, air bases and military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday whether each successive phase would have
to be approved by NATO's national representatives.
</P>
<P>
   With a long warning over a possible attack, the Yugoslav army
has already tried to hide much of its aircraft. NATO officials said
very few of Yugoslavia's 65 MIG-21s and 15 MIG-29s remained at air
bases, and the majority have been hidden in bunkers. It is unclear
whether Yugoslavia would fight back in the event of attack.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for a possible attack, Germany and Britain Monday
closed their embassies in Belgrade. Other nations, including the
United States, reduced their presence to a skeletal staff. The
Clinton administration, fearing reprisals, also ordered American
officials to leave the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia.

   NEW YORK _ The pitcher who will try to guide the Yankees into
the World Series on Tuesday night sat in an empty clubhouse with a
cup of coffee Monday afternoon and basically invited a mass of
reporters over for a baseball discussion. He was determined,
nostalgic and relaxed. David Cone sounded ready.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment 11 months ago when Cone tossed his first
rehabilitation pitches on the deck of a cruise ship, the thought of
pitching on a night such as Tuesday night, in Game 6 of the
American League Championship Series, has propelled him. Now Cone
and the Yankees are on the precipice of continuing this marvelous
ride because they will soar into the World Series if they conquer
the Indians on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lucky to be in this position,'' Cone said. ``This could
be the last one. Every year I say it, but it's true. This is
something that could be the last run. Who knows what this team is
going to look like next year? What kind of year we're going to
have? Whose going to be back? Right here, right now is what it's
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for these Yankees, who lead the ALCS, three games to
two, who are trying to erase the Indians before an always tense
Game 7, and who are chasing baseball history. The Yankees won 114
games during the regular season, more than every club in history
except the 1906 Cubs. Obviously, the Yanks are favored to win a
World Series title, and they do not want to wait until Wednesday to
try to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win,'' Derek Jeter said. ``We never want to go into
a situation where we think we can win one of two. We'll treat
tomorrow like it's Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking evenly and purposefully, Cone said: ``We know in the
back of our minds, we don't want it to go to a Game 7. We also know
in the back of our minds, we're onto a special season, and we want
to close this thing out.''
</P>
<P>
   That is up to Cone. Manager Joe Torre aligned his rotation
around Cone, allowing the 35-year-old to start Games 2 and 6 so
that he could have five days of rest, or one extra day, before
Tuesday night's contest. It could be a serious advantage,
considering Cone has a 1.57 earned run average in starts in which
he has had five or more days of rest since May. Tuesday night, he
works with more rest and with a self-imposed sense of purpose about
his status as a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow night,'' Cone said, ``is going to be a defining
moment in my career as a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone offered this line as a climax to an affirmative answer
about whether he wants to be remembered as a Yankee. If Cone wins
Tuesday night's rematch against Charles Nagy, who held New York to
one run in Game 2, it will enhance his legacy. It would also allow
Cone to eliminate some of the sting he felt after being pounded in
Game 1 of the division series against the Indians last season and
then not pitching in Game 5 because of his aching right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've probably put more trust in David in the three
years I have been here than in any other pitcher,'' Torre said of
the right-hander, who is 1-0 with an 0.66 ERA in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll the Yankees clubhouse, stop the first player you see and
ask him who he would want pitching a possible clinching game, and
the answer would usually be Cone. Even David Wells, who could be a
better choice this season, picked Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want it any other way,'' Wells said. ``I think he
deserves the situation he's put in. It's for a reason. He's meant
for this kind of stuff. It's up to him to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone called Tuesday night's start a reward for rebounding from
shoulder surgery 361 days ago. No one knew how much Cone would
boost the Yankees this season, but he won 20 games in the regular
season, he has won one more in the post-season, and he is trying to
win the most important game of the season Tuesday night.
``Everybody is aware that we've got a chance to carve out our own
little piece of history here, to carve our own little niche,'' Cone
said. ``Not only in Yankee history, but in baseball history. But we
don't dwell on it. We don't talk about it very much. But everybody
knows about it.''

JAPANESE AGREE ON STEPS TO REVITALIZE FAILING BANKING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (See also ASIA-ECON, ECONOMY-ASSESS) 
(sw) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's Parliament approved landmark banking legislation
on Monday that will allow the government to nationalize failing
banks, and Japan's political parties announced that they had
reached a new accord to provide several hundred billion dollars in
new money to try to revive the banking system and set the country
on a path toward economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord, reached between Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic Party and most of the opposition forces, could lead to
the injection of huge amounts of public money _ more than $400
billion, or four times as much as is now available _ into the
nation's banks. The Liberal Democrats hope that the political
alliance holds long enough for them to win passage in the
Parliament for the new accord by Friday, when the current session
ends.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a way out of the financial crisis sent stocks
surging on Monday, with shares of the nation's banks jumping an
average of 8 percent. The Nikkei index of 225 shares rose 5.24
percent, to 13,555.01, in a big comeback after last week's sudden
plunge. U.S. markets also rose on optimism about a solution to
Japan's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like the wheels on both sides of a car,'' Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi said at a news conference, referring to the
two pieces of legislation. ``When both of them pass the Parliament,
it will mean that we can send out a clear and strong message to the
world that a global depression will absolutely not begin in
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The law enacted by Parliament on Monday allows the government to
deal with large, failing banks by nationalizing them, liquidating
them or transforming them into publicly owned ``bridge banks,''
which take over the good loans and good borrowers and try to
collect on the bad loans. It would establish a public institution
to buy the good assets to resell them later and to collect the bad
loans in a process also used by the American Resolution Trust
Corp., which helped clean up the savings and loan crisis in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The accord announced on Monday night by the political parties,
if enacted and carried out, would amount to a bold attempt to
revive lending by cash-strapped banks and thus bolster an economic
recovery. With Japan's economy in its deepest recession since World
War II, the recent wild gyrations in the stock market and the
recent sudden and sharp surge in the yen against the dollar,
politicians have become a bit jittery that the financial crisis
both here and abroad could worsen and that the economy could sink
even further.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton administration officials said they were
encouraged by the new legislation, but were still waiting for the
Japanese government to carry out the steps and deal forcefully with
its economic and financial problems. The United States has grown
increasingly impatient with Japan for failing to clean up its
banking system and revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were also skeptical, partly because Japan has
announced agreements in the past, only to have them collapse later.
One key criticism has been the worry that Japan's major banks will
not apply for an injection of taxpayers' money, particularly if it
means they will be punished through controls on management or
reductions in shareholder capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, the main opposition to the new accord, has
demanded that the government force the banks to take public money.
Politicians did not disclose details of the new accord, but after
the Democratic Party protested, the Liberal Democrats decided to
bolster the amount of the bailout.
</P>
<P>
   For many, Japan is at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japan is able to adjust, it can become a locomotive to pull
Asia out of its troubles,'' said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist
at Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific, at a conference on Monday in
Singapore. ``Otherwise, it could become a Titanic that pulls the
rest of Asia under.''
</P>
<P>
   The new accordis intended to provide banks with sorely needed
new capital. Though no amounts were specified, politicians say the
accord could provide between $435 billion and $520 billion, or
about 10 percent of annual economic output. The money would not
necessarily be spent all in one year. International banks could
receive taxpayers' money if they agree to absorb another failing
institution, if there is a severe credit contraction or if more
capital is needed for a merger.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank of Japan, the nation's
central bank, warned officials in Washington recently that all the
banks were short of capital and that the resulting credit squeeze
had helped stifle economic recovery. With a weak capital base,
large international Japanese banks have been trimming their lending
to meet capital requirements set by the Bank for International
Settlements. Banks with only domestic business must conform to
government rules.
</P>
<P>
   The international banks say they currently meet those standards,
but just as troublesome is the level of equity capital _ a narrower
measure of capital _ that could absorb real losses arising from
writing off unrecoverable loans. The amount of the nation's bad
debt could be anywhere from $670 billion to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tumbling stock market, which is flirting with
13-year lows, hurts the level of capital at the banks. Recent
banking proposals by politicians highlight just how low the levels
of capital could tumble at the banks if their bad loans were dealt
with right away.
</P>
<P>
   According to the guidelines in one proposal, the core amount of
equity capital at the banks could fall by nearly one half if the
top 19 banks disposed of problem loans in line with internal
findings of the Bank of Japan. The Democratic Party and others have
demanded that the banks address these problem loans by setting
aside a portion of profits to absorb losses in the expectation that
one-fifth of these loans go bad, a proportion based on the findings
by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty, however, is that most banks contend that these
loans are currently in fine shape, and they have created virtually
no cushion of profits for them.
</P>
<P>
   The precarious level of capital is why many analysts are calling
on the politicians to put the money in first and then tackle the
rebuilding of the sticky principles that govern the system. For
years, analysts and economists here and abroad have been demanding
greater financial disclosure, tougher accounting standards and more
market-oriented rules in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for disclosure,'' said Ryuji Konishi, a former bank
executive who now teaches economics at Tokyo University. ``But this
is not a time of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Chikara Sakaguchi, a member of Parliament and a leader in the
New Peace Party, has said that his party supports the Liberal
Democrats' bill. Yoshio Suzuki, a senior member in the Liberal
Party, which was instrumental in Monday night's agreement, said
that the Liberal Party would also vote to pass the bill and that
the bill was assured passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have finally succeeded in establishing a scheme which is
essential to overcome the present financial crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with the bills, though. Some senior
bankers say that Japan may be passing up the chance to make the
financial system and its institutions much more competitive through
the kind of change that can only emerge from a crisis. In the words
of one Japanese banker, Japan needs ``hands of the devil and the
heart of a Buddha,'' so that painful revamping may be done now to
bring long term benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the Liberal Democrats' version is barely
different from the plan that is being replaced because of
opposition from the Democratic Party. Under that plan, Japan's
banks received public money worth about 1.8 trillion yen, or $15.7
billion, in March, but the plan failed to inspire worldwide
confidence in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pessimistic,'' said Katsuya Okada, a parliamentary
member for the Democratic Party, the main opposition whose views
are being edged out of the second set of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy and the method are not so clear yet. It seems
as though the government is forcing the vote.''
</P>

 BRUSSELS, Belgium: Holbrooke's visit. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A majority of the Albanians, whose autonomy was quashed by
Milosevic in the late 1980s, now want independence from Serbia and
a guerrilla army has been fighting with limited but often ruthless
means to press this demand. The United States has said that it
favors restored autonomy for the Albanians but that it does not
support their independence.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday that Milosevic was ready to agree
to a unilateral statement granting limited autonomy to ethnic
Albanians in the areas of local government, schools and policing
and promising a full review of the province's status in three
years' time.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the Albanians would respond to such a
statement, but it appeared well short of their aims. About 250,000
ethnic Albanians have been driven from their homes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said the ``activation order'' approved Monday
might remain in place for some time, even if an agreement is
reached, because it would serve as important backing for Western
attempts to monitor the pledges made by Milosevic in any accord.
</P>
<P>
   The demands on Milosevic were spelled out in a U.N. Security
Council resolution passed on Sept. 23, but the resolution did not
refer specifically to the use of force in the event of Milosevic's
failure to comply.
</P>
<P>
   This omission, necessary because Russia would does not support
the use of force against its Eastern Orthodox allies in Serbia, has
caused concern among some European nations as to the legal basis
for a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany and Italy, both between governments, gave formal
backing Monday to NATO's move toward the use of force. Like other
Western governments, however, they would prefer a peaceful
resolution to a crisis that risks undermining painstaking efforts
by NATO to establish a cooperative relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia reiterated its opposition Monday, saying any attack on
Yugoslavia would be a ``tragic mistake.'' The Russian
representatives to NATO was called back to Moscow for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO put the last political piece in place for a bombing
campaign, its military preparations continued. At the Aviano NATO
air base in Italy, A-10 Thunderbolt ground-attack aircraft arrived
Monday, the latest in a buildup of 260 American planes. NATO allies
have pledged 170 planes, making a total force of 430.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has said the first targets would be Yugoslavia's air
defenses, which would almost certainly be attacked by cruise
missiles launched from B-52 bombers that have already arrived in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's air-defense system is extensive, a reflection of
its obsession during the Cold War with possible attack by either
the Soviet Union or the West. Its arsenal includes 1,850
anti-aircraft guns and a variety of Soviet-made surface-to-air
missiles, some of which were used against allied planes during the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here said any military campaign would be calibrated to
leave open to Milosevic the possibility of compromise at any
moment. Initial strikes would be limited, but the campaign could
extend in phases to target strategic roads and bridges, military
garrisons, key roads and bridges, air bases and military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday whether each successive phase would have
to be approved by NATO's national representatives.
</P>
<P>
   With a long warning over a possible attack, the Yugoslav army
has already tried to hide much of its aircraft. NATO officials said
very few of Yugoslavia's 65 MIG-21s and 15 MIG-29s remained at air
bases, and the majority have been hidden in bunkers. It is unclear
whether Yugoslavia would fight back in the event of attack.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for a possible attack, Germany and Britain Monday
closed their embassies in Belgrade. Other nations, including the
United States, reduced their presence to a skeletal staff. The
Clinton administration, fearing reprisals, also ordered American
officials to leave the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia.

 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On the dance floor, Jose Cancela, a radio executive who
left Cuba as a child, is shaking a pair of maracas, trying to keep
up with the rhythm of a song that praises the hot tamales of a cook
named Olga. Lily Renteria, a Cuban actress who arrived in Miami
just over a year ago, is dancing next to him with a man who crossed
the Florida Strait in a raft four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is dark and smoky on this recent Friday night in Cafe
Nostalgia, the hottest dance club for Cuban music in Miami and, as
its name suggest, the perfect place for those who like to cultivate
their feelings of nostalgia for Cuba or, more specifically, for the
nights of Havana, which for this crowd are one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   All night long, black-and-white musical movie clips from the
1950s and '60s play on a screen behind the stage. There is Celia
Cruz, who was young and trim then but who is still singing and now
lives in New Jersey. There is Beny More, long dead, but his voice
strong and melodious on film.
</P>
<P>
   People sit mesmerized, listening to the music and looking at the
images of their past. For the younger crowd, or for the non-Cubans
in the audience, it is not their past they are looking at, but that
of their parents or their own ideas of what Cuba must have been
like back when it was fun and Americans liked to travel there for
their honeymoons.
</P>
<P>
   The band plays again, and the music is loud but good, very good.
Couples bump against one another on the tiny dance floor. The door
opens a crack and a tall, handsome man comes in. An entourage
follows. He is Francisco Gatorno, a Cuban actor who lives and works
in Mexico City and is visiting Miami. He heads for the dance floor
and taps Ms. Renteria, still dancing, on the shoulder. She turns
around and jumps to hug him. They have not seen each other in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him, my mind just went `trah-trah-trah' and it went
back to Cuba,'' Ms. Renteria said, making a mechanical sound as if
the wheels of her memory were turning. ``I can't tell you how many
times that's happened to me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovering over them, smiling beatifically at the scene as if it
were his doing, is Pepe Horta, a Cuban government official turned
successful businessman. Shortly after he left his job in Cuba at
the government-controlled film institute in 1994 and moved to
Miami, Horta opened Cafe Nostalgia, the kind of place that seems to
exist to make such encounters possible.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where on a given night a visitor to the club
could run into her old high school teacher while, a few feet away
on the stage, the Hollywood actor Andy Garcia, who was reared in
Miami, bangs the drums. Ruben Blades has been here and so have
Gloria Estefan and Bono of the band U2. But it is also the kind of
place where grandmothers can be seen tapping their fingers to the
beat.
</P>
<P>
   Horta is not the first Miami entrepreneur to profit from his own
nostalgia and that of his countrymen, but he has managed to turn it
into a kind of art. And now, with plans to open similar nightclubs
in Miami Beach, Madrid and Paris, he may be the first to market
internationally nostalgia for a certain lost moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   The longevity of Castro (73 years old, almost 40 of them in
power) and the embargo that the United States has kept against Cuba
for more than 30 years have made the island distant, inaccessible,
mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Horta has harnessed the allure and offered it in an irresistible
combination: film and drinks and good music for a hungry crowd of
exiles who cannot get enough of the country they lost.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming contradiction of his new role does not escape Horta,
who was 6 when Castro came to power. Like most other people who
remained in Cuba, Horta worked for the government all his life
until his defection _ the same government that created the
conditions that fueled the nostalgia in Miami. By the time he left
Cuba, he was the director of Havana's Film Festival and generally
considered one of the most powerful men on Havana's artistic scene.
Now he is the person who has made nostalgia chic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said it would not be possible, that Miami is
unforgiving, that Cubans here don't accept anyone who left after
the 1960's,'' said Horta, 45, a smart man with a raspy voice and a
suave air. ``But here I am. I look at what I've done and I'm amazed
at myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Horta said he left Cuba on an impulse. Because he spent years
living in Paris and traveling the world representing Cuba's film
industry, he said, he had been privileged, and practically
untouched by politics and the daily difficulties of life in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But everything changed one day at Havana's international airport
as he waited to board a plane for Mexico on his way to a conference
in New York. Suddenly, uniformed men ushered him to a room, took
his passport and went through his belongings. Horta asked them what
the problem was. They did not say. Eventually, he was allowed to
go. By then, Horta had made up his mind. The rough treatment had
been a warning: if he did not leave, he thought, he would be
demoted or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving in Miami, Horta had to find a job. He said he had
taken nothing of value from Cuba on that flight to Mexico except
dozens of reels of old films for a documentary he was to make in
Mexico about Cuban music. He was feeling nostalgic for his country
and his family and noticed that everyone in Miami was similarly
afflicted. The idea for Cafe Nostalgia just occurred to him.
</P>
<P>
   A friend lent him $48,000 and another gave him a few whisky
bottles for opening night. At the beginning, some people stayed
away. Horta had remained in Cuba too long, they said. He had been
too powerful, too close to the decision makers to ignore what was
going on, even if he had often been away from Cuba. But soon
enough, attracted by the music and the buzz and the personality of
Horta, the distrust collapsed and people flocked to Cafe Nostalgia.

SCI-NASA-MEMORIES-1, 10-12 -- Weeds are reclaiming much of the Cape
Canaveral Air Station, including Pad 14, where John Glenn was
launched into orbit in 1962. As monuments of inspired mobilization,
the ruins of Canaveral represent a progression of technological

many stone tools made obsolete by bronze and iron. (Keith

HOUSING MARKET REMAINS HOT, BUT PERCENTAGE GAIN COOLS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Coinciding with the arrival of autumn, the
steaming housing market in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley and
neighboring Santa Clarita Valley finally showed signs of seasonal
cooling during September, according to a report Monday from the
Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   In the bigger San Fernando Valley market, escrow closed on 1,096
single-family homes last month, an increase of a scant 1.1 percent
from September 1997. That's the smallest percentage gain in volume
since April 1997, when sales declined 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the total number of homes sold in September was
the highest for that month since 1989 and was the 17th consecutive
month of sales increases. The strong market reflects continued
consumer confidence in the economy and the lowest mortgage rates in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the median price, the point at which half the homes
sold for more and half for less, was $189,900, a 12.4 percent
increase from September a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Santa Clarita Valley, 264 homes closed escrow last month,
up 16.3percent from a year ago, the group said. The median price
was $210,000, up 5.6percent from September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That matches the perception we've had that sales are going to
slow down, and the hectic pace of increases we've seen for the last
12 or 14 months clearly is not going to be sustainable,'' said Nima
Nattagh, an analyst at First American Real Estate Solutions, a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the rest of the year, sales should remain stable or
increase slightly on an annual basis, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 1998 will end up being a pretty good year, probably the
best year we've had in the 1990s,'' Nattagh said.
</P>
<P>
   It will certainly be the best year for sellers this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sellers, even those who were hurt during the recession,
realize that the market has turned in their favor,'' said Jim Link,
the association's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But properties still have to be reasonably priced or they won't
sell, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only drag on the market is the tight inventory, which did
increase slightly last month.
</P>
<P>
   The number of active listings at the end of September stood at
5,002 single-family homes, up 3.8percent on an annual basis. And
1,910 new listings came on the market last month, up 17.5percent
from September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's a case of homeowners trying to take advantage of the
firming price trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``As resale prices rise, we're seeing a slight increase in the
number of properties listed for sale, but we're still in a low
inventory position,'' said Bud Mauro, the Realtors Association
president.
</P>
<P>
   But if prices keep climbing, it may induce homeowners to put
their properties on the market as long as they have an equity
position, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold a lot of properties over the last couple of years,
and we used up a lot of the market of people who had a need to
sell,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   The low inventory is also affecting sales in the Santa Clarita
Valley, said Nancy Starczyk, president of that Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   She recently took one client to 18 homes, and they were either
already in escrow or in poor condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventory is so low that it's acting like a brake on sales,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales fell in the Conejo Valley, but prices continued
to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Last month escrow closed on 288 single-family homes, down from
350 in September 1997, said Jim Keith, president of the Conejo
Valley Association of Realtors. The median price was $319,718, up
from $269,402 a year ago. Condominium sales totaled 123 last month,
up from 101 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Condominium sales were mixed in both the San Fernando and Santa
Clarita valleys last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, 300 condominiums closed escrow last
month, a 2.7 percent increase from September 1997. The median price
was $118,000, a 24.2 percent jump from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred condominiums sold last month in the Santa Clarita
Valley, up 58.7 percent from a year ago. The median price was
$128,500, up 13.8 percent. &UR; ! &LR;  &QL;

JUSTICE STORMS IN AND DEMANDS THE FLOOR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An agitated David Justice popped into the interview
room at Yankee Stadium Monday as an unexpected arrival on the
Cleveland Indians' day off. Almost instantly, he created a scene
that had all the feel and flavor of open-mike night at group
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice had something to say. And neither the Bronx-bound
traffic nor the gloom of his team's position in the American League
Championship Series was going to stop him from pouring out his
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black leather jacket and black knit cap from the
French Connection collection, Justice took a seat and railed
against a report he saw Sunday night that had questioned his desire
to be a team player.
</P>
<P>
   The report mentioned that Justice took himself out of the
Indians' lineup before Sunday's crucial Game 5, a game Cleveland
lost to go down to the Yankees by three games to two in this
four-of-seven-game series. Justice had been hit in the right arm by
a pitch in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurt to my heart when I was watching ESPN `Baseball
Tonight' and Peter Gammons said I asked out of the lineup,''
Justice said without being prompted by a question. ``I never asked
out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got little kids out there that look up to me. All I've
ever preached to kids is don't ever give up, give your best. And
then for that to be displayed _ that I asked out of the lineup _ I
didn't appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to repair his image, Justice explained why his
name was scratched from the lineup. He said Cleveland Manager Mike
Hargrove approached him during the pregame warm-ups and asked about
his right arm. Justice, listed third in the batting order at the
time, said he told Hargrove that his arm was a little sore. He also
suggested to Hargrove that he move him down in the order to bat
seventh ``because if David Wells makes tough pitches, it's going to
be hard on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hargrove, who did not join Justice at Yankee Stadium on
Monday, was not thrilled to hear his star hitter's aches or
suggestions. Sometimes a manager just wants to hear ``I'm fine.''
Within an hour of the game, Hargrove inserted Richie Sexson into
the lineup despite the fact that he had only one hit in his last 22
at bats. Sexson over Justice?
</P>
<P>
   Justice took it like a lamb. And perhaps this is where Justice
loses some people. To many, it did not matter if Justice was
struggling at the plate _ hitting .250 in the postseason _ because
he has always been an impact player and this was a team that needed
his bat and experience considering the crucial nature of Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other stars, Justice did not argue with Hargrove or
demand to be in the lineup. He was inserted as a pinch-hitter in
the ninth inning against Mariano Rivera, but did not get a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised that you are a player,'' said Justice, who
expects to be in the lineup when the Indians face the Yankees
Tuesday night in Game 6. ``You don't demand nothing. I don't run
the team. My job is to be ready when called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice went on to say that his teammates know his reputation as
a big-game player. But in the Indians' clubhouse after Game 5, a
couple of his teammates just shrugged their shoulders when
Justice's name was mentioned. Apparently, they did not understand
why he was out of the lineup either.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hargrove may bear some of the burden for the Justice
situation. After the Indians lost Game 5, Hargrove said Justice
could have played, but did little to clarify the reason Justice was
replaced in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Justice was nowhere to be found after the game, a
fact that he apologized for Monday. Whatever the reason for his
absence, this off-day cameo by Justice was not about the 3-2 hole
the Indians have found themselves in as they face possible
elimination at Yankee Stadium Tuesday night. This was about
Justice's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my ninth year in the big leagues,'' Justice said.
``Seven of those nine years, I have been in the postseason. I think
of those nine years. I have built a reputation as being a good
person, a good teammate, as well as a good player _ a player who
always shows up to play in the big games all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought that this reputation was being tainted by Gammons _
who was among others reporting on the curious nature of Justice's
absence in Game 5 _ left Justice sleepless. That is why he used
Monday's interview session, usually reserved for pitchers only, as
a vehicle to unleash his feelings. ``This won't be a distraction,''
Justice said. ``Tell you the truth, once I leave from here, I have
gotten it off my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing. Just before Justice ended his cathartic
session, he added, ``Thank you for listening.''

NOBODY WINS IN BERG STANDOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ It is hard to see who benefited from the Kings and
21-year-old defenseman Aki Berg failing to reach contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is one clear beneficiary, TPS, the team Berg
will play for this year in his native Finland. So if there are any
TPS fans reading this, party down.
</P>
<P>
   Berg loses a year of North American development that would have
helped him if his goal is to play in the NHL; the Kings lose that
year of development, too; and it's hard to imagine Berg's NHL
bargaining power will be enhanced no matter how well he plays in
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   As for Berg's current value to the Kings, it's hard to say. On
the one hand, his skating ability in a 6-foot-3, 203-pound package
makes his potential vast. On the other, he has yet to produce
offensively in the NHL. He had only eight points last season.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Berg has spent only a little more time on the
power play than Bill Clinton spends at Ken Starr's birthday bashes,
so how much of a chance has he really had to produce? It's clear a
fear of being typecast as a stay-at-home defenseman may have been
as much of a holdup in Berg's mind as the money the Kings were
offering.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see the outcome a year from now when
the Kings and Berg once again try to negotiate a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Another missing signature: The Vancouver Canucks were unable to
come to terms with 18-year-old defenseman Bryan Allen, despite
offering him a three-year deal at $975,000 a season, the highest
allowable salary under the collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that killed the deal was performance bonuses. Some
teams have made it a practice to pay a player all his bonuses even
if he doesn't earn all of them. The Canucks refused to make such an
agreement for Allen. So Allen is headed back to junior hockey for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Allen's agent is Larry Kelly, the same agent who
represents Berg and a number of other Kings, including Olli
Jokinen.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's crusade: Former NHL forward Sheldon Kennedy has
completed his inline skate across Canada. It was conducted to draw
awareness to childhood sexual abuse and to raise funds for a
facility in British Columbia that would serve as a retreat and
treatment center for abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two years since Kennedy, 29, came forward
with the story of the abuse he suffered as a teen at the hands of
his junior coach, Graham James, who is now serving time in a
Canadian prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's skate across Canada was not without its difficult
moments. In Edmonton, he admitted to drinking eight beers after
crashing a car, and marijuana was found in the vehicle, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been like a dance,'' Kennedy said during a visit
to Los Angeles last week. ``Before, I took two steps ahead and 20
back. Now, I take 15 forward and a couple back. My wife said, `I
don't expect Sheldon to be perfect. I expect him to be honest.'
That incident, I take full responsibility for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who suffered a broken leg in another auto accident a
year ago, said he still hopes to resume his once-promising NHL
career.
</P>
<P>
   No yen for Japan: Ex-King Bernie Nicholls, now with San Jose,
was not exactly thrilled he and his teammates along with the
Calgary Flames had to travel to Tokyo to play their first two games
of the season.

<P>
   ``Ridiculous, absolutely bleeping ridiculous,'' Nicholls was
quoted as saying. ``A fast start is so important to having a good
year and we're traveling 10 to 11 hours flying across the world to
play two games in a city we'll never see again. You tell me this
makes any sense? Just another example of western teams getting
shafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that one day we'll see two New York teams going over
there to play. Yeah, sure. Not in my lifetime. Us and Calgary and
L.A. and Anaheim and Edmonton and Vancouver, we get the tough
travel all season and then they throw this at us on top of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Tokyo games, Sharks coach Darryl Sutter had this
suggestion: ``It wouldn't be a bad idea if we both went to Hawaii,
split the games and laid on the beach and told the league we went
to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a better idea than Sutter realized. The Sharks went 0-1-1
against the Flames in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway blues: Entering play Monday night against St. Louis,
the New York Rangers were 0-2 and had been outscored 8-1. Among
their most disheartening statistics was only 40 of 126 faceoffs won
in the first two games, a 69.3-percent failure rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rangers already were grousing about others' work ethic, a
complaint echoed by coach John Muckler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give them some slack,'' Muckler said. ``I'll put them on
100-percent probation.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a long year.
</P>
<P>
   Final word: There is so much sadness in this world that we turn
to sports seeking respite, if only for the two-plus hours it takes
to play or watch a silly game. Perhaps this is why it is so painful
and haunting when real life intrudes on the games we follow.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of the Ice Dogs got to know Stephane Morin the person,
not just the player, during the nearly two full years he played in
Long Beach. Many members of the Kings knew him as well.
</P>
<P>
   He was a star at the IHL level, and much more importantly, he
was unfailingly polite and courteous off the ice, a true gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   For those who knew him, news of his sudden death last week at 29
during a game in Germany drained the excitement from the start of a
new season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLUE LINES &QL; 
Toothless wonders
</P>
<P>
   Given their (how do we say this nicely?) rustic home in
Nashville, Tenn., David Letterman predicted the Predators will be
the first team in the NHL where the players have more teeth than
the fans. &QL; 
Roster research &QL; 
Based on opening-night rosters:
</P>
<P>
   Oldest team: Stars (average player 29.2 years old)
</P>
<P>
   Youngest team: Canadiens (25.5)
</P>
<P>
   Tallest team: Kings, Flyers, Lightning (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Shortest team: Five teams' average player is 6-0
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweights: Kings (208.6 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   Lightweights: Stars (194.2)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Canada: The Sharks lead the NHL with 22 players from the
Northland
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes: The Coyotes and Islanders lead with seven
Americans apiece
</P>
<P>
   Foreign accent: The Penguins and Senators lead with 11 Europeans
each
</P>
<P>
   Ugly Americans: The Blackhawks have just one European player &QL; 
Bottom five, from bad to worse (records through Sunday) &QL; 
1. Rangers (0-2): Announcers said they looked a bit tired Friday
night _ in the second period of their season opener.
</P>
<P>
   2. Islanders (0-1): Instead of worrying about their decrepit
arena, this sorry team's owners should worry about their decrepit
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lightning (0-1-1): Their new owner is a close friend of
televangelist Jerry Falwell, and this team is going to need some
divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   4. Panthers (2-0): Undefeated, yes, with scintillating victories
against the Predators and Lightning. We'll wait and see. Their next
game is Friday against Dominik Hasek's Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   5. Predators (0-1): Who will score their first goal, sometime in
November? Will it be Tom Fitzgerald or Sergei Krivokrasov? The
drama is unbearable. &QL; 
Crunching the numbers &QL; 
4.82: The average number of goals in a game during the first three
days of the season, with new, offense-friendly rules in place. In
17 games, 16 teams scored two goals or less. Last year, teams
combined for 5.28 goals a game. In 1981-82, the year Wayne Gretzky
scored 92 goals, teams combined for eight goals a game.
</P>
<P>
   18-0: The first period shots-on-goal margin, in New Jersey's
favor, in the Devils' opener against Chicago. But it provided only
a 1-0 lead. The Blackhawks came back and won 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   $35 million: The amount of money the Canucks say they lost last
season. Things will be better this year: They don't have to pay the
$8 million salary of holdout star Pavel Bure.
</P>
<P>
   20: The number of NHL seasons played by Wayne Gretzky, Mark
Messier and Ray Bourque, who became the 24th through 26th players
to accomplish the feat. Will we see many more reach this mark?
``They don't have to play as long to make the same amount of money
I made in 20 years,'' said Kings coach Larry Robinson, a member of
the 20-year club. ``They can make it in one year.''

MORTGAGE RATES ZOOM AS U.S. CURRENCY DIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ While last week's spike in mortgage rates caught
many would-be borrowers off-guard, lenders and brokers have offered
a blunt retort: Deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have gotten a little greedy,'' said Ron Fleishman, vice
president of The Mortgage House Inc., a Los Angeles-based direct
lender. Even with recent rate increases, ``We're still at historic
lows. If people were thinking of purchasing, I'd still purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he and others said, the new higher rates won't last.
</P>
<P>
   Until late last week, the cost of a loan to either buy a home or
refinance an existing mortgage had been dropping in fits and starts
for months. That was largely because an increasingly strong dollar
pushed U.S. Treasury bond prices up, forcing their yields down.
Mortgage rates, which are pegged to 30-year bond yields, likewise
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, to the relief of the International Monetary Fund
but the consternation of dollar-lovers everywhere, beleaguered
Japan began finally to take action on its limp economy. Tokyo
announced plans to take over or close failing banks and to pump
money into healthier banks to encourage them to lend money to the
public again.
</P>
<P>
   Though not in place, mere news of the proposed steps bolstered
international confidence in the Japanese yen, at the expense of the
dollar. The U.S. currency staged its worst one-day fall against the
yen in a quarter century Thursday, spurring investors to pull out
of dollar-denominated investments, particularly U.S. Treasury
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the price of bonds plummeted, pushing their yields
up sharply, from a 30-year low of 4.71 percent at the start of last
week to 5.12 percent at the close of trading Friday. Mortgage rates
zoomed.
</P>
<P>
   At the nation's largest residential loan broker, Countrywide
Home Loans Inc., the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan leapt from 6
1/4 (one quarter) percent with 1 1/2 (one half) points on Tuesday
to 7 percent with 2 1/8 (one-eighth) points on Friday. Norwest
Mortgage Inc. and other lenders similarly boosted their rates, with
the average 30-year fixed-rate loan expected to rise to 6.95
percent this week, from 6.7 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, Realtors say they have seen little reaction to
the news by shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even a concern,'' Bud Mauro, president of the
Southland Regional Association of Realtors, said Monday. ``We're
still running very low on inventory, and there are a lot of buyers
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And over the long haul, lenders say they expect rates to fall
back, rebounding from what Fleishman described as an ``overreaction
to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   James Johnson, chief executive of Fannie Mae, the largest U.S.
buyer of home mortgages, said he expects rates to fall back at the
latest by early next year. ``I don't think we're seeing a real
run-up in interest rates that's going to last for a period of
time,'' Johnson said. ``The best for our bottom line is steady
rates, which is what we're going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that sort of bluster is little comfort to people who have
recently bought homes but whose rates haven't been locked in.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Goldberg, an executive at Blue Shield of California in Los
Angeles, will find out this week whether the rate on his new
Westlake Village house northwest of Los Angeles will increase a
little, a lot or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People plan what home they can afford and what kind of life
they can afford based on their mortgage payment,'' Goldberg said.
``It's frustrating to have something that affects my life so much
totally out of my control.''

By JOSEPH DUARTE 
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Silly as it might have sounded at one point this season,
if the Yankees were going to reach the World Series, the road led
straight through Cleveland.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, that was only by virtue of the Indians' now-hourly
rental of the title ``defending American League champions.''
</P>
<P>
   But reality has finally begun to soak in for the
underdog-from-the-start Indians. If they are to continue playing in
October, they'll have to go through New York.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, Cleveland finds itself in a
must-win situation after losing two of three games at home in the
playoffs. The Indians stand on the edge of elimination heading into
tonight's Game 6 of the AL Championship Series at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go in there with confidence. We're not hanging our
heads. We're not going to lay down and die,'' Cleveland first
baseman Jim Thome said. ``It's not going to be easy, but we've been
in situations like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has made a habit of pinning itself in a corner during
the postseason. A year ago, the Indians dropped two of three games
at home to the Florida Marlins during the World Series but came
within two outs of breaking a title drought of nearly a
half-century before losing Game 7 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But following Sunday's 5-3 loss to the Yankees at Jacobs Field,
Thome shook his head when asked if this year's predicament was like
last year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's no place like the House That Ruth Built. And
there may not be a team like the 1998 Yankees, whose 120 victories,
including the postseason, are the most ever by one team in a single
year.
</P>
<P>
   And as if they needed the odds stacked higher against them, the
Indians enter tonight's possible elimination matchup having to
hurdle Yankees 20-game winner David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win,'' said Cleveland outfielder Kenny Lofton.
``No other assessment has to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   After last year's near miss, the Indians have waited for another
chance at the World Series, which the franchise hasn't won in 50
years. The Yankees won their most recent title just two years ago
but nonetheless have longed for payback, since the Indians' 1997
playoff run started with a five-game victory over New York in the
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   The road back to the ALCS has been filled with potholes for the
Indians. Cleveland sleepwalked to its fourth consecutive AL Central
championship with an uninspiring 89 victories and was 39-38 after
the All-Star break. But the Indians surprised the Boston Red Sox,
who had the AL's second-best record, in the Division Series and
took a 2-1 ALCS lead over the powerful Yankees before losing Games
4 and 5 this past weekend at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Said Yankees owner George Steinbrenner: ``Now, we get 'em in our
home to beat the out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous Boss has reason to be confident, considering his
team was 62-19 in the Bronx during the regular season. New York
lost two or more games in a row at Yankee Stadium only four times,
the last a season-high three-game home skid from Sept. 11-13
against the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   To prolong their season at least another day _ if necessary,
Game 7 would be Wednesday _ the Indians will hinge their hopes on
31-year-old righthander Charles Nagy, no stranger to playoff
pressure. Nagy has made 11 starts in the postseason and pitched 7
shutout innings against Baltimore in Game 6 of the ALCS last year
to send the Indians to the World Series. Nagy entered in relief
during Game 7 of the Series last year and wound up losing.
</P>
<P>
   Against New York this season, he has allowed one run in three of
his last four starts, including two appearances at Yankee Stadium.
He received a no-decision in Game 2 of the ALCS last week after
allowing one run in 6 innings. The Indians eventually won 4-1 in 12
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Having won one of two games at Yankee Stadium already in the
series, the Indians realize their task is not impossible. But in
the best baseball tradition, they're taking things one game at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think about beating them twice,'' said reliever Paul
Shuey. ``We've got to think about beating them in the first inning
of Game 6. Then we think about beating them in the second inning,
because if we go there and try to beat them twice, it's probably
not going to happen.''

<P>
   John Hickey became suspicious as he reviewed the 16 detailed
questions faxed by a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the student, Justin D. Waldrep, had been quizzing
executives at Hickey's company, NRB Industries, a textile
manufacturer, for what he said was a business school research
paper. But the new questions seemed far more detailed than any
student would need. Increasingly uncomfortable, Hickey decided to
find out more about Waldrep.
</P>
<P>
   With a few telephone calls, Hickey discovered he had reason to
be concerned, according to a lawsuit filed by his company. Waldrep
was not working on a research paper. He was not attending business
school. He was not even a student.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, the company reached one conclusion: Waldrep was a
corporate spy.
</P>
<P>
   NRB Industries filed its lawsuit last year and has since
settled. It and another textile company, Johnston Industries, which
filed a lawsuit last week in an Alabama state court, say that they
were the targets of a corporate espionage operation conducted for a
top competitor, Milliken &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   According to the two lawsuits, Waldrep posed as a graduate
student and another consultant posed as a representative of Swiss
investors in order to steal confidential information from various
manufacturers on behalf of Milliken, the largest private textile
company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Milliken paid the consultants more than $500,000 for detailed
information on the customers, suppliers and manufacturing
operations of nine textile companies, according to NRB's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston executives say that Milliken used the stolen
information to lure customers away after first reducing prices on
some Milliken products. Milliken also introduced a fabric very
similar to one manufactured by Johnston and then marketed it to
Johnston's customers. Johnston executives say the small, publicly
held company, whose products include fabrics for automobile and
airplane seats, has lost millions of dollars in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Milliken are emerging as corporate
espionage increasingly receives attention from lawmakers and
executives. Some government estimates put the total cost of such
spying to American business as high as $250 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawsuits also underscore that the biggest security
threats faced by companies typically do not involve hackers
electronically sneaking into corporate computers. Rather, the
threats are often the people who are invited in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area of greatest concern is letting people in the front
door and giving them the keys to the kingdom,'' said Michael
Allison at International Business Research in Princeton, N.J.
``Companies forget that people can take information home in their
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of NRB and Johnston Industries, the knock on their
front doors came from Waldrep and his boss, Rodney Taylor. In a
24-page sworn statement filed in U.S. District Court in New York,
Waldrep, who agreed to cooperate with NRB after he was sued,
detailed how Milliken had repeatedly hired the consulting firm,
R.A. Taylor &AMP; Associates of Atlanta, to get information from its
competitors and how he and Taylor then obtained that information.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Milliken said it had hired R.A. Taylor ``to
obtain, through proper means, information about Milliken's markets
and some of its competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When claims were made about the propriety of the collection
techniques being used, Milliken ceased doing business with these
consultants,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Waldrep's statement, Taylor told Milliken
executives in late 1994, soon after the company hired him, that he
would pretend to be an investment banker seeking investment
opportunities on behalf a Geneva bank.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spring of 1996, at a meeting at Milliken's
headquarters, Taylor told other Milliken executives that the
consultants would use a ``two-pronged'' approach in trying to get
information from another textile company, Fab Industries, according
to Waldrep's statement.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had explained to the Milliken executives, Waldrep said,
that he would try to get information from Fab executives by playing
the role of an investment banker, while separately Waldrep would
approach the company with claims of being a student.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Monday that he had not yet seen the Johnston
Industries lawsuit. ``So it would not be appropriate for me to
comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrep did not return several messages left on his answering
machine last week and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NRB said it had ``amicably resolved'' its lawsuit against
Milliken, Waldrep, R.A. Taylor and Rodney Taylor earlier this year.
The terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, Milliken executives said they had been in
discussions with lawyers for Johnston Industries about its claims
and that they were ``very surprised'' to learn about the new
lawsuit, which they plan to defend vigorously. A company spokesman
said Monday that he could not comment further, because of the
pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Milliken, based in Spartanburg, S.C., is owned by Roger
Milliken, a wealthy industrialist and frequent contributor to
Republican and conservative causes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to NRB's lawsuit, Milliken hired the consultants to
obtain information on at least nine of its competitors, and told
the two men not to tell anyone whom they were working for. Milliken
and the consultants had code names like Project Ginkgo and Project
Coconut for their attempts at gaining information for each company.
</P>
<P>
   Jere Beasley, a lawyer representing Johnston Industries, said
the company would not have discovered that its trade secrets had
been stolen if NRB had not learned of a Project Meteor from
Waldrep. Under that project, Waldrep asked a number of Johnston
executives for information while posing as a student from Georgia
State University. At the same time, Taylor had requested
information, saying that he was representing a group of Swiss
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at another textile company that Milliken had hired
the consultants to get information on, Interface Inc. in Atlanta,
said Monday that they had also learned that it too had been a
target of the consultants from NRB's lawsuit. Ray Willoch, the
company's general counsel, said Interface was investigating the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   For the NRB project, according to Waldrep's sworn statement,
Taylor sent Waldrep to New York in the fall of 1996 to learn more
about Columbia University so that he could act more convincingly as
a graduate student when he visited NRB's headquarters in the Empire
State Building. For a few days, Waldrep toured the campus, sat in
classes and obtained a temporary library card from Columbia's
library.
</P>
<P>
   When Waldrep first met Hickey, the NRB executive, he told him
that he was involved in a transfer program that allowed Georgia
State students to attend classes at Columbia. Waldrep said he was
preparing a research paper for a corporate finance class and that
he wanted to do the paper on NRB's recent merger.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey gave Waldrep some of the information he requested after
he agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement. Waldrep promised
that only his professor would see the information. When Hickey's
secretary later requested proof that Waldrep was a student, the
consultant produced a Georgia State University identification card
that he had been issued as an undergraduate and one of Columbia's
temporary library cards.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Waldrep faxed Hickey a list of questions that
he said his professor had requested. The questions, which had
instead been requested by Milliken executives, included one asking
about NRB's ``new customer pursuits'' and one on how NRB fostered
their relationships with key suppliers, according to Waldrep's
statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a cover sheet faxed to Hickey with the 16 questions, Waldrep
asked the executive to meet with him again. ``I know you are busy,
so I promise not to take up much of your time,'' he wrote. ``My
professor suggested that I bring a tape recorder with me so I don't
have to waste time writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that corporate espionage is more common than the
public knows because many cases are settled privately by companies
seeking to avoid publicity and because most companies do not
realize that information has been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress made stealing trade secrets a federal crime.
So far, federal prosecutors have pursued few such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property is the only corporate asset that can be
misappropriated, copied and intercepted although nothing may appear
to be missing,'' said Richard J. Heffernan, a management consultant
in Branford, Conn., who focuses on protecting against economic
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan helped prepare a study for Congress that estimated
that American companies may be losing $250 billion annually because
of information that gets into the hands of competitors.

DISNEY MAKING MOVE FOR WEB TRAVEL SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co. says it plans to launch an
online-booking system that will let customers arrange entire travel
packages to its theme parks, resorts and cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   The service, accessible in a few weeks through the company's Web
site at disney.com, initially will allow travelers to book rooms at
hotels at the Walt Disney World complex in Orlando, Fla., without a
travel agent or phone operator. It then probably will be upgraded
next year to include setting up cruises, air travel and car rental,
according to Randy Garfield, president of Walt Disney Travel Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to make it easier for customers who like to use
the Internet to make travel plans, just like there are
do-it-yourselfers who like to go to Home Depot,'' said Garfield in
Monday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank-based entertainment giant, which has been moving
aggressively into electronic commerce in recent years, already
sells tickets to its theme parks online. In June, it bought 43

SERBS MAKE CONCESSIONS AS NATO ALLIES APPROVE BOMBING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The United States and its allies early
Tuesday approved an order opening the way for NATO to begin a
bombing campaign in the Serbian province of Kosovo in four days'
time. But White House officials said an agreement with the Yugoslav
president appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The ``activation order,'' passed here at a meeting of NATO, was
clearly aimed more at keeping maximum diplomatic pressure to bear
on President Slobodan Milosevic, than at preparing for military
action.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American and NATO officials said that America's special
envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, had made significant
progress with Milosevic, and ``has much of what we're looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president has agreed to end all police and military
operations in Kosovo, withdraw forces in a verifiable way and make
a unilateral statement pledging partial autonomy to the province,
American officials said. He also appears ready to allow a force of
2,000 monitors, mostly civilian, into Kosovo. NATO diplomats,
however, said that some differences remained over the exact makeup
of the international mission that would go into Kosovo to verify an
agreement. Milosevic's reluctance to promise cooperation with
international war-crimes investigations was also an outstanding
issue, they said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded with guarded optimism to the latest
offer of commitments from Milosevic. ``As I have said before, we
would prefer to resolve this crisis peacefully,'' he said on Monday
night. ``If fully implemented _ and that is a critical and very big
if _ these commitments could achieve the international community's
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Balkan graveyards are filled with Milosevic's broken
promises,'' Clinton said in New York after a fund-raising event.
``We will remain ready to take military action if Milosevic fails
to make good on his commitments this time.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO stipulated that 96 hours had to elapse before a first phase
of military action could begin. Earlier drafts had spoken of 48
hours, and Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, said the
extension reflected the fact that ``after analysis of the progress
made, we wanted to give a longer chance to negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO decision was made after Holbrooke unexpectedly
interrupted his marathon negotiations with Milosevic in Belgrade to
come to Brussels and brief NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed more clout behind the negotiating process, and this
NATO decision provides it,'' a NATO diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   After briefing NATO, Holbrooke returned immediately to Belgrade
to continue his talks with Milosevic, whose crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo has driven the Clinton
administration to the conviction that only the credible threat of
force could end the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not NATO does use force, an important precedent
appears to have been set by Tuesday's decision. In effect, NATO
implied that without an explicit U.N. Security Council resolution
authorizing force, it has the right, in certain circumstances, to
intervene in the internal affairs of a European nation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NATO order approved Tuesday, command of more than 400
aircraft and other materiel that might be used against Yugoslavia
was formally transferred from NATO member countries to the
alliance's commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark. Technically,
NATO is now ready to begin a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But any military strike _ likely to begin with cruise missile
attacks on Yugoslavia's air defenses _ would be delayed at least 96
hours. This four-day period was favored by several European nations
in NATO that remain deeply uneasy about the idea of air strikes
against Yugoslavia, NATO diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The two outstanding issues _ the make-up of a monitoring force
and war crimes _ are very sensitive to the the Serbian leader. His
rise to power a decade ago was based on his clamorous crusade on
behalf of the Serbs of Kosovo, who are far outnumbered in a
province that is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   If a Western military force is allowed into Kosovo, the
sovereignty of Serbia will appear compromised in the very place
that many Serbs regard as the heart of the nation's being because
it was the center of its medieval empire.
</P>
<P>
   If war crimes investigators are allowed into Serbia, the huge
police force that forms the core of Milosevic's power and has been
central to the repression in Kosovo would be enraged. It is unclear
whether Milosevic could afford to lose so important a buttress of
his power.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke declined to address those issues publicly during his
brief stay in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   But he held talks here with the Polish foreign minister,
Branislaw Geremek, on the possibility that the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe might organize the monitors to
be deployed in Kosovo in the event of an agreement. Poland holds
the rotating presidency of the 29-nation organization.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Holbrooke is discussing a group of about
2,000 international monitors, overwhelmingly civilian, largely
unprotected and under the auspices of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation, whose members include Russia. Such an arrangement
might placate Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of NATO troops would also be engaged, largely in
intelligence-gathering and in flight duties, and some of them would
be on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   American troops would play a role in that monitoring by NATO, a
senior American official said, but largely from the air. ``No one
anticipates American troops on the ground at this point,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   How an unarmed group of civilians could effectively verify
Serbian compliance with an promise to end its crackdown in an
atmosphere charged with violence and resentment was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected visit to NATO headquarters by Holbrooke appeared
to reflect a growing concern and irritation among America's allies
that they had not been sufficiently briefed on the talks in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1995 Dayton negotiations that ended the Bosnian war,
European governments were infuriated by what they saw as
Holbrooke's failure to keep them sufficiently informed or involved.
Diplomats here said similar irritation had begun to emerge before
Holbrooke's visit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Albanians, whose autonomy was quashed by
Milosevic in the late 1980s, now want independence from Serbia and
a guerrilla army has been fighting with limited but often ruthless
means to press this demand. The United States has said that it
favors restored autonomy for the Albanians but that it does not
support their independence.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Tuesday that Milosevic was ready to
agree to a unilateral statement granting limited autonomy to ethnic
Albanians in the areas of local government, schools and policing
and promising a full review of the province's status in three
years' time.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the Albanians would respond to such a
statement, but it appeared well short of their aims. About 250,000
ethnic Albanians have been driven from their homes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said the ``activation order'' approved Tuesday
might remain in place for some time, even if an agreement is
reached, because it would serve as important backing for Western
attempts to monitor the pledges made by Milosevic in any accord.
</P>
<P>
   The demands on Milosevic were spelled out in a U.N. Security
Council resolution passed on Sept. 23, but the resolution did not
refer specifically to the use of force in the event of Milosevic's
failure to comply.
</P>
<P>
   This omission, necessary because Russia would does not support
the use of force against its Eastern Orthodox allies in Serbia, has
caused concern among some European nations as to the legal basis
for a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany and Italy, both between governments, gave formal
backing Tuesday to NATO's move toward the use of force. Like other
Western governments, however, they would prefer a peaceful
resolution to a crisis that risks undermining painstaking efforts
by NATO to establish a cooperative relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia reiterated its opposition Tuesday, saying any attack on
Yugoslavia would be a ``tragic mistake.'' The Russian
representatives to NATO was called back to Moscow for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO put the last political piece in place for a bombing
campaign, its military preparations continued. At the Aviano NATO
air base in Italy, A-10 Thunderbolt ground-attack aircraft arrived,
the latest in a buildup of 260 American planes. NATO allies have
pledged 170 planes, making a total force of 430.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has said the first targets would be Yugoslavia's air
defenses, which would almost certainly be attacked by cruise
missiles launched from B-52 bombers that have already arrived in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's air-defense system is extensive, a reflection of
its obsession during the Cold War with possible attack by either
the Soviet Union or the West. Its arsenal includes 1,850
anti-aircraft guns and a variety of Soviet-made surface-to-air
missiles, some of which were used against allied planes during the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here said any military campaign would be calibrated to
leave open to Milosevic the possibility of compromise at any
moment. Initial strikes would be limited, but the campaign could
extend in phases to target strategic roads and bridges, military
garrisons, key roads and bridges, air bases and military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday whether each successive phase would have
to be approved by NATO's national representatives.
</P>
<P>
   With a long warning over a possible attack, the Yugoslav army
has already tried to hide much of its aircraft. NATO officials said
very few of Yugoslavia's 65 MIG-21s and 15 MIG-29s remained at air
bases, and the majority have been hidden in bunkers. It is unclear
whether Yugoslavia would fight back in the event of attack.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for a possible attack, Germany and Britain closed
their embassies in Belgrade. Other nations, including the United
States, reduced their presence to a skeletal staff. The Clinton
administration, fearing reprisals, also ordered American officials
to leave the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia.

   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ Matthew Shepard, the gay college student
who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days
after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been
left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital, fanned the
outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning
nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes
legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such
laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have
resisted them.
</P>
<P>
   From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to
honor the slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman at
the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of
anti-gay violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a
passer-by.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, were charged with
attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree murder
charges that could bring the death penalty. Their girlfriends,
Chasity Pasley, 21, and Kristen Price, 18, were charged as
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of
national Gay Awareness Week. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag
that symbolizes the gay rights movement was lowered to half-staff
in the Castro district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence,''
said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force in Washington. ``People have likened it to a
scarecrow. But it sounded more like a crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Laramie, Wyo., where the beating took place, have said
they believe robbery was the primary motive for the attack against
Shepard, which occurred outside a bar in the town of 27,000. But
investigators also said Shepard's sexuality may have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by
saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriends said Shepard
had embarrassed one of the men by making a pass at him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied to the
fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a street
corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy
Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the
brawl; McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same
hospital where Shepard died.
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear _ that
Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to
pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. Conservatives
generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights
over another.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia
have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are
committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national
origin, and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual
orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including
Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton responded to news of Shepard's death by
urging Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act,
which would make federal offenses of crimes based on sex,
disability and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress needs to pass our tough hate-crimes legislation,''
Clinton said of the bill that would expand protection.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has been one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three
hate crimes bills since 1994, most recently in February. But
Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to
lawmakers to reconsider their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate
legislation that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for
their consideration in January,'' Geringer said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor met Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain
student's father, and said that the elder Shepard did not want his
son's death to become ``a media circus'' and that ``we should not
use Matt to further an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into
just passing all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of
any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in
the process to race to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would
respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper,
Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped the death would
have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper
understanding of hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights
group that has 250,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States
because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern
Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against
minorities. According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor
in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use
Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom
of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of
violent crime and everything to do with silencing political
opposition,'' said Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family
Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to defending
``faith, family and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would criminalize pro-family beliefs,'' Schwalm said.
``This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the
political message of homosexual activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in
a series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne,
``overcame'' homosexuality through religious conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is
contrary to Biblical norms,'' said Paulk, who describes himself as
a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian
group in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Because we are standing up and
opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon as
advocating violence against homosexuals, when we categorically
reject violence against homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hate-crime laws that are on the books in 40 states have not
impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice
professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton
College, in Pomona, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before
they escalate,'' he said. Referring to murders of homosexuals, he
added: ``These crimes are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if
they are not punished the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered
higher rates of violent crime than the population at large. He also
said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals are
male, aged 22 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``With other crimes, violence is a means to an end. With hate
crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin said.
Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, as
well as a massive blow to the back of his skull.

 When to Get More RAM for Your PC   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 Q:  My 166 MHz Pentium PC has 32 megabytes of RAM. With memory 
 prices falling so low, I'm considering doubling the amount to   64
megs. My question is, will that give me a noticeable boost   in
performance? And if I decide to upgrade, what kind of memory 
 should I get? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The benefit of increasing RAM depends on how you use your
computer. If you have a lot of complex programs open at the same
time, you should find they work faster. Also, the more memory you
have, the better your PC can handle multimedia graphics and
fast-paced games. If you just do word processing and browse the
Web, 32 megs is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of memory you need depends on what kind of memory
modules your computer uses. Up until about a year ago, most
Pentium-class systems _ probably including yours _ came with DRAM
SIMMs, which are finger-length chips. Most of today's PCs use SDRAM
DIMMs, which are bigger and faster. If I explain what all the
acronyms mean, it'll take up the rest of the column. Just don't
confuse DIMM and SIMM with dim sum, which is Chinese food. Anyway,
check your computer manual or call the manufacturer to find out
what kind of modules you need. Also bear in mind that if you're
dealing with SIMMs, you may have to add them in pairs.
</P>
<P>
   The only other consideration is speed. Memory speed is
calculated in nanoseconds _ 60 ns, for example. Make sure that any
modules you add are at least as fast as the PC's existing memory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; As an America Online member, I use the Favorites &LR;   &LR; feature
daily. I would love to be able to change the order of &LR;   &LR; some of my
entries. Is there any way to do this? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Sure. You can simply drag the entries into different
positions within a folder or from one folder to another. This works
for both AOL 3.0 and the new 4.0 version of the software. Also, you
can create new folders to further help organize your entries. In
version 3.0, do this by clicking the Add Folder button in the
Favorite Places window. In 4.0, click the New button and choose New
Folder.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Do fax modems require a separate phone number to send &LR;   &LR; and
receive faxes? I already have a dedicated line for my &LR;   &LR; computer. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; You can use the same line for phoning and faxing. The only
thing is, you won't be able to talk on the phone and use the fax
simultaneously. So if you're waiting for an important fax, you'll
have to stay off the phone _ and also off the Internet, if that's
your data line.
</P>
<P>
   Most fax-software programs let you set things up so that the
computer answers the phone and determines whether a call is an
incoming fax. Many new PCs also can be used as answering machines.
That way, you can leave the computer on all the time and let it
field your calls and incoming faxes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR; Q:  &LR; I would like to be able to listen to audio on the Web. &LR; 
 &LR; I've downloaded the RealPlayer from the RealNetworks Web site, &LR; 
 &LR; but after installing it, the sound comes out as rapid garbage. &LR; 
 &LR; Their suggestions for troubleshooting didn't help, and their &LR; 
 &LR; automated help is a waste of time. I'm not hooked on &LR;   &LR; RealPlayer.
I'll use anything that works. Can you point me to a &LR;   &LR; resource? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Sounds like rapid garbage, eh? Are you sure you're not
listening to the Beastie Boys? (Just kidding, guys.) Without
knowing more about your computer system, it's hard to tell where
the problem is. At the risk of sounding like a Microsoft salesman,
I'd suggest that you try installing Microsoft's Windows Media
Player. It's a competitive program to the RealPlayer and does all
the same things. Maybe it will be more compatible with your Windows
PC. You can find the Windows Media Player under Free Downloads at
 &LR; www.microsoft.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; A Better Idea: &LR;  Last week, I recommended removeable hard disks
as a way for a nonprofit organization to archive old photographs
and documents. A number of readers wrote in with a better
suggestion _ a CD-ROM recorder. CD-R, as it's called, lets you
store up to 660 megabytes of data on a blank compact disc. Because
it records optically, the stored information is safer than it would
be on a magnetic disk. And the data can be read by any PC with a
CD-ROM drive. CD recorders can be had for about $200.

   TIP OF THE WEEK &QC; 
If you often use Windows Explorer to manage your files and folders,
here's a quick way to open it: Right-click the Windows Start
button, and choose Explore.

 Huge Loss Expected For BofA   By Sam Zuckerman  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
When BankAmerica Corp. posts its third-quarter results tomorrow, it
will disclose a substantial loss, possibly $100 million or more,
from its stake in a Wall Street firm,people close to the bank said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The loss stems from the bank's interest in a stock-and-options
portfolio managed by D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., a New York investment firm
that uses computer-driven mathematical formulas to profit on tiny
variations in securities prices.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's big loss, combined with red ink elsewhere in corporate
and investment banking operations, is embarrassing to executives of
the old BankAmerica, analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
   The new BankAmerica was created two weeks ago when NationsBank
Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., bought San Francisco's BankAmerica and
took its name.
</P>
<P>
   The loss could undermine former BankAmerica chief executive
David Coulter, who is president of the combined bank and has risk
management as one of his main responsibilities. Corporate banking
chief Michael Murray also is on the spot, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly weakens their position in the new company,'' said
Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. analyst Lawrence Cohn.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's investment techniques are similar to those that nearly
toppled the giant hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management last
month, but Shaw remains solvent because it didn't borrow as heavily
to fund its money-losing investments.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement last month, BankAmerica said it recorded a $12
million loss in interest income from its securities holdings during
July and August. Analysts said the result appeared to be triggered
by losses at Shaw, which offset gains elsewhere in BankAmerica's
securities holdings.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica's loss in its Shaw investment comes as global
financial turmoil takes a toll on the bank's trading, venture
capital and international lending businesses. Analysts expect the
bank to take a series of charges covering losses by the old
BankAmerica, sharply depressing profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to stuff all kinds of things'' into the
third-quarter earnings report, said Campbell Chaney, an analyst for
the brokerage firm Sandler O'Neill &AMP; Partners. ``They'll probably
make it a dump-truck quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica spokesman John Keane declined comment. Shaw
spokesman Nick Giankouros said the firm was ``not in any form of
financial distress.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank didn't have broad international operations and
didn't sink much money into exotic investment vehicles such as
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was founded 10 years ago by Columbia University computer
scientist David Shaw. It rapidly became one of the most highly
regarded quantitative investment houses on Wall Street, using
esoteric computer analysis to buy and sell stocks, convertible
bonds and stock options in global markets.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, BankAmerica entered into an alliance with Shaw
and agreed to fund an investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica's stake took the form of a loan of about $1 billion
to Shaw. In return, it collected a below-market interest rate but
garnered 50 percent of the profits or losses of the portfolio, said
people familiar with the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, Shaw manages a private hedge fund for BofA,'' Cohn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's portfolio, like that of Long-Term Capital, is designed to
make money whether securities prices go up or down. The system
broke down, however, when the recent extraordinary turbulence in
worldwide markets caused the value of Shaw's assets to plunge
faster than the firm could unload them.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica has several accounting options for its Shaw losses.
It could include the loss on its income statement, set aside a
special reserve or take a charge against capital, analysts said.

 Startup Gives Callers Free Long-Distance for Listening to
Phone  Ads   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
At the intersection of consumers' distaste for advertising and
their zest for freebies stands BroadPoint Communications, a
Maryland startup that is offering free long-distance service to
people willing to listen to recorded ads.
<TEXT>
<P>
   BroadPoint's FreeWay service gives callers two free minutes of
domestic long-distance service for every 10- to 15-second ad they
listen to. The service should be available in the Bay Area starting
in January.
</P>
<P>
   To use the service, members first must fill out a questionnaire
at  &LR; www.broadpoint.com &LR; . The information they give, such as income,
ethnicity, education level and children's ages, is used to
determine which ads to play for the caller.
</P>
<P>
   To use FreeWay, members dial a toll-free line from any telephone
and then plug in an identification number and the phone number they
wish to reach. They may then listen to as many ads as they choose,
racking up two minutes of long-distance service per ad. They can
stop listening to ads at any time, and their call will be
connected. Most people listen to seven or eight ads.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``It's an interesting concept that we think will be very
successful,'' said Jim Pagano, executive vice president of the
Flower Club, a FreeWay advertiser. ``Free long-distance time is a
very powerful currency,'' similar to frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Results for the advertisers appear to be quite mixed, however.
</P>
<P>
   A hefty 27 percent of FreeWay users who heard promotions for
Eagle Eye Sportswear called the company's 800 number after hearing
its ad, which promised a free turtleneck to respondents.
</P>
<P>
   But less than one-10th of 1 percent of those who listened to ads
for Vermont Teddy Bear's BearGram, a service in which people send
teddy bears instead of flowers for special occasions, called to
place an order.
</P>
<P>
   With other forms of direct marketing, such as mailers, a 2
percent response rate is considered successful. In four months,
FreeWay ads generated just six orders for Vermont Teddy Bear.
</P>
<P>
   But Irene Steiner, Vermont Teddy Bear's marketing manager, said
she expects orders to increase when BroadPoint begins using a new
technology that allows callers to ring directly to the advertiser
and then get linked back to their call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying that they're adding people (to the program),
so the response should go up,'' said Steiner. ``But we're also part
of a trial period and we're not paying for it, so to us it's all
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   FreeWay started with an 800-person pilot project in April in
Pittsburgh. The test group has been expanded to 10,000, and
BroadPoint is planning a national rollout in a few months. The
company has several patents pending on its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Neufeld, an advertising analyst with Jupiter
Communications, said there clearly is demand for a service like
FreeWay. But to generate enough advertiser revenue to pay for the
long-distance capacity that BroadPoint gives away, FreeWay probably
will need to attract between 500,000 and 1 million regular users,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   BroadPoint chief executive Perry Kamel, a former McKinsey
consultant and MCI executive, said the company's success in
attracting new members has exceeded his expectations. Because of
strong word-of-mouth advertising, the company spends only about $1
to acquire each new user, compared with between $50 and $150 spent
by long-distance companies to steal one customer from a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing out of people's mouths when they're making a
call with FreeWay is, `Hey guess what, I'm calling you for free,'
'' he said. ``We call it virus marketing _ it just spreads.''
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary nature of the service _ unlike radio or TV, people
aren't forced to listen to ads _ ``engenders a lot of good will and
creates a very responsive audience,'' Kamel said. As a result, only
about 5 percent of users drop out in the first month, compared with
about 20 percent for long-distance promotional programs offered by
conventional long-distance companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Household incomes of FreeWay users are relatively high,
averaging $60,000 per household, because better-off households tend
to make more calls, Kamel said.

 Microsoft's New Business Suite Melds With Web   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The next version of Microsoft's popular Office software suite will
offer a few interesting improvements for consumers. But it's what
it will do in the corporate setting that's truly amazing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Due out in the first half of next year, Office 2000 will take
the big step of making HTML _ the format for creating pages on the
World Wide Web _ interchangeable with the file formats it uses for
its own programs.
</P>
<P>
   The move could have a profound impact on business computing
because Office controls more than 80 percent of its market _ nearly
as much as Windows itself. The suite includes the most popular word
processor (Word), spreadsheet (Excel), database (Access) and
presentation software (PowerPoint) in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With Office 2000, users will be able to save documents directly
onto a company intranet (an internal, Web-based network) as easily
as if they were storing them on a hard drive. And people with
access to the intranet will easily be able to edit the documents,
make corrections and add comments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Microsoft says almost no type formatting will be lost
in the transition to and from HTML.
</P>
<P>
   ``To enable easy viewing and sharing of information, Office 2000
will elevate HTML to be a companion file format with the native
Office binary file formats,'' Microsoft said. ``This is a big
change for Microsoft, which has spent more than 10 years
fine-tuning and optimizing the native Office file formats.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Microsoft is letting anyone _ even the
Internet _ loosen its grip on the corporate desktop. In fact, the
new Office 2000 could strengthen the software giant's monopoly by
making Microsoft products crucial to Web-based computing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a company probably would need Microsoft's Web
server to get the full benefit of Office 2000's intranet
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new suite also promises to increase market share for
Internet Explorer, Microsoft's Web browser. Office 2000 will
include a new version of the browser specially designed to display
documents that have been created in Office documents and saved in
HTML.
</P>
<P>
   HTML notwithstanding, Office 2000 offers some improvements that
should appeal to the average consumer or small-business owner. The
following new features are included in the first beta of the
software, which now is making the rounds of testers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Open and Save As commands launch a window with a bar along the
left side that gives you access to frequently used folders,
including My Documents, as well as to Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The clipboard now can hold multiple items _ up to 12 _
including text and graphics. When you go to paste something into a
document, a small panel displays icons of all items on the
clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   _ The main drop-down menus (File, Edit, etc.) are short lists.
But if you open one and wait a couple of seconds, a longer list
appears. When you choose an option from a long menu list, it's
automatically added to the short list _ where it stays if you
continue to use it over time. If you don't, it's dropped from the
short list.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Help feature is easier to use. When you ask for help, your
document remains on the left side of the screen while the Help
feature appears to the right. Some help topics can be expanded into
Web-type pages with illustrations and links to subtopics.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Word, you can look up synonyms simply by selecting a word
and clicking the right mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   _ PowerPoint's default window has three panes that let you view
your presentation, outline and notes at the same time. And when you
add too much text to a slide, the font size automatically is
reduced to make it fit.
</P>
<P>
   As for shortcomings, the new version of Outlook is still too
complicated. Personal-information managers seem to be one of the
few things beyond Microsoft's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for Office 2000 has not been set. The current version
goes for about $500, though people who already own it can upgrade
for about $300.

 Diamond Multimedia Systems Is Caught in Legal Quagmire   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In the old days, the computer industry was wild and unregulated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowadays, tech territory is crisscrossed with legal barbed wire.
The mess facing Diamond Multimedia Systems is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Diamond will ask a federal judge in Los Angeles for
permission to start selling a pager-size portable device that plays
music through headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you might ask, would a federal judge care whether Diamond
wants to sell a $200 digital gizmo that is like a cheaper,
tape-based Walkman?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer is that last week, the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents major music publishers,
filed suit against Diamond. The association charged in the suit
that Diamond's device, called the Rio, would ``facilitate and
encourage'' music piracy by making it easy to download bootleg
music using MP3 technology.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote about MP3 last month. It lets people take music from a
CD, record or tape; compress the sound into a digital file; and
then ship the file over the Internet so others can download it,
uncompress it and listen to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Music pirates have used MP3 to put thousands of copyrighted
songs up on Web sites where people can download these bootleg
files. But so far, to hear bootleg MP3 files, you must hook
speakers up to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Rio comes into play. Diamond created Rio to
make MP3 music portable by storing digital files on memory chips in
the device. The Rio can play an hour's worth of recorded music on
batteries that last half a day.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, the RIAA is trying to halt distribution of the
Rio _ before Diamond can create a market for its two-ounce playback
device &UR; . &LR;  There have been other MP3 portable devices. But they cost
more and did less than Rio, making the new device the first real
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA has charged Diamond with violating the Audio Home
Recording Act, which was passed in 1992 to discourage music piracy
on Digital Audio Tape. Among other things, the AHRA forced DAT tape
makers to pay a royalty on each tape they sold, to compensate music
publishers for the piracy that would take place on DAT.
</P>
<P>
   RIAA is trying to apply the logic to Diamond in the world of MP3
music stored on computer chips. It will ask the federal courts to
rule that the Rio device is covered under the same laws as DAT
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   That may be tough, says Bob Kohn, an expert on music law. Kohn
is hardly a neutral source. He is, after all, chairman of GoodNoise
Corp., a Palo Alto startup that sells music in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also the author of a textbook on music copyrights and
has said the 1992 act on DAT tapes specifically exempts all
computer-based devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RIAA lawsuit ought to be laughed out of court,'' Kohn
said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Diamond will go into court Friday to argue that
there's plenty of legitimate music _ much of it from smaller or
lesser known bands _ available for sale in the MP3 format. It
argues that this is the legitimate market it is going after.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The RIAA is really trying to limit access to
distribution,'' said Ken Wirt, Diamond's vice president of
marketing. ``If you're a little guy and you want to get your music
in a record store, you have to go through them. They don't like the
idea of music distribution over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   RIAA attorneys did not return calls, but they'd see things
different. The 1992 act also required DAT tape makers to implement
a copy protection scheme to limit piracy. So far, piracy protection
isn't part of the MP3 technology, and this lawsuit seems like the
music industry's way of forcing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Polling experiment: &LR;  Today, most political polls are done on
the phone. But Harris Black Internation, the company that runs the
Harris Poll, will use the Internet this year to try to pick the
winners in 18 Senate and gubernatorial races _ including
California's _ on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Black President David Clemm said his pollsters have spent
the last year assembling a database of 1 million Internet users who
represent the country's racial, economic, occupational and
geographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what they look like, we know what they think and we
know how they compare to the larger population,'' Clemm said.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Harris Black has surveyed this Internet sample on
political matters like the Lewinsky scandal. They have compared
these Net results against surveys done by phone to make sure the
Net group wasn't different than the phone sample.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clemm said he's confident the Net sample can call 36 races
in 18 states. ``The proof will be in the pudding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can view the Harris Black poll results on Excite
 &LR; (www.excite.com) &LR; .

 2 Rating Services For Web Merge   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The two leading Web audience ``ratings'' services, Media Metrix of
New York and Atlanta's Relevant Knowledge, announced their merger
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ratings services use computer software or hardware to track
the activity of Web visitors, producing data about computer usage
much as A.C. Nielsen does for television. Their clients include
advertisers, who use the data to decide which sites to buy ad space
on; and Web sites, which use it to get a better handle on who their
visitors are.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings service data are popping up more and more in the news as
well, as journalists used their numbers to gauge interest in
Internet sites and events such as the posting of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company, which maintains the Media Metrix name, will
track Web-viewing habits of 40,000 consumers by adding Relevant
Knowledge's 10,000 panel members to Media Metrix's existing 30,000.
The all-stock deal leaves the next biggest service, NetRatings of
Milpitas, trailing a distant second with a panel size of 3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ``there are some months when (Media Metrix's report)
is ... off by a fairly large magnitude,'' said Peter Brine,
director of online marketing for Santa Monica's EToys, a Media
Metrix subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the sample size by 10,000 will allow Media Metrix to
measure many smaller Web sites that can't currently be tracked in a
statistically significant fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix will ``jump, all of a sudden, to being able to
report on more than 15,000 sites,'' compared with Media Metrix's
previous 8,000 sites and Relevant Knowledge's 1,500 to 2,000, said
Jeff Levy, vice chairman of Media Metrix and the former chief
executive of Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   NetRatings collects statistically significant data from about
450 sites, said Tim Meadows, vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also will allow Media Metrix to adopt the best
technologies of its predecessor companies. For example, the new
Media Metrix will adopt Relevant Knowledge's Web-based tracking
technology, which delivers information instantly. Media Metrix's
system, in which panelists mailed in floppy disks that recorded
their computer usage once each month, will be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Media Metrix will be able to expand its measurement of
advertising activity in other Internet-related services such as
e-mail, America Online and Pointcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies had significant strengths, and their plan is to
bring those strengths together so we would have a more encompassing
total measure of the competitive Web marketplace,'' said Andy
Fessel, director of the database and research group at Microsoft
IMG, the company's interactive media division.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Several Web executives said yesterday's deal relegates
NetRatings to niche status. But Fessel pointed out that the Web
ratings race is just beginning, and there is plenty of room for
innovation and change.
</P>
<P>
   Also, NetRatings has a head start in measuring the effectiveness
of specific banner ads, something Media Metrix has not started
doing, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Packo, president of Media Metrix, said it will take
about five months to completely integrate the two companies'
systems, although the basic monthly report, which tracks traffic on
the biggest Web sites, will include information from the combined
panel in December.
</P>
<P>
   Packo and Levy said they decided to join forces after sitting
together on a recent conference panel debating the merits of their
respective systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we could do much more together than by devoting our
energies to creating competing products,'' said Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month ago, the two companies' systems gurus decided
it would be possible to mesh their data sets, spurring serious
talks, Packo said.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix expects to be profitable next year and generate
revenue in the low eight-digits, the executives said.

 Oscar's Lure Draws High-Tech Workers to Lucas   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
How does a private company that can't offer stock options lure
high-tech employees?
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Lucas' film production empire dangles a golden statuette.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd. employees ``have a tremendous upside which will
generate cash later on: getting an Oscar,'' said Michael Moon, who
runs Gistics, a high-tech research firm in Larkspur.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm has won 17 Academy Awards, while its divisions
Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound have a combined 24
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas employees are ``in that hallowed group of artists who can
reasonably expect to get an Oscar,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cachet of putting Lucasfilm on a resume, Moon
said workers are lured by the workplace, with offices throughout
Marin County, away from the Hollywood rat race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the individual who most consistently pushes the
envelope in artistic and technological endeavors, George remains
paramount, peerless,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking the job, he said, people know they ``will learn more
about the craft hanging out here than anywhere else except maybe
Disney.'' But, he added, ``Disney's a pretty corporate environment,
a pretty harsh environment for creative people _ it's L.A., and
it's got a bunch of suits running around.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Lucas employees are well paid, the company has a
reputation of not paying top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most people don't leave because they want to make money,''
said Gordon Radley, president of Lucasfilm. ``The work is the issue
... They want to be in charge of their own shop, work in their own
environment.''

ADVERTISING: NATIONAL ADVERTISERS ARE UPBEAT ON THE ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ A luxury hotel on the Gulf of Mexico has little
in common with a home on the range. But the 89th annual conference
of the Association of National Advertisers, held at the
Ritz-Carlton, shared with that little house on the prairie the
absence of discouraging words.
</P>
<P>
   The recent events that have rocked the world's financial
markets, which have newspapers publishing and newscasters uttering
phrases like ``unnerving panic,'' ``how low can it go?'' and
``rapid selling,'' were barely mentioned at the general sessions of
the conference, which ended on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it was only in response to a question after an
upbeat speech that Robert A. Eckert, president and chief executive
of the Kraft Foods unit of Philip Morris Co., confirmed a report
this week in the trade publication Advertising Age that his company
had ``scaled back some brand advertising'' spending for the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And when the worldwide financial difficulties were discussed, as
in a speech by Harry S. Dent Jr., a financial consultant and
author, the outlook was uniformly rosy; Dent, for example, burbled
about the Dow Jones industrial average reaching 35,000 by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with increasingly common forecasts of a slowdown in
economic growth, if not outright recession, the topic was on the
minds of attendees at the conference. In interviews, they described
themselves as cautiously optimistic that the damage would be
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Next year ``will be a softer year relative to other years,''
said Ave Butensky, president of the Television Bureau of
Advertising, ``with a very modest increase in ad rates of 2 to 3
percent for television stations. But we see a pretty good 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not supposed to advertise when business is coming in
over the transom,'' he added. ``You're supposed to advertise when
business is hard to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph W. Ostrow, president of Cabletelevision Advertising
Bureau, said that if a recession led to cutbacks in spending on
advertising, ``I could even argue the point that cable would get a
bigger share of a diminished tie'' because of the growth in cable
network ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The astute marketer looks at a recession as a time to build
share,'' he said, ``when the competition may be pulling in their
horns.''
</P>
<P>
   Marnie Delaney, senior vice president and director for
advertising and marketing communications at Bank of America, a unit
of BankAmerica Corp., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes the value of brands these days,'' Ms.
Delaney said. ``I'm not sure we can afford not to invest in our
brand very aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   David G. Ropes, director for corporate advertising and
integrated marketing at Ford Motor Co., said the automaker
``remains committed to brand-building advertising regardless of the
economic climate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has become a strong believer in branding, so
there's absolutely no intention to cut spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several parts of the conference were devoted to interactive
advertising and marketing, which prompted this thought: If the
economy falls into recession, will spending on pitches on the
Internet be reduced, a variation on the last-hired, first-fired
school of recession employment attrition?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most new enterprises need to be protected,'' said John H.
Costello, the 1998-99 chairman of the Advertiser Association, who
is also senior executive vice president and general marketing
manager at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I worry about,'' he added, ``is if we as an industry will
continue to experiment with and test (new media) when we have tough
times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering our Darwinian period in marketing, where
results will be king,'' Costello said. ``Boom times or recession,
those media that demonstrate return on investment will capture a
greater portion of marketing dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Denis F. Beausejour, vice president for advertising at Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co., is at the forefront of interactive marketing as the
catalyst for FAST Forward, an Internet industry coalition dedicated
to accelerating the development of digital advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what will actually happen'' with the economy,
Beausejour said. ``I don't think any of us has a clear sense of
where bottom is.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``We normally don't cut experimentation and
research and development when times are tough. We're more likely in
times of trouble to look at extremely different ways to solve
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``if consumers cut discretionary spending,'' Beausejour
said, staying home rather than going out, ``I would bet time on
line might go up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the current economic problems, some
things never change. Among them are the annual election of officers
and bestowing of awards at advertising industry conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Costello, who had been the 1997-98 vice chairman of the
association, was elected chairman on Friday morning. He succeeded
James J. Garrity, senior vice president for advertising and brand
management at the First Union National Bank, a unit of First Union
Corp., who had been the 1997-98 chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph V. Tripodi, executive vice president for global marketing
at Mastercard International, was elected vice chairman for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   On the awards front, Matthew J. Dee, advertising production
director at Wendy's International Inc., was presented the Robert V.
Goldstein Award for his work as volunteer campaign director for the
4-H public service ads from the Advertising Council. The award is
named for a former board member of the association and the council.
</P>
<P>
   The conference also featured the presentation of the third
annual Casie Awards for effective interactive advertising and
marketing. Casie is the Coalition for Advertising Supported
Information and Entertainment, founded by the Advertiser
Association and the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G won for best interactive product ad for a campaign for Scope
mouthwash designed with Blue Marble ACG, a unit of MacManus Group,
which had a ``click rate'' among computer users of 30 percent. John
Hancock Variable Life Insurance Co., part of Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance, won for best interactive service ad for work produced by
the Modem Media.Poppe Tyson unit of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The award for the best packaged goods Web site went to Avon
Products Inc. for a site developed by Think New Ideas, part of the
Communicade unit of Omnicom Group. And the award for the best
corporate Web site went to Dell Computer Corp. for a site by the
Grey Interactive unit of Grey Advertising, which now generates an
average of $6 million a day in computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   And the trade publication Brandweek presented its Marketer of
the Year Awards for 1998 at a dinner at the conference. The top
honor, Grand Marketer, chosen from among winners in 16 categories,
went to Steve Wilhite, senior marketing executive for the
Volkswagen of America unit of Volkswagen AG, for the introduction
of the new Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a farewell honor for Wilhite; Advertising
Age reported that he would be leaving Volkswagen after nine years,
effective on Jan. 1, and would move to his hometown of San Diego
from the Detroit area.

BASEBALL COLUMN: YANKEES KEEP ONE EYE ON PADRES AND BROWN
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By MURRAY CHASS  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday night's Game 5 of the National League Championship Series
was critical for three teams: the Atlanta Braves, the San Diego
Padres and the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who are confident they will win their American
League Championship Series against Cleveland, had a good reason for
caring about the outcome of Monday night's game. His name is Kevin
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves won, Game 6 would be Wednesday in Atlanta and
Brown would pitch for the Padres. If the Padres won Game 5, the
series would be over and Brown could open the World Series at
Yankee Stadium on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would he able to pitch the first game, but if the
Padres so chose, he could also start Games 4 and 7. That's why
Monday night's game was critical to the Yankees. Not that they will
talk about the World Series and their preferences before they wrap
up the league series, but the Yankees don't want to face the
prospect of seeing Brown in three games, let alone two.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the Indians, for that matter. The Indians are included
here, as an afterthought perhaps, because they would be offended if
they thought they were being ignored, as though they had already
lost the series.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Indians could beat the Yankees on Tuesday night and
then Wednesday night; that's why they play the games instead of
rewarding pennants on the basis of what is supposed to happen. But
the Indians had their best chance when the series was in Cleveland
and squandered it.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Yankees to contend with Brown, an 18-game winner
with a 2.38 earned run average who has been even more dominant in
the postseason. In three starts, he has defeated the Houston Astros
twice and the Braves once, allowing one run and eight hits in 23
2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about a short series, Kevin Brown can make
a big difference,'' said Dave Dombrowski, general manager of the
Florida Marlins, for whom Brown pitched with mixed success in the
postseason last year.
</P>
<P>
   The intense right-hander allowed San Francisco one run in seven
innings, but was not the winning pitcher in a 2-1 victory that
sparked a sweep of the division series. Then he beat the Braves
twice in the league series, including Game 6, which sent the
Marlins to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, however, was not as overpowering in those two victories
as he was in his three-hit shutout of the Braves last Thursday. He
was not effective in the World Series, losing twice to the Indians,
who battered him for 10 runs in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Brown the Yankees would like to see if they meet in
the World Series, but he doesn't come with that kind of guarantee.
On the contrary, he is improving with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown really has stepped it up,'' said Doug Melvin, the Texas
general manager, who was joining the Rangers in 1994 as Brown was
leaving as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, a teammate for two years in Florida, said Brown, 33,
has expanded his pitching repertory in recent seasons. From being a
sinker-slider pitcher, he has added a four-seam fastball that
``stays on the same plane and explodes up.'' This year, Leiter
said, Brown began throwing a split-fingered fastball at the urging
of Dave Stewart, the Padres' highly capable pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   This is what awaits the Yankees, or the Indians (wink, wink).
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy, the Padres' manager, hasn't addressed his plans for
Brown in the World Series. He figured the team should get there
first before he sets a pitching rotation. But there's no question
how much stronger the Padres would be with Brown starting Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a pitcher started Games 1, 4 and 7 was in 1991
when Jack Morris did it and won the first and seventh games for the
Minnesota Twins. The last pitcher to start Games 1, 4 and 7 and win
all three was not Mickey Lolich of Detroit in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Lolich is the name that comes to mind when the question is
raised. He started and won three times, all right, but he pitched
Games 2, 5 and 7, starting the seventh game with only two days'
rest. No, the last pitcher to work and win Games 1, 4 and 7 was Bob
Gibson for St. Louis in 1967. In almost single-handedly beating
Boston with three complete games, Gibson allowed only three runs
and 14 hits in 27 innings.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of pitching Brown has been doing this
postseason, and that's exactly what the Yankees (Indians) don't
want to see, whether he pitches two games or three.
</P>
<P>
   In the division series against the Astros, Bochy started Brown
with three days' rest but had him scheduled for five days' rest for
his second start in the League Championship Series against the
Braves. The Yankees wouldn't mind if Bochy told him to take off the
rest of the year.

KNOBLAUCH'S MISCUE: FORGOTTEN, NOT GONE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Chuck Knoblauch was on the field at
Yankee Stadium, he made an awful mistake. He forgot to chase after
a loose ball. It was the sort of reaction that could get a
10-year-old second baseman benched, even if his father was the
coach. It is the sort of lapse that should never happen in a
major-league game, but it did.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch knows that now. After initially being defensive about
a terrible choice that enabled the go-ahead run to score and helped
vault the Cleveland Indians to a 4-1 victory in 12 innings over the
Yankees in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series,
Knoblauch relented and blamed himself the next day. And the day
after and the day after that.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has apologized for bickering with an umpire during a
sequence that was fraught with team mistakes and has admitted that
he ``screwed up.'' Is that enough for the Yankee fans who berated
Knoblauch when he batted after the bogus play last Wednesday? Is
Knoblauch safe from more taunting? Or will Tuesday night's
reactions in Game 6 be positive for 24 adored Yankees and negative
for the player who was dubbed ``Blauch Head'' by headline writers?
</P>
<P>
   That scenario should not materialize. The Yankees lead the
series, 3-2, and need to play nine sound innings to advance to the
World Series. That has been their goal since February and that is
what should matter to their fans Tuesday night. Not criticizing
Knoblauch. He doesn't deserve a standing ovation or any kind of
ovation, but Knoblauch should not be booed for a regrettable play
that has caused him to stop watching television and to seek advice
from Fran Pirozzolo, a team counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really doesn't matter,'' Knoblauch said when asked about
the possibility of being bathed in boos. ``They pay their money,
they can do whatever they want. Like I said, I'm concentrating on
the game only and not anything that takes place outside of the
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some fans might argue that spending $60 allows them
to use their vocal cords any way they choose. Even Knoblauch
mentioned that that is their prerogative. But New York fans are
constantly lauded for being so savvy. They stand and clap
rhythmically with two strikes on opposing hitters. They devise
creative K corners to count the strikeouts for pitchers. Jack
Russell terriers for David Cone, after he was bitten on the hand by
his mother's dog. Beer mugs for David Wells, no explanation
necessary. The fans in the bleachers even chant each starter's name
to elicit waves during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better place for a big game than Yankee Stadium,''
Cone said. ``It is center stage. There's no place like it in all of
sports. You feed off the crowd here.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. So how would it look if these shrewd fans booed the
first Yankee to bat Tuesday night? How would it look if a team that
has 120 victories hears boos for the player who scored two
important runs and started a crucial double play in Game 5? It
would look and sound silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to boo him, then they might as well boo every
one of us because we're all a team,'' Wells said. ``We're all in
this together. So we win together and we lose together.''
</P>
<P>
   After Knoblauch's brain cramp, he was rightfully compared to
Bill Buckner, and there was a theory that this unforgettable play
would plague him for the rest of his career if the Yankees lost the
series to the Indians. But even that notion seems stale. Knoblauch
has played well in the three games since his mistake. If the Yanks
drop the next two, is it suddenly Knoblauch's fault because of
something that happened last week? That is foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they focus on us being up, 3-2,'' Joe Girardi said.
``Chuck is not the reason we lost that game anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wells does not think Knoblauch has been rescued yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work out, he's going to be criticized about
that for the rest of his Yankee career,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was terse about the play and about fans Monday. It has
been a topsy-turvy season and he has numerous reasons for hoping
the Yankees march into the World Series. If Knoblauch's miscue has
not been forgiven by Tuesday night, it should be if the Yankees win
the series. Actually, only the fans can make that happen by letting
go. Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play the game,'' Knoblauch said. ``I'm not
worried about how any fans react. I'm worried about winning the
game.''

LIFE TURNS ABSURD FOR THE NEW YORK ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Islanders, a proud team that won the Stanley Cup
four times from 1980 to 1983, find themselves in a sports opera
bouffe, a landlord-tenant dispute gone wacky.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the team abandoned Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale,
N.Y., declaring it unsafe for fans, beer men or goalies, but
returned by court order after National Hockey League inspectors had
declared that conditions at the arena posed no danger.
</P>
<P>
   Life has turned absurd at the Uniondale arena, where 24 banners
representing long-ago glories hang from exposed rafters. The team
is fighting legal issues with Nassau County and SMG, its landlord,
a credibility gap with fans who say the safety argument is a ploy
for a new arena and dubious news media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While 15 arenas have opened in the NHL since 1993, the
26-year-old Coliseum remains a shabby presence on Hempstead
Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure this franchise can be healthy for the
long term,'' Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, said Monday. He
stepped into talks with the county on financing a new arena when
the team's owners withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for a team to be stable in an antiquated
building with a difficult lease,'' he added. ``We can't guarantee
success, but we guarantee we'll work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few franchises in major sports long for stability more the
Islanders. In late 1996, John Spano appeared from Dallas, promising
$165 million and a free-spending, hands-on style. But he never had
the money and pleaded guilty to federal bank and wire fraud
charges, and handed the franchise back to John Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners _ Howard Milstein, a billionaire real-estate
magnate, and Steven Gluckstern, an insurance executive _ are angry
but resolute, believing they were stonewalled on safety by SMG,
certain that the Coliseum was unsafe when lawyers advised the team
to leave, and positive the building attained habitability only
after they filed the federal lawsuit against SMG.
</P>
<P>
   And is it safe now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know,'' said David Seldin, president of New
York Sports Ventures, which owns the team. ``Our owners are not
willing to make short-term decisions to be popular when an
unpopular decision may be better for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on Saturday night, during the season opener against the
Pittsburgh Penguins, fans were not too willing to believe the
owners. They wanted the team to sign Ziggy Palffy, its star player,
and stifle its rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   When Pittsburgh jumped in front by 4-0 in the first period, Bill
Cox and his buddies in Section 311 began a derisive chant, ``We
want Spano!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck,'' said his friend Tim Brown, ``we want Roy Boe!''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the strangeness of life in Uniondale, where fans chant
the name of a disgraced owner, and the founding owner, who sold the
team to Pickett, whom fans disliked for his parsimony, who sold it
to Spano. ``Welcome to the twilight zone,'' said Cox, who lives in
Valley Stream.
</P>
<P>
   Said Matt Pilla, of Ozone Park: ``There's nothing wrong with the
arena. It's the lease.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's mandate to play in the Coliseum forestalled the
Islanders' playing home games at Madison Square Garden or
Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J.; at arenas in Hartford,
New Haven or Philadelphia, or at an ice rink near you.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the court order, Gluckstern and Milstein withdrew from
talks about building an arena after Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau
county executive, called the team a ``pig at the trough'' and left
Bettman to negotiate the team's future.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Torrey can hardly fathom his former team's predicament. ``I
spent 20 years there when it was as good as it could get,'' said
Torrey, the general manager from the team's inception through 1993,
when he moved to the Florida Panthers. ``I hate to see this
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Westfall, an original Islander, shook his head dolefully.
``What's important is to get a competitive team, have the building
bulge and fall apart from the noise, then ask for a new arena,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   New woes arose Saturday night, when Fox Sports New York refused
to televise the opener for lack of advertising. During the game,
Seldin complained that the scoreboard had no video replays but
sprouted a steady drip of water and that the ticket windows were so
understaffed, some fans missed the game's first half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   The team's lawsuit against SMG alleges that the landlord
breached the lease by ignoring safety hazards. If the team wins, it
could forge a new lease with the county, or move within the region,
to Suffolk County, or to Queens, where the team would like to
relocate to the retractable-dome stadium being planned by the Mets
beside Shea Stadium. An executive involved in the discussions said
the Islanders approached the Mets about moving to the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they set themselves on fire,'' said Wes Westley, the
SMG president. ``I've never seen anything like this in sports where
right before the season starts, a team evicts itself.'' Westley
denied the team's core allegation: that the hoists supporting the
scoreboard and sound system were unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, SMG has replaced the hoists and removed the sound
system; the team said that would not have happened without the
lawsuit and stunning move from the arena.
</P>
<P>
   If the team loses the case, bankruptcy or relocation could loom,
but leaving the market would mean losing $13 million a year from
Fox Sports New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best solution is a new arena,'' Seldin said. ``If we win,
the objective is to have the team on Long Island, but Long Island
is bigger than one town.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman and the county are discussing the framework for
financing a new arena in Uniondale, adjacent to the Coliseum, and
are not discussing any other site, or commercial development on the
70-acre location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the owners will participate on the terms we
negotiate,'' said Bill Daly, the NHL's senior vice president for
legal affairs. ``That'll be their decision. It could be that a deal
we negotiate may be good for another owner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Westley said he had not considered whether SMG would buy the
team to protect its investment under the lease, in which it shares
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   League and county officials are to meet for a second time on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to work from the owners' and the county's standpoint,
or it won't get built,'' Bettman said. ``That's a situation I don't
want to contemplate.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams, landlords and municipalities often clash, especially in
an era when franchises threaten to skip to cities that promise
arenas or stadiums with increased revenues. But although the
Islanders have one of the NHL's worst leases _ they get no money
from parking and concessions _ they did not have the leverage of
another city in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Devils alleged that the New Jersey Sports
and Exposition Authority had breached its Continental Arena lease,
but they had a sweetheart deal _ a new Nashville arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you're terminating your lease days before the season
with nowhere else to play is as strange as it gets,'' said Marc
Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd., a consulting firm. ``Safety
seemed to be the hook to get out of their lease.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash of egos and issues pitting the Islanders against the
county and SMG has been gaudy. At different times, Gulotta has
accused SMG and the Islanders of holding a gun to the county's
head. ``I was not overly pleased with the way SMG functioned in the
past,'' Gulotta said, ``but their level of performance did not
justify the Islanders' action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hardball negotiating,'' said Gulotta, who is happy to
negotiate with Bettman rather than the owners he mistrusts. ``Team
owners will come and go, but the league will remain in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders threw off their gloves by creating a Web site
_``www.coliseum-coverup.com'' _ to explain the alleged breaches and
the reasons that ``constructive eviction'' occurred at the arena.
Visitors to the Web site can access letters, reports and the
federal lawsuit, under headings like ``Political Smoke and Coliseum
Mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Seldin: ``There's been a lot of skepticism. It's an
accurate description of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman described it as ``an intriguing function of the new
media.''
</P>
<P>
   The team and SMG also dueled in competing full-page
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real Idea Is Not to Hurt the One You Love,'' was the
headline on an Oct. 2 Islanders' advertisement in Newsday. A few
pages away was an ad from SMG, vowing that the arena ``remains the
safe, secure place that holds many great memories for us all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' situation is an odd wrinkle in the league's
portfolio of franchise problems. ``From early on, the sense was
clear that the building situation on Long Island was going to be an
issue,'' Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern and Milstein had two major advantages: they were rich
_ their wealth was well known _ and neither was John Spano. ``We
thought they were white knights,'' said Steve Ellers, head of the
Save the Islanders Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are not only the richest in Islanders history, but
also the most aggressive. ``It's probably a shock to SMG and the
county to be up against such tough businessmen,'' said Pickett,
adding that he never asked to renegotiate his lease and paid $15
million to improve the Coliseum. ``Maybe I shouldn't have been so
passive and butted heads.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the relationship between the Islanders' new
owners and SMG, there was strife. Before they completed the deal
with Pickett in February, SMG demanded a document requiring them to
declare what they felt was wrong with the arena. The owners
refused, Bettman intervened and the demand was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   SMG's demand surprised the owners, but Seldin said: ``We didn't
think there were safety issues. There were 12,000 seats in
disarray. But was it a moment of `uh-oh'? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying to absolve ourselves of responsibility,''
said Westley said. ``We said, `If there's something wrong, tell us
now and flush it out.'''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship deteriorated from there, culminating with the
team leaving the arena. What now? The team lost by 3-0 to Boston
Monday, and travels to Tampa Bay and St. Louis before returning to
its beleaguered home next Wednesday. But hockey seems like the
least important activity at the coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the arena Saturday night _ ``Wrestling Monday''_
heralded what may continue to be the most riveting sport in Nassau
County.

<P>
   The NBA may be involved in a lockout, but Houston-area fans can
still see some of the game's biggest stars playing a little
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Linda McIngvale, owners of Westside Tennis Club, site of
the Rockets' practice facility, announced Monday they will sponsor
the Gallery Furniture Charity Basketball Game, to be held at 7:30
p.m. Oct. 23 at Hofheinz Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The game, which will benefit the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,
came about through the efforts of the McIngvales and former Rockets
guard Kenny Smith, who wanted to put on a showcase for NBA players
who have been locked out of training camps and have been working
out locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that we have a lot of professional basketball
players playing here at Westside through the week,'' Jim McIngvale
said. ``They were looking to play some real games, so my wife,
Linda, myself, Kenny Smith and (San Antonio's) Avery Johnson and
some of the other players came up with the idea for a charity
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Committing to play in the game are San Antonio's Tim Duncan,
David Robinson and Johnson; Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim;
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Stephon Marbury; Seattle's Vin Baker
and Gary Payton; Boston's Kenny Anderson; Denver's Nick Van Exel;
Portland's Rasheed Wallace and Damon Stoudamire; New Jersey's Sam
Cassell; Atlanta's Steve Smith and Chucky Brown; Sacramento's Otis
Thorpe; Cleveland's Derek Anderson; Indiana's Mark Jackson;
Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse; Toronto's Kevin Willis; the Rockets'
Mario Elie; and the Lakers' Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   More players are expected to commit in the next few days,
including some ``surprise announcements,'' according to Smith, who
said more big names may volunteer to play. In fact, Smith is
working his Carolina connections in an effort to land the biggest
name of all _ former Tar Heel Michael Jordan _ for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(There has been) no direct contact with Michael, but we've put
out some different kites to everyone (connected with Jordan),''
Smith said. ``We're trying to get everyone in the NBA involved. I'm
getting calls constantly from guys interested in playing and
enthusiastic about the whole situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been myself, Avery Johnson, Sam Cassell and a lot of guys
networking together. It's easy to catch people at this time of year
because they expected to be playing at this time of year, so
they're in their home cities working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will coach one team while former Rocket and current
University of Houston basketball coach Clyde Drexler will run the
ship for the other team, splitting the players via a draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his (Drexler's) coaching debut,'' Smith said.
``Hopefully, I can spoil it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, which will range from $20 to $100, go on sale Friday.
The game will be the first to be played at the revamped Hofheinz
Pavilion, which will feature a new scoreboard and a new sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing to this entire event is that 100 percent of the
money from ticket sales will be given to the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center,'' Jim McIngvale said. ``If we sell out this event, as we
hope we will, that will be about $300,000 for the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Westside Tennis Club also has been busy providing NBA players
with an outlet to keep their skills sharp until the lockout is
resolved. Several players are participating in the Westside lockout
league, which is played Monday and Wednesday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was basically the guards' idea,'' Horry said. ``Avery, Sam
and them. The guards, they run the show, so they said, `Let's do a
little league, get some refs in here and try to make it a game-like
situation.'''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best place to start is with the fish that were
staring up from the clear mountain lake and had the faces of people
from the traveler's childhood. It was 1954, and the traveler, a
very tired Czech filmmaker lost for 14 months in Tibet, had put his
feet in the water to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there was Novak, a neighbor from the street of his
childhood, swimming in on the right. There was Bitnar floating on
the left. When Novak and Bitnar started to nibble at the
filmmaker's toes, he quickly pulled his feet from the water _ and
later, back home in Prague, Czechoslovakia, told the story to his
wide-eyed 5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Move forward 44 years, to a small SoHo studio on Elizabeth
Street, where Peter Sis, the now grown-up but in some ways still
wide-eyed son, was telling the story on his own last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father,'' he said, ``has got obviously a very vivid
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   So, obviously, does the son: He is a filmmaker, writer and
illustrator (and goose-egg painter) who has turned his father's
lost journey into his latest and most personal children's book,
``Tibet: Through the Red Box.'' Actually, the soon-to-be-published
book is too full of things adult _ the communist takeover of
Czechoslovakia, a grown-up son's questions about whether the Tibet
of his father's stories ever existed _ to be really for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the child inside all of us, or something like that,''
said Sis, 49, who has the dark, soulful looks of a European actor
and the besotted nature of a father of young children who finds
magic in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear Madeleine,'' he wrote to his 6-year-old daughter in
the dedication of one of his earlier children's books, ``The Three
Golden Keys,'' about his childhood in Prague. ``You might never
speak Czech. You may prefer other parts of this beautiful planet _
blue seas, green islands, bustling metropolises. You are free.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stirrings of ``Tibet'' began across a different pair
of generations in 1994, when Sis' father sent him a letter from
Prague. ``He said, `We have to talk about what I will leave you,'''
Sis said. ``It really spooked me.'' One of those things was a red
lacquer box, forever locked, containing his father's diary from
Tibet. Sis' mother filled in the rest by phone: his father had
prostate cancer. Sis flew to Prague, made arrangements for
treatment, opened the red box, and read all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strange feeling,'' he said, ``because I was
reading the diary of somebody who was still alive, but 45 years
younger.''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered no horrible secrets _ his father had kept the
diary locked because of a generic fear of communist government
officials _ but far more detail in the stories he had heard so many
times during his childhood. In the fall of 1953, his father,
Vladimir Sis, had been drafted into an army film unit to record the
building of a mountain highway in what was described as a remote
western province of China. But when a wall of the mountain broke
off, destroying the road, the elder Sis was separated from the
project, and lost in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Many strange things happened.
</P>
<P>
   In a forest of giant rhododendrons, a boy covered with jingle
bells delivered a letter to Vladimir Sis from his family in Prague.
Sis, astonished, gave the boy a pair of scissors, and the boy tried
them out on the leaves, then stayed by the fire that night.
Vladimir Sis hoped the boy would help him find his way, but the
next morning he was gone. Then he noticed an unusual cut on a leaf,
and then another, that led him out of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? ``It's his story,'' Sis said. ``But who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1954, Vladimir Sis had made his way to Lhasa,
Tibet, where he met the Dalai Lama, then 19, who gave him a shawl
as a gift. In 1959, long after Sis left, the Dalai Lama fled the
Chinese army and began what is now almost 40 years in exile. That
is not in Sis' book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to turn the book into good and bad,'' Sis said.
</P>
<P>
   Sis grew up in a large gray house in Prague, and since his
mother was an artist she allowed him to paint pictures on chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Sis went to the Royal College of Art in London, made animated
films, moved to Los Angeles, met the children's author Maurice
Sendak, then drove across country to begin a career as an
illustrator in Manhattan. ``I remember driving around it, and I
couldn't find the entrance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sis has since done thousands of illustrations for newspapers and
magazines, including The New York Times. He has written 14
children's books and illustrated 27 others. He is married, has two
children, and on Easter 1995 he presented a painted goose egg to
President Clinton at the White House. His artist friends said he
was selling out, but Sis wanted a story for his children, which he
got when his daughter somehow got hold of the egg during the formal
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine dropped the egg, of course, so I threw myself at the
feet of the president _ it was the ultimate nightmare of the
immigrant _ and caught the egg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His father is still alive. ``He's OK _ it's a strange feeling,''
said Sis. ``Well, actually, it's a good feeling. I did the book in
a hurry because I thought it would be too late.'' This summer, Sis
presented the Dalai Lama with an early copy of his book, and gave
him a second present wrapped in the same shawl that the Dalai Lama
had given his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remembered everything about it,'' Sis said. ``There was
something said about a full circle.''

 &HT;    Who's wearing conservative stripes?
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One candidate is a Republican businessman who talks
about cutting the size of state government. The other candidate is
a Democratic lawyer under attack as too liberal for the state.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate has made cracking down on school discipline the
keynote of his education program. He's for after-school programs to
keep students off the streets and a 10 p.m. school night curfew.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the state needs to concentrate on accountability
rather than launching off into another big reform movement. As for
higher education, any new money would probably be targeted at
vocational education.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidate wants to hire 7,500 new teachers and spend
$375 million for new classrooms to meet the goal of reducing
elementary school class sizes by 20 percent. Salaries for new
teachers would be increased 15 percent, and they would be required
to have a higher college grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   Students would be monitored in annual standardized tests.
Teachers who do well on the statewide teacher tests and their
students' tests would receive $472 million in bonuses over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been following the governor's race, it's obvious that
the candidates and their education platforms haven't been placed in
parallel order in the preceding paragraphs. It is actually Roy
Barnes, the Democrat, who is preaching discipline and retrenchment,
while Guy Millner, the Republican, is the advocate of more teachers
with higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   An outsider would easily be confused, however. By the measure of
any conservative theory from Edmund Burke to Newt Gingrich, there
is something infernally skewed in the way ideological lines have
been drawn in this race.
</P>
<P>
   On what voters say is their most important issue this year, the
labels have been mismatched. Whichever plan is better for the
state, Barnes' position is clearly to the right of Millner's.
</P>
<P>
   This confusing situation is a result of the way education has
developed as an issue in the South over the past 30 years. Millner
is following in the footsteps of Republican governors such as
Tennessee's Lamar Alexander, who campaigned in Georgia for him
recently. They leaned more conservative on some issues, but pushed
as aggressively for big school packages as Democrats Terry Sanford
in North Carolina and William Winter in Mississippi once did.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, on the other hand, has less temptation to push big
programs of his own when he is also running as the custodian of
Zell Miller's legacy. In what amounts to a significant departure in
the South, certainly in Democratic politics, he's running on the
proposition that the era of reform has run its course and a period
of consolidation should begin.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the very different education proposals being made in
the governor's race didn't come up much Sunday in the GPTV debate
of school superintendent candidates, sponsored by the Atlanta Press
Club. Perhaps that's another sign of how the issue has become
disconnected from its philosophical moorings.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes and Millner education programs offer voters a clear
choice. It's just that the choices don't jibe with all the other
liberal-conservative rhetoric of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the tax issue. There, you have a candidate who'd favor
middle-class homeowners by increasing the homestead exemption
against a candidate taking the more populist approach of
eliminating the car tax.

SPECIAL ENVOY TO WORLD'S FAIR 
FINALLY GOT A SEAT  
 A REALISTIC TRIBUTE
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By JAMES BARRON with ALAN FEUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a Democratic donor _ he gave more than $480,000 to the
Democratic National Committee from 1991 to 1996 _ and in 1994 he
and his wife stayed overnight at the White House. Now the donor,
William Rollnick, and his wife, photographer Nancy Ellison, are
being sent to the next World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton named Rollnick to head the U.S. effort for
Expo 2000, which is scheduled to be held in Hanover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``My killer title,'' Rollnick said, ``is special envoy and
personal representative of the president of the United States. It
has a certain lilt to it.'' How does he say it in German? ``My
German is terrible,'' he said. ``I can hire people who speak
German.''
</P>
<P>
   The president named Ms. Ellison the deputy commissioner general.
</P>
<P>
   Rollnick, a former chief executive of Genstar Rental Electric,
said he took the job when the president called and began the
conversation by saying, ``Billy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only my mother and the president of the United States call me
Billy,'' Rollnick said, ``and my mother is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Clinton asked him to take the job. ``I said, `Of
course,''' Rollnick said. ``How can you say no? I said, `What's our
budget?' He said, `Depends on how much you raise.'''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is $45 million for a nonprofit foundation connected
with the fair. Rollnick will oversee the design and operation of
the U.S. pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Rollnick said the invitation to stay at the White House came
after he and his wife accepted an invitation to a benefit in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I thought was, it was a joke,'' he said. And
no, Clinton did not put him in the Lincoln Bedroom. ``I slept in a
bedroom upstairs across from where his mother used to play poker
with her buddies. I don't know if the room had a name, but I
thought it was a wonderful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Got a Seat
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You never know how people will react to secondhand
furniture. Rufino Lopez discovered this when he bought the dining
chairs that had been at Daniel, the restaurant in Manhattan that
Daniel Boulud closed in August.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez moved them to Irvington and put them in the back room at
his new restaurant there, Solera II.
</P>
<P>
   A woman walked in the other day. She did not want to eat
anything. ``No,'' she said, ``I just want to sit in one of these
chairs. I could never get a reservation at that place in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   A Realistic Tribute
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no unveiling of the new Nelson Shanks
portrait of mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves. It was not veiled to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there much time for artistic contemplation: Shanks, a
realist painter who did the last commissioned portrait from life of
Diana, princess of Wales, finished his ``demonstration portrait''
of Ms. Graves in less than three hours. He worked in front of 300
art students and painters, two video cameras and a microphone at
the Art Student's League on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Graves, starring as Dalila in ``Samson et Dalila'' at the
Metropolitan Opera, seemed to enjoy sitting for Shanks. She said
that while she was accustomed to working live in front of crowds,
it was a strange pleasure to play to just one person, Shanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it felt like a dance,'' she said. ``Sometimes I
could actually feel where he was on my face _ my mouth or my
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanks, who plans to paint a new, 7-foot image of Ms. Graves for
the National Gallery in Washington in the spring, sounded please by
her review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Denyce was happily surprised to see so many
recognizable parts of herself on the canvas so quickly,'' he said.

BRUCE WILLIAMSON, 71, FILM CRITIC AT PLAYBOY

 (ATTN: Mich.)   (ll) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Williamson, a longtime film critic and
contributing editor at Playboy magazine, died on Tuesday at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was bladder cancer, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson began writing film criticism for Time magazine in the
1960s, worked briefly for Life magazine and then joined Playboy in
1968. He was the magazine's film critic until his retirement in
June.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reviewing, Williamson interviewed actors and
contributed articles on other movie-related subjects. During the
1980s and '90s he wrote a movie column for New Woman magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson was born in Cadillac, Mich., went to New York in 1949
and had a brief career as an actor, appearing in several
productions off-Broadway and on television.
</P>
<P>
   He also began to write and eventually joined Julius Monk's
cabaret group, ``Upstairs at the Downstairs,'' for which he wrote
topical humor pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Shirley Sealy; a daughter,
Stephanie, from his only marriage; two sisters, Alberta Van Brunt
of Owasso, Mich., and Janette Van Rhee of Middleville, Mich., and
two grandchildren. &QL;

   West Nkosi, a saxophonist, songwriter and producer who helped
bring South African music to the outside world, died on Thursday in
Johannesburg, South Africa, from injuries he had received in a car
crash in August, said an executive of Gallo Records, where Nkosi
had made hits since the 1960s. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, Nkosi was a prime mover of South
African music, combining traditional elements with pop. By signing
and acting as producer for the a cappella choir Ladysmith Black
Mambazo, he set the direction for iscathamiya, Ladysmith's
``stalking style,'' with its quiet and loud passages.
</P>
<P>
   As a producer and the saxophonist for the band Makgona Tsohle,
he shaped the style called sax jive and then the music that grew
out of it, called mbaqanga (named after a homemade stew) or
mgqashiyo, ``the indestructible beat.'' It was the beat that Paul
Simon used for many of the songs on the 1986 album ``Graceland,''
which also featured Ladysmith Black Mambazo's vocals.
</P>
<P>
   To create mbaqanga, Nkosi said in a 1990 interview, ``we took a
little bit from each individual tribe, put them together and made
one solid rhythm that could cater to all the South African
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Nkosi's recordings can be heard on a series of
collections called ``The Indestructible Beat of Soweto''
(Shanachie).
</P>
<P>
   Nkosi was born in Nelspruit, South Africa, and went to
Johannesburg when he was 16. His first instrument was a penny
whistle, the lead instrument in a South African pop style called
kwela, and he was in a band led by Spokes Mashiyane, a well-known
kwela musician. As kwela gave way to sax jive, Nkosi took up the
alto saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   The Makgona Tsohle band was formed in 1962 and became the Gallo
Records studio band through the 1960s and 1970s, playing
instrumentals and backing vocal groups, like a South African
equivalent of the Stax Records studio band Booker T. and the
M.G.'s. Nkosi wrote more than 100 songs and was heard on hundreds
of recordings.
</P>
<P>
   While working with Makgona Tsohle, Nkosi became a producer with
Mavuthela, the black-music division of Gallo Records. He signed
Ladysmith Black Mambazo after hearing them on the radio in Durban,
on South Africa's east coast, and produced 22 albums for the group,
which merges Zulu traditional styles with gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Every album released by Ladysmith Black Mambazo has been a gold
album (selling 25,000 copies) in South Africa, and some have sold
more than 200,000 copies there. ``Nobody wanted to record that kind
of music, without guitars,'' Nkosi said in an interview for ``The
Rough Guide to World Music'' (1994). ``But I took it up and it
worked out good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nkosi had hits of his own, notably the sax-jive tune ``2
Mabone'' (``Two Headlights'') in the 1970s, which spawned a dance
craze and answer records like ``4 Mabone'' and ``6 Mabone.'' His
best-known mbaqanga production was Mahlathini and the Mahotella
Queens, a deep bass ``groaner'' and a female harmony group, who
adapted traditional Zulu wedding songs to a pop format.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Makgona Tsohle, the group became hugely popular in
South Africa in the 1960s and '70s, and was discovered
internationally in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Nkosi continued to produce music for Gallo Records through the
'90s, recording, among others, the Zulu traditional singer
Phuzekemisi and Zulu-style pop with Joe Mifela. ``He had hits all
the time,'' said Ivor Haarburger, the executive director of Gallo
Records.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Thami, and three daughters.

RICHARD DENNING, 84, ACTOR ON `HAWAII FIVE-0'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Hawaii, Ore.)   (ll) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Denning, a character actor who was perhaps best known
for his roles in the television series ``Mr. and Mrs. North'' and
``Hawaii Five-O,'' died on Sunday at the Palomar Medical Center in
Escondido, Calif. He was 84 and lived in Rancho Bernardo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Born Louis Albert Heindrich Denninger in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
Denning moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was 2. After
graduating from Woodbury College in Montpelier, Vt., he joined his
father in the garment business and worked his way up from office
boy to vice president. But the acting bug had bitten him in
college, and he switched professions.
</P>
<P>
   After a night-school course in drama and performances in a small
theater in Los Angeles, Denning won a radio-acting contest that
lead to a screen test and a Paramount contract in 1937. Tall and
blond with a chiseled jaw, Denning appeared in some 50 films from
1937 to his enlistment in the Navy submarine service in 1942.
``Beyond the Blue Horizon,'' in which he was cast opposite Dorothy
Lamour, was his favorite, said his daughter, Diana Dee Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   After serving three years in the South Pacific, Denning returned
to film work, appearing in such movies as ``Some Like It Hot,''
``The Creature From the Black Lagoon,'' ``Adam Had Four Sons,''
``The Lady Takes a Flyer'' and ``An Affair to Remember,'' in which
he played Deborah Kerr's fiance.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s and early '50s, he starred with Lucille Ball
in the CBS radio comedy ``My Favorite Husband,'' succeeding Lee
Bowman in the role of a Midwestern banker married to Miss Ball's
harebrained wife. His performance led to the television series
``Mr. and Mrs. North,'' in which he starred with Barbara Britton;
his other television credits included ``Flying Doctor,'' ``Michael
Shayne'' and ``Karen.''
</P>
<P>
   Denning's final role was as the governor of Hawaii, which he
played for 12 years on ``Hawaii Five-O.''
</P>
<P>
   Denning's first wife, Evelyn Ankers, died in 1985. In addition
to his daughter by Ms. Ankers, Ms. Dwyer of Hawi, Hawaii, he is
survived by his wife, Patricia Leffingwell of Rancho Bernardo and
Kihei, Hawaii; four stepchildren, Mike Salzer of Kihei; Gay Salzer
of Honolulu; Jackie Jacobson of Klamath Falls, Ore., and Sandy
Salzer of Mariposa, Calif., and two granddaughters.

GAME ON: UCLA VS. MIAMI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They have no flight, no hotel, no kickoff time and
no television contract.
</P>
<P>
   But they've got a game.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA and Miami have rescheduled their canceled game for Dec. 5
in the Orange Bowl, assuming the schools agree on a start time. The
Bruins want to play at 12:30 p.m. (PST) so they can travel Friday.
Playing at 9 a.m. would necessitate traveling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, I was inclined to play,'' UCLA
athletic director Peter Dalis said. ``If it happened to us and we
had an earthquake and needed a team to (reschedule), I'd hope they
would do it. That was the most prevalent part of my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, UCLA announced tailback Jermaine Lewis has been
reinstated following a one-game suspension for fighting. He'll play
Saturday against No.11 Oregon but won't start.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Lewis-less victory at Arizona and subsequent climb to
No.2 in the rankings did not affect the decision to play Miami,
Dalis said. He had hoped to finalize the matter last week but
didn't speak to Miami athletic director Paul Dee until Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dalis and I) wanted to play,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
``Arizona had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which owned the rights to the Sept. 26 game, is scheduled
to show the Army-Navy football game and the Miami-Kentucky
basketball game Dec. 5. But Dee assured Dalis the football game
will be televised, perhaps by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA basketball team also plays that day, against Oklahoma
State in the Wooden Classic at 4:15 p.m. The football game should
finish before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the cancellation, Toledo and Dalis voiced
several concerns about rescheduling: Fans weren't keen on playing a
game after USC; it would eliminate a critical recruiting weekend;
and it would extend the season by two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players were not real interested in extending the
season,'' Dalis said. ``I can't blame them. They've got lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But team sentiment shifted after the 52-28 victory in Tucson. No
one knows if playing Miami will help or hurt UCLA's national
championship drive _ if the Hurricanes are 5-5, the game could
damage UCLA's strength-of-schedule rating _ but the Bruins don't
want to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be sitting back in December being mad at
ourselves because the game slipped away and we're in the Rose
Bowl,'' offensive tackle Kris Farris said. ``I never thought the
Rose Bowl would be second-best. But to be that close (to the Fiesta
Bowl) and not obtain our goal is terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lewis practiced Monday for the first time since his
Oct. 6 suspension. He and Elonza Malone III have filed battery
complaints against each other following an off-campus fight in the
early hours of Oct. 4. Campus police have not concluded their
investigation, but Toledo is satisfied with the length of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a lot of people and police and came to the
conclusion that he has suffered enough,'' Toledo said. ``A one-game
suspension for what happened, in my opinion, is enough. He didn't
throw the first punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he does not know Malone and called the incident a
misunderstanding. He said he was hit twice before fighting back _
``It was self defense'' _ and a plethora of witnesses will confirm
his version of events to the police.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the weekend at home in Lancaster, watching the Bruins
on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I let my teammates down,'' he said. ``I was
depressed. I had a hard time sleeping (last week). During practice,
I sat on a car (in an adjacent parking structure) and watched. It
was rough. It was the longest week of my life.''

CANDIDATES RISK LITTLE WITH HARSH ADS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-NY) 
 (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a Sunday morning service recently, the Rev. Floyd
Flake went to the pulpit of his church in Queens and urged the
candidates for the U.S. Senate, Alfonse D'Amato and Charles
Schumer, to cease their ``dirty campaign.'' They were doing
themselves a disservice and would ultimately turn voters away from
an important political contest, Flake told the congregation, which
included D'Amato that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Flake got the answer to his plea two days later. D'Amato, the
Republican incumbent, released three new advertisements attacking
Schumer (``Chuck Schumer consistently votes against us,'' the
announcer says in one), while Schumer, a Democratic congressman
from Brooklyn, slashed into D'Amato's environmental record,
asserting that ``people are wise to his act.''
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders like Flake, and some voters, might frown on such
politicking _ thrashing the opponent, rather than advancing one's
own record and accomplishments _ but the candidates and their
advisers in this pivotal Senate race have concluded that they have
no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   The unrelenting attacks _ on voting records, on ethics, on
political ideology, even on the place that Schumer calls home _ are
the inevitable result of a competition that features a relatively
unpopular incumbent fighting for re-election in a Democratic state,
and a relatively little-known challenger trying to knock out one of
the most resourceful figures in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Flake's concerns notwithstanding, the candidates and their
strategists have decided that the risks of ``going negative'' are
far outweighed by the effectiveness of such politicking. The
finger-pointing between Schumer and D'Amato about who started it,
and who has been more negative, might present intriguing questions
for historians one day, but it is unlikely to influence many voters
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll underscores their
judgment. By any objective measure, the campaign between Schumer
and D'Amato is about as negative as they come _ it is, arguably,
the most negative Senate race in the nation this fall _ yet 54
percent of voters said it was no more negative than D'Amato's last
contest, in 1992, against Robert Abrams. In fact, 14 percent said
it was more positive.
</P>
<P>
   More voters blame D'Amato for the tone of the race, by 34
percent to 26 percent, and slightly more are inclined to think
D'Amato's attacks are unfair, instead of the ones offered by
Schumer, the Times/CBS News Poll found. But there is no evidence of
voters punishing the candidates for what they see as tactical
transgressions. Three weeks of punch-for-punch campaigning have
produced a statistical dead heat for the candidates, the Times/CBS
News poll found.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,066 registered voters in New York state,
taken from Oct. 1 to Oct. 6, has a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the campaign has devolved to this level so fast is
certainly not a surprise to anyone familiar with the dynamics of
the race or its two tenacious contestants. ``Neither of these guys
had a choice; it was inscribed the day before the primary,'' said
Norman Adler, a political analyst from New York who is not
affiliated with either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But though both have embraced the same tactic, they have done it
for different reasons, and that is revealing of the shortcomings
and political positions Schumer and D'Amato find themselves in this
year.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's motivates can be determined from a cursory reading of
any public opinion poll: The three-term senator invariably scores
less than 50 percent against his opponent. In the Times/CBS News
Poll, 41 percent of registered voters said they would support him.
That is not good for an incumbent who has been in office for 18
years, since by this point, there is little that D'Amato can tell
undecided voters to win them over.
</P>
<P>
   That means that D'Amato must provide them with reasons not to
support Schumer, which he has been doing since the night Schumer
won the Democratic primary (and as the senator has done in all of
his statewide races in New York).
</P>
<P>
   To this end, D'Amato has combed through 23 years of Schumer's
legislative record, picking out votes _ some on major pieces of
legislation, and others on procedural or inconsequential matters _
to portray the congressman as liberal or hostile to upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he has seized on the fact that Schumer, who has
for most of his career had a strong attendance record in Congress,
missed more than 100 votes this year as he attended to his campaign
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's attacks on D'Amato have been no less brutal. Schumer's
challenge has been built on one overarching theme: that D'Amato is
a chronic liar. (``Too many lies for too long'' is the last line of
most commercials, a slogan so harsh that it appears to have taken
even D'Amato's breath away).
</P>
<P>
   It is a broad pre-emptive attack intended to inoculate Schumer
against any criticism D'Amato might come up with between now and
Nov. 3, by stirring what polls suggest are strong doubts about
D'Amato's trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   As an all-encompassing theme, Schumer's approach pushes the
horizon of negative campaigning, and could, if Schumer wins, be
remembered as a political benchmark one day. Early indications are
that it is successful. The Times/CBS News Poll shows that Schumer
continues to have a generally favorable rating among voters,
suggesting that D'Amato's attacks have yet to stick.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's confrontational strategy has two other unstated
purposes. First, it was designed to catch the attention of
Democratic contributors across the country who were deciding where
to send their checks in this year's 34 Senate contests, by
signaling that Schumer would run the campaign against D'Amato that
some Democrats believe Abrams failed to do six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the unusually sharp cast of the attack _ even some Democrats
describe it as a little over the top _ is intended to be splashy
enough to win Schumer a few newspaper articles and some television
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and D'Amato are executing the kinds of campaigns that
have been part of American politics for the better part of 200
years, but which really came into focus with the 1988 Presidential
contest. That year, Vice President George Bush and the Republican
Party devastated Michael Dukakis with a searing run of
advertisements that questioned Dukakis' fortitude, ideology and
even his patriotism. It is often cited by analysts as evidence of
the potency of such tactics.
</P>
<P>
   There are some notorious examples of negative campaigning this
year as well. In the Nebraska Republican primary for governor, Rep.
Jon Christensen accused Mike Johanns, the mayor of Lincoln, of
condoning child pornography after a cable television channel in his
city showed some nudity. Other Republicans assailed Christensen,
and he went on to lose the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But viewed by the three best measures of a campaign's negativity
_ the sharpness of the attacks, their sheer volume, and the mix
between positive and negative _ the New York race stands out this
year. D'Amato's menu of television is almost entirely negative.
Schumer has leavened his mix with a handful of positive
advertisements and is expected to produce more upbeat ads as
Election Day approaches.
</P>
<P>
   That has formed the backdrop for a second subject of dispute
between Schumer and D'Amato: which candidate is responsible for the
attacks, and who is the most negative. That may sound like an
academic question to viewers bombarded with one attack ad after
another, but it is particularly relevant this year because D'Amato
has _ once again _ tried to portray himself as a victim of unfair
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer notes, correctly, that D'Amato was the first to run
attack ads, starting the day after the primary with one that
asserted: ``Liberal Chuck Schumer. Wrong on taxes. Wrong on
welfare. Wrong on crime. Wrong for us.'' (D'Amato actually began
attacking Schumer in a Dec. 30, 1997, letter to supporters, in
which he said, ``I've listened to this guy for 17 years and I still
can't figure out what they taught him at Harvard. It wasn't common
sense!'') Schumer knew D'Amato's history well enough to be ready
with his own attack ad the moment the senator ran his.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the two are quarreling about what is fair in political
discourse. D'Amato contends that Schumer crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns aren't always gentlemanly-like,'' D'Amato said
Monday at a news conference in Manhattan in which he assailed
Schumer's attendance record. ``However, I do believe it is one
thing to point to a person's record and it is another thing to use
pejoratives that have been used in this campaign that go beyond.''
He said he was referring specifically to Schumer's having described
him as a liar and a bully.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer responded by mocking D'Amato. ``When he finally gets
someone to answer him back, he starts whining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, even the representative's supporters acknowledge that
calling someone is a liar is extraordinary by the standards of
American politics. Still, the senator's bid for sympathy based on
Schumer's perceived excesses arguably runs up against his own
history.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato played a very prominent role in writing the book on
attack politics in the United States over the past 25 years. He
helped produce a seminal snippet of campaign advertising 18 years
ago. ``And now, at age 76 and in failing health, he wants six more
years,'' the announcer said as the screen showed a crumpled Javits
poster fluttering to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the attack was Sen. Jacob Javits, a fellow
Republican. D'Amato defeated him in the GOP primary by 70,000
votes, and went on to win the general election.

   MILAN-FASHION (Milan, Italy) _ With the current political and

approaching, society is being affected in countless ways. And
fashion, being a reflection of the times, is in its own state of
unease, searching for a new way of dressing post-minimalism. It
appears to be particularly true in Italy, where the government has
just been toppled by a no-confidence vote in Parliament and where
many designers, too, seem to have lost confidence. The sharp
tailoring that Italy is known for is no longer the prevailing
style, but no one has yet come up with a definitive new direction,
although several have tried with varying degrees of success. By

SPOTTSWOOD ROBINSON III, 82, CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Va., Md.)   (ll) 
 By ERIC PACE  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spottswood W. Robinson III, a Virginia civil-rights lawyer who
argued one of the five cases that led to the Supreme Court's 1954
desegregation ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education, died on
Sunday at his home in Richmond, Va. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause appeared to have been a heart attack, said Robinson's
only surviving son, Spottswood W. Robinson IV.
</P>
<P>
   After the Brown case, Robinson went on to become dean of the
Howard University Law School and chief judge of the District of
Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision in Brown vs. Board of Education
declared that segregation in public schools violated the
Constitution. When the court handed down its decisions, the
justices also ruled on four other cases, among them a Virginia case
Robinson had argued challenging conditions at an all-black high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Jack Greenberg of Columbia Law School, an authority on
civil rights law, said on Monday that Robinson, who was black, was
``one of just a very small handful of practicing lawyers who
handled civil rights cases in the late '40s and early '50s in
Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, a former director of the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, added: ``He was a curious combination of a
property lawyer, who knew the ins and outs of property law, and a
constitutional lawyer, who knew the great policies of the
Constitution as they were expressed in 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Howard's law school, Robinson became legal
representative of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund in
Virginia in 1948. Three years later, he began working on the case
of a black student in Prince Edward County, in south-central
Virginia, who said that the Robert R. Moton High School there,
which had only black students, was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was eventually combined with the Brown case, out of
Kansas, and the other cases, from South Carolina and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   While the Virginia case was being heard in Richmond, Robinson
recalled in a 1963 interview, when he wanted lunch he had to rush
to a hotel for blacks 12 blocks from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   A black lawyer then sometimes had ``a hard time finding any
place to eat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for the Brown cases to be heard by the Supreme
Court, recalled Greenberg, who argued the Delaware case before the
justices, Robinson ``got the assignment of, among other things,
arguing the constitutional history of the 14th Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   In his court appearances, Greenberg said, Robinson ``was
uniquely effective, in that he was just one of a couple of people
doing what he was doing in Virginia'' at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg added: ``He was also an exceptionally capable lawyer.
He was good with judges and juries. He knew the law. He knew some
of the esoteric, technical, sort of obscure parts of legal
history.'' Robinson's view was that the 14th Amendment had
envisioned the establishment of complete equality for all people,
regardless of race. Equality was denied to blacks, he held, as long
as their children could not go to white schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Robinson's appearances before the Supreme Court, Greenberg
said, ``He was very calm and just absolutely brimming with facts
and information and legal doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson became a professor and then dean at Howard's law school
from 1960 to 1963, and was named a judge of the U.S. District Court
in the District of Columbia from 1964 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He was elevated to the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in 1966, where he became chief judge from 1981. He
retired from the chief judge position when he turned 70 on 1986,
and from the court in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer's son, Robinson, who was tall, spare and mild-mannered,
attended Virginia Union University in Richmond and received his law
degree in 1939 from Howard, magna cum laude. He began his law
career as a teacher at Howard, mainly in property law. He took a
leave of absence in 1947 and did not return until he became the
school's dean. In the intervening years he practiced law in
Richmond, for the NAACP and other clients.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other civil rights cases over the years were lawsuits
involving interstate bus travel, public parks and restrictive
covenants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Robinson practiced law in Richmond on his own, as
a law-firm partner and as a general counsel in the banking
industry. He was a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
from 1961 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The honors he received included an honorary doctorate of laws in
1986 from New York Law School, for his efforts ``to achieve true
equality under the law for all Americans'' and addressing ``the
conscience of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, a Richmond resident, Robinson is
survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Marian Wilkerson; a
daughter, Nina Govan of Greenbelt, Md.; one grandson, and a sister,
Isadore Burke, of Freeport in the Bahamas.

CLINTON TOUTS THE SENATE CANDIDACY OF AN ABSENT SCHUMER

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton flew into New York on Monday night
to raise $1 million in one of the most fiercely contested Senate
races in the nation _ Charles Schumer's challenge to Alfonse
D'Amato _ and to draw emotional sustenance from a place where
Clinton has been admired, even during his worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing was missing: Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was preparing to head to Air Force One from the
White House, Schumer, a Democratic congressman from Brooklyn, was
boarding the 2:30 p.m. Delta Shuttle for Washington for a series of
session-ending votes on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an odd scene in which Clinton spoke to a hotel
ballroom filled with Schumer signs, Schumer supporters, and
Schumer's wife, Iris _ but no Schumer, aside from three minutes of
videotaped remarks that the congressman had prepared Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's absence from his own blue-chip fund-raiser was due to
a tangle of governmental and political obligations _ and suggested
that D'Amato had captured Schumer's attention with his latest line
of attack in the campaign. D'Amato's escalating criticism of
Schumer for missing votes this year left the congressman with a
choice between staying in New York with Clinton and risking new
criticism from D'Amato, or going to Washington and leaving Clinton
alone to do his financial favor. Schumer chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chuck Schumer when he decided to take on this herculean
task that if he ever needed anyone to fill in for him, just to call
me,'' Clinton said after being swept with applause that lasted two
minutes and was quieted only when the congressman's wife raised her
hand. ``So here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, for 21 minutes, the president, standing alone on a
stage at the New York Hilton, laid out a case for Schumer that went
notably beyond the president's usual generic case for Democratic
candidates in his frequent trips across the nation. Clinton
assailed Republicans for questioning Schumer's attendance record in
a congressional session that he said was notable for its lack of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, he said, Schumer could at once fill the
constituent-service role that D'Amato has traditionally played in
New York _ which has earned him the nickname ``Senator Pothole'' _
and perform the grander policy duties normally associated with
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York deserves a senator who is both tied to the specific,
concrete needs of individuals and their communities, and a senator
who will vote in the interests of this state and the nation over
the long run, and finally give voice to what makes America a great
nation,'' Clinton said. ``This is a time when we need people who
are both practical and visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   (UPDATED MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance in New York comes less than a month after
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, came to New York to campaign on
Schumer's behalf, a clear sign of how vulnerable D'Amato is viewed
by the White House. In his speech, however, Clinton was less
caustic than the first lady about D'Amato, mentioning him by name
and even offering some praise for his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator D'Amato has gotten some criticism that I never thought
was fair, actually, for being called Senator Pothole and all that _
you know that people make these funny little jokes,'' Clinton said.
``It's not funny if you've got a pothole in front of your house.
It's not funny, it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Clinton added, ``If Chuck Schumer is a senator, given his
level of energy, his intensity, his aggressiveness, he will make
Senator D'Amato look laid back when it comes to filling potholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political appearances here, along with a brief speech
at a cancer charity fund-raiser in Manhattan, came on a trip that
was also constrained by the demands of government. It had
originally been planned as a two-day trip to New York and Florida
before the White House scaled it back to about seven hours, after
Republicans criticized the president for taking care of politics in
the midst of budget negotiations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also appeared Monday night at a far smaller fund-raiser
at the Waldorf Astoria for Peter Vallone, the City Council Speaker,
who is running against Gov. George Pataki, a Republican. This one
was attended by fewer than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance on behalf of Vallone, who is trailing badly
in the polls, came after the speaker ran a television advertisement
embracing Clinton and saying he should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton appearance in New York _ and Schumer's trip to
Washington _ came as the two senate candidates exchanged charges
about each other's attendance records. D'Amato offered a list of 10
out of about 100 votes Schumer had missed this year _ many on
procedural votes, or own measures that passed overwhelmingly _
while Schumer, trying to capture the offensive, said he had
discovered six instances in which D'Amato had missed votes to give
speeches for honorariums from such groups as an association of
public accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has missed crucial votes to go out and line his
pockets with honoraria, with payments from the special interests,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's office disputed the actual votes that the senator had
missed, but did not deny the instances Schumer had provided of the
senator's collecting money. The practice was outlawed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted a sizable portion of his own speech to rebutting
D'Amato, telling the audience of over 600 that he was ``a little
amused'' by D'Amato's line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   The president praised Schumer for casting what he described as
key votes, including one for the 1993 deficit reduction bill. He
then listed initiatives that had foundered in the Republican
Congress, including campaign finance reform and the tobacco
settlement legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had that kind of voting record, I don't believe I'd be
criticizing Chuck Schumer for his voting record,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's aides said they were not concerned about D'Amato's
campaign assault, but the candidate's actions suggested
differently. He flew to Washington even though he was unsure what,
if any votes, might come up. He did end up voting for a resolution
to keep the government operating through Wednesday, and for
legislation increasing penalties for someone convicted of repeated
sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hopped a late flight to return in time for one final
private dessert reception with Clinton at the home of Steven
Rattner, an executive at Lazard Freres.
</P>
<P>
   There, Clinton said, ``If you want to stand by me, the best
thing you can do is stand up for him.''
