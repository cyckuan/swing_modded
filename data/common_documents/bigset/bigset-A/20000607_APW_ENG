Corzine Wins N.J. Senate Nomination
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Ruining the comeback hopes of former Gov. Jim Florio,
retired investment banker Jon Corzine captured New Jersey's Democratic Senate
nomination Tuesday. With 46 percent of precincts reporting, Corzine led with
124,405 votes, or 60 percent. Florio drew 83,095 votes, or 40 percent. Corzine
has never held elected office but quickly gained endorsements from top state
political leaders, including the man both he and Florio hope to replace,
retiring three-term Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg. The race was the highlight
of primary voting in six states today.

   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Brian Schweitzer, a farmer and political newcomer who
made the high cost of prescription medicine the theme of his campaign, easily
won the Democratic nomination Tuesday to challenge GOP Sen. Conrad Burns.
Schweitzer held off John Driscoll, a well-known political figure who challenged
Democratic Sen. Max Baucus in 1990. Driscoll conducted his low-key pitch mostly
through his Web site, and did little fund raising. With 12 percent of precincts
reporting, Schweitzer had 13,069 votes, 67 percent, and Driscoll had 6,513
votes, 33 percent.

Solomon Island Rebels Fire at Coast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Fighting between rival rebel factions on the
Solomon Islands intensified Wednesday, with one using a stolen gunboat to fire
cannon rounds at coastal encampments set up by the other group, a Solomon
Islands official said. New Zealand officials said earlier the shelling had hit a
Catholic school, although a Catholic worker in the capital, Honiara, said no
students were believed to be in residence because they were on holiday. The
shelling marked a major escalation of the weaponry being used in the dispute
between rival islanders. The 1{-year-old confrontation on the Solomon Islands
exploded into a governmental crisis on Monday, with one rebel group seizing the
prime minister.

Microsoft Files Breakup Response

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. filed a fresh response to the Justice
Department's breakup plan a day earlier than expected, clearing the way for a
federal judge to make a final ruling in the protracted antitrust case. In the
filing, Microsoft asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to include
previously suggested language that would give a broken-up Microsoft more freedom
to enter into agreements with software developers and computer makers. The DOJ
and 17 states have pushed to have Microsoft broken up into two separate
companies -- one to market and produce Windows, and the other to handle
Microsoft Office and other applications software, along with the Internet

<HEADLINE> Guards Said Set Up Prison Fights  </HEADLINE>
By KILEY RUSSELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Eight guards at one of California's
toughest prisons abused their authority by staging gladiator-style
fights among rival inmates ''for entertainment purposes,'' a
prosecutor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''To these defendants, inmate safety was a game,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Daniel Velez said in his closing argument to the
federal trial of the Corcoran State Prison guards. ''Rather than
protect the inmates, they used them for entertainment purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of the eight defendants face possible life sentences in the
shooting death of an inmate during a 1994 prison brawl. The other
four face lesser charges in connection with another fight.
</P>
<P>
   All eight guards have denied the accusations, and their lawyers
Tuesday began what is expected to be three days of arguments for
their acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 8{-week trial, prosecutors pointed to a
significant rise in prisoner fights during the defendants' daytime
shift.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are fighting one, two, three, four times a day within
an hour of each other ... and nobody said anything about it,''
Velez said.
</P>
<P>
   During a 2{-year period, there were 84 fights during the guards'
shift -- 300 percent more than the next most violent area of the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The fights came to light in 1994 when two guards blew the
whistle on their colleagues after the death of inmate Preston Tate,
who was shot by a guard during one of the alleged set-up fights.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Christopher Bethea fired a round from his 9mm rifle in
an attempt to wound a fighting prisoner and struck Tate in the
head, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Douglas Martin, Sgt. John Vaughn, officer Jerry Arvizu and
Bethea face life sentences if convicted of setting up the fight
that led to Tate's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Truman Jennings and officers Michael Gipson, Timothy
Dickerson, and Raul Tavarez face up to 10 years in connection with
another prison yard fight in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Velez said the guards knew the so-called Southern Mexicans and
black prisoners were warring and that the officers should have kept
them away from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putting Southern Mexicans and blacks together is like putting
a flame to gun powder ... if you do it enough times, it eventually
will go off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers began closing arguments Tuesday by denying there
was a war between prison gangs at the time the guards are alleged
to have set up the fights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast, vast majority (of inmates) went out to yard without
any problems,'' said Arvizu's lawyer, William Portonova.
</P>
<P>
   The brawls can be blamed on the violent nature of the inmates,
which is what landed them in the high-security unit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The violence follows the inmates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the number of fights was greatest on the
defendants' watch was because it was the only shift when prisoners
were free, Portonova said.
</P>
<P>
   The prison system's ''integrated yard policy'' is partly to
blame for the violence, said Curtis Sisk, Jennings' lawyer. That
policy required prisoners to be placed in the yard together
regardless of racial background or geographic loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   The other defense lawyers will present closing arguments
Wednesday. The case is expected to go to the jury by Friday.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Charged After Michigan Fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Rapper Eminem was charged Tuesday with two felony
weapons counts stemming from a weekend fight which prosecutors say
started after the Grammy winner saw another man kissing his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem is charged with one count of carrying a concealed weapon
and one count of assault with a deadly weapon, said Macomb County
Prosecutor Carl Marlinga.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old performer, whose real name is Marshall Bruce
Mathers III, is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Warren
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The fight happened about 2:20 a.m. Sunday in the parking lot of
a bar in Warren, the rapper's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Marlinga said Eminem hit John Guerra over the head with a 9mm
Smith &AMP; Wesson gun after he saw Guerra kissing his wife, Kimberly
Mathers, 27. The gun was not loaded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Mathers told the Detroit Free Press her husband
''overreacted'' to a friendly kiss between friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's lawyer, Howard Hertz, said his client planned to let
the judge enter an innocent plea for him in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Eminem won a Grammy for best rap album for his
debut release, ''The Slim Shady LP,'' and another Grammy for best
rap solo performance for the hit single ''My Name Is.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem has the No. 1 album in the country, ''The Marshall
Mathers LP.''

<HEADLINE> Report: 'Personal watercraft' a $1 billion nuisance nationwide  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A national study used by opponents of
personal watercraft concludes that noise from Jet Skis is a $1
billion national problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only effective noise-control measure is banning Jet Skis
outright,'' said economist Charles Komanoff, co-author of the
report for the environmental lobbying group Noise Pollution
Clearinghouse based in Montpelier, Vt. The study also recommended
restricting the craft to a few designated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year study used a formula to determine the value of
''lost enjoyment'' from the whine and roar of 1.3 million
watercraft often known by the trade name Jet Ski.
</P>
<P>
   The formula included comparison with the cost of known noise
abatement, like when airports buy houses in flight paths. The
report found Americans would be willing to pay $1 billion to rid
waters and beaches of the noise from Jet Skis.
</P>
<P>
   Using decibel measures, the study also contends that Jet Skis
create a more irritating noise than motor boats. That's because Jet
Skis frequently leave the water as they crest waves, so the motor
is no longer muffled by the water. Critics say that's why the craft
warrant special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The American Watercraft Association says their sport is under
attack by such lobbying efforts and is being discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   ''At every level of government, our sport faces restrictions and
outright bans,'' states the national group on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The group supports safety classes like ones now required in New
York state after a rise in accidents, some of them fatal. Members
of the association are also signing a code of ethics for safe and
courteous operation.
</P>
<P>
   A national spokeswoman didn't return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's New York spokesmen, Charles Bufano of Medford
on Long Island, said the noise concern is overblown. He said
outrage against the motorcycle-like power boats is loud, but from a
relatively few people who live along shores.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 11-point code of ethics includes: ''I will pay close
attention to the noise my vessel makes and be aware of how that
noise affects others on or near the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists in states like New York don't think that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   The report is being used to bolster an effort to pass a bill
that would give local governments the power to restrict or ban the
craft. The restrictions could limit time and speed and prohibit
''wave jumping'' and other behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jet Skis are a major threat to a lot of things - wildlife,
habitat - but they're also a threat to peace and quiet,'' said
David Higby of Environmental Advocates based in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has been approved by the Democrat-controlled
Assembly and has 13 Republican sponsors in the GOP-dominated
Senate, Higby said.
</P>
<P>
   Local businesses and some governments where marinas are riding
the vessels' wave of popularity have joined the industry opposition
to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But even one of the American Watercraft Association's two New
York spokesmen says he's had enough of the noise and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bufano sold the Sea Doo he bought in 1991. Back
then on a typical day, he'd see a half-dozen fellow jet skiers. Now
he sees five dozen or more.
</P>
<P>
   That, Bufano said, is the noise problem. He also said the sport
is evolving to attract mostly young people, partly because of the
low cost of older, noisier craft. The Sea Doo he bought for $8,500
sold two weeks ago for $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ride by myself and you don't hear anything. You get a group
and it's annoying,'' said Bufano, 35. He said an increasing
minority of riders ride in groups, are discourteous and violate the
law that prohibits jetting around within 500 feet of shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, this has become a young boys' sport, which is
kind of ruining it for everyone else.'' Bufano said. ''There is a
very inexperienced crowd out there now.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Man Charged in Stabbing Death  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors charged a man with murder Tuesday
in the stabbing deaths of an elderly couple who were friends and
financial supporters of some of the city's top politicians and
sports figures.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the suspect, Steve Jackson, was a cocaine addict and
a former tenant of Albert and Edna Patton who had asked the pair
for money in the past and gotten it.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Michael Whelan said a bloody piece of clothing linked
to the murder victims by DNA testing was found in the motel room
where Jackson was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors found the bodies of Patton, 90, and the
wheelchair-bound Mrs. Patton, 85, in their home on May 27. They
were well-known philanthropists in their poor, largely minority
community, and Patton had co-founded the national 100 Black Men
organization for disadvantaged youth.
</P>
<P>
   Their home was filled with photos of them with such celebrities
as Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Muhammad Ali and Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a $25,000 reward the City Council authorized to help
find the Pattons' killers brought informants forward with
information that led them to Jackson, 35, who was taken into
custody Friday at a nearby motel where police said he'd been
staying for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is being held without bail, is to be arraigned June
20.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged him Tuesday with one count of first-degree
robbery and two counts of murder with special circumstances,
meaning he could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Pattons were killed about 24 hours before Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks' 20-year-old granddaughter was shot to death
outside a fast-food restaurant two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the slayings were not related and there have been no
developments in the search for Lori Gonzalez's killer.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Judge Leads Chief Justice Vote  </HEADLINE>
By PHILLIP RAWLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The Alabama judge who fought to keep the
Ten Commandments displayed in his courtroom won the Republican
primary for chief justice of the state Supreme Court on Tuesday and
avoided a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 percent of precincts reporting, Etowah County Circuit
Judge Roy Moore had 99,210 votes, or 56 percent. Supreme Court
Justice Harold See, who was backed by the GOP establishment, had
51,142 votes, or 29 percent. Two other judges split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   By getting more than 50 percent, Moore advanced to the general
election Nov. 7 against civil appeals court Judge Sharon Yates, a
Democrat who had no primary opposition Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 53, said that if he becomes Alabama's top judge, he will
take the Ten Commandments to the State Judicial Building in
Montgomery. Appearing before cheering supporters in Gadsden, Moore
quoted Scripture as he explained why he ran stronger than polls had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're about establishing the moral foundation of our law once
again in this state and in our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   See had a $1.1 million campaign warchest -- more than twice as
much as his primary opponents combined. But Moore's Ten
Commandments fight gave him greater name recognition and clearly
helped him at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Christian and I like his stand for the Ten Commandments
and family values,'' said Shea Hill, a 29-year-old mother of two
small children who wore a cross necklace when she went to vote in
Pelham.
</P>
<P>
   The current chief justice, Republican Perry Hooper, is retiring
because state law prohibits judges from running after they turn 70.
The race to replace Hooper took on extra significance because of
the GOP's 5-4 majority on the court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the American Civil Liberties Union sued Moore over his
display of the Ten Commandments and his having Christian ministers
open court sessions with prayer. Moore spoke about his case at
rallies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out the suit, and then-Gov. Fob James and
the state attorney general filed their own lawsuit in hopes of
having Moore's courtroom practices declared constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama Supreme Court dismissed the case because the state
officials and the judge were on the same side. But the court let
Moore have the plaque and the prayers.

<HEADLINE> Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, the Pentagon
spokesman during the Persian Gulf War who became a familiar face to
millions of Americans, died Tuesday. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who retired from the Army in 1991, died at his home in
Clifton, Va., after suffering from cancer for about a year, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1991 Gulf War, Kelly served as the director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the command of Gen.
Colin Powell and was responsible for a daily press briefing. He
also played a key role in the planning and execution of military
operations during Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Through his briefings, Kelly was seen by reporters and
television viewers alike as blunt, funny and totally believable. As
the direct link between Powell and the heads of each of the armed
services, Kelly was overqualified for the job of a mere briefer,
and it enhanced his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly didn't start facing throngs of reporters until 1989, when
he conducted news briefings during the invasion of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia on Nov. 16, 1932, Kelly later earned a
bachelor's degree in journalism at Temple University, intending to
become a newspaperman. But he joined the ROTC at Temple in 1952 and
became caught up in the military life.
</P>
<P>
   During his 34 years in the military, Kelly served as commander
of the U.S. Army Security Affairs Command; commander of Fort Dix,
N.J.; director of the Joint Special Operations Agency of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff; and in NATO as War Plans Officer, Allied Forces
Southern Europe. Kelly also served in Vietnam as operations officer
for the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 1st Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, his helicopter was shot down four times and crashed
six times. He was wounded once.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's awards and decorations included the Defense
Distinguished Service Medal, the Army Distinguished Service Medal,
three awards of the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying
Cross, five Bronze Stars with ''V'' and the Purple Heart. In 1995,
he was awarded the American Legion's Distinguished Service Medal.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, Kelly worked as a professional speaker and
joined the Wing Group in 1995. He served as the company's president
and vice chairman and worked toward the company's goal of building
natural gas powered plants in China, the Middle East, Europe,
Turkey, Pakistan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is survived by his wife, Dorothy, two sons and a daughter.

primary for chief justice of the state Supreme Court and had a chance of
avoiding a runoff. With almost one-third of precincts reporting, Etowah County
Circuit Judge Roy Moore had 26,028 votes, or 58 percent, well ahead of Supreme
Court Justice Harold See, who was backed by the GOP establishment.

   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- After two days of fierce fighting, Rwandan and
Ugandan troops on Tuesday agreed to a U.N.-brokered cease-fire in a northern
Congolese city that both sides consider strategic. Only sporadic gunfire could
be heard in the Congo River port of Kisangani after the cease-fire took effect,
the third such attempt by a U.N. mission here to stop the fighting between the
two erstwhile allies in a 22-month war against Congolese President Laurent
Kabila. Both armies were in the process of withdrawing on Monday when Ugandan
artillery pounded Rwandan positions in the city.

<HEADLINE> Medical Data Sharing Regs Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Financial companies would have to get
customers' consent before sharing their medical data with other
firms or using it to make credit decisions, under a new proposal by
the head of the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation proposed Tuesday by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, is
similar to the medical-data provisions of legislation pushed last
month by the Clinton administration and Democratic lawmakers. The
Democrats have promised to make the Clinton-Gore privacy proposal,
opposed by most Republicans and given little chance of passage, a
hot election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals go beyond privacy rules included in sweeping
legislation, which President Clinton signed into law in November,
removing Depression-era barriers and allowing banks, brokerage
firms and insurers to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said his bill ''ensures privacy protection in an area of
great sensitivity to all Americans: personal health and medical
records.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a consumer applying for a loan or credit card
from a bank, for example, shouldn't have to worry about getting
rejected because of medical data provided to the bank by an
insurance company with which it is affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the Banking Committee's senior
Democrat, called Leach's proposal ''a constructive effort to
address the issue of medical privacy.'' But he said it does not go
far enough because it deals only with that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore bill, which LaFalce sponsored in the House,
also would require financial companies to get customers' consent
before sharing with other firms lists of what they buy and where
they buy it -- a practice known as profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, meanwhile, is divided over new voluntary
guidelines for protecting consumers' private data, including their
medical information.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines adopted by some major banking groups are similar
to privacy rules for all financial companies that became law last
fall, but two groups representing community banks believe they're
too strict and don't really apply to them. Smaller banks often rely
on marketing agreements with outside companies, and the guidelines
restrict sharing of customer data with outside firms.
</P>
<P>
   The community banks' opposition to the guidelines announced
Tuesday reflected a bitter schism between big financial
institutions involved in multiple businesses such as banking,
investments and insurance, on the one hand, and smaller banks and
thrifts that focus only on banking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medical privacy is a major issue for Citigroup,'' Ken
Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Community
Bankers of America, said in a telephone interview. ''It is not a
major issue for thousands and thousands of community banks, savings
and loans, and local insurance agents.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Citigroup, perhaps the best-known financial
conglomerate, combines under its corporate roof Citibank, the
Salomon Smith Barney securities and investment firm, and Travelers
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest push for financial services legislation last year
came from the larger financial companies, and their lobbyists
accepted the privacy restrictions as a condition for enactment of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary guidelines announced by the American Bankers
Association, the Consumer Bankers Association and the Financial
Services Roundtable include a prohibition against banks and savings
associations disclosing customers' medical data, or using such
information for marketing or credit decisions, without their
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Leach's proposal would:
</P>
<P>
   --Require financial companies to obtain customers' express
written consent before disclosing ''individually identifiable''
health or medical data to an affiliated company or any other firm,
such as a telemarketer.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit financial companies from using health or medical data
in deciding whether to grant credit without the prospective
borrower's express consent.
</P>
<P>
   --Require separate and specific customer consent for disclosure
of mental health information.
</P>
<P>
   --Give consumers the right to inspect, copy and correct their
health or medical data that are under the control of a financial
company.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Economy Hurt by Hostage Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji may seem like paradise on Earth, but it's
just now learning a painful financial lesson: Its white sand, coral
reefs and great surf can't outweigh the tourist turnoff of men with
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's economy -- based on tourism, sugar production and clothes
manufacturing -- has been frozen since armed rebels stormed
Parliament House on May 19 and took Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and most of his government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   In the five-star resorts dotting Fiji's island chain, the
poolside lounges are empty. In plantations, towering fields of
sugar cane are ripe but unharvested. In the clothes factories of
Suva, the capital, workers are sent home early each time they hear
rumors that a mob intent on a riot is headed for town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just coming into the peak season and we should have been
full this week for sure,'' said Paul Southey, general manager of
the Centra Pacific Harbor, an 83-room resort nestled among coconut
palms on the Coral Coast 30 miles west of Suva. ''Instead, we have
35 percent occupancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half a million tourists visited Fiji in 1999, mostly from
Australia, New Zealand and the United States. They spent around
$240 million on hotels and millions more on scuba diving, fishing
and boating tours, restaurants and other leisure activities, the
Fiji Bureau of Statistics says.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation is in the midst of a standoff that shows no sign
of ending, with rebel leader George Speight holding more than 30
people hostage and insisting he'll keep them until he gets to name
a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which took control of Fiji a little more than week
into the crisis, is saying just as strongly that Speight and his
rebels can't have any power, although it has offered amnesty in
exchange for release of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims he is acting on behalf of indigenous Fijians, and
wants the country's large minority of Indian descendants to be
barred from holding political power.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 19, the number of tourists arriving at Fiji's
international airport has dropped to 200 people a day.
</P>
<P>
   ''That should be 1,800 people a day,'' said Southey. ''Any
operator that tells you this crisis is not having an effect is
telling an untruth.''
</P>
<P>
   While cancellations in the past three weeks have skyrocketed,
Southey is more concerned about the lack of new bookings.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term damage will come from travel agencies cutting
their marketing campaigns for Fiji, which competes with a dozen
other nations as a ''Pacific paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond just tourism, business leaders and economists say Fiji's
whole economy is paralyzed and will likely remain so as long as
hostages are being held.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether that will carry over into long-term
trouble because of economic sanctions, which are being threatened
by Fiji's most important trading partners -- the European Union,
Australia and New Zealand -- unless democracy is quickly restored.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have now is the worst possible thing for the Fiji
economy,'' said David Forsyth, head of the economics department at
the University of the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   With an annual gross domestic product of about $1.44 billion,
Fiji is heavily dependent on other countries for its prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Next to tourism, the two biggest industries are sugar, worth
around $120 million a year from exports, and clothes manufacturing,
worth about $48 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth warned that if the European Union abandons a trade
agreement under which it pays up to three times the market price
for sugar -- as it has threatened to do if any member of Speight's
group is included in a new government -- it will be catastrophic for
Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 25,000 cane farmers, mostly ethnic Indians, would be
unable to meet production costs and be forced off the land. Many of
the country's 2,000 seasonal cane cutters, mostly indigenous
Fijians, would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop is overdue for harvest, but farmers have
refused to do so until Chaudhry, Fiji's first Indian prime
minister, and the other hostages are released.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they do not harvest, everything will be lost, the economy
of Fiji will be lost,'' said Umesh Prasad, director of the
Sugarcane Growers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's garment industry has boomed since the early 1990s, when
Australia agreed to give preferential treatment to its imports.
</P>
<P>
   If Australia cancels the agreement, foreign manufacturers that
flooded in will move away, taking up to 20,000 jobs with them,
Forsyth said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight says he expects an international backlash against his
coup, but that sanctions and economic and diplomatic isolation are
a price indigenous Fijians are willing to pay for political power.
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, Forsyth said, the economy's best hope would be
for the military rulers to quickly re-establish order. The sugar
and garment industries could recover if international sanctions can
be avoided, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers' Fears Grow  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARME TSUR, West Bank (AP) -- Small and remote, this red-roofed
Jewish settlement and others like it lie at the heart of what could
be a risky new peace push by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Israeli leader is speaking openly about
the prospect of leaving 50,000 Jewish settlers -- one-quarter of
those living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- outside the umbrella
of Israeli sovereignty as part of an accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And in the isolated communities likely to be sacrificed under
this scenario, settlers are responding with fear, anger and, in
some cases, threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several days, Barak has used his frankest language
yet to describe territorial concessions his government is prepared
to make to achieve a peace agreement. Talks aimed at reaching a
final accord are to resume in the Washington area early next week,
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of explosive sentiments over West Bank land that many
Jewish settlers consider their biblical birthright, Barak has been
emphasizing what Israel will seek to retain rather than what it is
ready to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the prime minister brings an agreement that puts 150,000
settlers in the West Bank in large settlement blocs ... under
Israeli sovereignty in an agreement recognized by the entire world,
it's a historic achievement,'' Barak said Monday night on Israel's
Channel Two television, the latest in a series of similar public
statements.
</P>
<P>
   To listening settlers, who total 200,000 in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the message was clear: 50,000 of them could be left out
in the cold. Barak, elected overwhelmingly on a peace platform a
year ago, has always said ''painful choices'' would accompany any
peace agreement, but this marked the first time he had cited
specific numbers of settlers who could expect to be uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   And if his public statements were meant as an opening position
in the peace talks, even more settlers could ultimately be left
with the choice of living under Palestinian rule or abandoning
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said Israel would seek to retain sovereignty
over settlement blocs in the Jerusalem suburbs, to the city's
south, in the northwestern West Bank and in a corridor linking the
Jordan Valley to the rest of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In isolated, thinly populated settlements like Karme Tsur, near
the West Bank town of Hebron, such criteria would leave little
chance of their inclusion. Home to just 500 people, Karme Tsur is
surrounded by Palestinian villages and cut off from any major
settlement bloc -- a prime target for handover.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a disaster,'' said Esti Uliel, a 37-year-old
mother of five, sitting at her kitchen table in the pleasant, sunny
home she and her husband recently remodeled. ''We couldn't live
under Palestinian authority.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicted any move to hand over settlements like hers would
spark a groundswell of opposition in Israel, even though relatively
few people are affected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're good citizens -- we vote, we pay taxes, we are
law-abiding,'' she said. ''What is a democracy for, if not to
protect the rights of its minority? I wouldn't cry just for my
house -- I'd cry for the state of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliel, who came to Karme Tsur 14 years ago, when it was only a
few houses carved into a raw patch of hillside, said she and her
neighbors would leave -- reluctantly -- if her settlement was among
those relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Radical settlers, though, are making fiery pledges to stand and
fight -- in language that raises, for some, the specter of the 1995
assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist opposed to land concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pleas from mainstream settler groups to refrain from
incitement or threats, the extremists are branding Barak a traitor
to his people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister of the Jews who can even consider taking
Jews out of their house! It borders on fascism,'' said Yaakov
Haiman, from the northern West Bank settlement of Itamar.
</P>
<P>
   However much Barak's new stance might inflame radical settlers,
he can expect a cool reception from the Palestinians, who insist
that all settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are
illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position on the issue of settlements is clear -- they
should all be dismantled, and any other suggestion is rejected,''
said Nabil Abourdeneh, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Women's Conference Addresses Men  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Thousands of women activists have gathered
to work toward ending gender-based violence, reaching equality
between the sexes and assuring reproductive rights to all. Many,
though, have found that men can't be left out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The role of men in women's issues is one of the key points that
the United Nations wants to raise in this week's meetings to review
the progress made toward women's equality since the 1995 U.N.
conference of women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to challenge the boys to understand the issue of
consent, as well as challenging girls to understand that they have
the right to say no,'' Noeleen Heyzer, executive director of the
U.N. Development Fund for Women, said Tuesday at a panel on ''Men
and Boys Preventing Violence Against Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyzer believes that including men in women's issues has become
more pressing since the Beijing conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''After Beijing, we were able to launch all these campaigns and
put them into action. We realized how important it was to include
men,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Development Fund for Women has recently launched
several projects addressing men and boys, including campaigns in
schools and in police stations.
</P>
<P>
   Involving men is necessary because often men will not listen to
women, said Norman Tjombe, who organized a meeting of hundreds of
men in Namibia to discuss violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had an effect. ''A week later, we saw a large
demonstration of men wanting to prevent a suspect accused of rape
from getting out on bail,'' Tjombe said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still few men to be seen at the conference, and
actually getting men involved in women's issues may be more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kaufman, international director of the White Ribbon
Campaign, says one way is to launch positive campaigns for men.
Kaufman's Canada-based group urges men to wear a white ribbon as a
''public pledge never to commit violence against women, never to
condone it, and never to remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an anti-male campaign,'' said Kaufman, adding that
''positive campaigns'' also may stop a backlash from men who feel
excluded from the women's movement. ''It says very clearly to men
that we must be allied to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Another argument to involve men is that improving women's
situation is beneficial to all.
</P>
<P>
   Violence is ''debilitating to both parts of society,'' said Guy
Hewitt of the gender affairs department of the Commonwealth
Secretariat, the administrative body for the 54-nation group of
Britain and its former colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Women have learned from experience to include men in their
battle for equality, said Sreelakshmi Gururaja, senior adviser on
gender and development at UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found in the 1980s that we could increase the power of
women, but the relationship (between men and women) did not
change,'' Gururaja said. ''If we want transformation, we need
transformation in both men and women.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Majority Seeks New Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's 11-month-old government was teetering
after half the parties in the coalition said they would support a
bill to call new elections -- a move that would freeze Middle East
peace efforts for months.
</P>
<P>
   Three the six parties in Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government
said they would vote with the opposition, giving the bill a clear
majority. But the legislation would face four separate votes,
including one set for today, before elections actually are called.
</P>
<P>
   The many parliamentary obstacles that remain leave plenty of
time for political maneuvering to keep Barak's coalition steady.
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself precipitated the crisis, refusing to give his
largest coalition partner, Shas, millions of additional dollars for
its bankrupt, scandal-ridden Orthodox school system. He also broke
off talks after Shas announced it would vote for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Shas party leader Eli Ishai, the labor and social welfare
minister, warned Barak not to ''sacrifice his government'' over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Barak said his government would ''not give in to
threats, external or internal.'' Sitting next to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright -- visiting to promote Israel-Palestinian
negotiations -- Barak denounced coalition parties prepared to
endanger his government as peace moves intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he is not afraid of facing the voters, adding that
''the people will judge all those who are interfering'' with his
efforts to make peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   If elections are called, Barak himself might remain in power.
Under Israel's election system, the prime minister is elected
separately from legislators. Parliamentary elections can be called
by a majority of 61 of the 120 members, but toppling a prime
minister takes 80 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary reading can pass with a simple majority, which
appeared certain. But if it is voted down, a similar bill cannot be
presented for six months. Sponsors would likely pull the bill if
they were not sure of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the vote would be a protest by parties unhappy
with Barak's treatment of them, rather than a sincere desire to
face the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's election system, instituted in 1996, contains its own
triggers for constant coalition crises, fragmenting the parliament
into more than a dozen factions. In last year's election, Israelis
split their ballots, voting for Barak in overwhelming numbers but
giving his party only 26 seats. Shas received 17 while Likud, the
main opposition party, got 19 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's coalition contains its own seeds of self-destruction.
His left-center One Israel faction is teamed with the secular,
dovish Meretz on the left and right-leaning parties like Shas, the
National Religious Party and Israel B'Aliyah, representing
immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders from Barak's faction are calling on him to dismiss
ministers who vote against the government and set up a minority
coalition with other parties.
</P>
<P>
   Barak took office hoping he could cement wide support for his
peace efforts, but that hope quickly faded as his partners returned
to their traditional positions.

<HEADLINE> Parents Support Baseball Defector  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN NICOLAS, Cuba (AP) -- A sports agent says Cuban baseball
player Andy Morales is seeking U.S. political asylum. Morales'
parents say that is OK with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care what uniform -- whether it be from here, from
there, Colombia, Venezuela or Japan,'' Adelso Morales, Andy's
father, said Tuesday. ''But he has to play. It's in his blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Gus Dominguez said Morales was picked up at sea and
interviewed by American authorities aboard a U.S. Coast Guard
cutter. The Coast Guard would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is a 25-year-old third baseman who hit a home run last
year in an exhibition against the Baltimore Orioles. The elder
Morales and his wife, Magdalena Leon de Morales, said they had not
heard directly from their son since he disappeared just before the
weekend. All they knew were the reports circulating Sunday among
neighbors in their hometown of San Nicolas, about 30 miles
southeast of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our message for him is that he be the happiest man in the
world, and that his father and his mother will be happy for him as
well -- even though we may never hear from him again,'' Adelso
Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That he should not worry, that we will be fine, thinking of
him,'' added Morales' mother, as she sat in a wooden rocking chair
in the living room of the small, white family home. ''Whatever he
has decided is fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Morales, his parents' first child, is clearly the family's
pride. The living room wall is decorated with a black and white
photograph of their son playing baseball three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a clock, a wall tapestry rug and other gifts he
bought for his parents on 13 trips to countries such as the
Netherlands, Venezuela, Colombia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Morales has two children: Andy Jr., 10, and Yandi, 4
months. He lived in another community near San Nicolas with his
second wife, Daiyana, and Yandi.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said Sunday that Coast Guard officials told him
Morales was one of 31 would-be immigrants found on a boat stranded
near Key West over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials also would not
confirm whether Morales was among the Cubans aboard a power boat
that ran out of fuel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Morales would be the latest Cuban national team member to
defect, following such current players as New York Yankees pitcher
Orlando ''El Duque'' Hernandez, his half-brother, San Francisco
Giants pitcher Livan Hernandez, and New York Mets shortstop Rey
Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 Cuban baseball players have defected in the past 10
years. The Cuban government has not commented on reports about
Morales' possible defection.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cuban national team's 12-6 win over the Orioles in May
1999 in Baltimore, Morales delivered the clinching blow, a
three-run homer in the ninth inning. He zoomed around the bases
with his arms spread wide, looking like a kid imitating an
airplane. Zigzagging his way home, he gestured at his teammates in
the third base dugout and pointed to the sky before he touched the
plate.

   Professional sports are banned in Cuba. Top athletes are given
favored treatment by the communist government, but salaries and
living standards pale beside those of millionaire athletes abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Morales said his son was earning 520 Cuban pesos a
month, the equivalent of about $24.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' parents said they are anxiously awaiting news from
their son. Until then, they have told Andy Morales Jr. that his
father is playing baseball on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we know something official, we will start telling him bit
by bit,'' the elder Morales said. ''The boy will understand.''

<HEADLINE> Indiana's Offense May Hold Shaq  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rik Smits wasn't afraid to say what all of
the Indiana Pacers must be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd much prefer to play against Portland,'' Smits said. ''Not
that the Trail Blazers aren't a great team, but it would make my
job a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits' job, which he shares with all his teammates, is stopping
Shaquille O'Neal. With his mix of size, speed and strength, the Los
Angeles Lakers' MVP center shreds most conventional defensive
schemes and generally makes players like Smits wonder why they took
up basketball in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA Finals, beginning tonight at Staples Center, the
Pacers undertake the task at which the entire league failed this
season. Most recently, the Blazers tried everything from
pre-emptive fouls to constant, oppressive double-teams in an effort
to slow Shaq. They still lost the Western Conference finals in
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the Pacers, the series sometimes seems like a matchup of
Goliath vs. 12 Davids. Such is the truly massive presence O'Neal
has taken on during this season, when he finally acquired a quality
supporting cast and led Los Angeles to the league's best record.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know Shaq is going to get his points no matter what you
do, because he's the MVP,'' Indiana guard Jalen Rose said. ''The
key to the series is going to be our team defense. When Shaq gets
the ball down low and he's looking to pass it out, we have to
prevent people from getting open shots. That's all you can really
do.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the series could depend on which team's
outside shooters perform better. Los Angeles assistant coach Tex
Winter noted that without Shaq, the series is essentially a matchup
of two jump-shooting teams who prefer the perimeter game to post
play.
</P>
<P>
   And therein might lie Indiana's key to success. Nobody gives the
Pacers any chance to stop O'Neal, but Indiana is a team capable of
outscoring anyone.
</P>
<P>
   With the right mix of an aggressive offense, judicious fouls on
O'Neal and strong defense against his Lakers teammates, the Pacers
think they'll have a shot at outshooting Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't remember we're a pretty good team on offense,''
point guard Mark Jackson said. ''I didn't get all those assists
this year by throwing the ball in the stands. We hit our shots, and
we think we can shoot with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, Indiana's sharpshooting veteran guard chasing
what might be his last chance at a title, will be particularly
important. Miller made his reputation on frenetic playoff
performances, and the Pacers' Eastern Conference playoff opponents
found out he can still unleash a barrage of jumpers as well as
anyone in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope they overlook us,'' said Miller, who led Indiana to
its first NBA Finals by burying the New York Knicks under a wave of
3-pointers in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not coming here to lay down. We're coming in here to
shock the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' roster of shooters also includes Rose, who
complements his slashing drives to the basket with jumpers; Travis
Best and Jackson, who can both hit from outside; and big men Smits,
Austin Croshere and Sam Perkins, all accomplished outside shooters
from varying distances.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't get to this point by being a one- or two-man team,''
Rose said. ''You need a whole bunch of guys with the same kind of
focus. We can all contribute offensively, right down the roster.
Not many teams can match that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Pacers' best stretches of the regular season, they
killed their opponents with dozens of open shots in assistant coach
Rick Carlisle's jump-shot-friendly offense. Such marksmanship will
be necessary for Indiana to surprise the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a lot of weapons on their team. They have a lot of
great shooters,'' O'Neal said. ''Reggie's not the type of guy that
you really could stop. He's real aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Indiana has been tested in nearly a decade of playoff
appearances, the Lakers are essentially making their first run with
this particular cast wearing purple and gold. If teamwork is as
important as Bird claims, the Pacers have another edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' roster is a mishmash of judicious drafts, trades and
free-agent signings. The Lakers don't have the years of experience
together most teams need before advancing to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green is the only player on the roster with more than four
years of L.A. experience, and Green had been away for six seasons
before returning last fall. He is the only link to the past glories
of Magic and Kareem, but he doesn't give them much relevance to the
task facing the Lakers now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't seem like very long since I was in the finals with
this organization, but it really has been,'' said Green, who was on
the last Los Angeles team to get this far, in 1991. ''This is a
whole different show now. The game is different.''

<HEADLINE> Young Decision Expected on Friday  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- After a meeting with Steve Young, Denver Broncos
coach Mike Shanahan came away with a ''strong feeling of what
(Young) is going to do.'' He's not telling, however.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan on Tuesday refused to be specific about Young's
intentions, saying only that Young will make an announcement,
probably on Friday, about whether he will play for the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Young could also elect to play for the Seattle Seahawks, retire
from the game or even return to the San Francisco 49ers. The latter
option appeared to be ruled out by 49ers general manager Bill
Walsh, but Walsh reversed himself Tuesday, saying Young could stay
if he gets medical clearance.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 49ers granted Young permission to negotiate a
contract with the Broncos. Shanahan interrupted his charity golf
tournament to meet with Young at a Denver hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The pair had an ''in-depth conversation,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe his mind is made up,'' Shanahan told the media
Tuesday following the first day of his team's four-day minicamp.
''But I'll let Steve share that with you. I think he's going to
have a press conference on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said the meeting with Young, whom he coached in San
Francisco, lasted 90 minutes to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a great conversation,'' Shanahan said. ''We bounced
some things off of each other. He asked me some questions, and I
asked him some questions. I believe the big question that everybody
has is about his health. I asked a lot of questions relative to
that. He said he felt like he knows more about concussions than
most doctors. He has studied it quite a bit and has taken a lot of
tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, missed the final 13 games of the 1999 season because
of a severe concussion, prompting some friends to urge him to
retire. He has had four concussions in the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers haven't given Young medical clearance to continue
playing, and their attempts to retain Young also are hampered by
salary-cap concerns. Walsh insisted Tuesday that the 49ers do have
cap room to keep Young.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it did work out with the Broncos,'' Shanahan said, ''our
doctors would have to approve him. So there are some question marks
right now. I asked if he was pushing the envelope a little bit to
play. But he feels very good about where he's at relative to his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not want him to take a chance of playing if the
doctors had any question about it. I want to do the best thing for
Steve and the best thing for our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, the most accurate passer in NFL history and twice the
league's MVP, said in San Francisco on Tuesday his meeting with
Shanahan was to gather information and that there was no contract
talk or negotiations. Those close to Young said he also wanted to
meet with Seattle coach Mike Holmgren before making any decision
about his NFL future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spoke with Mike Shanahan based on the fact that he is one of
the guys who was really important in my career,'' Young said.
''Everyone knows how much respect I have for Mike. I sought the
permission specifically so that I could go and not be in trouble
for talking with somebody else who is a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have three options, basically. I could retire, I could play
for San Francisco or I could play somewhere else. I have a big
decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said he and Young ''have had a great relationship. I
think the world of him as a person, not only as a football player.
He's a class act, a cinch Hall of Famer.''
</P>
<P>
   And the coach left little doubt that Young could help his team,
which slumped to 6-10 last year under inexperienced quarterback
Brian Griese after back-to-back Super Bowl titles under John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Steve could help any football team at the highest
level,'' he said. ''I like the way he's played over the last few
years. He keeps himself in great shape. He's a student of the game.
He's a great competitor.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis Testifies in Murder Trial  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- One day after a deal with prosecutors to drop
murder charges against him, Ray Lewis told a jury his friend showed
him a knife after a fatal street brawl and demonstrated using it.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens linebacker told the jury he demanded an
explanation from Joseph Sweeting after the fight ended. Sweeting
showed him a knife, made punching motions with it and said, ''Every
time they hit me, I hit them,'' Lewis testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the Jan. 31 fight, which took place outside an
Atlanta club after a post-Super Bowl party and left two men dead,
was over so quickly he couldn't tell if Sweeting or defendant
Reginald Oakley stabbed the two men.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination from Sweeting's lawyer, Lewis said the
knife was not bloody and Sweeting had no blood on him when they
returned to their hotel. Lewis testified that Oakley, whom Lewis
had met only a few times, told him he didn't stab anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting and Oakley are charged with murder, felony murder and
aggravated assault in the stabbings of Jacinth Baker and Richard
Lollar. They face up to life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Murder and assault charges against Lewis were dropped Monday
after he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and agreed to
testify about what he saw during a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never did anything,'' Lewis said after leaving court. ''I
was nothing in this whole case but a witness the whole time. And
what I just said today is to prove to the world that I've always
been a witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis testified that he was not involved in the fight at all.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Lewis' testimony was going to hurt the
remaining defendants, Lewis' lawyer Ed Garland said, ''I think it
both hurt and helped them ... It was a mixed bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis testified that he left the Cobalt nightclub with his
friends around 4 a.m., when Oakley got into an argument with a
group of men. Lewis said he tried to break up the argument by
taking Oakley back to his rented limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reginald was the aggressor at the time that I was walking
up,'' Lewis said. ''He was really hostile toward the other two
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, the group of men walked past Lewis'
limousine and then turned around and came back. Oakley jumped out
of the limousine, and one of the victims, Jacinth Baker, smacked
him in the head with a champagne bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honestly, all hell broke loose from that point,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting tried to help Oakley, but never made it because two
large men attacked him and dragged him behind a tree, Lewis said.
Then he saw Sweeting regain his footing and start throwing punches
and fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he saw Oakley and another member of Lewis' group,
Carlos Stafford, fighting with Baker. He said Oakley punched Baker
four or five times in the chest while Stafford was kicking him.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a frantic fight,'' Lewis said. ''They was really
going at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statements, prosecutor Paul Howard told jurors
that both victims were stabbed several times in the chest. He told
jurors that the killers held their knives in their fists and
delivered the death blows in a punching motion, so w  As a result, Lewis will
serve 12 months on probation under
Georgia's first offender law. His record could be cleared if he
successfully completes his sentence. During probation, he must
remain employed and not use drugs or alcohol. Lewis will also pay
one-third of the prosecution's court costs and could be fined. He
won't be suspended by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the leading tackler in the NFL last year, has a
four-year, $26 million contract with the Ravens. Lewis plans to
rejoin the club at a voluntary minicamp next week, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over for Ray Lewis. That's the last court appearance
he'll have in Atlanta,'' Garland said.

<HEADLINE> Lions' Batch Probably Out 3 Months  </HEADLINE>
By RANDI GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Yet another injury has struck Charlie Batch.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Lions quarterback will be sidelined for about three
months after fracturing a bone in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Batch, who missed the last two games of the 1998 season with a
back injury and missed six games last season with a broken right
thumb, caught his foot in the turf during noncontact drills Monday
at the Silverdome.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed he broke his tibial plateau, has a fracture
displacement, and has slight damage to his posterior cruciate
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no pressure on him. He wasn't trying to avoid
anybody at all,'' Lions spokesman Matt Barnhart said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Batch and his agent asked for the test results to be sent to Dr.
James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., for a second opinion, Barnhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the world-renowned orthopedic surgeon agrees with Lions
doctors, Batch will have arthroscopic surgery in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' first preseason game is Aug. 4 against visiting New
England, and they begin the regular season Sept. 3 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The diagnosis we've received would likely put Charlie out of
action through training camp and preseason,'' Lions coach Bobby
Ross said. ''Injuries happen in the game of football, and we've got
to move on. We have to get through the arthroscopic procedure and
see what is found once they look inside the knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we're going to have to deal with, and we
will. Charlie will get well and we'll get him back. What we may do
in the short term, though, is explore the possibility of bringing
in another quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tomczak, acquired March 3 to back up Batch, will become the
Lions' No. 1 quarterback for now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to be looking to see who else is out there,''
Barnhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak is a 15-year NFL veteran who started his career with the
Bears, playing six seasons in Chicago. He spent one year each with
Green Bay and Cleveland before joining the Steelers in 1993. He
signed a two-year contract with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Batch, a second-round draft pick in 1998 from Eastern Michigan,
is entering his third season with the Lions. He is negotiating an
extension to his four-year contract that would raise his salary far
above the NFL-minimum $358,000 he is set to earn this year.
</P>
<P>
   Batch got the starting job when Ross benched Scott Mitchell
after two games in 1998. Batch has been the starter ever since,
except when injured.
</P>
<P>
   In 23 games, he has 24 touchdown passes, a 56.5 percent
completion rate and 13 interceptions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Europe Tour A Last Hurrah  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- It was a rally to stir the political soul
of any candidate. But none was there. Only Bill Clinton, the
American president, at the finale of his farewell tour of Europe,
in the twilight of his term.
</P>
<P>
   His was the campaigner's wave, the fence-line handshaking, the
cheerleading speech to the throng stretching far down the broad
mall beyond St. Michael's Square on Monday, at the last show of his
week of European conferences including the summit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   These wouldn't have been his voters anyhow, of course. But when
he stood before them in the blazing evening sun, the old Clinton
seemed revived, the man who pressed every hand in reach, beamed as
he shared the stand with the conductor of the Odessa Symphony
Orchestra, waving in time as they played ''Take Me Out To The
Ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had seemed subdued, almost wistful, at earlier stops,
occasions of state, as though bent on leaving the image of
statesman rather than that of a politician playing to the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   His summit conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin was
cordial enough, by the account of both men, but without the hearty
embraces of his sessions with Boris Yeltsin, retired from office
now as Clinton will be at noon next Jan. 21. He paid what he called
an old-times visit to Yeltsin at his retirement dacha outside
Moscow and said he found his old diplomatic friend happy and
looking good.
</P>
<P>
   So ended his summit weekend in Moscow, after sessions in which
Putin said he found Clinton a comfortable negotiating partner, and
Clinton said it was productive, even to deal with differences
candidly and clearly.
</P>
<P>
   They had those, even as they signed preordained agreements to
eliminate 34 tons apiece of weapons-grade plutonium over the next
20 years and to open a joint missile launch early warning system in
Moscow. They issued a joint statement declaring dedication to arms
control, but with the U.S. aim of building a national missile
defense still in dispute, and with no progress on a third nuclear
arms reduction treaty -- the Senate hasn't yet fully ratified the
second -- in which the Russians want sharper weapons cuts than
Washington will accept.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiev, Clinton and President Leonid Kuchma celebrated with a
champagne toast at the presidential palace Monday as the Ukrainian
leader announced that the last nuclear power plant at Chernobyl,
site of the 1986 disaster, will be shut down on Dec. 15. That, too,
was long in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton showed little fire in his address to the Russian
parliament Monday, a 45-minute speech with some of the elements,
but none of the hearty style of a State of the Union message to
Congress. He offered a series of recommendations to the Duma on
economic reform, down to overhauling the tax code for fairness to
attract foreign investors. This after saying that one problem in
the relationship is an American tendency to press its answers to
problems as though Washington knows everything.
</P>
<P>
   Then to Kiev, and to the ancient square, with one gold-domed
cathedral, blue and white and just rebuilt and rededicated, behind
the yellow-and-blue-decked platform where Clinton spoke. Another,
dating from the 11th century and now being renovated, loomed far
down the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Kiev police estimated 50,000 people were in the crowd in front
of Clinton. They waved small flags, the blue and yellow of Ukraine
and the red, white and blue of the United States, cheered his
summons to build a stronger democracy and a free economy, delivered
with pauses for translation.
</P>
<P>
   Giant American flags were waved across the mall over the crowd
some 300 yards from the platform.
</P>
<P>
   They had come hours earlier, to stand in 86-degree heat, as
Ukrainian rock stars and bands performed as they awaited Clinton.
The Odessa symphony took the train up to Kiev for its part of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had more advice, urging Ukrainians to build free markets
for prosperity beyond the hard times that followed the fall of
communism in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It was a solo. Kuchma, just re-elected president over a
communist rival, stayed at the palace. This was Clinton's show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not give up,'' he cried. ''Keep on fighting. Borites,
poboryte.''
</P>
<P>
   His translation of ''Keep on fighting,'' which is close, but not
quite, literal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that beat the unintended translation of one Ukrainian
phrase to English back at the palace. It was fractured into an
observation that the two presidents had signed far-fetched
agreements, instead of the intended far reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Even when there is not a vote to be had, Clinton rises to the
crowds, the campaign instinct surviving his last campaign at home.
He beamed, he waved, he paused at the applause lines. They may have
turned out for the rock stars, but they certainly cheered Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Speech done, he went straight to the fence line for a half-hour
of hand shaking. The band played Bennie Goodman classics. ''Swing,
swing, swing.'' The symphony took its turn. ''The Stars and Stripes
Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   His last election is history, but Clinton has few rivals at
working a crowd. Americans or Ukrainians.

<HEADLINE> Corzine Wins N.J. Senate Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Propelled from obscurity by his
record-shattering $33 million campaign, retired investment banker
Jon Corzine captured New Jersey's Democratic Senate nomination
Tuesday and ruined the comeback hopes of former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Corzine led with 239,291
votes, or 58 percent. Florio drew 172,564 votes, or 42 percent.
Corzine outpolled Florio by more than 3-1 in the vote-rich Newark
area, while Florio did well in his base in southern New Jersey near
Camden -- but couldn't overcome Corzine's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake. I want to invest in America,'' Corzine told
supporters. ''That is what this campaign will be about.''
</P>
<P>
   On the GOP side, Rep. Bob Franks edged out a win in a close
four-way race. And in a repeat of a nail-biter two years ago,
moderate GOP Rep. Marge Roukema, the longest-serving woman in
Congress, narrowly defeated a conservative challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic Senate race was the highlight of primary
voting in six states Tuesday. Corzine has never held elected office
but quickly gained endorsements from top state political leaders,
including the man he hopes to replace, retiring three-term
Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, seeking a return to politics after voters dumped him in
1993 at the end of just one term because he raised taxes by $2.8
billion, accused Corzine of trying to buy the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's primary spending, roughly $140 per vote, shattered the
previous U.S. record for a Senate campaign -- $30 million spent by
Republican Michael Huffington in his losing 1994 bid for office in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The former Goldman Sachs chief executive, with a personal
fortune estimated at $400 million, raised $2.5 million for the
campaign. The rest came from his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   He unleashed a $2-million-per-week blitz of TV commercials and
poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into state and county
Democratic organizations. Florio denounced the tactic as a
''hostile corporate takeover'' of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat, Florio said the primary campaign was a
''monument to the need for campaign finance reform.'' But he said
he would support Corzine in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters shrugged off the criticism of Corzine's spending.
Norm Reiff, 69, of Northfield, said he picked Corzine, ''in spite
of all the money he put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a new face,'' Reiff said. ''Let's give him a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid to Corzine's spending and his campaign
platforms, such as federal funding of college for students with B
averages or better and investing Social Security funds in the stock
market, dwarfed interest in the GOP primary for Lautenberg's seat.
</P>
<P>
   After GOP Gov. Christie Whitman said she would not run, four
lesser-known candidates stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of precincts counted, Franks won with 36 percent
of the vote, pulling ahead of state Sen. William Gormley, who led
in early returns but only drew 34 percent by the end. Trailing were
Essex County Executive Jim Treffinger and Ramapo College professor
Murray Sabrin. The GOP has not won a Senate seat in New Jersey
since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter primary fight in New Jersey, Roukema, seeking her
11th term, once again beat back a tough challenge from conservative
state Assemblyman Scott Garrett. Garrett, who came within 1,700
votes of beating Roukema two years ago, lost this time by about
1,500 votes. He received $100,000 worth of support in ads from a
conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday also marked the end of the presidential primary season,
with contests in five of the six states, though they held little
import since George W. Bush and Al Gore locked up their nominations
back in March. The sixth state, Iowa, held its caucuses in January.
</P>
<P>
   In the other states:
</P>
<P>
   --Alabama Circuit Judge Roy Moore, who fought the American Civil
Liberties Union in 1995 to post the Ten Commandments in his
courtroom, won the GOP nomination for chief justice of the state
Supreme Court. Moore, who bucked Republican leaders to run for the
seat, took 56 percent of the vote in a four-way race and avoided a
run-off.
</P>
<P>
   --In Montana, Democratic farmer Brian Schweitzer made the high
price of prescription medicine the theme of his Senate campaign,
taking buses of seniors to Canada to highlight the price
differences. He easily won the nomination to face two-term GOP Sen.
Conrad Burns in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Montana, state Auditor Mark O'Keefe won the Democratic
nomination to replace Republican Gov. Mark Racicot, forced by term
limits to retire. Lt. Gov. Judy Martz won the GOP race.
</P>
<P>
   And in New Jersey, former GOP Rep. Dick Zimmer, a lawyer who
teaches at Princeton, defeated another former GOP congressman, Mike
Pappas, to challenge first-term Democratic Rep. Rush Holt. Pappas
lost to Holt two years ago in part because of a ditty he sang about
impeachment on the House floor (''Twinkle, Twinkle, Kenneth
Starr'').
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   -- In New Mexico, former Rep. Bill Redmond won a three-way GOP
race to challenge three-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Iowa, lawyer Jay Marcus won the GOP nomination to challenge
two-term Democratic Rep. Leonard Boswell.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the race for South Dakota's lone House seat, Curt Hohn,
manager of a water pipeline, won the Democratic primary to
challenge two-term GOP Rep. John Thune.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Wins Montana Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By BOB ANEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Brian Schweitzer, a farmer and political
newcomer who made the high cost of prescription medicine the theme
of his campaign, easily won the Democratic nomination Tuesday to
challenge GOP Sen. Conrad Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer held off John Driscoll, a well-known political figure
who challenged Democratic Sen. Max Baucus in 1990. Driscoll
conducted his low-key pitch mostly through his Web site, and did
little fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   With 64 percent of precincts reporting, Schweitzer had 39,898
votes, 67 percent, and Driscoll had 19,744 votes, 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, who promised to embarrass Congress into doing
something about the cost of medicine, orchestrated four bus trips
of senior citizens to Canada and Mexico to get their prescriptions
filled at up to half of what they would pay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also went on the attack against Burns, rapping his farm
policies and saying he cannot be trusted because he reneged on a
vow to spend only two terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who was unopposed Tuesday, withheld rebuttals and watched
donations flow in. At last count he had $3.5 million, almost five
times the $710,000 raised by Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Montana voters also narrowed the field of candidates vying to
succeed Gov. Marc Racicot, a popular Republican who is barred from
seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Auditor Mark O'Keefe easily beat two
other top state officials, Secretary of State Mike Cooney and
Attorney General Joe Mazurek. With 64 percent of precincts
reporting, O'Keefe had 31,948 votes, or 49 percent. Mazurek had
23,177, 36 percent, and Cooney had 9,807 votes, 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With 63 percent of the vote counted in the Republican race, Lt.
Gov. Judy Martz had 41,843 votes, or 55 percent, to beat Rob
Natelson, a University of Montana law professor known for
conservative activism. He drew 34,261 votes, 45 percent.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Island Rebels Fire at Coast  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Fighting between rival rebel
factions on the Solomon Islands intensified Wednesday, with one
using a stolen gunboat to fire cannon rounds at coastal encampments
set up by the other group, a Solomon Islands official said.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel spokesman, Andrew Nori, said his side killed 100
enemies. He said he received the information from colleagues who
fired a machine gun from the gunboat directly into a crowd of
people, as well from others on the ground watching.
</P>
<P>
   Nori said there had been about 300 to 400 armed men on the
beach. ''There were no civilians,'' he told The Associated Press.
''They were all carrying weapons. They were not holding a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate way to confirm Nori's claim. A Solomon
Islands government spokesman and New Zealand officials said there
had been a gunboat attack in the morning, but they had no
information about deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's true there was a shooting incident and there might well
have been casualties,'' Alfred Maesulia, a spokesman for the
Pacific island nation, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand officials said earlier the shelling had hit a
Catholic school, although a Catholic worker in the capital,
Honiara, said no students were believed to be in residence because
they were on holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling marked a major escalation of the weaponry being
used in the dispute between rival islanders. The 1{-year-old
confrontation on the Solomon Islands exploded into a governmental
crisis on Monday, with one rebel group seizing the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the Malaitan rebels who captured Bartholomew
Ulufa'alu (pronounced oo'-loo-faa'-loo) two days earlier dropped
their demands that he resign. Ulufa'alu's political fate will be
determined in a parliamentary session June 15, where he will face a
no confidence vote, according to a joint statement released by the
government and Nori, an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu will no longer be followed by armed rebel guards, with
normal police providing his security, and he ''is at liberty to
move out of and into his residence and offices at will,'' the joint
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the Solomon Islands closer to being ''back
into constitutional rule,'' New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff
said.
</P>
<P>
   But an end to the political crisis isn't likely to stop the
fighting between indigenous people of the nation's main island of
Guadalcanal and migrants from the neighboring island of Malaita.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months, the rebel groups -- the Isatabu and Malaitans --
have skirmished on Guadalcanal, the country's main island and the
scene of a pivotal battle between U.S. and Japanese forces in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Isatabu want to rid Guadalcanal of thousands of settlers
from nearby Malaita. The Malaitans complain they are being unfairly
pushed off their land, and some accuse the democratically elected
Ulafa'alu -- who is from Malaita -- of betraying them.
</P>
<P>
   The current emergency began Monday when armed Malaitan rebels
seized Ulafa'alu and demanded that he resign. On Tuesday, the
country -- 2,300 miles northwest of Wellington -- appeared to be
plunging into war.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu came to a meeting of government caucus officials and
told them he would leave ''if that is the price of peace in the
Solomon Islands,'' the nation's state minister, Alfred Sasako, told
Australian television.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were wounded Tuesday during a three-hour gunbattle
between the two groups -- the Malaita Eagle Force and the Isatabu
Freedom Movement -- on the fringe of the airport in the capital,
Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   After securing the area around the airport, the Malaita Eagle
Force rebels early Wednesday deployed a stolen police patrol and
with the cannon were ''indiscriminately shooting'' at nearby
coastal villages, according to a New Zealand official in the
Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-milimeter shells hit the Nazareth Apostolic Center -- a
Catholic missionary school -- but it appeared students were on
holiday and there were no immediate reports of injuries, said the
official, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   A Solomon Islands government official reached by phone in
Honiara said rival bands of rebels were fighting both east and west
of town -- with a group of migrants from Malaita much better armed
after joining forces with paramilitary teams on Monday and seizing
machine guns and ammunition from the Solomon Islands' armory.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita Eagle Force, which was formed a few months ago, now
has the support of about half of the Solomon Islands paramilitary,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the crisis had been scant on Monday and early
Tuesday because phone lines were cut, but communications were
restored by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday called
on the rebels through his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, to release the
prime minister and to resume peace talks ''aimed at returning the
country to normalcy and re-establishing democratic governance as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff, New Zealand's foreign minister, warned that ''the
international community will not accept a democratically elected
prime minister being forced out of office at gunpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup attempt was the second in the South Pacific in weeks.
Armed rebels in Fiji are still holding the elected prime minister
and more than 30 other people seized in a raid on Parliament on May
19.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Eyed As Gore's V.P.  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Richardson flops onto an overstuffed
couch in his office, peels off a shoe and starts rubbing his left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man, these things are killing me,'' says Richardson, America's
energy secretary and former United Nations ambassador. ''Your feet
swell up when you're on airplanes a lot, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has been traveling almost nonstop lately -- trying to
get oil-producing countries to boost their output and bring down
gasoline prices, visiting a New Mexico nuclear lab scorched by a
wildfire, stumping for Vice President Al Gore's Democratic
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now Richardson, 52, is being mentioned as Gore's potential
running mate. Gore aides positioned him right behind the vice
president as Gore claimed victory in the March 7 Super Tuesday
primaries, getting Richardson right in TV-camera view and
increasing the Washington buzz about the top Hispanic in President
Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson says he would be honored to be on the ticket but is
not openly pursuing the job. Former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who is heading Gore's running mate search, met with
Richardson last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His down-to-earth, take-off-your-shoes personality, friends and
supporters say, stands Richardson in good stead, whether he's
trying to win the release of captives from the likes of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein or wooing skeptical voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very comfortable in situations that would make you or I
very uncomfortable,'' said Earl Potter, a friend for more than two
decades. ''He's very used to walking into a room and having
everybody with their swords drawn and being very antagonistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson credits his upbringing. Born in California to a
Boston banker father and a Mexican mother, Richardson spent most of
his childhood in Mexico City. He spoke English with his father and
Spanish with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''The personal background of being bicultural makes resolving
differences between cultures something that appeals to me,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats lobbying for Richardson for vice president include
prominent Hispanics such as former California state Assembly
Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. Backers say having Richardson on the
ticket could help Gore in heavily Latino states like California,
Illinois and even Texas, home to GOP contender and Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never before in this country's history have either of the
major parties nominated a Hispanic candidate. This could be a
historic moment,'' said David Garcia, executive director of the New
Mexico Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson does not want to be defined by his heritage
alone, and says that's one reason he's focused on ''nontraditional,
non-Hispanic'' issues such as diplomacy and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe you're a stronger Hispanic advocate if you're a
player in the mainstream,'' he said. ''I'm very proud to be
Hispanic. But the key to being successful as an American public
figure is not to be pigeonholed.''
</P>
<P>
   But as energy secretary, Richardson risks being pigeonholed as
the head of an agency that makes news mainly for its missteps. He
took the helm of the agency in 1998, just as controversy surged
about the agency's handling of alleged spying at nuclear weapons
labs.
</P>
<P>
   And although gasoline prices have eased from their highs of
earlier this year, another jump in price could increase criticism
of Richardson -- and hurt his running-mate prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I relish solving problems,'' Richardson said. ''I've fired
contractors. I've done international initiatives. I've used
diplomacy to get this department a high profile. But there are
still a lot of problems we have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   As a New Mexico congressman, Richardson alienated some core
Democratic supporters -- labor unions and environmentalists -- with
his strong support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Labor opposed NAFTA because of the potential for job losses to
Mexico, while some environmentalists worried the pact could
undermine U.S. environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   An advantage is Richardson's diplomatic experience. While in
Congress, he negotiated the release of American captives held by
North Korea, Iraq and Sudanese rebels. Clinton named him ambassador
to the United Nations in 1997, where he worked to negotiate peace
among warring factions in Afghanistan and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Picking Richardson also could help Gore win New Mexico, a state
regarded as a toss-up in the presidential race. New Mexico has only
five electoral votes, but friends and supporters say he would be a
relentless campaigner who could connect with voters who have been
turned off by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a take-charge attitude, a dogged pursuit of any goal he
sets,'' said Jeff Smith, a friend from high school who later served
as chief of staff in Richardson's congressional office.

<HEADLINE> Murder Rattles Indiana Town  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTER, Ind. (AP) -- Mike Anton was recently startled awake in
the middle of the night, but not by an intruder or a noise. It was
the memory of Rick Pinkerton, his dead friend.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton, 56, was gunned down at the front door of his home May
30, apparently by someone posing as a pizza delivery driver. The
slaying is oddly similar to a 13-year-old killing in Illinois, but
so far it has only mystified authorities and frightened residents
like Anton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I have any enemies. But this makes you think
that maybe you're not safe,'' he said. ''That's an eerie,
uncomfortable, foreign feeling for us in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Pinkerton, co-owner of P&AMP;P Pinkerton Fuels &AMP;
Lubricants, was the first murder in 16 years in this town of 4,000
near the Indiana Dunes along Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Porter attracts tourists who stroll along its lakefront park, go
swimming, fishing, hiking, picnicking or camping. Visitors come for
its maple syrup, antiques, quaint farms and wineries.
</P>
<P>
   The killing left more than Anton sleeping uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably what this means is that we're just like any other
city,'' Town Council President Eugene Bodnar said. ''Anything can
happen to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the gunman parked in front of Pinkerton's
business and walked a quarter of a mile through the woods to his
ranch-style home. Then the killer rang the doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton responded and was hit twice, glass shattering around
him.
</P>
<P>
   Police found three shell casings and two Pizza Hut boxes with
the name ''Martinez'' on them. In the nearby woods, police found a
backpack containing a ski mask, knife, camouflage bandanna,
binoculars and a towel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It almost has the ring of a gangland hit,'' Anton said.
''That's really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton's girlfriend, who had been watching TV during the
shooting, heard words exchanged before the gunfire but couldn't
hear what was said, police say. Authorities are withholding her
name for her protection.
</P>
<P>
   The murder is vaguely similar to the unsolved slaying of an
Amoco Oil Co. executive in the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights
in 1987. A gunman shot Charles E. Merriam as he answered his front
door; no one was ever caught.
</P>
<P>
   Three shots were fired at each scene. One gun was used on
Pinkerton; Merriam was shot twice with a .38 caliber pistol and
once with a .25-caliber gun. Pinkerton was shot at 10 p.m.; Merriam
was shot about 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both worked with Amoco and there were three shots fired at the
front door, but that's where the similarities end right now,''
Assistant Police Chief Jim Menn said. ''But we're not ruling
anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both men were involved in the oil business, Merriam
supervised more than 1,000 gas stations in Illinois, Indiana and
Wisconsin, and Chicago police believe his shooting may be related
to business.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Poparad, co-owner of P&AMP;P Pinkerton, said the business
supplies gasoline, diesel fuel and lubricants to farmers,
construction companies and steel mills. He said it is not the type
of business that creates enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mueller, an Amoco spokesman, said Tuesday the company has
not been contacted about possible similarities. Some Porter
residents almost wish there was a connection between the two
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people here hope that it wasn't just random, sad and
twisted as that might be,'' said Paula Deiotte, the town's clerk
and treasurer. ''Because if it was just random, that's even
scarier.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends describe Pinkerton as a fun-loving person who liked to
golf and fish. He also was a pilot and flew as much as he could,
and he enjoyed traveling on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say Rick wanted to get a taste of it all,'' Anton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lived life to the fullest,'' Poparad said.
</P>
<P>
   In his younger days, Pinkerton had been active in politics and
community events, although he wasn't quite as involved in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Porter wonder whether the case will be solved. Tom
Lindquist, who has been cutting hair in town for 40 years, has
confidence in the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the size of the town, I think we can match anybody,''
Lindquist said. ''If this case isn't solved, here will probably be
speculation on who did this and why for years to come.''

<HEADLINE> Deposits, Heart Disease Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Heart disease -- America's No. 1 killer -- could be
reduced by the development of drugs to prevent calcium deposits in
arteries of the heart, suggests a study published today.
</P>
<P>
   The deposits are thought to be precursors to the fatty buildups
that cause a narrowing of the arteries and lead to heart attacks
and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   People with calcium deposits are much more likely to be smokers
and have high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. All of
those factors are thought to contribute to calcification.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're seeing here is a consequence of lifestyle that is
modifiable, so we're looking at a condition that is preventable,''
said Dr. Carlos Iribarren, a researcher at the Kaiser Permanente
Medical Care Program in Oakland, Calif., who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Because calcium deposits do not automatically lead to heart
disease in all cases, Iribarren said it is too soon to recommend
widespread screening. Such screening could, in turn, lead to more
invasive tests.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 116,309 men and women in a San Francisco-area
Kaiser health maintenance program was published in today's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were ages 30 to 89 and had not been diagnosed
with heart disease when they were given chest X-rays during a
checkup between 1964 and 1973. Their medical records were obtained
for the ensuing years.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose X-rays showed calcium deposits ran a 25 percent
higher risk of developing heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Women with the deposits faced a 50 percent higher risk of having
blood clot-related strokes. Among men, there was no increased
stroke risk.
</P>
<P>
   While previous studies have shown that calcification is a risk
factor for heart disease, the researchers said their findings
clarify the extent of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar study published in 1996, calcium deposits were
discovered through an ultrafast type of CT scanning called Electron
Beam Computed Tomography.
</P>
<P>
   EBCT is better at detecting the deposits than traditional X-rays
but was not available at the start of Iribarren's research.
Iribarren said his study thus may not have identified the full
extent of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   EBCT is also expensive -- about $400 to $500 a scan.

<HEADLINE> Menigitis Vaccine Tested in Babies  </HEADLINE>
By TAMMY WEBBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new vaccine is the first to safely and
effectively immunize infants against a form of meningococcal
disease, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis, researchers
reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   British researchers tested the meningococcal C vaccine on 182
infants in Oxfordshire, England, and found it gave them
long-lasting antibodies against the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Although Britain began routinely using the vaccine in infants at
the end of 1999, it is not yet available in the United States,
where approval could take two to three years, said Nancy
Rosenstein, an epidemiologist at the Centers of Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcal C bacteria cause about one-third of the 3,000 U.S.
cases of meningococcal disease each year; types Y and B cause the
others. There are no vaccines against Y and B for infants.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcal disease can cause bacterial meningitis, an
infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The
disease can also cause a fatal bloodstream infection.
</P>
<P>
   A meningococcal vaccine now used in the United States is not
recommended for infants, whose immune systems are not fully
developed. It also eventually stops protecting. It is most often
used to treat outbreaks of the disease and to inoculate travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has approved two other infant vaccines to
prevent diseases that can cause meningitis -- one is effective
against the Haemophilus influenzae type b, the other against
pneumococcal bacteria.

search of new investments and lower trade barriers, conceding his
economy may grow slower than expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press, Fernando De
la Rua also defended austerity policies that have caused some
discontent among citizens paying higher taxes, public workers with
reduced salaries and hard-line unions disgruntled by labor reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, Latin America's third-largest economy, has struggled
to recover from a 22-month recession brought on by the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, and compounded by Brazil's devaluation of its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th-century Pink House, the downtown presidential office
building, De la Rua said his economic advisers have scaled back
Argentina's growth target for the year from 4 percent to 3.5
percent, ''or maybe a little less.''
</P>
<P>
   But many private economists say the country will come out of the
recession with an expansion rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's first U.S. visit since assuming the presidency six
months ago comes amid national belt-tightening. The 62-year-old
president is to meet financial and business leaders in New York on
Monday and President Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will be seeking increased private investment from
American firms, especially in telecommunications, and will be
pressing the Clinton administration to reduce import restrictions
on Argentine goods such as steel pipe, orange juice and beef.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua announced a new round of spending cuts in late May as
he tries to re-ignite the idling economy. His plan calls for an
annual 12 percent to 15 percent reduction in the salaries of state
employees, a deregulation of the country's health system and a cut
in state pensions, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, De la Rua said government deficits ''have been
reduced'' and his administration is ''taking hard measures firmly
for the country's economic health.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua stressed that while he has tried to wring savings out
of the budget, he hasn't cut spending on public health and
education, ''we have increased efficiency, but have made no cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and civil servants have protested the measures,
including a national work stoppage Friday. But De la Rua said he
does not view it ''as an expression of a permanent social crisis,''
nor as a forerunner of social violence.
</P>
<P>
   A bulletin board along a corridor near the president's office
was festooned with leaflets urging a staff walkout Friday. As
reporters crossed a patio leading to the presidential wing, a
shower of leaflets in support of the stoppage fluttered down from
an upper balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment stands at 14 percent and many companies have taken
jobs across the border to Brazil, which devalued its currency in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's exports are more expensive and thus less competitive
because of the one-for-one link of the Argentine peso to the
dollar. But De la Rua said he would not consider eliminating it.
''Maintaining parity is necessary'' to protect the country's
economic infrastructure, he said. Much local debt is denominated in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua also reaffirmed Argentina's support for the
four-nation trading bloc known as Mercosur, which also includes
neighboring Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. He predicted the group
would have a common currency ''within two or three years,''
although financial experts have predicted it would take at least 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua also said the Mercosur countries as a group support
Clinton's call for a hemisphere-wide free trade area, even though
some of them have shown no great enthusiasm for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua held to the traditional Latin American posture of
nonintervention when asked for his reaction to the May 28 run-off
election in Peru, boycotted by opposition candidate Alejandro
Toledo and won by incumbent President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the electoral process, but said economic sanctions
against Peru, proposed by some critics, would cause hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people would suffer,'' he said. ''I am against
blockades.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually reserved De la Rua became emotional while discussing
a planned visit to the Holocaust Memorial in Washington, and said
he had recently hosted a reception honoring Holocaust survivors at
the Pink House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked for their forgiveness,'' he said, speaking of
Argentina's role in harboring Nazi war criminals after World War
II, and for the difficulties imposed on refugees seeking to enter
the country.

<HEADLINE> NBA, 'Millionaire' Overshadow Tonys  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Broadway was no match for basketball and ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Awards telecast Sunday night drew only 8.5 million
viewers, despite Rosie O'Donnell's presence as host, Nielsen Media
Research said Tuesday. The ratings are the lowest in the show's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The previous low came in 1996, the year before O'Donnell was
host for the first time and briefly revived interest in the show.
O'Donnell's presence after a one-year absence on Sunday didn't make
much difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonys, which even drew fewer viewers than ABC's telecast of
the World Music Awards, competed directly with ABC's ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' and the gripping seventh game of the Los Angeles
Lakers-Portland Trailblazers NBA playoff contest on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight marks the second matchup of the summer's most intriguing
ratings contest: CBS's ''Survivor'' series against ''Millionaire.''
ABC has scheduled a special ''Millionaire'' against the CBS reality
series for the second week in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millionaire'' won last week, but just barely, as ''Survivor''
had a strong debut.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's summer animated series, ''Clerks,'' had a mediocre showing
with 7.3 million viewers for its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by basketball, NBC narrowly took the week's ratings crown
with a prime-time average of 10.6 million viewers (7.4 rating, 13
share). ABC had 10.5 million viewers (7.2, 13) and CBS had 9.8
million (7.0, 13). Fox had 6.5 million viewers (4.3, 8).
</P>
<P>
   UPN had 3.4 million viewers (2.3, 4), the WB had 2.1 million
viewers (1.6, 3) and Pax TV drew 1.2 million viewers (0.9, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
9.3 million viewers (7.0 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.4 million viewers (6.4, 15), and the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 7.8 million viewers (6.0, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of May 29-June 4, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings were ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC,
16.0; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 15.1; ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 14.4; ''NBA Playoffs:
Portland at L.A. Lakers,'' NBC, 12.4; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire (Wednesday), ABC, 11.8; ''Survivor,'' CBS, 10.3; ''60
Minutes,'' CBS, 10.2; ''60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 9.8; ''20/20
Downtown,'' ABC, 9.7; ''NBA Playoffs: L.A. Lakers at Portland,''
NBC, 9.3.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Gov. Backs Income Tax  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Gov. Don Sundquist views an income tax
as the way to Tennessee's financial salvation, but the roadblocks
are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Republican proposed a 3.75 percent personal income
tax, his own party has deserted him, lawmakers are backing away
from him and he is booed in public. A columnist for the
conservative National Review magazine even dubbed him the worst
governor in America.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist is sticking to his guns. He believes the tax will save
Tennessee -- routinely at the bottom of national rankings for
spending on education, health care and law enforcement -- from
becoming ''a second-rate state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The collapse of our tax structure occurred on my watch,'' he
said. ''I could patch this thing up for another year or two and let
somebody else worry about it, but I didn't run for office to get
by, to do what was politically expedient.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of nine states without a general personal
income tax. It is facing a budget shortfall of roughly $300 million
when the nation's economy is at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist has proposed the income tax to fund an $18.2 billion
budget for the next fiscal year. His plan would decrease a 6
percent state sales tax to 3.75 percent on most goods and eliminate
it from food. It also would revoke a tax on certain interest and
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has rejected several business tax proposals and
the income tax during the past 15 months, instead looking at
alternatives such as raising taxes on liquor, wine, beer,
cigarettes and home heating energy, or possibly using money from
the national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist has threatened to veto any budget that doesn't include
tax reform and to call a third special session this summer, when 99
House members and 16 of 33 Senate members plan to be home
campaigning for re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is war,'' declared Tommy Hopper, a former state GOP
chairman and a leading anti-income tax activist. ''It will not shed
blood but it will destroy careers. It will tear apart (political)
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters have voiced their opposition to the tax plan in
horn-honking protests and letters to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail sent this week to House members, postal service
worker Lynn Gabriel of Hermitage asked: ''Why can't there be cuts
instead of tax increases? If we can't live off a 7 percent increase
a year in income, there is a definite problem with someone spending
way too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   About 56 cents of every state tax dollar comes from the 6
percent sales tax, but some pay as much as 8.75 percent because of
local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Tennesseans cross the line to shop in eight
surrounding states with income taxes and lower sales taxes. Many
also are lured by lotteries, which are illegal in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the out-of-state workers who commute to
Tennessee, never paying taxes where they use roads and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   ''I go to these national governor's meetings and I'm jealous and
embarrassed,'' Sundquist said. ''I have to listen to all these
states with huge surpluses trying to figure out how to cut their
taxes, and here we are at the bottom without a way to collect from
people who ought to be paying.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only last year, however, that Sundquist began to embrace
an income tax as the solution. He opposed it for most of his
political career -- six terms as a congressman and his first term as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But when a decline in business taxes forced a reassessment of
the tax system, Sundquist said he found it unfair and regressive.
After lawmakers rejected three business tax plans, he forged ahead
with the income tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to tell the people of Tennessee I made a mistake,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist says that while the income tax would raise $450
million more for the state coffers, residents would pay $54 million
less in taxes under his plan. He said he is disappointed by the
public opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The lone outspoken supporter of Sundquist's plan is state Sen.
Bob Rochelle, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public has been told for so long that no politician acts
in the general best interest that it's taken them a long time to
understand that's what we're trying to do,'' Rochelle said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Sundquist was booed when introduced at a celebration
of the Tennessee Titans' American Football Conference championship.
Anti-tax groups have run radio and television ads across the state,
and organized protests at the capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Republican Party voted in December not to support
his plan. Legislators who might have agreed with the governor were
scared off by the public's outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you see zero support for an issue it's just a futile
waste of time to continue to pursue it,'' said House Republican
Leader Steve McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old Sundquist ends his second term as governor in
2002 and doesn't plan to seek another political office. If he ends
his career as the hated governor who supported an income tax, so be
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident that what I'm doing will be vindicated in the
future, that people will look back and say, 'He made the decisions
that should have been made, he led the way he should have led, and
what he said was accurate.'''

<HEADLINE> Gore To Appear in DNC Ad  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ads featuring Al Gore and the issue of
prescription drugs for senior citizens will hit TV airwaves in more
than a dozen states on Thursday as the Democratic National
Committee launches a multimillion-dollar campaign to boost its
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will feature Gore discussing drug coverage and will
outline differences in how the two political parties approach the
issue, two senior Democrats said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs are not covered under Medicare. The Clinton
administration has proposed a plan for drug coverage, but
congressional Republicans have been slow to embrace the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which will be identical across the country, will air in
15 states including much of the Midwest battleground, according to
several Democratic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. A
Spanish version will air on Hispanic stations, one top Democrat
said.
</P>
<P>
   This first ad will continue at least through Sunday, the start
of a campaign that will cost upward of $25 million and continue
through the Democratic National Convention in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, which has worked closely with the DNC in
developing the ads, has little money left from a hard-fought
primary to air commercials of its own. Therefore, the vice
president is relying on the party to carry his message until the
campaign's coffers are restocked after he becomes the official
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The ads dovetail with plans being developed to have the
Democratic presidential candidate crisscross battleground states
next week, in what some Gore aides described as a ''prosperity
tour'' highlighting the Clinton-Gore administration's economic
record.
</P>
<P>
   The ads comes as Gore shifts his campaign into a positive mode,
setting aside direct attacks on Republican rival George W. Bush.
Like Gore on the stump, the summer ad campaign will include upbeat
messages about his life story and Democratic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent national polls suggest Gore's new approach may be
working, although Bush has led Gore in many surveys and, at this
early stage, the Texas governor is performing better in the
state-by-state contest.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC ad campaign has been anticipated for months and was
expected to start soon after Gore and Bush wrapped up the party
nominations in March.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gore challenged Republicans to forgo ads paid for with
unlimited contributions known as soft money, promising that the DNC
wouldn't run these ads ''unless and until'' the Republican National
Committee did.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now charge that Gore is breaking his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like to me they're laying out a smoke screen to
provide an excuse for Al Gore to break his promise,'' Bush said
Tuesday in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats respond that the proposal was never accepted and note
that the original challenge included Republican-leaning outside
groups, which have already spent more than $2 million in anti-Gore
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''They rejected my offer,'' Gore said Tuesday on ABC's ''Good
Morning America.'' The pro-Bush ads, he said, began airing ''months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are likely to respond with an ad campaign of their
own, and they have more money available.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC is targeting a half dozen states in the traditional
battleground stretching from Pennsylvania across the Midwest,
including Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also will air the spots in states where they should hold the
edge and in others that lean Republican, where Gore hopes to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will air in three states -- Iowa, Oregon and Washington --
that have voted Democratic in the last three elections. Gore
advisers say they are confident he will win those states and hope
that buying ad time there will tempt Bush to spend -- and waste --
money in states he will ultimately lose.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will also run in several Southern states -- Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, as Gore pushes into territory
where President Clinton did well. They're also set for Maryland,
aimed at viewers in neighboring Delaware, a swing state, and in New
Mexico, another tight race.
</P>
<P>
   In total, according to a tally by the Bush campaign, the DNC is
spending about $1.9 million on this weekend of advertising, buying
most major markets in each state. An AP survey found the DNC buying
ad time in Seattle, St. Louis and Tampa, Fla., and across the state
of Kentucky.

Judge Could Rule Today on Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- With final arguments in hand, a judge overseeing the historic
Microsoft Corp. antitrust case may be ready to rule on whether to split the
computer software giant into two separate companies. On Tuesday, Microsoft
attorneys filed a fresh response to the Justice Department's breakup plan. The
company's filing -- a day earlier than expected -- cleared the way for the U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who sits in Washington, D.C., to rule at
any time. As his company was taking care of the last-minute legal work,
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was in Washington, D.C., appearing at a
congressional hearing on the future of high technology in the United States and

Solomon Island Rebels Fire at Coast

   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Fighting between rival rebel factions on the
Solomon Islands intensified Wednesday, with one using a stolen gunboat to fire
cannon rounds at coastal encampments set up by the other group, a Solomon
Islands official said. A rebel spokesman, Andrew Nori, said his side killed 100
enemies. He said he received the information from colleagues who fired a machine
gun from the gunboat directly into a crowd of people, as well from others on the
ground watching. Nori said there had been about 300 to 400 armed men on the
beach. ''There were no civilians,'' he told The Associated Press. ''They were
all carrying weapons. They were not holding a picnic.''

Schweitzer held off John Driscoll, a well-known political figure who challenged
Democratic Sen. Max Baucus in 1990. Driscoll conducted his low-key pitch mostly
through his Web site, and did little fund raising. With 12 percent of precincts
reporting, Schweitzer had 13,069 votes, 67 percent, and Driscoll had 6,513

despite prodding by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright they remained far

has not been formally discussed, a senior U.S. official said. On the Palestinian

<HEADLINE> 'Slavemaster' Suspected in 5 Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MILBURN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISONVILLE, Mo. (AP) -- A man who solicited sadomasochistic
sex over the Internet using the name ''slavemaster'' is considered
the prime suspect in the deaths of five women whose bodies were
found stuffed in barrels in Kansas and Missouri, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's arrest of John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, led police
to two bodies found Saturday on his property in La Cygne, Kan.
Three more bodies in 55-gallon drums were discovered Monday at a
storage locker rented by Robinson about 30 miles away, in Raymore.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies showed the victims died of blunt trauma to the head,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began draining a pond on Robinson's property
Tuesday afternoon and were to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be surprised if we found any more bodies,'' said Paul
Morrison, the district attorney in Johnson County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was not immediately charged in the women's deaths. He
was being held on $5 million bond after being charged Monday with
sexual assault on two women at hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The two women told authorities they objected to him
photographing them and said he brutalized them in a way that went
beyond what they intended. One of the women had traveled from Texas
to have a sexual encounter with Robinson in April.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the five victims are believed to be related to
Robinson's alleged Internet relationships with women interested in
sadomasochism. He was known to use the screen name ''slavemaster''
in his computer correspondence and sometimes called himself James
Turner in person, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said he expected to file murder charges by week's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had not retained a lawyer as of Tuesday and was being
represented by the Johnson County public defender's office,
Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference in Harrisonville with Cass County
Prosecutor Chris Koster, Morrison said the case began three months
ago as a missing persons investigation. It gained momentum after
the two women came forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had been working on this case for several weeks when those
victims came forward,'' Morrison said ''It helped us out a lot.
Kind of manna from heaven.''
</P>

   Robinson was arrested Friday at his home at a mobile home park
in Olathe, Kan., managed by his wife. Morrison said dozens of
photographs of women and computer equipment were confiscated.

<HEADLINE> McCourt Brothers Sued Over Royalties  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank McCourt and his brother, Malachy, have
turned their grim yet hilarious experiences of growing up Irish
into a pot of gold. Now someone wants a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-playwright Mike Houlihan sued the brothers Monday in U.S.
District Court in Chicago, saying they have largely ignored their
1984 agreement to pay him royalties for their autobiographical
works.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a word, they stiffed him,'' said Edmund Scanlan, Houlihan's
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book ''Angela's
Ashes,'' which was made into a Hollywood film, and brother Malachy,
who penned the best-selling ''A Monk Swimming,'' deny that they
have shortchanged Houlihan.
</P>
<P>
   The claim goes back to 1984 and the McCourts' play, ''A Couple
of Blaguards,'' about their childhood in Limerick, Ireland. The
play featured gossiping old women, a scolding grandmother, a kindly
priest and various eccentrics.
</P>
<P>
   Houlihan said he put up $20,750 to produce the play and enlisted
other investors to help. The brothers signed a contract
guaranteeing Houlihan a share of the royalties and subsidiary
rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The play wasn't performed much until ''Angela's Ashes'' hit it
big. Since then it has been in production all over the world and
Houlihan claims the subsidiary rights cover not only ''Angela's
Ashes'' but Frank's ''Tis'' and Malachy's ''A Monk Swimming,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   Houlihan says all those works are based on ''A Couple of
Blaguards.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They just put on a different name and put it out there,''
Scanlan said. ''They really are a couple of blaguards.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanlan said the suit could run into the millions of dollars
once the revenues from the McCourts' various projects are
tabulated. No court date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Malachy McCourt said Tuesday he hadn't seen a copy of the
lawsuit, ''so the nature of it sort of escapes me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But if you write the words, 'Good morning' in a script, does
that mean that you can never say it again without paying
royalties?'' he asked. ''The man is a parasite, he always has been.
They come out of the earth when the lust and greed gets to them.''

<HEADLINE> Angels 6, Giants 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn's single capped a ninth-inning
comeback as the Anaheim Angels overcame Barry Bonds' major
league-leading 25th homer to beat the San Francisco Giants 6-5
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard's RBI double off Troy Percival (4-2) gave the
Giants a 5-4 lead in the ninth, but Robb Nen (0-2) blew a save for
the fourth time in 12 tries and second time in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy singled with one out, pinch-hitter Scott Spiezio
walked and Erstad followed with an RBI single. Nen then charged
Kevin Stocker's squeeze bunt and threw out Spiezio at the plate --
Angels manager Mike Scioscia argued briefly -- and Erstad scored
just ahead of Armando Rios' throw on Vaughn's single to right,
upending catcher Doug Mirabelli.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco took a 3-0 lead in the third on Benard's two-run
homer and Bonds' 10th homer in 16 games following a back injury.
The 493-foot drive to right was the longest in two-plus seasons
since the ballpark was renovated.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller's RBI single put the Giants ahead 4-1 in the
seventh. The Angeles closed in the bottom half on RBI singles by
Bengie Molina and Darin Erstad, then tied it in the eighth on Tim
Salmon's homer off rookie Aaron Fultz.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nathan, activated from the disabled list before the game,
allowed one run and three hits in 5 2-3 innings. He had been
sidelined since May 13 because of right shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Angels rookie Seth Etherton allowed four runs and six hits in 6
1-3 innings and started an inning-ending 1-2-3 double play in the
fifth. He'll probably go back to Triple-A Edmonton because the
Angels won't need a fifth starter again until June 17, and Tim
Belcher probably will have been activated by then.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn drove in a run in the sixth with an infield out -- a liner
that popped out of Nathan's glove.
</P>
<P>
Ntes: Bonds' previous high before the All-Star break was 24 homers
in 1993, when he finished with a career-high 46. He has 470 homers,
five behind Stan Musial and Willie Stargell, who are tied for 18th.
... The Giants designated OF Terrell Lowery for assignment. ...
Mark Petkovsek, on the disabled list since May 17 because of viral
syndrome, is to make his first rehab starts on Wednesday and Friday
at Class-A Lake Elsinor. ... Jeff Kent was 1-for-5, stranding eight
runners.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Gets OK To Test Missiles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan has obtained permission from the
United States to test the U.S.-built Patriot missiles in the
island, the first time the missiles will be tested outside the
United States, defense officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, designed to intercept incoming missiles, are an
important part of Taiwan's defense against China's Dongfeng-31 -- a
nuclear-capable missile that can reach as far as the western United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman who spoke on customary anonymity said
Taiwan received permission to test the PAC-2 next year, and only
have to work out the details. He did not say when the United States
had given its permission.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military has acquired 200 PAC-2 missiles, upgraded
versions of the Patriots used by U.S. forces during the 1991
Persian Gulf War. Taiwan has test-fired the missiles in the United
States, but the military wants to observe how they work in Taiwan's
subtropical climate.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's defense chief Wu Shih-wen last week confirmed Taiwan's
wanted to test the Patriot missiles outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China will test-fire its Dongfeng-31 missiles in the near
future, Chinese-language newspapers reported today, without
specifying when the tests would be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   It would be China's fifth test of the missile, and the flight
path would likely be from the northern Shanxi region toward China's
northwestern Xinjiang region, the respected China Times quoted
Taiwanese security officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese defense officials said they had no information on the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949. Although the two
sides have been ruled separately for decades, Beijing views Taiwan
as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland, by
force if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves To Ban Shark Finning  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lucrative practice of slicing off a
shark's fins and leaving the fish to die in the ocean would be
outlawed in U.S. federal waters under legislation approved by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed the House 390-1 on Tuesday and now goes
to the Senate. It is aimed mainly at Pacific Ocean fishermen
profiting from markets in Asia, where shark's fin soup is a pricey
delicacy. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, was the lone no vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a hunter, diver and fisherman myself, I believe we must end
the unsportsmanlike, environmentally harmful and wasteful practice
of shark finning,'' said Rep. Randy ''Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif.,
the chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make it illegal to land or possess shark fins
without the carcass in U.S. federal waters, which extend out 200
miles from American territories. It would effectively stop finning
among most fishermen who lack the storage to transport shark of
otherwise little economic value.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department in 1993 took administrative action to
halt finning in Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico waters after
it became apparent that the practice was affecting shark
populations.
</P>
<P>
   But finning has continued in the western and central Pacific,
particularly off Hawaii, where finning was less prevalent a decade
ago and the effects on blue shark are disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The department's National Marine Fisheries Service has argued
that shark finning is wasteful and should be stopped, but has met
resistance from the federal Western Pacific Regional Fishery
Management Council, based in Honolulu, which says there is no
evidence the blue shark population is being depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Spalding, a council spokeswoman, said it recently adopted
a plan to protect blue sharks that includes an annual quota of
50,000 for the Hawaiian longline fleet and places severe limits on
the catching of other shark varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii state legislature also recently approved a no-finning
bill. The legislation awaits the governor's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Spalding said most of the benefits of finning go not to fishing
companies but to fishermen, who derive some 10 percent of their
incomes from the practice. The price of dried shark fins is
reportedly as high as $40 a pound in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean Wildlife Campaign, a coalition of conservation groups,
says the number of sharks killed by Hawaiian longline fisheries
climbed from 2,289 in 1991 to 60,857 in 1998, with 98 percent of
the sharks killed for their fins.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Researchers Deny Genome Map Race  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's no race between two groups mapping the
human genes. Instead, two researchers said they are reaching for
the same goal using different methods that will be
''complementary.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health
program to map the human genome, and Dr. Craig Venter, president of
Celera Genomics, a private Maryland company doing the same thing,
shook hands and complimented each other in a brief meeting Tuesday
at an NIH conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about their competition, Collins told reporters, ''racing
is the wrong metaphor. I wish you would stop using it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Collins said the federally funded project and the
private effort by Venter's company are using different ways to
explore new territories.
</P>
<P>
   Venter agreed, saying the efforts of the two organizations are
''complementary.''
</P>
<P>
   A Celera spokeswoman said results from the two efforts will be
used to ''double check'' each other for accuracy in the sequencing
of the 3.1 billion DNA subunits in the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Venter hinted that Collins' group and his company may be in
discussions about a joint announcement, but declined to be
specific.
</P>
<P>
   He said that earlier the two groups had discussed the
possibility of negotiating a cooperative agreement, but nothing was
firmed up.
</P>
<P>
   Collins leads the National Human Genome Research Institute,
which is part of an international, government-funded effort to
sequence and map all of the human genes. The United States is
spending about $3 billion on the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The government consortium is nearing completion of ''the working
draft,'' which would mean 90 percent of the genome had been
sequenced and checked for accuracy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter is using a computer-driven method he helped pioneer to
map the genome. Celera announced last month it has sequenced the
genes for one human being and may complete assembly of the
sequences this month, probably reaching the goal before NIH.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter rivalry has been reported between Venter and Collins'
group. But the two were all smiles Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The controversy has been painful for both of us,'' said
Venter. ''But a good effect is that the world is far more aware of
genomics (study of genes) than before.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Competition is a good thing,'' added Collins. ''It gets the
blood stirred up.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were speakers at the annual scientific conference of the
General Motors Cancer Research Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Venter said his company would ''publicly and
freely'' release its map of the human genome when it was completed.
The announcement came after some researchers had charged that
Celera was withholding gene information to sell the data to drug
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The government-funded effort puts its genetic data on the
Internet daily, available to all. Venter said his company will do
the same when the project is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of credit goes to Celera,'' Collins said after the
announcement. ''They are taking this data, that they paid dearly
for, and making it available to the academic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Celera will make a profit if the information is given
away, Venter said his firm would sell its interpretation and the
use of its massive gene-analysis computer system. Celera's $100
million facility in Rockville, Md., is one of the largest civilian
computer assemblages in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Celera already has completed, or been a partner in, genetic maps
for a microbe and the fruit fly, and is about a third of the way
through a project to sequence genes of a strain of laboratory mice.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is all of the genes that give instructions for
an individual's biological development and the functioning of the
cells.

<HEADLINE> Bipartisan Patients' Rights Possible  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats said they may bypass House-Senate
negotiations on a patients' bill of rights and introduce as early
as today a bipartisan bill on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The move is being led by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a key
member of the committee that has been working for more than three
months to combine bills passed by the House and Senate aimed at
strengthening the hand of patients in dealing with HMOs and other
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   With talks stalled and time running out before the summer
recess, Kennedy and other Democrats are ready to take alternative
steps to get a bill, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   As early as today, Kennedy may offer legislation -- fashioned
after the bipartisan House bill favored by the White House and some
Republicans -- as an amendment to a defense authorization bill now
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would guarantee basic protections for all 161
million Americans in private health plans, establish a process for
appealing HMO decisions and expand patients' rights to sue their
health plans if they were harmed by decisions not to cover care.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans cast doubt on whether the bill could pass
and accused Democrats of trying to foil efforts to reach bipartisan
agreement so they could tell voters this fall that Republicans
wouldn't support patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his allies believe re-election pressures will bring
enough GOP support, because some senators will want their campaigns
to address patients' frustrations with managed care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are optimistic we can do so,'' said Jim Manley, Kennedy's
spokesman. A vote on the defense bill could come within two weeks,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who is working with
Kennedy on the bill and helping to recruit Senate Republicans, is
looking at including GOP-favored tax provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Possibilities include tax deductions for people who purchase
their own insurance and modest expansion of a medical savings
account pilot program that lets self-employed people save tax-free
money to pay doctor bills, said John Stone, Norwood's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans criticized the Democrats' plan to
circumvent their own efforts to reach a compromise, which would go
to both houses of Congress for a vote and then to President Clinton
for signing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moving to the floor right now would be an act of extremely
poor faith,'' said Gayle Osterberg, speaking for Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., committee chairman. ''If we are going to have a bipartisan
agreement then folks should be supportive of the conference and
have some patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is still open to a committee agreement on a bill, Manley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a GOP-backed patients' rights bill last year
that would provide many of the same protections as the proposed
legislation, but would not expand lawsuit rights and applies to
fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Another patients' rights bill passed last fall would have to be
reintroduced and voted on again in the House, where Republicans are
divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some, siding with Democrats, say all Americans should get
federal protections and health plans should be held liable for
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Republicans, however, believe patient protections
should be left up to states and contend that employers will drop
worker health benefits rather than face expensive lawsuits, adding
to the 44 million uninsured Americans.

<HEADLINE> Hospital budget predicts surplus at end of next fiscal year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) - A budget for the next fiscal year at
the University of Connecticut Health Center predicts a $170,000
surplus, the result of an infusion of millions of dollars in state
bailout money.
</P>
<P>
   The $430 million spending package unveiled Tuesday for the
fiscal year that begins July 1 and ends June 30, 2001, includes
$4.4 million in state money, part of $20 million for the health
center approved by the General Assembly in May.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the state money was used to help fill the $21
million hole in this year's budget and to pay for an expansion of
biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message to the staff is not to breathe a large sigh of
relief; there are state dollars in this (budget) that are not
recurring,'' said Daniel Upton, interim chief financial officer at
the Farmington health center.
</P>
<P>
   The health center includes UConn's medical and dental schools
and John Dempsey Hospital, which has been losing about $1 million a
month.
</P>
<P>
   UConn officials have said the shortfall is largely the result of
growing discounts in managed care insurance payments, shorter
hospital stays, and a sharp reduction in federal Medicare payments
to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The university has taken several cost-cutting steps, including
an administrative reorganization and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's budget projects a modest increase in the number of
patients treated at John Dempsey and in private doctors' offices at
the center. It also assumes that private grant funding for research
will increase by 17.6 percent to $62.5 million in the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   The budget includes $3 million for new programs. Millions more
for those initiatives - including a request for additional state
money - is expected to be included in the health center's 2002 and
2003 budgets. Health center administrators are scheduled to present
plans for those budgets to the board of trustees this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 budget ''is a foundation for the strategic plan,'' said
Lorraine Aronson, UConn's vice president for finance, planning and
management.

<HEADLINE> Freeh, Reno Clash Over Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying he was ''surprised'' by a comment
linking ''pressure'' in the campaign fund-raising probe to Attorney
General Janet Reno's future in the Clinton administration, FBI
Deputy Director William Esposito immediately informed his boss,
Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   The November 1996 conversation between Esposito and Lee Radek,
chief of the Justice Department public integrity section,
foreshadowed the bitter disagreement between the FBI and top Reno
aides over the handling of the fund-raising investigation. The FBI
said the Justice Department should turn it over to an independent
counsel. The department refused.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito and Radek testified at two congressional hearings
Tuesday as the House Government Reform Committee spewed out 61
Justice Department and FBI documents laying bare the bureaucratic
battle that began in 1996 and continues today.
</P>
<P>
   In one memo, Freeh said he told Reno that Radek's comment about
''pressure'' and Reno's job ''would be enough for me to take him
and the Criminal Division off the case completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying to the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
administrative oversight and the courts, Esposito recalled being
told by Freeh that Radek's comment ''was a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Radek flatly denied ever linking Reno's job with the
fund-raising probe. The public integrity chief testified that the
only ''pressure'' he felt was ''to do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's memos were just one of the sources urging Reno to
unleash an independent counsel investigation on President Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and top administration aides.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the Justice Department said no independent counsel
was warranted, top Reno adviser Bob Litt said an independent
counsel should be appointed to look into possible false statements
by Gore about his fund-raising phone calls from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Radek didn't want an independent counsel for Clinton and Gore.
But Radek did recommend at one point an independent counsel be
appointed to investigate deputy White House chief of staff Harold
Ickes for possibly lying to Congress. Radek was overruled.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Freeh and Justice Department prosecutor Charles
LaBella, head of the Justice Department fund-raising task force,
who were the most vehement. Freeh recounted a Dec. 4, 1998 meeting
with Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ... argued once again that the Attorney General has and had
had for some time an irrevocable political conflict of interest
which makes it inappropriate and -- in my judgment -- impossible for
her ... to make legal ... decisions'' regarding a probe of
President Clinton and Gore, Freeh wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the gravity of the Attorney General's political conflict
of interest -- as well as the DOJ's and her principal advisers -- I
cannot imagine a more compelling matter for the appointment of an
Independent Counsel,'' Freeh concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Radek and the public integrity section that he heads came in for
harsh criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public Integrity is ... a black hole'' and Radek's nickname is
''Doctor No'' because he always declines to prosecute, complained
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Public Integrity Section deputy Joseph Gangloff defended Radek
at the hearing before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, saying the
FBI did not understand some of the complicated legal issues that
needed to be considered when dealing with the law on appointing
independent counsels.

from 1961 to 1965, has died of pneumonia at age 88.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure at Air Force secretary, the nation was
involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis
and saw its involvement in the war in Vietnam escalate.
</P>
<P>
   He died Monday at Sibley Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His career in government service stretched back to 1937 when he
started a three-year stint as an attorney for the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Navy during World War II, he became a
special assistant to the secretary of war for air in 1946, and then
an assistant secretary of the Air Force from 1947 to 1952. He spent
the next two years as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his government posts, Zuckert helped found
Project HOPE in 1958 and served as the medical training and relief
organization's board chairman from 1967 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   During his Washington years, he practiced law between tours with
the government. At the time of his death, he was of counsel to the
Washington firm of Zuckert Scoutt &AMP; Rasenberger, which he helped
found.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Academy Changes Honor Code  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- A Pentagon investigation has
prompted Air Force Academy officials to revamp the way the
academy's honor code is enforced and evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   While wording of the code, ''We will not lie, steal or cheat,
nor tolerate anyone among us who does,'' will not change, the
proposed reforms are still significant, said Joe Traficanti, a
retired Air Force attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a deep and expansive look into the current protocol
surrounding the honor code,'' said Traficanti who helped update the
procedures in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon began reviewing the code after Senior Cadet Juan
Nieves was expelled for poor grades last year. He said his academic
performance slipped because he was defending himself against a
professor's accusations of honor code violations.
</P>
<P>
   He was cleared of the allegations, and earlier this year, won a
rare reinstatement to the academy from Air Force Secretary F.
Whitten Peters, who ordered the review of the honor code.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force report, portions of which were released Tuesday,
found the cadet-run honor system failed to give Nieves a fair
appeal, questioned the influence professors have in the system and
determined that academy faculty had publicly denigrated the honor
system.
</P>
<P>
   In their response, academy officials defended the system but
offered reforms including a process for professors to recuse
themselves, changes to the honor handbook, more discussion among
commanders about honor cases, more training for new staff on the
system and new measures to assess if the system is working.
</P>
<P>
   Peters has approved the reforms, which the academy is to
implement by June 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my hope that these remedial measures will prevent anyone
else from undergoing what I was subjected to,'' said Nieves, who
expects to graduate this summer.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Pill May Have Restrictions  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposed rules being considered by the
government could restrict access of the early-abortion pill,
RU-486, says the head of Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration had said in February it would
approve sale of RU-486, also known as mifepristone, once some
final, but undisclosed, requirements were met.
</P>
<P>
   The pill's sponsor, the nonprofit Population Council, last week
told abortion providers the FDA is proposing some curbs on the
pill's use, said Gloria Feldt, national president of Planned
Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply concerned that FDA is considering restrictions
that in my view would virtually assure that very few doctors would
ever make mifepristone available,'' Feldt said Tuesday. Planned
Parenthood is a family planning group that favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   She said the biggest concern is an FDA proposal that physicians
allowed to administer RU-486 must be part of a registry, which she
said would deter doctors worried about anti-abortion violence from
offering the pill.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt said the FDA also is considering long-term health tracking
of at least some RU-486 recipients, something she called
unnecessary because half a million European women have used the
pill successfully since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the FDA's recent proposals are more restrictive than
we had expected,'' said Sandra Waldman, speaking for the Population
Council. She would not be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   But Waldman stressed that FDA discussions over the pill's use
have just begun and no requirements are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show RU-486 is 95.5 percent effective in causing
abortion when taken within the first 49 days of pregnancy. But a
very small percentage of patients required additional surgical
treatment or blood transfusions, something the FDA must consider in
determining how the pill should be used. One question is how to
ensure women return for an exam to be sure the pregnancy was
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Population Council in 1994 received U.S. marketing
rights to RU-486 from the original French manufacturer, which
feared an anti-abortion boycott.

<HEADLINE> Army Laser Shoots Down Rocket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- A new laser weapon being
developed to protect Israel from short-range missile attacks shot
down a target rocket for the first time in a successful test,
project officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tactical High Energy Laser took out a short-range Katyusha
rocket on Tuesday, Lt. Gen. John Costello said in a statement
issued by the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command in
Huntsville, Ala. Later tests will attempt to shoot down multiple
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   A string of rocket attacks on Israel in 1996 prompted President
Clinton to approve the program by the Army and the Israeli Ministry
of Defense to develop the $250 million weapon. Congress is
considering an additional $5.7 million for the laser.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials planned to turn it over to Israel this fall if
tests proved it effective. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth
Bacon has said it is up to Israel to disclose how and when it plans
to deploy the new weapon. The Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets are
used by Hezbollah guerrillas against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The laser weapon is being built under contract by
Cleveland-based TRW Space and Laser Programs Division. Costs have
been shared by the Israeli and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   Although this would be the first laser weapon built for defense
against rockets, the Defense Department has said it has no
immediate plan to use it with U.S. forces, in part because the
system is not easily transportable. The Pentagon is working on a
variety of other laser weapon technologies that could be used to
shoot down ballistic missiles in flight, although deployment of
such weapons is at least a decade away.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expands Medicare Coverage  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today directed Medicare to
begin covering costs of routine patient care associated with
clinical tests of new drugs and medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is concerned that too few older Americans take part in
such trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''As America ages, we must provide all our seniors affordable,
quality health care, and we should be using our cutting-edge
science to meet that challenge,'' Clinton said before leaving for a
36-hour trip to Japan to attend memorial services for Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simply put, the more seniors we enroll in trials the faster
we'll be able to use these advances to save American lives,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As the president made the announcement, the White House released
a statement saying: ''With the fast pace of medical advancements
and a continuing effort to make evidence-based medical decisions,
clinical care serves as the first step toward providing new
clinical innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 percent of elderly Americans participate in
clinical trials of drugs and treatments even though the elderly are
more severely affected by disease than are younger people.
</P>
<P>
   The White House cited findings that 63 percent of cancer
patients are older than 65 but people that age make up only 33
percent of those enrolled in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity is greater for breast cancer patients. Elderly
women are 44 percent of breast cancer patients, but only 1.6
percent of women over 65 are in clinical trials for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said current Medicare reimbursement policy
could discourage older people from taking part in clinical trials
because the investigators running the tests cannot be sure that
Medicare will pay for the care.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, older people considering whether to enter the
trials may be responsible for costs simply because they are taking
part in a test and investigators and research centers often are
reluctant to recruit older people because of the uncertainty of
Medicare reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare covers 39 million elderly and disabled Americans. Many
private insurers follow its example in deciding what to cover.
</P>
<P>
   The White House cited progress in treating the youngest patients
as evidence that greater participation in clinical trials by older
people is worthwhile. For decades, more than 50 percent of
pediatric cancer patients have been enrolled in clinical trials,
the White House said, and today 75 percent of cancers in children
are curable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed the Department of Health and Human Services to
revise Medicare guidelines to explicitly authorize payment for
routine patient care associated with clinical trials. This week,
the Health Care Financing Administration will put out word to
Medicare contractors that these costs are reimbursable. Clinton
also wants a tracking system for Medicare payment for test costs.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying Medicare law has been interpreted to bar
reimbursement for routine medical care needed when beneficiaries
participate in clinical trials. Many private insurers also deny
coverage on grounds the treatments were experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who is campaigning for the presidency,
has been advocating Medicare coverage of such clinical trials.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were slightly higher in early
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 16 points in the early
going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange held a 6-5
lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index was ahead 10 points and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index was up 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are showing no real sign of breaking out of the quiet
trading that has marked the past two sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there's been a need for the market to catch its
breath after last week's furious advance.
</P>
<P>
   And the lack of any market-moving news has helped them in that
regard.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, some investors may be content to wait until
Friday's release of the May producer price index before taking on
any new significant positions.
</P>
<P>
   One sector that could see some activity today is the airlines,
on reports of possible further consolidation in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Deer Found Taking Bubble Bath  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   HOWARD, Pa. (AP) -- When Connie Beck and her husband
awoke to
strange noises last weekend, they thought high winds were rattling
their home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What they found was even more unexpected: A deer was taking a
bubble bath in their tub.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't exactly dressed for company,'' Beck said. ''We were
just waking up. Things were flying off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The deer burst through the front door early Saturday, ran past
the couple's bedroom and into the bathroom, somehow managing to
turn on the water in the tub and knocking over a bottle of bubble
bath. He then submerged himself in the frothy water.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could hear the water running over the kicking,'' Beck
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Becks called state Game Commission officials, who arrived at
their Centre County home with tranquilizers and a lot of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy said, 'There's nothing wrong ... he's just in there
taking a bubble bath,''' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   The animal was subdued, removed from the house and released.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was unharmed except for a little cut above the eye,'' Beck
said. ''We were also fortunate. There wasn't much damage, except
for the front door, storm door, some marks on the tub, and a few
hoof prints in the linoleum.''

<HEADLINE> Jury sequestered after eight hours of deliberations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) - A jury resumed deliberations today in the
case of a man accused of killing a co-worker's husband at her
request.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara County jury failed to reach a verdict in the
second-degree murder trial of Michael Northrup after eight hours of
deliberations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup of Caledonia in Livingston County is accused of
shooting John Montstream in June 1998 and leaving the body in the
victim's minivan in a Niagara Falls parking ramp, where it was
found a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Montstream's 41-year-old wife, Annette, is awaiting sentencing
after admitting soliciting someone to kill her husband. She pleaded
guilty in March to first-degree manslaughter and testified that
Northrup, with whom she was romantically involved, volunteered to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Northrup shot Montstream in the town of Sweden
and drove the victim's van to Niagara Falls. He then allegedly
drove home in a pickup truck that he and Annette Montstream had
left there three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said DNA evidence from Northrup's gun matched that
of John Montstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is about how Annette Montstream and Michael Northrup
planned and carried out the murder of John Montstream, a
37-year-old man and father of two, whose only crime was being
married to Annette Montstream,'' said prosecutor Timothy Lundquist
during a 90-minute closing argument Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Attorney John Parrinello on Monday emphasized the
untrustworthiness of Annette Montstream, who had several sexual
affairs during her marriage and lied to keep from being found out.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Montstream and Northrup had met at a shopping mall where
she worked in a coffee shop and he was a security guard.

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Amid the stillness and silence of a museum
exhibition room, an ancient vase stands in its housing, unable to
reveal the secrets of its rich past. But as easily as a visitor
slides on a pair of transparent eyeglasses, the artifact comes to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Images appear to the side of the case, revealing the unearthing
of the vase, providing similar artifacts for comparison as well as
comment and analysis by experts in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of this technology is a prism-like computer chip
inserted into a portion of the eyeglass lens.
</P>
<P>
   This ''augmented reality,'' as it is known, is one form of
technology that could change the museum experience of the 21st
century and beyond. Augmented reality is a way to layer the virtual
world on top of the real world, without replacing reality,
according to Phil Hoffstetter, Multimedia professor at California
State University, Orinda.
</P>
<P>
   While ''virtual reality'' games involve wearing a type of full
head gear that monopolizes most of the senses and shuts out the
rest of the world, augmented reality allows the user to
''navigate'' in the real world, Hoffstetter said.
</P>
<P>
   An example of today's technology is IBM's Wearable Computer. It
has a Walkman-like headset, a display smaller than two sugar cubes
and an attached microphone that allows the user to control the
computer by speaking. The computer is based on the Think Pad Series
and is about the size of a deck of playing cards. The technology
can be tailored to meet the individual needs of museums and their
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The wearable computer has been around since 1998, but the
marriage of the wearable computer to software that recognizes items
and calls up audio and visual enhancements is only a few months
old, according to Cameron Miner, a User Interface Design Engineer
who leads the DesignLab at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San
Jose, Ca. Miner said IBM is the only company that has this
technology.
</P>
<P>
   There are no firm plans in place to operate IBM's augmented
reality wearable computer prototype in any museums, but Miner said
he has spoken with some museums about that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The technology is here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of the technology could prevent smaller museums from
accessing wearable computers.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven percent of all museums have annual budgets of
$100,000 or less, and 38 percent have annual budgets of $50,000 or
less, according to a survey administered by the American
Association of Museums in 1989. The organization says those numbers
largely hold true today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how much it would cost to implement IBM's
wearable computer system in museums. But for research studies,
Miner said the wearable computer is less expensive than an ordinary
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wearable computer could be created for 30 percent less
than the cost of a PC,'' Miner said. The computer display is what
makes PCs cost more.
</P>
<P>
   A museum's decision to implement technology into exhibits
requires a substantial budget for the technology itself, but also
for the initial set up, personnel training and maintenance
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   And then there will always be the struggle to keep up with the
latest technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in the very near future, we won't be wearing
computers. The computer will be in the wall and data will be
transmitted to it,'' said Hoffstetter.
</P>
<P>
   Not all industry members attending a recent gathering of the
American Association of Museums in Baltimore agreed that high tech
is the way to carry museums through the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology must be the servant of content,'' said Peter
Johnson, director of design at the New England Aquarium in Boston.
''It can be very seductive, and you have to tell people to slow
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbie Chessier heads Quatrefoil, in Laurel, Md., a company that
specializes in museum exhibition design, fabrication, interactives,
multimedia and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I want to tell people is, you don't
necessarily have better exhibits through technology,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Museums must first determine their content and goals before
deciding whether technology will improve exhibits, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching sounds and screens to an exhibit changes the way a
viewer reacts to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''No media can touch reality -- real place, real objects,''
Chessier said. ''Some connection to real, whether it's in the past
or present, makes a good exhibit.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Gene Kranz  </HEADLINE>
By MARCIA DUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Just about everybody thinks he said
it. He wishes he had. But Gene Kranz, Mission Control's feisty
flight director, never, ever said ''failure is not an option'' as
Apollo 13 lurched toward the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood came up with the catch phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz liked it so much he borrowed it for the title of his new
book about America's early space program as seen from his seat
inside Mission Control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The words I used: 'OK, we've never lost an American in space,
we sure as hell aren't going to lose one now. This crew is coming
home,' '' Kranz says during a visit to the Kennedy Space Center,
just days following the 30th anniversary of Apollo 13's triumphant
return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ''This crew is coming home'' was too bland for Ron Howard's 1995
hit movie, ''Apollo 13.'' A brainstorming session with
scriptwriters resulted in ''failure is not an option.'' Ed Harris,
who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Kranz,
got the line.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly the most emotional and quotable of all NASA's flight
directors, Kranz isn't surprised that so many people think
''failure is not an option'' came from him.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the tourists who lined up for an autograph this warm
spring afternoon did; they appeared to be in awe of the gravelly
voiced man with the crew cut and booming enthusiasm. The only thing
missing was his trademark vest, made for each mission by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure Is Not an Option'' tells the behind-the-scenes story
of Mission Control, from its primitive origins in Cape Canaveral
during Project Mercury to its celebrated heyday in Houston during
Apollo. The 66-year-old Kranz was there for it all.
</P>
<P>
   A former Air Force fighter pilot who grew up poor in Toledo,
Ohio, Kranz, who is now retired, begins his story with his arrival
at Cape Canaveral on Nov. 2, 1960. No one was at the airfield to
greet him, so a thin, curly haired stranger offered him a lift in
his new Chevrolet convertible.
</P>
<P>
   To Kranz' disbelief, the Chevy peeled into a 180-degree turn and
roared through the Air Force gate and onto the highway. Only after
hitting 80 mph to 90 mph and shouting ''Eeeee hah'' did the driver
offer his hand and introduce himself as Gordo Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had just met my first Mercury astronaut,'' Kranz writes.
''As I soon learned, if you saw someone wearing a short-sleeved
Ban-Lon sport shirt and aviator sunglasses, you were looking at an
astronaut. We humble ground-pounders wore ties and white shirts,
and yes, those nerdy pencil-holding pocket protectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a day or two, and without knowing anything about rockets
or countdowns, Kranz was writing the Go NoGo rules for Mercury
Control. Within three weeks, he was at the console for his first
launch. The unmanned Redstone rocket rose a scant 4 inches and then
landed back on the pad, right-side up.
</P>
<P>
   One month after the ''4-inch flight,'' Kranz and the rest of
Mercury Control sent the rocket aloft. Ham, a chimpanzee, went up
on the next Redstone. Alan Shepard followed on May 5, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz recalls the strain inside the Mercury Control Center
during Shepard's countdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't a subject anyone talked about openly,'' he writes,
''but we in MCC fully expected to lose one or two astronauts in
Mercury. The prayer at that moment was, 'Not now, Lord, please, not
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kranz found himself praying a lot.
</P>
<P>
   He wept in Mission Control, feeling the presence of the Creation
and the Creator, as Apollo 8's astronauts read from Genesis as they
circled the moon on Christmas Eve 1968. And the evening before
Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon on
July 20, 1969, Kranz went to Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blessed by my mother with strong faith,'' he writes, ''during
almost every mission, I find a way to get to church and pray for
wise judgment and courage, and pray also for my team and the
crew.''
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, ''Failure Is Not an Option'' stands apart from
the multitude of books written by astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the astronauts by nature, they have to suppress
emotion,'' says Kranz. ''Where I can say, 'OK, I get sort of wound
up at times.' '' He laughs at the understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz never intended to write a book after retiring from the
space agency in 1994. Building an aerobatic biplane was his top
priority and, besides, he says, ''I was pretty well burned out at
NASA by the time I punched out.''
</P>
<P>
   But a book agent who saw Kranz in a TV documentary began
pestering him. ''Finally, he just browbeat me into the doggone
thing,'' Kranz recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz had kept all his notes from meetings, console logs and
mission reports; the stuff filled seven file cabinets and numerous
boxes and bookshelves at his Houston-area home. But he needed more,
especially after so many decades. So he turned to his former flight
controllers from Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, who helped fill in the
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the interest in the movie ''Apollo 13,'' Kranz
quickly snagged a contract in 1997. But the relationship with the
publisher was stormy, according to Kranz, and he ended up buying
back the rights to his book.
</P>
<P>
   After streamlining the manuscript, Kranz sold it to Simon &AMP;
Schuster last fall. Seven months later, in April, ''Failure Is Not
an Option'' was out, just in time for the 30th anniversary of
Apollo 13. He dedicated it to his wife of 43 years, Marta, and
their six grown children.
</P>
<P>
   The title was his choice from the start. It's a recurring theme
in the dozens of motivational speeches he gives each year, along
with leadership and trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be related to one mission in particular,'' Kranz
says. ''But I don't think any flight director who was ever worth
his salt, and I can't think of any who weren't, would ever consider
putting a crew into a spacecraft and up in orbit without the
conviction, the utter conviction, that they were going to come back
home.''

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Baritone Simon Estes  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- Simon Estes sits in a garden chair in
his glassed-in porch, bathing in the afternoon sun. He is talking
about the joys -- and tortures -- of his career.
</P>
<P>
   His high cheekbones soon spread into an easy smile. It's been a
good day for the world-class opera star: He has just finished
vacuuming his white-on-white living room, spotless from rug to
piano to contemporary sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Estes earns a six-figure income from much-lauded performances at
the Metropolitan Opera, the Vienna State Opera and other top
houses, and he clearly can afford to hire a housekeeper. But the
celebrated baritone has his own definition of success -- and of how
to live.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more I sing, the more, in quotes, 'success' I have
--whatever that may be -- the more humble and grateful I'd like to
become, instead of feeling that everybody has to cater to me and I
have to have the presidential suite and a limousine that's 40 feet
long,'' Estes says.
</P>
<P>
   To him, success means ''being at peace with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the 62-year-old singer, a bachelor again after a painful
divorce, does his own laundry, cooking and cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving his wife and three daughters, ages 12, 14 and 16, ''was
the most difficult thing in my life,'' he says. And after the
separation, he would fly around the world touring, ''and I was in
hotel rooms crying like a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he's back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Estes has carved a niche for himself as one of the finest
performers of Verdi and Wagner, singing with superstars like
Placido Domingo and Leontyne Price. His new autobiography, ''Simon
Estes/ In My Own Voice,'' is filled with photos of Estes in the
company of world leaders -- Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II,
former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with his boyhood, growing up in a segregated
society in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was a kid, we couldn't go into the swimming pool with
white people,'' Estes recalls. ''They'd disinfect the pool, and
then they'd let the white kids come in. You know, those 'black
germs' were in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was in junior high school, in his hometown of
Centerville, Iowa, the high school choir director asked him to sing
with the older kids. ''I could hit high C along with the sopranos,
but the girls didn't want a boy singing soprano. I could also sing
tenor,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who had an exceptional voice, sang in church and
raised a musical family of five children -- three sisters and two
brothers. His father first worked as a coal miner, developing
asthma while putting in 14-hour days in the dark, damp shafts. Then
he supported the family with a variety of jobs that included
washing cars, carting hotel luggage and cleaning a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, blacks represented less than 1 percent of the
population and were relegated to menial jobs. Life was a struggle,
and the Estes home was warmed by a potbelly stove, with no running
water or indoor plumbing until Simon was 14.
</P>
<P>
   Estes worked his way through the University of Iowa, where his
mentor was Charles Kellis, a music teacher who noticed the
''skinny, sweet, undernourished kid with a remarkable voice.'' He
loaned him recordings by Price, Enrico Caruso and other stars, and
gave him daily four- to five-hour lessons, at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   With his splendid voice, Estes took his first airplane flight,
from Iowa to New York and auditioned for the Juilliard School. He
was accepted with a full scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   But the same discrimination that tortured him in Iowa followed
him to New York. He answered an ad for an apartment in The New York
Times and when the landlady opened the door, she took one look at
his skin and yelled, ''What are you doing here? Get away!'' She
slammed the door in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Estes soon became the only black male opera singer of great
celebrity. Still, he says, ''The world did not let me forget that I
have a darker skin color than you.''
</P>
<P>
   For his 1965 debut at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, he was
subjected to makeup that made him look ''white as a ghost.'' And in
the 1970s, he says, ''I remember singing in one of those Southern
cities, and the director of the opera house came up to me and said,
'Simon, I want to work with you, but I can't because some of the
people who are giving us money said if I engaged you, they're going
to take away the funds. And we need the money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Things slowly changed. In Centerville, the local high school
auditorium was named after Estes several years ago. ''That was a
way of saying, 'Simon, we're sorry.''' He also has performed
throughout Iowa, and he is the first black person to receive the
state's highest honor -- the Iowan Award.
</P>
<P>
   But his racially charged journey has left its mark.
</P>
<P>
   When he teaches classes at Iowa State University, he speaks not
only about music, but about human values, telling students: ''Don't
ever compromise your principles to try to get a job, or a position
or relationship, or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite his success, he's still waging an age-old battle to
bring more talented black male singers into classical music. There
are plenty of black females singers, but only a handful of men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Find me a group of people where one gender can sing, and the
other gender cannot sing!'' he says. ''It's one of the last big
hurdles that we still have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Estes tempers such frustrations by thinking of Mandela, for whom
he has performed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here was a man who was unjustly incarcerated for 27 years. He
came out and not one time did he speak of revenge or hatred or
bitterness,'' Estes says. ''In order not to have hatred when you
have been so unjustly treated requires an inner strength that I
personally think has to come from a higher source.''
</P>
<P>
   Before each performance, he prays. ''I pray that the gift God
has given me touches somebody's heart out there,'' says Estes,
relaxing one afternoon at his spacious, contemporary house in an
upscale neighborhood of the New Jersey countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Estes glances at his watch to make sure it's not too
late to call Switzerland, where his three daughters live with their
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce he granted her more than a year ago, after almost
two decades of marriage, was tough on his voice, too. And as he
flew around singing to adoring audiences, ''I had lumps in my
throat bigger than grapefruits -- before, during and after the
singing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was especially difficult to face the lead role in Wagner's
''Flying Dutchman'' for which Estes is famed. At one point, his
character says, ''Oh, I'm without a wife and I'm without a child.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been a very strong person in my life. But this
broke me, it really broke me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Estes says, ''I thought, 'Well, I have to take this
incredible pain and make myself stronger, and go on.'''
</P>
<P>
   He survived through friends and prayer, and the shows went on.
And now, his piano accompanist tells him, he's singing at his best
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm almost cured,'' Estes says. ''And I think about trying to
improve my life, to be a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   He sponsors an educational foundation that gives scholarships to
talented students. Two years ago, he founded Simon Estes High
School near Cape Town, South Africa, with almost 200 students whose
focus is music. Last year, 40 of them attended school in Iowa for
the academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Estes believes he has perhaps another decade of performing ahead
of him.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he appeared at Carnegie Hall in Ponchielli's ''La
Gioconda,'' to be followed later this season by a performance in
Los Angeles of Verdi's ''Aida'' with Domingo. He'll also appear in
Tokyo and has opera dates throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Estes says he'll stop performing while he can still sing, so
he'll exit opera while still riding high. His final, dream concert
in Washington, D.C., is already planned, except for the exact date.
The program will include ''Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen,'' as
well as a rendition of the 27th Psalm, ''The Lord Is my light.''
</P>
<P>
   And he'll offer Gustav Mahler's, ''Ich bin der Welt Abhanden
Gekommen,'' which in English means ''I am lost to the world.''	   It ends with
the words: ''I live alone in my heaven, in my love
and in my song.''

<HEADLINE> Paris on Display in Four Shows  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Images of Paris, glorious and grim, are in the
limelight this spring, as four major art shows in the French
capital spotlight the City of Light, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   In black-and white photographs shot mainly at night, Brassai's
Paris, on show at the Georges Pompidou Center through June 26,
chronicles ordinary people in ordinary urban settings.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitutes in seedy hotels bathe in between customers, lovers
embrace in empty subway halls and hobos sleep under bridges over
the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   A master of atmosphere, light and shadow, the Hungarian-born
Brassai, who died in 1954, turned his lens on well-known Paris
monuments. His mist-shrouded statues and glistening cobblestone
boulevards create a certain nocturnal magic all their own.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display are photographs of Paris stone facades. Some are
carved up or defaced so badly that they resemble primitive art.
Others are so cracked and peeling, they border on the best -- or
worst -- of contemporary abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   With sculpture, a tapestry and even a documentary on animals he
filmed at a Paris zoo, the show is one of the most exhaustive ever
mounted of Brassai's work.
</P>
<P>
   Paris becomes the stage for a bloody revolution in two
exhibitions now showing at the Orsay Museum about the Paris revolt
of 1871 -- a milestone in French history long ignored by the art
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The shows bring together paintings, drawings and photographs
depicting the violence of the period as republican Parisians,
fearing the return of the monarchy, formed a revolutionary
government. The revolt failed, thousands died and bodies littered
the streets of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Grim photographs of executed partisans lined up in their coffins
date from the period. Edouard Manet's drawing, ''Guerre Civile''
(''Civil War''), shows a cadaver sprawled behind the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display at Orsay is a small show through July 16 devoted
to one of the brightest figures of 19th-century Parisian literary
society -- the dark-haired, creamy-complexioned Nina de Callias.
</P>
<P>
   De Callias was the mystery damsel in Manet's famed ''Dame aux
Eventails'' (''Woman With a Fan''). The painting -- with De Callias
gazing bemusedly at the viewer -- was one of Manet's favorites. He
kept it in his studio and it was not shown until after he died in
1883.
</P>
<P>
   The well-born, free-spirited De Callias flouted social
convention. An accomplished musician and poet, she threw open the
doors of her luxury Paris apartment to the leading avant-garde
figures of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But she fell into disfavor with authorities after harboring
Republican Communards of the 1871 revolt and was forced into exile.
She returned to Paris two years later, but late-night carousing
took a toll on her increasingly fragile mental state, and she died
in 1884, the year Manet's painting of her was shown in public. She
was 41.
</P>
<P>
   On a happier note, the finer things of life designed to decorate
cozy interiors for France's burgeoning bourgeoisie a century ago
are on show at a blockbuster exhibition at the Grand Palais, itself
a stunning example of turn-of-the-century Belle Epoque French
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Entitled ''1900,'' the show is an eclectic overview of
masterpieces executed between 1895 and 1905 and brings together the
best of what artists around the world were doing as the new century
dawned.
</P>
<P>
   A mother-of-pearl hairpin encrusted with diamonds and rubies,
photographs of American Indians dancing during an eclipse of the
moon, and small sculpted heads by Degas, Rodin and Picasso, among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Art Nouveau takes center stage, with dozens of objects
illustrating the trend that saw plants and animals incorporated
into designs of chairs, tables, lamps, flatware and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights: Louis Majorelle's mahogany side table
shaped like a water lily and adorned with chiseled flowers in
gilded bronze, a hairpin encrusted with opals by Rene Lalique, an
ornate silver vegetable dish with mythological figures as handles.
</P>
<P>
   The show runs through June 26.

<HEADLINE> Sound Artists Reach Center Stage  </HEADLINE>
By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- For the first time, sound artists have reached
center stage in London.
</P>
<P>
   Works by 26 artists are humming, clicking, whirring, whistling
and banging away in the Hayward Gallery's ''Sonic Boom: The Art of
Sound,'' providing an alternative to art lovers used to looking at
drawings, paintings and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibit consists of 51 record players stacked on scaffolding
from floor to ceiling and another is a ''Quiet Club.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dark rooms, flashing lights, sensors in floors to
trigger noise as people pass by, and even bird calls from the
Brazilian rain forest to listen to through headphones while
standing outside looking across the river Thames toward Big Ben.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sonic Boom'' features artists from 10 countries and four
continents, and was put together by David Toop, a British musician,
writer and sound curator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been involved in this since the 1960s, but even I was
surprised at the amount of work being done when I began moving
around to find people,'' Toop says. ''The sound community is very
big. I could have done 10 different shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the show first see a film called ''The Shaman Girl's
Prayer'' in which Mariko Mori, a Japanese woman who lives in New
York City, appears to be in a kind of trance while manipulating a
white glass ball. Soothing sound surrounds the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Around a corner, a mass of metal and wires coalesces to form a
robot named Yoyo Berimbau, which bangs a drum and plays a string.
It's a creation of Chico MacMurtrie of San Francisco, whose
mechanical sculptures grew out of his art and electronic music
studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   MacMurtrie has made more than 100 such machines to explore the
''dynamism of sound, movement and form,'' the exhibition catalog
notes.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Extended Schwitters'' of American-born Stephan von Heune,
a German resident, is a plywood figure resembling a semaphore. It
moves and claps and emits nonsense phrases in the style of the
German artist Kurt Schwitters who, between the two world wars, made
art from things thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Eno, a British musician who specialized in sonic
manipulation by juggling tapes, contributes a sound and light
installation he describes as musical painting. He doesn't work out
the patterns in advance, but uses multiple reproduction systems
that continually and without repetition create ''pictures'' on the
wall of a darkened room -- his ''Quiet Club.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the kind of club I'd like to go to -- Music for More
Senses,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Heri Dono from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, has a line of identical
wooden animal masks on a wall playing a ritualized, repetitive
rhythm which he says are inspired by Javanese Gamelan instruments
and shadow puppetry.
</P>
<P>
   Toop says the Japanese are perhaps the most advanced in sound
art appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Japanese have a sensitivity to sound and they are
interested in newness, in new technology,'' he says. ''They are
aware of precision and delicacy so that off a noisy Kyoto street
you'll find a Zen garden of perfect peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Bradley, the Hayward's exhibitions curator, notes that the
art of sound is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ancient Greeks knew about it,'' Bradley says. ''They were
such masters of building open-air theaters in which the actors
could be heard from every seat that it's still a mystery how they
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more people are using sound as primary in their
work,'' she says. ''Electronics development has a lot to do with
it, and the rise of video and film technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ferleger Brades, the New Yorker who directs the Hayward,
calls sound ''an integral part of our experience of the world, one
of the tools we use to make sense of our experience. Sound art
manipulates our sense of sound to enlarge the possibilities of that
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sonic Boom'' is at the Hayward through June 18 and will not
travel. The $24 catalog includes two compact discs containing
nearly two hours of tracks of the artists' work.

   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   For someone who says he isn't worried about building a career,
Joshua Jackson is well on his way. Jackson, who was born on June
11, 1978, is familiar to TV audiences as Pacey on the WB network's
''Dawson's Creek.'' He had two new films this spring: ''The
Skulls'' and ''Gossip.'' ''I have high expectations of myself as a
person, but my ambition is more to succeed as a human being than a
business entity,'' Jackson says.
</P>
<P>
   Ally Sheedy is back in business after more than a decade of
living with irrelevance. ''There was a whole period of time when I
just could not get seen for a job,'' says Sheedy, who was born on
June 13, 1962. Now a slew of edgy, indie roles has brought renewed
attention to the star of the 1985 film ''The Breakfast Club.'' She
won the National Society of Film Critics' best actress award for
her role in the 1998 film ''High Art.'' She played the part of a
lesbian drug addict. ''As far as my career is concerned, as far as
my work is concerned, 'High Art' is the best thing that ever
happened to me,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Entertainment Highlights in History  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Entertainment highlights during the week of June
11-17:
<TEXT>
<P>
   65 years ago: ''Becky Sharp,'' the first full-Technicolor
(three-color) feature, opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York
City. It starred Miriam Hopkins, Billie Burke and Nigel Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   40 years ago: Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh starred in Alfred
Hitchcock's ''Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   And Billy Wilder's ''The Apartment'' starred Jack Lemmon and
Shirley MacLaine.
</P>
<P>
   35 years ago: The Beatles were each awarded the MBE, or Member
of the British Empire. Some medal holders were so upset, they
returned their medals.
</P>
<P>
   And ''Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines'' starred
Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles and James Fox.
</P>
<P>
   30 years ago: ''The Long and Winding Road'' by the Beatles
topped the U.S. singles chart.
</P>
<P>
   25 years ago: Karen Black, Henry Gibson, Keith Carradine and
Lily Tomlin were among the stars of Robert Altman's ''Nashville.''
The film had 24 main characters, who improvised at times as they
moved through the worlds of country music and Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   And Gene Hackman and Jennifer Warren starred in Arthur Penn's
''Night Moves.''
</P>
<P>
   20 years ago: John Travolta and Debra Winger starred in ''Urban
Cowboy.'' The film sparked a fad of mechanical bull riding in bars
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   10 years ago: ''Dick Tracy'' opened in theaters across the
country. The film starred Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, Madonna, Dustin
Hoffman and James Caan.
</P>
<P>
   And Cher returned to the Las Vegas stage after an eight-year
absence, giving a pop-metal review to a sold-out crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: Madonna's 1969 white Mercedes convertible sold
for $56,350 at an auction of rock 'n' roll memorabilia in New York
City. Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics to ''Blowin' in the Wind''
drew $8,625, nearly four times the pre-sale estimate, the auction
house said.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' took in
$54.9 million on its opening weekend, making more in its first
three days than the original movie did in its entire run. The
original, ''Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,'' tested
poorly and opened to a tepid $9.5 million in May 1997. But
audiences warmed up to Austin's humor, and the $16 million-budget
film hung on through the summer to gross $53.9 million and turn a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   And the top 10 of The Hollywood Reporter's Star Power '99 survey
of bankable stars were, in order: Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson, Tom
Cruise, Harrison Ford, Jim Carrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, John
Travolta, Julia Roberts, Robin Williams and Brad Pitt. The
Hollywood Reporter surveyed 135 entertainment industry executives,
bankers, buyers and sales agents. The top 10 list was ''a
subjective look at the bankability of 525 actors and actresses
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken five years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ''I do it to get a free seat.'' -- Bill Cosby, explaining why he
had hosted the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl for 17
years.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Cynthia Garrett  </HEADLINE>
NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When you watch Cynthia Garrett interview someone
on NBC's ''Later,'' the first thing you notice -- besides her
striking sleek looks and ever-present smile -- is the way she puts
her guests at ease.
</P>
<P>
   She also separates herself from the male, suit-wearing
late-night pack with her Bohemian style: She wears a nose ring, has
long, crinkly hair, and would rather talk about issues involving
spirituality than sensationalism. In addition, Garrett, a law
school graduate, is the only black female to host a late-night talk
show on a major TV network.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's such a blessing that it's been enough to be me to
be in this job,'' said Garrett as she sat in her Manhattan
apartment. ''They like me the way I look with my hair and my skin
color and my nose ring and my sometimes quirky way of dressing, or
my sometimes quirky way of thinking, and my emotional sensibilities
as a woman -- they like that. It's so great to be able to be myself
and go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a dream come true for Garrett when she took over hosting
duties for ''Later,'' whose previous hosts include Bob Costas and
Greg Kinnear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always knew that I wanted my own late-night show,'' she
said. ''When I started out in the business four or five years ago,
and I produced my own piece of tape, a spec pilot done as a
one-hour late-night imitation of (Jay) Leno, (David) Letterman and
Arsenio (Hall).''
</P>
<P>
   Her tape caught the eye of a talent agent at the William Morris
Agency and eventually helped her get her first big break, a vee-jay
spot at VH1.
</P>
<P>
   Since she took over hosting duties at ''Later'' in January,
Garrett has been taping the daily show in Los Angeles, then
commuting back to New York on weekends to be with her 7-year-old
son. She does occasional vee-jay stints for VH1, and starting in
July, will write a monthly column for InStyle magazine as a
contributing editor.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the hustle and bustle of what I'm doing, all of a sudden
my life has really gotten busy, and I mean, it's crazy,'' she said.
''I sit here at home with two house (phone) lines and two cell
phones, and they are all ringing, and the door is buzzing. And some
days, I go, 'WOW! Be careful for what you pray for, you just might
get it.'
</P>
<P>
   ''But the flip side is, I probably wouldn't have it any other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   1. Why did you want to host a late-night talk show instead of
daytime or other time slot?
</P>
<P>
   Garrett: Because I just really believe that late-night is in
need of what I can offer. And I just in my gut always felt like God
said to me, 'You should be on late-night.' Now, I'm not opposed to
daytime, but daytime is a different medium. I don't think an
interview show, like a half-hour, one-on-one interview show, is
going to hang in daytime. ... And I think that the syndicated
market is so glutted with daytime talk shows, that I think that I
would have gotten lost.
</P>
<P>
   2. What do you think makes you different from other late-night
talk-show hosts?
</P>
<P>
   Garrett: I'm an interviewer. And you know what? I say this with
all confidence now. There are not a lot of people who can make a
person feel comfortable and open and not judged. ... I just feel
like there's not a lot of interviewers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   3. You have talked about an ordeal that renewed your faith in
God. What was that?
</P>
<P>
   Garrett: I went through an incredibly abusive marriage and
divorce at one time in my life, a long time ago, when I was really
young, and really found myself in it -- lost myself for a while, and
really found myself. ... It's the greatest gift in my life, faith,
because it has gotten me through some really dark times and it has
made me even happier and more fulfilled in the really bright times.
</P>
<P>
   4. Rocker Lenny Kravitz has been called your brother. Are you
truly related?
</P>
<P>
   Garrett: We are not related by blood. We are related by life
experience, by 23 years of calling each other brother and sister
because we are best friends and we lived in the same household and
shared parents. ... I talk to him four or five times a day every
day. We don't get through the day without connecting with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   5: What's next for you?
</P>
<P>
   Garrett: I'm going to do a movie with Lenny Kravitz. We're going
to star in a movie together, and I think we're shooting at this
point late summer. ... It's about growing up in two cultures,
growing up in two worlds, knowing how to navigate the 'hood and
Beverly Hills at the same time. ... (Acting) is something that I
really enjoy. But unlike other actresses, my day job is something
that I've always wanted to do -- always.

<HEADLINE> A Year in the Life of P.D. James  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Readers of a diary kept by British mystery
writer P.D. James may be amazed at the large number of speeches she
gave and the many meetings, dinners, book signings and festivities
she attended over a period of one year. Perhaps more amazing, given
her age and occupation: It was her first diary.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're perpetually asked to do things,'' the 79-year-old James
said. ''Some are very good, charitable things, supporting causes
I'm glad to support. The result is an overly busy life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography'' was
published by Knopf in April. Besides the activities of her day,
Phyllis Dorothy James also recorded her memories, observations and
opinions in the year between her 77th and 78th birthdays, from Aug.
3, 1997 to Aug. 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it should be what I felt at the end of each day,''
she said in an interview. ''Once I wrote, I never revised.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers have been especially interested in her views on the
craft of writing, her childhood memories and her experiences during
the bombing of London in World War II, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her diary, James deplores the lack of control a writer has
when his or her works are adapted for television or film. She also
writes that she dislikes people who talk loudly on cell phones in
train compartments.
</P>
<P>
   James has enjoyed a long and productive career. Her first book,
''Cover Her Face,'' was published in 1962. A string of best-selling
mysteries followed, bringing her fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   She is currently finishing book No. 17, which stars Commander
Adam Dalgliesh, the Scotland Yard detective and published poet, who
is one of the best-known and most interesting creations in popular
English fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chief joy of fame is the private satisfaction that you
have exercised, I think, a God-given talent,'' she said. ''It's the
recognition of talent that gives pleasure to many other people.
They let me know it, and I appreciate that and their support and
encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although fame ''does attract a certain amount of envy and
malice, I've been lucky,'' she said. ''There has been very, very
little.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the money, it allows her to help her family and is
assurance that she will never be a financial burden to them. It has
also enabled her to live comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't lived vastly differently on a day-by-day basis, but
it's wonderful to be relieved of the anxiety of being poor,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Queen Elizabeth II made James a baroness, not for her
writing but for her large amount of official public work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt that women were underrepresented on more
powerful bodies. So when I received invitations to serve on things,
I felt I had an obligation to say 'yes' if I thought I could do it.
It's no good complaining and not accepting when you get the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, she accepts fewer engagements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the excuse that I'm nearly 80 now and have to cut down
a bit. I need to conserve my energy for my writing and see more of
friends and family,'' said James, who has two daughters and five
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   As she gets older, James said she has a greater appreciation of
the people she loves. ''One cares less about superficial things,
like what people think. I'm much more aware of the beauty of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''In youth, one is so busy earning a living and with personal
relationships. Now I get much more pleasure in looking at a cherry
tree in bloom or a tulip.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a family dinner to celebrate her 80th birthday in
August, and Faber and Faber, her English publisher, will host a
party on a boat on the Thames River in London.
</P>
<P>
   James said her age makes her think about the inevitability of
death -- and that so few years remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I going to be writing at 90? Will I write two or three more
books, or less?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what change during her lifetime upset her the most,
James replied that it is the breakup of the family as an
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was in school from age 5 to 16, there was not a single
child there whose parents were separated or divorced,'' she said.
''I'm not saying divorce is always wrong. With cruelty or terrible
meanness, divorce is the answer. But it seems to me now that
society is much less stable because the family is less strong and
children have suffered very much through this.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every good has its other side. The good is women aren't tied
in economic dependence to staying in an unhappy situation. The
other side is that we have a generation of less happy and less
stable children. There's far more mental illness and suicide.''

<HEADLINE> Deep Purple Is Still Making Music  </HEADLINE>
By GERARD O'LEARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In 1969, Deep Purple performed ''Concerto for
Group and Orchestra'' with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at
Royal Albert Hall in London. Things didn't go exactly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The orchestra did not want to play with us because we were a
rock group,'' recalled bassist Roger Glover during a recent
interview. ''Some members of the orchestra actually walked out,
refusing to play, and the ones that stayed didn't perform well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead singer Ian Gillan regrets that he didn't take the incident
more seriously, but ''we were just kids basically and weren't
mature enough to handle the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the band returned to Royal Albert Hall to record
the concerto for a live album. This time, they performed with the
London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Paul Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deep Purple -- Live at the Royal Albert Hall'' (Spitfire
Records) is a two-disc enhanced set with video. Special guests
included Ronnie James Dio, Sam Brown and Eddie Hardin. The album
contains the concerto, ''Smoke on the Water'' and other Deep Purple
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bands like Metallica have done the orchestra thing,'' said
guitarist Steve Morse, who joined Deep Purple in 1994. ''But the
difference is they used it to sweeten the songs and make them
fuller. With the concerto, the band is backing the orchestra up and
coming in and out at different times.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover, 54, said it was nostalgic to go back and play at Royal
Albert Hall. ''There is no place like it in the world. ... It is a
totally awe-inspiring building with its beauty and its grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the passage of time brought any changes?
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the most noticeable differences between now and then is
we're older than most of the orchestra members,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Purple was born in England in 1968. The original members
included guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, drummer Ian Paice,
keyboardist Jon Lord, vocalist Rod Evans and bassist Nick Simper,
who was replaced by Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were originally defined as a progressive band, then an
underground band, hard rock band, then heavy metal,'' said Gillan,
who joined the band in 1969, replacing Evans. ''But I feel we don't
fall in any one category. As my wife once said, 'Deep Purple is
just Deep Purple.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bickering and frequent changes in the band's lineup
over the past 32 years, Deep Purple has recorded hit albums,
including ''Fireball'' (1971), ''Machine Head'' (1972) and
''Perfect Strangers'' (1984), and maintained its popularity with
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's because the band has accepted the need to change that we
have such a large fan base,'' Gillan said. ''It's been like a
roller coaster ride with this band. There has been three definite
highs in the band and three definite lows. ... Maybe four.''
</P>
<P>
   One high was the release of ''Machine Head,'' an album that
catapulted Deep Purple to superstar status and inspired ''Smoke on
the Water,'' a song about a casino in Montreux, Switzerland that
caught fire during a Frank Zappa show. Deep Purple had planned to
use the casino to record ''Machine Head,'' but had to find another
location.
</P>
<P>
   The band split up, then got back together for its ''Perfect
Strangers'' album. In a 1985 AP interview, Glover explained what
led to the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Silly little things that normally you'd work out never got
worked out because of the amount of pressure on us to perform
concerts. Jon Lord said it was death by 1,000 cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody got tired of everybody. Ian Gillan was the first to
say he was leaving. I decided to leave at the same time. I thought
it would be easier on the others. They carried on a while with
replacements. Then Ritchie Blackmore left 18 months later. They
carried on with a replacement for him as well. The whole thing
folded in 1976,'' Glover told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Purple's current lineup is four-fifths the same as the
''classic'' 1969 edition, featuring Gillan, Glover, Paice and Lord,
who composed the ''Concerto for Group and Orchestra.'' Only
Blackmore is missing. He left after the 1993 album ''The Battle
Rages On.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ritchie is no different from anyone else,'' Glover said. ''We
all have our ups and downs. There are times he is easy to get along
with and times when he is tough. ... I think he kinda enjoys that
reputation and works at maintaining it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chill from the open windows in a freezing hotel room in
midtown Manhattan grew colder when the conversation turned to
Blackmore, the reclusive and often moody guitar virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is asking those questions these days,'' snapped Gillan
in an intimidating tone.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Country Fan Fair  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- This is the last year Nashville singing
stars and their fans will suffer the indignity of autograph
sessions in a building marked ''Livestock.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Country Music Fan Fair is poised for dramatic
change as country music's biggest annual party kicks off next week.
</P>
<P>
   Fan Fair, now in its 29th year, will run June 12-15 at the
Tennessee State Fairgrounds, where it has been held for the past 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   But fans can say goodbye to the fairgrounds. Next year, the
event will move to a new location.
</P>
<P>
   Although attendance has been hurt by the closing of the popular
Opryland theme park, a downswing in country music sales and
depressed overall tourism in Nashville, some 20,000 fans are
expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 artists will perform and sign autographs. This
year's bill includes LeAnn Rimes, Montgomery Gentry, Alan Jackson,
Ronnie Milsap, Loretta Lynn and Sara Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite events around the festival abound. There is a
celebrity charity softball game, private fan club parties and the
fan-voted TNN Music Awards show on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Fan Fair was born in 1972, after fans started turning up
uninvited at a music industry convention. Country music officials
figured a festival for fans would prove popular. They were right.
Five thousand turned up for the first year; the number doubled the
following year. In 1982, the event moved to the fairgrounds, which
has a capacity of 24,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone used to make fun of me because I wouldn't let people
say, 'The lunch feed is going on in the cattle barns,''' said Ed
Benson, director of the Country Music Association, the trade group
that organizes Fan Fair. ''I would yell, 'No, it's not the cattle
barn, it's the Luncheon Pavilion!'''
</P>
<P>
   Many involved have grown unhappy with the fairgrounds over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quite honestly, the city has allowed that facility to fall
into dilapidation,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   The city is pushing for Adelphia Coliseum, home of the Tennessee
Titans NFL team, as the performance venue, with the downtown
Municipal Auditorium (home of the first 10 Fan Fairs) as the site
for autograph booths.
</P>
<P>
   A downtown alternative would be the smaller, indoor Gaylord
Entertainment Center for performances and the Nashville Convention
Center across the street for autograph booths.
</P>
<P>
   CMA officials are also considering the Nashville Superspeedway,
now under construction, which is about 45 minutes outside of
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment executive E.W. Bud Wendell, a CMA board member,
said Fan Fair has a bright future, despite a downturn in attendance
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think by 2010, it could be 50,000 to 60,000 people. There
are opportunities to attract more worldwide attention. ... We're
looking at moving the site to allow it to breathe, allow it to grow
more.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, it's one of the most unique events in the
entertainment business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The CMA is planning a stronger marketing effort, and possibly
the sale of single-day passes. The traditional $90 weekly ticket
includes more than 30 hours of live stage shows; admission to the
exhibit halls where artists sign autographs; admission to the
Country Music Hall of Fame; the historic Ryman Auditorium and
discounts to other tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been going on 29 years pretty much the same formula,''
Benson said. ''The overriding philosophy is to maintain the unique
characteristics and traditions, and yet enhance the experience for
all the people involved.''

<HEADLINE> Major Solar Storm Detected  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo.(AP) -- Scientists have detected a major solar
flare erupting on the sun that could buffet Earth with a
geomagnetic storm in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   The blast of charged solar particles already is producing
scattered radio blackouts but is not expected to significantly
disrupt telecommunications or electrical power. It might generate a
dramatic light show for midnight stargazers in the northern
latitudes until early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is approaching the height of its 11-year storm cycle.
Unlike previous cycles, this period has been relatively quiet, with
eruptions every two months or so.
</P>
<P>
   This storm is estimated to be 20 times stronger than a solar
flare in early April.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, the sun is beginning to flex its muscles,'' said
solar forecaster Dave Speich of the federal Space Environment
Center in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   The latest eruption came at midday Tuesday from a cluster of
sunspots on the upper left of the sun as viewed from Earth. A
powerful X-ray flare ejected an estimated billion tons of charged
particles into space.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the solar wind at speeds up to 2 million mph, the
particles should zap Earth's magnetic field late Thursday or early
Friday. The sunspot cluster could be active another eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Solar flares can create electrical disturbances that disrupt
power supplies, telecommunications and signals that control
pipelines and other systems. The particles can damage satellites
and alter their orbits.
</P>
<P>
   The storm is rated as moderate on the federal government's new
space weather scale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a severe solar storm knocked out power stations serving
Canada and the northeastern states, as well as an electrical
transformer in New Jersey. Since then, power grid and satellite
operators have taken steps to protect their systems.
</P>
<P>
   The clouds of charged particles also produce the aurora
borealis, or northern lights. Weather permitting, the light show
from this storm could be visible as far south as Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> CBS Brings 'Big Brother' to TV  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the CBS Studio Center lot, tucked into a
corner usually given over to parking spots, is the house that
voyeurism built.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch, Spanish and German viewers have gone wild over a
television show that joins 10 strangers in a spartan home for three
months under unblinking cameras and the audience's judgmental eye.
</P>
<P>
   In July, America will get its own version of the peep show with
''Big Brother,'' and CBS is gambling that the titillation quotient
and ratings will be as impressive on this side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The upside for players: a $500,000 prize for the one who avoids
being expelled by fellow housemates and the TV audience. The
downside: cameras everywhere. (Yes, everywhere. Even in the
bathroom.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the tacit ''No Exit'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can leave if they want. The door's open ... but it's a
one-way door,'' said Paul Romer, the Dutch TV executive who helped
create ''Big Brother'' and is producing the U.S. version.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is the same network that's airing ''Survivor,'' based on a
Swedish show, in which 16 people compete on a desert island for a
$1 million prize. Both followed the success of ABC's ''Who Wants to
be a Millionaire,'' patterned after a British game show.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences have responded. ''Survivor'' managed to hold its
own in its debut against ''Millionaire'' and scored impressively
among coveted younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want something different. There's more of a voyeuristic
nature to our watching habits,'' contends Leslie Moonves, president
of CBS Television, which paid a reported $20 million to Dutch
producer Endemol Entertainment for rights to ''Big Brother,'' to
run July 6-Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are intrigued by seeing someone who could be their
next-door neighbor or their Uncle John in a situation like this,''
Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voyeurism and television were destined to embrace, and the
miracle, I think, isn't so much that they've finally done so. The
miracle is they've taken so long,'' Thompson said -- especially
given the successful tenure of MTV's ''Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   The mild-mannered Romer makes ''Big Brother's'' concept seem
benign, despite its chilling Orwellian title (drawn from the novel
''1984,'' about a totalitarian society devoid of privacy).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a television show. It's fun,'' he said. ''Humans are
curious beings. We like to know how other people live. We like to
know what other people do.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience will see ''normal Americans, living their lives
more or less normally in this house ... It's fun to get to know
them during those three months, and it's kind of a reflection of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of. First, the 10 participants will surrender virtually all
contact with the outside world along with their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,800-foot home, with adjoining vegetable garden and
exercise area, is screened to prevent the CBS studio crew -- which
represents the outside world, kind of -- from contaminating ''Big
Brother's'' hermetic environment.
</P>
<P>
   The house is stocked with staples, including beans, rice,
potatoes and frozen meat. Participants have to tend the vegetable
crop and the chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   There's no television, no radio, no newspapers, although each
person can bring a small suitcase with a few distractions such as
books or games. What's in plentiful supply are cameras (28) and
microphones (60).
</P>
<P>
   Tracks running behind one-way mirrors allow the cameras to sneak
along in pursuit of the players. Other remote-control cameras are
fixed throughout the house, including a small ''lipstick'' version
in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bathroom camera is never shown on television,'' said
series co-executive producer Douglas Ross. ''It's there for the
participants' safety. We also want them to not have any private
places, so they can't go into the bathroom and have a conversation
which we're not privy to.''
</P>
<P>
   Condensed versions of each day's footage will be shown in
half-hour episodes Monday, Tuesday and Friday, with a one-hour
recap Saturday. On Thursday, ''Big Brother'' raises the ante with a
full hour of live TV.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users can conduct round-the-clock surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Every two weeks, the housemates will nominate two colleagues for
expulsion, with TV viewers then voting out one of them by
telephone. At the end, the audience will choose the winner from the
three remaining players.
</P>
<P>
   The German version of ''Big Brother'' used careful editing to
juice up the action, according to one magazine article. Romer, who
contends that's ''not entirely accurate,'' said no liberties will
be taken here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on the Internet 24 hours a day, real time, so if we try
to manipulate events we would have a lot of reaction from the
Internet community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' will, however, toy with its guests. The group
will face regular challenges, such as agreeing on who gets dibs on
rare phone privileges.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people submitted videotaped applications to
become players. Next week, 64 finalists will arrive in Los Angeles
to undergo further scrutiny, including psychological testing and
what CBS vows will be comprehensive background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of revelations that emerged about instant couple Rick
Rockwell and Darva Conger after Fox aired ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'', Ross said, ''we wanted to make sure we were
doubly careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Their overseas popularity aside, CBS' summer series arrived with
baggage. A losing contestant from the Swedish version of
''Survivor'' committed suicide in 1997, although the network denied
responsibility. And ''Big Brother'' was harshly criticized before
it aired in Holland and Germany, with The Netherlands Institute of
Psychologists calling the show ''irresponsible and unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer notes that ''Big Brother'' has generated little
controversy so far here, despite heavy advertising and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say it's avoided scrutiny altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Swanson, founder of the grassroots Viewers for Quality
Television, dismissed ''Big Brother'' as ''lazy programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In search of escapist summer fare, however, Swanson admitted
she'll likely tune in. So will Syracuse's Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   As a professor, ''I'm disgusted at the way the greatest
communications medium in planetary history is going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other side of me, however, the person alone in a room with
a television and no accountability, can't wait for the next
'Survivor,'' can't wait until July to see 'Big Brother.'''
</P>

   WHAT A TRIP: The institution of the family summer holiday is
examined in ''Are We There Yet? America on Vacation,'' a new
History Channel special debuting 9 p.m. EST Friday (June 9). Such
vacation pioneers as the Western campers of the 1800s and the ''tin
can tourists'' who ventured out in their Model T Fords are
spotlighted in the two-hour documentary narrated by actor Matthew
Broderick.

<HEADLINE> Hutchence Girlfriend Wins Damages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The girlfriend of the late INXS singer Michael
Hutchence won substantial damages Wednesday from the publishers of
a book that said she deliberately became pregnant to trap him into
a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Yates also received an apology from The Mail on Sunday
tabloid, which published excerpts from the book by Vince Lovegrove
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, a TV personality and author, was Hutchence's partner from
1994 until his death in November 1997. Their daughter, Heavenly
Hiraani Tiger Lily, was born July 22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yates said after the hearing she was pleased. ''I think when
people start to tell lies about a 3-year-old child who has lost her
father, anyone would take action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sums of the settlement with the book's British publishers, Faber
&AMP; Faber, and its original Australian publishers were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Stone's Ex-Maid Jailed for Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sharon Stone's former housekeeper was
sentenced to 16 months in prison after pleading no contest to
taking pricey handbags, shoes, jewelry and other goods from the
actress.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Victoria Chavez also ordered Socorro ''Coco'' Del Carmen
Membrano to pay Stone as much as $50,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who wasn't in court Tuesday for the case's disposition,
has said she was hurt by the actions of the woman she had all but
considered a family member.
</P>
<P>
   Membrano, 48, pleaded no contest to a single count of receiving
stolen property. Among the items reported taken were dozens of
evening gowns, including one worth $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Stone noticed things missing over the years and
would occasionally ask Membrano if she knew where they were.
</P>
<P>
   ''The housekeeper would say, 'You gave that to your sister,' or,
'Oh, that's at the cleaners,''' said Deputy District Attorney Wendy
E. Segall.
</P>
<P>
   The actress finally learned the truth, authorities said, after
other staffers saw the items stuffed into eight garbage bags at
Membrano's home.

<HEADLINE> Adoption Hurdles Highlighted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers is hoping to
draw attention to the bureaucratic maze that surrounds the adoption
process and spur Congress to action.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's events to raise awareness featured an appeal by
Wendy's founder Dave Thomas and an exhibit in a House office
building with pictures detailing the struggles facing foster
children and families attempting to adopt. Thomas was adopted as a
child and has founded the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping to demonstrate the difficulty children have
finding their way to a permanent family,'' said Sen. Mary Landrieu,
D-La. ''We have made it much more difficult than it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thomas, ''Every day a child waits in the foster care system
is one day too long. They're losing their childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse, 72
percent of children awaiting adoption have been stuck in the foster
care system for two years or longer. Approximately 117,000 children
are waiting for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Landrieu and Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Mike
DeWine of Ohio are introducing adoption legislation that includes a
bonus to states for placing children in an adoptive home within
three years.

<HEADLINE> Pollster: New York Senate race still a dead heat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio is running even with Hillary
Rodham Clinton in their U.S. Senate race, just as his predecessor
Rudolph Giuliani was doing when he dropped out of the contest last
month, a new poll indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Clinton were each favored by 44 percent of voters in
the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute survey released
Wednesday. A Quinnipiac poll released May 16 had Clinton at 44
percent and the New York City mayor at 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Giuliani dropped out of the campaign to battle
prostate cancer. Lazio, a Long Island congressman, got into the
race the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's becoming obvious that the more people get to know Rick,
the more they like him,'' said Lazio campaign spokesman Dan
McLagan.
</P>
<P>
   But McLagan said Lazio does not want to focus on polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a tight race and we're going to go up and
down and back and forth with the polls,'' McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign countered that Lazio's poll numbers will
sag as the race continues.
</P>
<P>
   ''As New Yorkers learn more about Lazio's record of voting
against the interests of New York's working families ... they will
realize that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in this race who
will fight the right fights for New York's children and families,''
Clinton campaign spokeswoman Karen Finney said.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac polling institute in
Hamden, Conn., said that while Lazio's campaign remains a ''work in
progress, 44-44 is a pretty good place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   One cause for Lazio's concern, however, is the fact that 50
percent of those who said they were voting for him are doing so to
vote against Clinton, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Clinton vote is ''not necessarily a bad thing'' for
Lazio, ''but it shows they don't have much of an image of him,''
the pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the voters who stated a preference between Lazio and Clinton,
29 percent of Lazio voters said they strongly favor the Republican
candidate while 57 percent of the Clinton voters said they strongly
favor the Democratic first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters favored Clinton, 83 percent to 7 percent, and Jews
were with her, 44 percent to 37 percent. Whites favored Lazio, 52
percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 970 registered New York voters was
conduced by May 30-June 5 and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> IRS agent says Pirro ledgers show unsupported changes  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A handwritten ''2'' was changed to a
''4'' on an accountant's worksheet, adding a phantom $20,000 to
Albert Pirro's tax deductions in 1994, an Internal Revenue Service
agent testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the agent testified, a federal prosecutor displayed the
ledger entry to the jury at Pirro's tax evasion trial, clearly
showing the 2 under the 4 in the work papers of Anthony Pirro,
Albert's accountant, brother and codefendant. There was no
testimony about who might have changed the numeral.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro, husband of Westchester District Attorney Jeanine
Pirro, and his brother are accused of hiding more than $1 million
with phony tax deductions. The trial entered its third week on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   IRS agent John Dennehy, in his third day on the stand, said the
overwritten ''2'' changed a depreciation entry from $23,613 to
$43,613 and bumped the total allowance to $73,123 instead of the
$53,123 that could have properly been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, that cut Pirro's declared income by $20,000, Dennehy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant's papers showed other mysterious entries, Dennehy
said. An extra $23,455 in interest expenses, $30,000 in
subcontracting expenses and $10,588 in rent was added, without
foundation, to various companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was there any explanation?'' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney
Cathy Seibel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the figure,'' Dennehy said. The effect, he said again,
was to cut Pirro's declared income and thereby limit his tax
liability.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he said, a company half-owned by Pirro was entitled to
a $517 deduction for ''passive activity loss'' but took $30,517,
reducing Pirro's income by $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The agent also presented a computerized slide show purporting to
show that the $45,000 decorative gates outside the Pirro home in
Harrison were paid for in a complex transaction using three of
Pirro's companies. The gates were amortized by two companies,
resulting in improper deductions, he said, because the gates were a
personal expense.

<P>
   Asked about defense claims that the gates were for the district
attorney's security, Dennehy said they were designed long before
she became district attorney, were not very secure and were not
reported on her tax return the year they were paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Pirro has not been accused.
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy also testified that Albert Pirro improperly deducted as
entertainment 50 percent of the $5,000 in dues he paid in 1995 for
Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago beach club in Palm Beach, Fla., near the
Pirros' summer home.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that there was overdraft protection on some of
Pirro's accounts; in 1995, his personal corporation account was
overdrawn by as much as $37,000. A secretary testified earlier that
personal expenses were paid from business accounts only if there
was not enough money in the personal account.

<HEADLINE> Defense Launches Satellite Rocket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A Defense Department
satellite carrying several space experiments was lofted into orbit
early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pegasus rocket carrying the $85 million satellite was
dropped from the belly of an L-1011 jetliner at 40,000 feet about
100 miles west of Monterey. Seconds later, the rocket's first stage
fired for the 14-minute ride into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything went well,'' said Staff Sgt. Rebecca Bonilla,
spokeswoman at Vandenberg Air Force Base, where the jumbo jet
dubbed Stargazer took off about an hour before launch.
</P>
<P>
   Among other goals during the six-month mission, planners hope to
detect low-flying and slow-moving aircraft from space.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a scanner will measure potentially harmful radiation
around the satellite.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 20; Nasdaq Up 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned slightly higher in a quiet session
today as investors awaited word on Microsoft's antitrust case and
looked for new ways to buy into the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 19.58 at 10,755.15.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 7.01 at 1,464.85, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 10.96 at 3,767.33.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 75 cents to $68.875. After the close of trading
today, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson was expected to
issue his ruling on whether to split the computer software company
into two separate businesses. Microsoft has previously said it will
appeal any order to break it up.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology companies were faring better. Microstrategy,
a software maker that has struggled since admitting it would have
to restate earnings for the past few years, rose $9.688 to $37.688.
Traders said the company may receive financing from an outside
source.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines rose $2.50 to $29. KLM and British
Airways confirmed they have begun talks that could lead to a
merger. An alliance would create the world's third-largest airline,
behind United Airlines and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways fell 56.25 cents to $59.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, trading was quiet and directionless, with market
averages changing course several times. Analysts said interest rate
worries, which eased last week amid a slew of reports that signaled
a modest economic slowdown, haven't truly left the market. Many
investors are back on the sidelines, waiting for more information
as they try to discern whether the Fed may finally be finished
raising interest rates to cool the pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said the Fed
may have to force U.S. economic growth to a more substantial
slowdown. But he said he believes the slowdown can take place
without derailing the economy's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several considerations provide optimism that the outcome will
be a benign one -- a soft landing as opposed to a hard landing,''
Meyer told the Boston Economics Club.
</P>
<P>
   The next crucial piece of data for Fed economists and investors
will be the Producer Price Index, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 539.94 million shares, well
behind Tuesday's moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.94 to 510.71.

<HEADLINE> Nun Found Fatally Stabbed in Italy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIAVENNA, Italy (AP) -- The mother superior of a Roman Catholic
convent in this northwestern Italian town was found fatally stabbed
Wednesday in a park frequented by drug users and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Maria Laura left the convent at 10 p.m. Tuesday, telling
her fellow nuns she was meeting a young woman who needed help.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old nun's family lawyer, Michele Cervati, said
Mother Maria Laura helped ''many young people in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother superior, whose birth name was Teresina Mainetti, was
found in the park not far from the convent, which is home to the
order of the Daughters of St. Andrew of the Cross.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly villager who found the nun told the ANSA news agency
he didn't recognize Mother Maria Laura at first because of the
wounds to her face. Police said she was stabbed repeatedly.

<HEADLINE> Korean War Remembrance Opens  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air Force leaders opened their remembrance of
the Korean War by warning that some of the same threats to
readiness that hampered the U.S. military in that conflict 50 years
ago are repeating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''If ever there was a lesson learned in the cost of letting
readiness slide, Korea is it,'' Secretary of the Air Force F.
Whitten Peters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peters noted that when the war started on June 25, 1950, the Air
Force, like the other U.S. armed services, had just ''drawn down
rapidly after the victory of World War II and as a result was
unprepared in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan said military budgets
also were historically low, as they are again today.
</P>
<P>
   ''History teaches us a lot of lessons if we'll just listen,''
Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating themes that are some of the main issues facing the
services today, the two top men at the Air Force spoke at a daylong
seminar on the 1950-53 war, which ended not in victory, but with a
truce that has left the peninsula divided between communist North
Korea and Democratic South.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar is the first in a series of events this month that
will commemorate the outbreak of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the military budget at the start of the Korean War was
at its ''second lowest level'' since the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the first lowest point since Pearl Harbor is today ...
about 3 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was also fought during a time when the strategic interests
of the United States were stated in an unfortunate way -- where the
question of our resolve to be able to prosecute the conflict was in
question, not only within the United States, but transmitted
outside the United States in a very clear way,'' Ryan said. ''And
today we find ourselves in that same debate.''

<HEADLINE> Attorneys give closing arguments in insurance magnate's fraud case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A businessman was guilty of bad decisions
- not fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion - in the collapse of his
insurance empire, a defense attorney told a federal court jury
Wednesday as it prepared for deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Michael Koening told the U.S. District Court
panel to focus on defendant Albert Lawrence's state of mind as it
considered whether he was guilty of illegally using $32 million in
company assets.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was in Albert Lawrence's mind. It was to save his
company,'' Koening told jurors during an hourlong closing
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Koening reminded jurors that Lawrence acted on the advice of
''big banks, big attorneys and big accountants'' and that the
72-year-old insurance magnate went from a worth of $150 million to
bankruptcy trying to save his ailing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made errors in judgment. He made bad business decisions,''
said Koening. ''But he never intended to harm anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, of Schenectady, was named in a 20-count indictment
charging him with embezzlement, mail and wire fraud, and tax
evasion. Lawrence, once head of the now-defunct Lawrence Group
Inc., a holding company that owned most of the insurance companies,
is accused of illegally using $32 million in assets that should
have been invested to cover future policyholder claims.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lawrence used the money in an attempt to salvage his
own financially troubled companies and for his own benefit,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's Schenectady-based insurance companies operated in
dozens of states. The businesses have since either been liquidated
or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence could face a maximum of 50 years in prison and fines of
millions of dollars if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Frederick Scullin was scheduled to give jurors legal
instructions Wednesday and then send them off to begin
deliberations. The jury began hearing testimony May 9.
</P>
<P>
   During his closing argument, Assistant U.S. Attorney William
Pericak repeatedly used the words ''schemed'' and ''connived'' as
he stressed to jurors how Lawrence had used the money illegally and
then tried to cover his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you determine someone's intent, you do it at the time of
their actions, not after the fact,'' Pericak said. ''He put his own
interests first, second, third and fourth. His actions speak louder
than his words.''
</P>
<P>
   Pericak said prosecution evidence showed that Lawrence had ample
financial resources to keep his companies solvent. He said Lawrence
offered no legal defense during his testimony, only weak
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Pericak told jurors not to believe the defense's assertion that
Lawrence acted on the advice of others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Lawrence was the boss,'' Pericak said. ''He hired several
employees as high-paid yes men who told him what he wanted to
hear.''

<HEADLINE> Regents to consider vocational diploma  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - High school students seeking a vocational
curriculum will have the option of getting a technical endorsement
on their diploma, according to a proposal being presented to the
state Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, students wishing to pursue a trade could take
integrated programs that will combine academic learning with
technical skills. The programs would be designed by schools and
boards of cooperative education services (BOCES) and would need
certification from the state Education Department to become
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Students would also have to complete industry-based technical
assessments, to be developed either internally by the state
Education Department, by external groups, or both.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, schools and BOCES would prepare a ''work skills and
employability profile'' for each student based on the individual's
technical achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Graduating students who complete the integrated programs and
technical assessments would receive a ''career and technical
endorsement'' on their high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, devised by two panels of statewide and national
experts, was presented to the Regents last Friday and will be taken
up during the board's meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Education officials said such programs would address critics'
concerns that the Regent's tougher educational standards are not
giving vocational students enough time to learn adequate technical
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal would help solve the important issue of time for
students who want a career and technical education,'' state
Education Commissioner Richard Mills said in a statement Wednesday.
''They would be able to learn English, math and other subjects at
the same time and in the same courses in which they learn
vocational skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Schadewald, coordinator of instruction at the Capital
Region BOCES, serving Albany, Schenectady, Saratoga and Schoharie
counties, said without integrated programs, Regents requirements
are putting teachers and counselors in a ''crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now there is a lot of stress to get students to get
through the requirements alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is also getting support from the business
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very glad that the Regents are taking this up. It's very
important to businesses that technical education be part of the
standards,'' said Margarita Mayo, Director of Education Training
for the Business Council of New York State.

<HEADLINE> Drug Offers Hope Vs. Scleroderma  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A synthetic version of a fertility hormone
reverses some of the crippling, disfiguring effects of the
sometimes-fatal tissue disease scleroderma, researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   A study in Tuesday's Annals of Internal Medicine found in most
patients, a low dose of the hormone relaxin softened and loosened
skin scarred and hardened by the poorly understood disease.
</P>
<P>
   Caused by unexplained overproduction of the protein collagen,
the ''scaffold'' supporting tissue, scleroderma afflicts about
400,000 Americans to some degree, mostly women of childbearing age.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-patient study is the first in which patients getting a
drug improved more than a comparison group getting a placebo, lead
researcher Dr. James R. Seibold said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bit of an historic first,'' said Seibold, director of
the Scleroderma Research Center at the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey in New Brunswick. ''We see softening of the
skin. Patients are able to use their hands better, their ability to
perform basic tasks of daily activity improves, they're able to
open their mouths better.''
</P>
<P>
   Scleroderma can make fingers and other joints inflexible,
leaving patients unable to eat, groom themselves or do other basic
tasks unassisted. Often, it hardens internal organs, the esophagus,
gastrointestinal tract and blood vessels, making it difficult for
the body to breathe, deliver oxygen to tissues, clear out toxins,
or swallow or absorb food.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it kills quickly. Current treatments can only relieve
some symptoms. Unlike relaxin, many of those have nasty side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Carwil LeRoy, professor and chairman of microbiology and
immunology at the Medical University of South Carolina, said
relaxin has a good track record of inhibiting collagen formation in
test tube and animal experiments and appears to reverse damage to
skin. But he said more research is needed, particularly to see
whether it can stop or reverse the internal damage some patients
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, groups of patients received a low dose of relaxin,
a dose four times higher, or a benign, sterile solution.
</P>
<P>
   After six months, patients getting the placebo and the high dose
fared about the same, with a few getting worse and nearly half
showing no improvement. Just over half the patients getting the low
dose improved greatly; a few more improved only somewhat, and none
got worse.
</P>
<P>
   A one-year, 185-patient study is planned to learn more about
relaxin's long-term effects. Other studies are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is being developed by Connetics Corp., a California
company that is funding the research. John Higgins, president of
the company, said Connetics plans to test relaxin in people with
life-threatening poor leg circulation, infertility and two other
conditions that occur alone or as part of scleroderma, fibrosis of
the kidneys and of the lungs.

<HEADLINE> Murder, Mayhem Returns to Colosseum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Murder and mayhem are returning to the Colosseum,
1,500 years after the last gladiators fought and died in the
ancient arena. But this time the blood is fake and so are the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins will form the backdrop for productions of three Greek
tragedies by Sophocles, ''Oedipus the King,'' ''Antigone'' and
''Oedipus at Colonus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Culture and the National Institute of Ancient
Drama on Wednesday announced the productions, which will run from
July 19 to Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Colosseum, ancient Rome's most famous monument, was the
scene of bloody gladiator fights for hundreds of years until they
were banned in the 5th century, about 40 years before the fall of
the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   The last known spectacle in the amphitheater, fights between men
and wild beasts, took place in A.D. 523 during the reign of
Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths.

<HEADLINE> Germans Tired of High Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- It's not just hitting Germans at the pump: Rising
gas prices are pushing up the price of pizza delivery, a taxi ride,
even the cost of a locksmith driving to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   German newspapers regularly display pictures of gas station
price signs, as the auto-obsessed country airs its angst over
rising prices that reached an all-time high Wednesday of nearly
$3.85 per gallon of premium across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the blame has been falling on an ecology tax, aimed at
encouraging alternatives to driving. The tax was one of the few
achievements of the Greens party, which is serving in government
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties screamed Wednesday for a lowering or
elimination of the ecology tax, and polls show most Germans agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody can explain to commuters how they should get to work
without a car,'' the pro-business Free Democrats wrote in a motion
debated Wednesday in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vogue word 'ecology' conceals that the taxes only serve
the aim of filling state coffers.''
</P>
<P>
   A tax cut proposal also was to be raised Friday in the upper
house of parliament by Baden-Wuerttemberg state, where
DaimlerChrysler is based.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices are up more than 20 percent from the start of 1999,
and taxes now make up nearly 70 percent of the gas price. The Free
Democrats said taxpayers would spend $1.95 billion more this year
because of the ecology tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans -- torn between their dual passions for cars and
environmentalism -- are finally crying enough. According to a survey
by the Forsa polling firm for this week's Die Woche weekly, 61
percent of Germans want the government to eliminate the ecology
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Only 31 percent believe in keeping the tax, according to the
poll of 1,001 people conducted May 31-June 2 that had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry held firm in its position Wednesday.
''There are in no way any plans'' to eliminate the tax, said
spokesman Joerg Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he continued to cite the government's line for rising
oil prices: Market factors, the weak euro-dollar exchange rate and
OPEC shortage strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short-term reactions are not our thing,'' Social Democrat
parliament leader Wilhelm Schmidt said, saying Social Democratic
lawmakers are united behind Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure is continuing to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Taxis in Stuttgart have raised their prices, bus companies are
charging more for class trips, and locksmiths are upping the cost
of driving to let in locked-out Germans, according to the
mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The gas hike is even affecting pizza prices. Axel Fassbach, head
of the Hallo Pizza! chain, said prices would be going up next month
by 25 cents for small pizzas and 50 cents for large -- in part due
to rising gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that the customers will understand, but we aren't
sure,'' he said from the company's headquarters near Duesseldorf.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push Equal Pay for Women  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are urging House Republicans to act
soon on proposals to narrow the wage gap for women.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said House GOP leaders should follow the lead of
moderate Republican Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont, who scheduled a
Thursday hearing before his Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should do the same in the House,'' Rep. Rosa DeLauro,
D-Conn., said Wednesday. ''Unequal pay is unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate
to Congress and a former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission: ''Congress must not go home for the July 4 recess
without making a start on fair pay for American women and their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, women earn about 75 percent as much as equally
qualified men, according to a variety of government and independent
studies. Several proposals in Congress would tighten controls and
enforcement of federal equal pay laws.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has sought about $47 million to help narrow
the wage gap for women, including money to advance the careers of
women in the high technology field.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House
Education and the Workforce Committee, House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt of Missouri and 20 colleagues wrote that Congress should
''send a strong message to American women -- and to their families --
that we value their work and that we will do what it takes to
ensure that they are paid equally for it.''

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Clinton Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- A man who threatened to blow up President
Clinton and placed phony pipe bombs near the Eugene Airport before
a presidential visit has been sentenced to 13 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Loring Pickering, 51, pleaded guilty to making bomb
threats by telephone, lying to investigators and placing two fake

</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Oyster Funding, Conn Bjt, 660  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Twenty-three Connecticut oyster farmers
are being asked to return more than $1 million in federal disaster
aid after the government determined the way they farm is not
prescribed by law.
</P>
<P>
   The government's demand, state farmers say, threatens their
livelihood. The president of a national industry group says it
poses a threat to oystermen across the country who use the same
farming method and rely on the same federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Long Island Sound was hit by two parasites, commonly
referred to as MSX and Dermo. El Nino conditions caused the water
temperature to rise above normal, triggering the infestation, said
Terry Backer, executive director of the watchdog group Soundkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, whose family has been in the oyster business since 1820,
received $67,000 of the $1.3 million doled out last year to 23
farmers who qualified through applications based on losses from the
1997 outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''They issue these payments to us and come back a year later and
say (they) made a horrible mistake and (they) need the money
back,'' said Backer. ''People depended on this money and they spent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is requesting the money back because the farmers
use a ''bottom culture'' method, rather than cages, to farm for
oysters. About 90 percent of the sound's oysters are bottom
growers, said Backer.
</P>
<P>
   A letter dated June 2 from the Windsor-based Farm Service Agency
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture says, ''The Connecticut State
FSA Committee has reviewed your application for 1998 Crop Loss
Disaster Assistance program (CLDAP) benefits for oysters and has
determined you did not raise the oysters in a controlled
environment ... As a result, the State Committee has also
determined that you were overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brule, acting state executive director, signed the letter.
He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A message was left
at his office in Rhode Island, where a woman said he was out for
the day. Calls to the Windsor office were referred to Brule.
Messages were also left with USDA officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, we think that's a misinterpretation of the
rule,'' said Backer ''Can you imagine looking out at Nebraska and
seeing 200 acres of corn planted in flower pots?''
</P>
<P>
   The same farming method is used on the Gulf Coast where about
two-thirds of the nation's oysters are farmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned about the challenges that are being
placed (in Connecticut) by the industry. It doesn't make sense,''
said Mike Vosin, president of the Molluskan Shellfish Institute,
which represents farmers, processors and distributors nationwide.
''I'm really appalled that this is happening in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, whose ancestors began farming in Louisiana after
immigrating from France in the 1700s, represents the seventh
generation to join the family business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Motivatit Seafood suffered great losses due to
Hurricane Andrew. Without the help of several million dollars in
federal disaster aid, the business may not have survived, said
Vosin.
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, who is also on the board of directors of the Gulf Oyster
Industry Council, which represents farmers from Florida to Texas,
said the industry must fight what is happening in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we are going to, as an industry nationally, respond
through the congressional delegation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, a Democratic state representative from Stratford, said
local farmers have a lawyer ready to fight the government's demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there are a lot of basic tenants of law to go through
this process,'' he said. ''If we need to go to federal court, we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Backer views the request as a contractual violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a promise. There was a contract. No one is disputing
the contract,'' he said. ''They had 90 days to catch this. It's
just horrendous.''

<HEADLINE> Supporters Backing Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Mariachi musicians and retired officers
loyal to Gen. Augusto Pinochet saluted Chile's former dictator
Wednesday, trying to lift his spirits amid mounting legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of Mexican ballads, Pinochet received the mariachi
serenade at his home in Santiago on Infantry Day, a holiday for the
army he commanded after a bloody 1973 coup ushered in his 17-year
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces the prospect of a long legal battle over human
rights abuses committed under his rule after a court Monday
announced its decision to strip him of immunity from prosecution,
which Pinochet had enjoyed as a senator for life.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers say he will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court
before the Saturday midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   He faces 110 lawsuits filed on behalf of those killed or missing
under his authoritarian rule, which ended in 1990. The civilian
government that succeeded Pinochet has said more than 3,100 people
died or disappeared under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, a South American nation of 15 million that remains
highly divided over the past military government, Wednesday marked
a day for Pinochet's supporters to come out in force. Some 52
retired military officers visited the aging general.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we will defend him as best we can until the very
end,'' said Gen. Julio Canessa, a senator and former deputy
commander of the army that Pinochet led.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Carlos Forestier said Pinochet appeared in good
spirits after being greeted at his home. Mariachi musicians in a
courtyard belted out the lyrics: ''He is still the king.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet opponents maintain that if he is healthy enough to
receive well-wishers, he is capable of standing trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Pinochet is able to celebrate Infantry Day this way, then
his health is OK,'' said attorney Hugo Gutierrez, who is marshaling
several of the lawsuits against the 84-year-old general. Pinochet's
lawyers say he is not well enough to understand trial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's closest aides say he is innocent of the accusations.
His youngest son, Marco Antonio, has charged that the move to strip
him of immunity was motivated by politics.
</P>
<P>
   The government of new socialist President Ricardo Lagos has
withheld comment, saying the issue is a matter for the courts. His
government has said it will respect the decision of the judiciary.

<HEADLINE> House GOP May Use Surplus for Debt  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans proposed Wednesday that any
additional budget surplus be earmarked this year exclusively to pay
down the public debt, mainly to prevent the money from being used
for an election-year spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Debt relief should be a top priority, not an afterthought,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee. ''This plan says it's time for Washington to pay
its bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, any fiscal 2000 surplus above the $24.4 billion
estimated in March by the Congressional Budget Office would be set
aside in a new Treasury Department account. Analysts widely believe
the CBO's upcoming update will estimate a $40 billion surplus for
this year, perhaps as high as $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deposit would be mandatory -- just like entitlement programs
such as Medicare -- and not subject to the battles between
Republicans and Democrats over dollars used for discretionary
spending or tax cuts. GOP sponsors said they were mainly trying to
head off the end-of-year budget fight that almost always results in
sharply higher government spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not available for any spending,'' said Budget Committee
Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. ''This takes that money and
guarantees that it will pay down debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The account would be permanently put in place, but the amounts
deposited would be left up to Congress each year. Kasich said
lawmakers do not want to tie the hands of a future Congress -- those
possibly of George W. Bush, the GOP presidential nominee-in-waiting
-- to use surpluses in 2001 and beyond to enact deep tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt totals about $5.7 trillion, of which the
government owes $3.6 trillion to the public and $2.1 trillion to
Social Security and other trust funds. Paying down the debt is
popular among voters and is becoming a political battleground as
both parties seek to portray themselves as true fiscal
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although debt is automatically paid down if Social Security
surplus dollars aren't used for spending or tax cuts, the bill
would add to that by using surplus from the non-Social Security
part of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also reduce by an equal amount the national debt
ceiling -- the amount of debt the government can accumulate without
further action by Congress. That limit, currently $5.95 trillion,
has never been lowered since it was created in 1917, Archer said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 92; Nasdaq Up 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly higher in a quiet session
today as investors awaited word on Microsoft's antitrust case and
looked for new ways to buy into the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 91.92 at 10,827.49.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 7.01 at 1,464.85, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 10.96 at 3,767.33.
</P>
<P>
   Market averages broke out of a tight trading range as investors
bought a wide range of technology stocks. IBM rose $6.688 to
$119.063, contributing most to the Dow's gains, after Goldman Sachs
analyst Laura Conigliaro said orders were strong in the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology companies were also faring better.
Microstrategy, a software maker that has struggled since admitting
it would have to restate earnings for the past few years, rose
$8.438 to $36.438. Traders said the company may receive financing
from an outside source.
</P>
<P>
   And biotechnology stocks continued their most recent winning
streak. Immunex rose $4.063 to $36.188 after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration expanded its approval of the company's Enbrel
rheumatoid arthritis drug to more patients.
</P>
<P>
   The good news from a diverse range of technology companies
helped distract investors from their concerns over Microsoft. After
the close of trading today, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson was expected to issue his ruling on whether to split the
computer software company into two separate businesses. Microsoft
has previously said it will appeal any order to break it up.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 25 cents to $69.875.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines rose $2.50 to $29. KLM and British
Airways confirmed they have begun talks that could lead to a
merger. An alliance would create the world's third-largest airline,
behind United Airlines and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways fell 56.25 cents to $59.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, trading was quiet. Analysts said interest rate
worries, which eased last week amid a slew of reports that signaled
a modest economic slowdown, haven't truly left the market. Many
investors are back on the sidelines, waiting for more information
as they try to discern whether the Fed may finally be finished
raising interest rates to cool the pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said the Fed
may have to force U.S. economic growth to a more substantial
slowdown. But he said he believes the slowdown can take place
without derailing the economy's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several considerations provide optimism that the outcome will
be a benign one -- a soft landing as opposed to a hard landing,''
Meyer told the Boston Economics Club.
</P>
<P>
   The next crucial piece of data for Fed economists and investors
will be the Producer Price Index, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 656.47 million shares, well
behind Tuesday's moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.00 to 512.65.

<HEADLINE> NSA Farms Out Information Technology  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -- The super-secret National Security Agency
plans to turn management of most of its nonclassified information
technology over to a private contractor.
</P>
<P>
   NSA officials said the move, announced Tuesday, could save the
government $1 billion over 10 years, while allowing for faster
modernization of the agency's computers and telecommunication
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The contract would not involve the supercomputers, satellites
and ground stations around the world that the NSA uses to monitor
communications and eavesdrop on foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It narrows our front and allows us to focus the energies of
the agency on the things that only the agency can do,'' said Lt.
Gen. Michael V. Hayden, NSA director.
</P>
<P>
   The plan could be worth up to $5 billion to the winning bidder
over 10 years, The Washington Post and The Sun of Baltimore said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Mike Lewin, secretary of the Maryland Department of
Business and Economic Development, said three consortiums led by
major U.S. corporations are planning to submit bids. The contract
is scheduled to be awarded in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The companies leading those consortiums are: OAO Technology
Solutions Inc.; Computer Sciences Corp.; and a partnership between
AT&AMP;T and IBM, Lewin said.

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Goof Off for an Hour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Hundreds of Norwegians goofed off during
working hours Wednesday with the government's blessing in a
campaign to remind people about the value of time.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, people left their offices and other
workplaces, switched off their cellular phones and just enjoyed
life for an hour from noon to 1 p.m., in addition to their regular
lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about thinking through what we use our time for,''
said Minister of the Environment Siri Bjerke, who joined about 200
people in lollygagging for an hour outside parliament in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   A project called ''07-06-05'' had taken out full-page newspaper
advertisements throughout Norway urging people to take a break and
think about their lives. The group's name was taken from the June
7, 1905, date that Norway gained full independence from neighboring
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The group said people need independence from the tyranny of
tight schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take a walk in the park. Dip your toes in the water. Talk
about something different for an hour,'' said the group, set up by
the environment ministry, the national association of
municipalities and other public and private groups.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, people returned to their regular routines, often
jolted back to reality by the ringing of their cellular phones.

Swedes Deliver Unpretentious Jazz   
An AP Entertainment Review
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was just jazz -- straightforward,
unpretentious. But what the Swedish musicians delivered Tuesday at
Carnegie Hall, in a kind of prelude to the 12-day JVC Jazz
Festival, was of quality that the festival's participants may find
difficult to match.
</P>
<P>
   All evening, Swedish musicians in various groups made
straightforward jazz interesting, playing with skill, feeling and
fluency. They improvised and didn't overembroider; they played a
lot more clarinet than one gets from American jazz concerts these
days. All in all, they were more interested in the fine quality of
the cloth than the decoration.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, hosted by Duke Ellington's granddaughter Mercedes
Ellington, began with ''Deep Purple'' by the Swedish Swing Society,
doing a good job of portraying the Benny Goodman Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a tribute to Dixieland from the five-member Stockholm
Classic Jazz Band, playing banjo and a muted trumpet that sounded
as tinny as an early New Orleans recording.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups shone: the Allan-Gustafsson-Riedel Quartet with Jan
Allan playing light but assured trumpet on ''Sweet and Lovely'' to
easy, dissonant accompaniment; followed by ''Toomba Samba''
composed by bassist Georg Riedel.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday Night Big Band ended the first half of the concert in
emphatic but non-derivative American big-band style.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was even better. Pianist Jan Lundgren's trio
began with a gentle composition of his ''A Touch of You,'' in Bill
Evans' style. A guest, guitarist Ulf Wakenius, joined them for
''Cakewalk,'' which Lundgren played in Oscar Peterson's style, and
Wakenius played ''Too Late Now'' as a solo, with soft, full, round
tones.
</P>
<P>
   The Putte Wickman and Claes Crona Trio moved the evening in a
more modern, less melodically intent direction with two
compositions by pianist Crona. Then, while Crona improvised,
clarinettist Wickman played ''I Loves You, Porgy'' with tonal
beauty. They finished by making ''Summertime'' swing, Wickman
noodling a final phrase of great originality.
</P>
<P>
   A tribute to Jazz at the Philharmonic had a guitarist,
clarinettist, trombonist and three saxophonists lined up across the
stage. Organist Kjell Ohman and vibraphonist Lars Erstrand were
exceptional. Two singers appeared briefly -- the clear, flexible
soprano Rigmor Gustafsson, and Svante Thuresson, whose vocal style
is rooted in blues.
</P>
<P>
   The June 12-24 JVC festival opens Monday at the Kaye Playhouse
with a tribute to pianist Bill Evans.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills 2 Russian Servicemen  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Two Russian servicemen died when suicide bombers
blew up a truck packed with explosives outside a Russian facility
in Chechnya on Wednesday evening and rebels raked the area with
gunfire after the blast, a Kremlin spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The two bombers, a man and a woman, ''were blown to bits'' and
five Russians were wounded, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's top
spokesman for Chechnya, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Alkhan-Yurt, seven miles southwest of the
republic's capital Grozny, was one of the boldest guerrilla actions
of the war, now in its 10th month.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the truck drove at high speed through a
Russian checkpoint and stopped outside a school where Interior
Ministry troops are stationed. Seven troopers ran up to the vehicle
and it then exploded, Yastrzhembsky was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, the Russian troops were hit by a squall of
gunfire from nearby rebel positions, he said. Helicopter gunships
flew to the scene and the firing abated, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported that artillery fire
was continuing in Alkhan-Yurt late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's rebels have mounted a series of hit-and-run attacks
in Russian-controlled territory in recent weeks. But there have
been no reports of them using car or truck bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, although outnumbered and outgunned, have tormented
Russian troops with sniping and lightning attacks that sometimes
produce casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the military said Russian forces had come
under fire at least 19 times in the last 24 hours, but no soldiers
were hit.
</P>
<P>
   However, one Russian soldier was killed Tuesday when a mortar
exploded as his unit was shelling a forest near Gudermes, where
patrols had detected a rebel band, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gudermes is in northern Chechnya, which Russian forces occupied
months ago, but the rebels have been pressing attacks there.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Gennady Troshev, commander of Russian forces in the area,
said Tuesday that ''the army has virtually fulfilled its task'' and
claimed the Russian operation had left only 1,500 militants able to
fight from their refuges in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   A police detachment stationed in Grozny, which was captured in
February, came under fire overnight from rebels less than 200 yards
away, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels also fired at a military headquarters in the central town
of Urus-Martan and at a police building in Itum-Kale in the
southern mountains, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian attack planes flew 13 combat missions in the
past 24 hours. Mi-24 helicopter gunships flew more than 30 times,
the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven from Chechnya in a 1994-96 war, but
returned in September after Chechnya-based militants seized several
villages in the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan, and after
about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government blames
on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Seeks New Land Seizures  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Unbowed by criticism of his plan to
seize more than 800 white-owned farms, President Robert Mugabe said
Wednesday that his government is eyeing all white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   If whites are allowed to remain on their farms, Mugabe said, it
will be out of charity from the nation's majority black population.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced it would immediately begin
nationalizing 804 white-owned properties. On Wednesday, Mugabe said
that those farms were not enough to satisfy landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking at the totality of our land. It must come and
if we allow others to have portions of it, that must be on the
basis of our own will, our own desire and our own charity,'' Mugabe
said in an address to ruling party candidates in the parliamentary
elections, set for June 24-25.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's announcement of new land seizures, the United
Nations postponed a visit by Mark Malloch Brown, the head of the
U.N. Development Program. He had been scheduled to discuss how to
get orderly land reform back on track in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's announcement was criticized by the United States,
Britain -- the former colonial power -- other donors and opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest opposition party, the Movement for Democratic
Change, described Mugabe's remarks Wednesday as ''irrational'' and
a further threat to the agriculture-based economy already disrupted
by the illegal occupation of more than 1,400 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the war that led to independence from white minority
rule in 1980 have spearheaded the occupations. Mugabe urged
supporters Wednesday to offer thanks to war veterans for leading
the occupations that had hastened the land takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Welshman Ncube, secretary-general of the Movement for Democratic
Change, said Zimbabweans had little reason to be thankful for the
occupations, which triggered political violence. At least 30
people, most of them opposition supporters, have died in the
violence, and at least 7,000 people were displaced from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is completely irrational to ask Zimbabweans, ... whose
women have been raped, whose homes have been burned down, whose
teachers have fled, to thank the thugs responsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has described the land occupations as a justified protest
against the unfair ownership of land mostly by the descendants of
British settlers.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 whites own about one-third of the productive land,
which also supports 2 million farm workers and their families.
About 7.5 million blacks live on the remaining two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's opponents say he has promised white land to rural poor
to bolster his flagging popularity ahead of elections as the nation
faces its worst economic crisis since independence.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday in London, British Foreign
Office Minister Peter Hain said only Mugabe could insure the
upcoming elections were free and fair, ''and he seems determined
not to.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither Britain nor the international community can solve the
land problem or reverse Zimbabwe's economic decline. Only Robert
Mugabe can do so, and he shows no sign of wanting to,'' the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Boosts Iran-Egypt Ties  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Egypt narrowly beat Iran in a penalty
shootout Wednesday, but diplomacy was said to be the real victor in
the first soccer match between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning or losing is a secondary issue in these tournaments.
They are more of a bridge between us and the participating
countries for the expansion of friendly ties,'' said Mohammad
Ghaffari, an Iranian soccer federation official, before the game.
''We hope that football will serve as a means to improve political
relations among us.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Egyptian delegation, Azmi Quraitem, called the
event ''very symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a choice not to come, but we did so eagerly because we
want the two countries to have better ties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The match, part of a four-sided contest with South Korea and
Macedonia, began after dozens of white doves of peace were released
from boxes on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian-Iranian ties have long been strained. Iran opposes
Egypt's 1979 peace with Israel and Egypt objects to Iran's naming a
street in Tehran after Khaled al-Islambouli, the Muslim militant
army officer who assassinated Egypt's President Anwar Sadat in
1981. Egyptian officials have often said that the street name must
be changed before relations can be fully normalized.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 45,000 spectators had to wait until the second half
for a goal. In the 52nd minute, Egypt's captain, Hossam Hassan,
kicked the ball home from inside the penalty box. Egyptian fans,
who appeared to number no more than 10, jumped out of their seats
and waved their national flag.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Iran's captain, Ali Daei, replied by heading
a pass into Egypt's goal.
</P>
<P>
   When the final whistle blew, the two sides were drawn at 1-1.
The first 10 penalties gave neither side the advantage. The
shootout continued until Egypt went one up to win the match at 9-8.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Medicare Changes  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elderly and disabled Americans who want to
participate in clinical trials of new drugs or medical treatments
can now be certain Medicare will help pay the bill, after a change
ordered by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simply put, the more seniors we enroll in trials, the faster
we'll be able to use these advances to save American lives,''
Clinton said Wednesday, making the announcement before leaving the
White House for a trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is ordering the Health and Human Services
Department to instruct contractors who process Medicare claims to
approve bills submitted for routine medical care during clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   That will include doctor's office visits, lab tests and other
care needed by a patient participating in a trial that normally
Medicare would cover if it were part of traditional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded coverage will not include care required only
because of the trial, such as extra lab tests needed solely to help
researchers collect data or the cost of the experimental devices or
drugs. Often, these costs are paid by the sponsors of clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Medicare change will take effect within a week
and that HHS will track use of the benefits and evaluate the need
for broader coverage.
</P>
<P>
   It has been estimated that 265,000 Americans participate in
clinical trials each year, and that about 61 percent of them --
161,000 -- are Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Among cancer patients, the White House said that 63 percent are
over age 65 -- the Medicare eligibility age. But elderly people make
up just 33 percent of participants in cancer clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today America's seniors are badly underrepresented in clinical
trials, yet they bear the heaviest share of illness,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the
National Academy of Sciences, recommended the Medicare change. The
December report said uncertainty about whether the program would
pay bills discouraged elderly and disabled Americans from
participating in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the physician is giving a patient full information ... he
has to say he can't guarantee they will be paid,'' said Henry J.
Aaron, one of the report's authors.
</P>
<P>
   The institute estimated that Medicare already paid 50 percent to
90 percent of health care costs for elderly people who take part in
clinical trials. That is because claims submitted by doctors and
hospitals do not normally indicate if a patient is participating in
a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare has generally deemed such bills improper when audits
have uncovered them.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers from both parties have sought legislation
explicitly directing Medicare to pay the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said a recent determination by
government lawyers that legislation was not necessary cleared the
way for Clinton's order.
</P>
<P>
   No Medicare law explicitly disallowed the coverage; rather, it
was only a long-standing interpretation of law, which could be
reversed at the president's discretion, the lawyers advised.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medicare coverage for clinical trials is a victory for
patients and scientists alike,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the change, Clinton cited Vice President Al Gore's
advocacy of better access to clinical trials for retirees and the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee,
welcomed the move and believes more should be done to ''ensure that
seniors have access to these breakthrough medical treatments,'' his
campaign said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not say what the cost to Medicare would be.
Without giving a figure, the Institute of Medicine had predicted it
would be small because Medicare already paid many of the bills in
question and because accompanying care often was the same whether
someone had experimental or traditional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   What goes for Medicare's 39 million beneficiaries often
influences health coverage available for other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the more interesting things will be to see how the
insurance industry responds to the change in Medicare policy,''
Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Most private health insurance now does not cover care associated
with experimental treatment. But there is evidence that like
Medicare, private insurance companies unwittingly have paid for
much of it.

<HEADLINE> New trial sought for murder on racial bias claim  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A convicted murderer is seeking a new
trial because his defense lawyer was not allowed to ask prospective
jurors their opinions on interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Frank Mandanici said the interracial marriage question
can act as ''the X-ray of the heart'' to get at whether a person is
racially biased.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're against interracial marriage, I believe that means
you're a racist at heart,'' said Mandanici, a public defender in
New Haven Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on race relations disagree about whether opposition to
interracial marriage always indicates someone is biased and would
be unfit to serve on a jury where a black person is accused of a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Something about the issue, however, seems to spark more
controversy- among people of all races - than other racially
charged matters, such as integrated schools, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Mandanici is making such an argument in a 13-page brief before
U.S. District Judge Alvin W. Thompson in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   In picking a jury in 1990 for the murder trial of Sean Smith,
who is black, Mandanici asked jurors several questions about race.
When he asked about interracial marriage, the prosecutor objected
and the judge told Mandanici to withdraw the question.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was convicted of killing Darrel Brantley in Meriden and
was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Smith claimed he acted in
self-defense when he shot and killed Brantley in 1990. Mandanici
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Connecticut Supreme Court found that while the
question was proper, it did not matter in Smith's case because
other questions about racial attitudes had been asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mandanici and other lawyers now can freely ask about interracial
marriages when picking juries. Mandanici said the issue is
important enough to warrant a new trial for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal appeal, he says the recent controversy about Bob
Jones University's policy against interracial dating shows how the
issue indicates overall racial attitudes in a way that other issues
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a policy against interracial marriages is such a litmus
test that the government can expel a university from the rolls of
tax-exempt institutions ... then surely a defendant in a criminal
case should be allowed to apply the same litmus test and expel
potential jurors,'' Mandanici wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to interracial marriage cuts across all races,
experts on race relations said, and is probably the prevailing
public opinion today.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get jurors who all favor interracial marriage, you'll
have a stacked jury. The people who favor it are not with
mainstream values,'' said University of Delaware history professor
Raymond Wolters.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters also pointed out that some prominent black leaders have
been opposed to interracial marriage for nonbiased reasons.
</P>
<P>
   W.E.B. Du Bois thought mixed-race marriages were likely to fail
because social conditions made it very difficult for the couples to
be secure in their marriages and raise their children, Wolters
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders, such as Marcus Garvey, opposed interracial
marriage because of their pride in the black race, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors who are asked about interracial marriage give all kinds
of answers to explain their opposition, such as ''the Bible says
it's wrong'' or ''people should stay with their own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the religion angle is way to justify what can't
otherwise be justified. Who's going to argue with God?'' asked
Robert McNamara, a sociology professor at Furman College in South
Carolina, who wrote the book ''Crossing the Line: Interracial
Couples in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said opinions such as Du Bois' just show that the
problems interracial couples and children face are not because of
race, but because of the way a biased society treats them.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the reasons people use to oppose interracial
marriages are flawed or rationalizations to hide what's really
under the surface - that they think blacks and whites shouldn't
marry because blacks are inferior,'' McNamara said.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Oyster Funding, 1st Ld-Writethru, 700  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Twenty-three Connecticut oyster farmers
are being asked to return more than $1 million in federal disaster
aid after the government determined the way they farm is not
prescribed by law.
</P>
<P>
   The government's demand, state farmers say, threatens their
livelihood. The president of a national industry group says it
poses a threat to oystermen across the country who use the same
farming method and rely on the same federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Long Island Sound was hit by two parasites, commonly
referred to as MSX and Dermo. El Nino conditions caused the water
temperature to rise above normal, triggering the infestation, said
Terry Backer, executive director of the watchdog group Soundkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, whose family has been in the oyster business since 1820,
received $67,000 of the $1.46 million doled out last year to 23
farmers who qualified through applications based on losses from the
1997 outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''They issue these payments to us and come back a year later and
say (they) made a horrible mistake and (they) need the money
back,'' said Backer. ''People depended on this money and they spent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is requesting the money back because the farmers
use a ''bottom culture'' method, rather than cages, to farm for
oysters. About 90 percent of the sound's oysters are bottom
growers, said Backer.
</P>
<P>
   A letter dated June 2 from the Windsor-based Farm Service Agency
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture says, ''The Connecticut State
FSA Committee has reviewed your application for 1998 Crop Loss
Disaster Assistance program (CLDAP) benefits for oysters and has
determined you did not raise the oysters in a controlled
environment ... As a result, the State Committee has also
determined that you were overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brule, acting state executive director, signed the letter.
He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A message was left
at his office in Rhode Island, where a woman said he was out for
the day. Calls to the Windsor office were referred to Brule.
Messages were also left with USDA officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm outraged at the Department of Agriculture, quite
frankly,'' said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-New Haven. ''Our oyster
farmers are not going to be punished for (the USDA's) mistakes. We
are going to exhaust every avenue to see that our farmers are not
devastated by the ineptitude of the Department of Agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLauro, who has contacted the USDA secretary, said the FSA
never spoke with farmers about alternate farming methods when
officials came soliciting applications for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, we think that's a misinterpretation of the
rule,'' said Backer of the FSA's farming restrictions. ''Can you
imagine looking out at Nebraska and seeing 200 acres of corn
planted in flower pots?''
</P>
<P>
   The same farming method is used on the Gulf Coast where about
two-thirds of the nation's oysters are farmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned about the challenges that are being
placed (in Connecticut) by the industry. It doesn't make sense,''
said Mike Vosin, president of the Molluskan Shellfish Institute,
which represents farmers, processors and distributors nationwide.
''I'm really appalled that this is happening in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, whose ancestors began farming in Louisiana after
immigrating from France in the 1700s, represents the seventh
generation to join the family business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Motivatit Seafood suffered great losses due to
Hurricane Andrew. Without the help of several million dollars in
federal disaster aid, the business may not have survived, said
Vosin.
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, who is also on the board of directors of the Gulf Oyster
Industry Council, which represents farmers from Florida to Texas,
said the industry must fight what is happening in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we are going to, as an industry nationally, respond
through the congressional delegation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, a Democratic state representative from Stratford, said
local farmers have a lawyer ready to fight the government's demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there are a lot of basic tenants of law to go through
this process,'' he said. ''If we need to go to federal court, we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Backer views the request as a contractual violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a promise. There was a contract. No one is disputing
the contract,'' he said. ''They had 90 days to catch this. It's
just horrendous.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 77; Nasdaq Up 83  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks shook off early losses to
close higher today after a Goldman Sachs analyst said IBM is
expected to have a strong year. The rosy prospects for IBM helped
pull investors off the sidelines, where they had been fitfully
awaiting a judge's ruling on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stocks came on very strongly once they found a catalyst,''
said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter
Ltd. in New York. ''It wasn't anything terribly dramatic, but
there's a lot of money on the sidelines, and a fervent desire to
get it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.29 to 10,812.86, while
the Nasdaq composite index rose 82.76 to 3,839.13. Both indexes
recovered from early declines.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 13.52 to 1,471.36.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,604 up, 1,323 down and 493
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 840.19 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
936.15 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.89 to 516.54.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market seems to be on the path of least resistance, and
that is to the upside,'' said Bleier, noting that investors are
continuing to buy stocks even after solid gains last week that
could have set up a big bout of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks continued a steady recovery from their swoon in
March and April, led by IBM. Well-known Goldman Sachs analyst Laura
Conigliaro said orders were strong in the past two months, and
added that investors may be undervaluing the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology companies were also faring better.
Microstrategy, a software maker that has struggled since admitting
it would have to restate earnings for the past few years, rose
sharply as investors anticipated that the company may soon receive
financing from an outside source.
</P>
<P>
   And biotechnology stocks continued their most recent winning
streak. Immunex rose after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
expanded its approval of the company's Enbrel rheumatoid arthritis
drug to more patients.
</P>
<P>
   The good news from a diverse range of technology companies
helped distract investors from their concerns over Microsoft. After
the close of trading today, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson was expected to issue his ruling on whether to split the
computer software company into two separate businesses. Microsoft
has previously said it will appeal any order to break it up.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines rose. KLM and British Airways confirmed
they have begun talks that could lead to a merger. An alliance
would create the world's third-largest airline, behind United
Airlines and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways ended with a more modest gain.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, trading was quiet. Analysts said interest rate
worries, which eased last week amid a slew of reports that signaled
a modest economic slowdown, haven't truly left the market. Many
investors are back on the sidelines, waiting for more information
as they try to discern whether the Fed may finally be finished
raising interest rates to cool the pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said the Fed
may have to force U.S. economic growth to a more substantial
slowdown. But he said he believes the slowdown can take place
without derailing the economy's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several considerations provide optimism that the outcome will
be a benign one -- a soft landing as opposed to a hard landing,''
Meyer told the Boston Economics Club.
</P>
<P>
   The next crucial piece of data for Fed economists and investors
will be the Producer Price Index, due out Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Workers say Karan sanctioned sweatshops  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A group of garment workers sued Donna Karan
International in federal court Wednesday, saying the designer's
chic togs were made under sweatshop conditions in Manhattan's
Fashion District.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, mostly Chinese immigrants who don't speak
English, said they were forced to work long hours with no overtime
pay. Some claimed they were paid less than minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Donna Karan has been treating workers like slaves,'' Sau Kwan
Yu of the Chinese Staff and Workers' Association said at a news
conference. ''We want to see a 40-hour work week and a living
wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Five plaintiffs filed the class-action lawsuit in Manhattan
federal court on behalf of what they said were about 300 workers --
many of them women -- who sew Donna Karan garments in New York.
They alleged abuses in at least two Fashion District factories, but
lawyer Ken Kimerling said he believed there were several others.
</P>
<P>
   The factories were run by companies working on contracts for
Donna Karan International, but Kimerling said the designer's
representatives knew about the long hours and lack of overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have people in those factories every day,'' said
Kimerling, legal director at the Asian-American Legal Defense and
Education Fund. ''They know how much they're paying for those
garments.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan International issued a statement saying it could not
comment on the lawsuit because it had not yet reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said the company expected its contractors to
follow labor laws and ''proper ethical standards,'' and that it had
set up a factory compliance program ''to promote adherence to these
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As a company founded by a woman and an employer of a great
many women at all levels, we are always working toward the
advancement and further empowerment of women - both inside and
outside our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan was among five clothing retailers who agreed in
October to settle a lawsuit over working conditions at factories in
Saipan, an island in the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng Liu, 47, a plaintiff who worked for two and a half years
making Donna Karan garments at an Eighth Avenue factory called Jen
Chu, said the company retaliated against workers who complained by
shutting down several weeks ago and leaving them jobless. An
affiliated company, Jen Jen fashions, continues to produce Donna
Karan garments, Kimerling said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng said he often worked more than 70 hours a week for $8.50 an
hour, but was not given overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I refused to go to work one day, I would get fired,'' he
said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerling said some workers earned as much as $12 an hour, but
were denied overtime pay. Others, he alleged, were paid by the
piece and sometimes got less than minimum wage. All five plaintiffs
worked at one time for Jen Chu or Jen Jen.
</P>
<P>
   Xiao Li, 46, said he often worked 80 hours a week at Jen Chu for
as little as $130 to $150, below the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had very high expectations for us,'' he said. ''There was
a lot of work to be done. ... There were surveillance cameras to
monitor key (work) areas.''
</P>
<P>
   A phone number listed for Jen Chu had been disconnected, and
there was no listing for Jen Jen. Both companies were named as
defendants in the lawsuit, as were their owners, Carvin Chen and
Winnie Young Chen, whose numbers also were not listed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was part of an effort by labor advocates to hold
retail companies responsible for working conditions even when
garment production is contracted out to independent companies.

   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- It's just a tiny piece of
evidence the size of a fingernail. But prosecutors hope it pays off
big in linking two Libyan defendants to the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockerbie trial, in its sixth week, moved to a new stage
Wednesday by focusing on a half-inch fragment of a circuit board
that appears to have belonged to the electronic timer that
detonated the Lockerbie bomb.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the two suspects planted the bomb
with the detonator on a connecting flight from the Mediterranean
island of Malta. Investigators have traced the detonator to a Swiss
firm that said it delivered a batch of the timers to Libyan
intelligence agents who allegedly worked with the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the trial has involved a description and analysis of
the debris from the explosion Dec. 21, 1988, over Lockerbie,
Scotland that killed 270 people, including 189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, described
in their indictment as Libyan intelligence officers, have pleaded
innocent, blaming Palestinian terrorist groups for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Alan Turnbull showed the Scottish court photo
enlargements of the circuit board fragment with blackened bumpy
edges. A silver painted ''1,'' possibly all that was left of an
identification code, spanned the blistered top surface beside two
copper foil leads.
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow police inspector Keith Harrower told the court that in
the four months following the discovery of the fragment in January
1990 he went to electronics firms in Britain and Germany to try to
learn where the board had come from.
</P>
<P>
   But by April 1990 the search still had not uncovered the
manufacturer and the investigation was handed over to other
Scottish investigators, Harrower said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not say whether the fragment was the one
identified by investigators in 1991 as a piece of the
Swiss-manufactured electronic timer that triggered the bomb 38
minutes after the jetliner took off from London's Heathrow Airport
en route to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss timer was cited as a key piece of evidence when U.S.
and British authorities announced the indictment against the two
Libyans in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbull, the prosecutor, indicated he would try to establish a
link between the detonator and the Libyan intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockerbie trial is being conducted before a special Scottish
court at this former U.S. air base as a result of an agreement that
persuaded Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender the suspects
after nearly a decade of economic sanctions in his country.

<HEADLINE> McCall says Pataki, Legislature missed boat on budget  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature
missed an opportunity to provide significant long-term stability to
state finances in the recently enacted budget, state Comptroller H.
Carl McCall said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the 2000-01 budget displayed a ''business-as-usual''
attitude, while the state's strong tax collections and continuing
surpluses should have dictated a more prudent, farsighted approach.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's analysis, which was attacked by the Pataki
administration, said the $77.5 billion budget fails to close
projected future-year budget gaps, borrows too much, has a spending
increase far higher than the rate of inflation and ''backloads''
tax cuts so that they don't take full effect for three or four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a classic recipe for creating failed policies for the
future,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and Legislature, with a $1.5 billion budget surplus
at the end of the last fiscal year, should have put far more money
into reserve funds as a hedge against a future economic downturn,
McCall said. The comptroller also faulted the budget for failing to
address a long-standing budget shortfall involving the State
University of New York's hospitals and to make changes in the
state's aid-to-education formulas.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic comptroller's analysis was assailed by the
Republican Pataki administration, which noted that McCall may end
up running against Pataki for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a blatantly political and partisan report from someone
who is running for office,'' state Budget Division spokesman Joe
Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall fails to give Pataki credit for the five years of tax
cutting he has done as governor, nor for getting the Legislature to
adopt a debt-reform package as part of the budget which should
curtail some borrowing by New York, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   ''On debt reform in particular, New Yorkers should be made aware
of the fact that the comptroller was nowhere to be found when
Governor Pataki was fighting a tough and ultimately successful
battle to achieve the first real reforms in state history,'' Conway
said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget spokesman said Pataki successfully closed a projected
$5 billion budget gap during the first state budget he presided
over, for fiscal 1995-96, and that New York has earned two credit
upgrades on Wall Street since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think his fiscal track record speaks for itself,'' Conway
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall spokesman Jeffrey Gordon countered it is unfair to take a
shot against McCall on debt reform since the comptroller has pushed
for changing the state's borrowing practices for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parts of that package were lifted directly'' from the reform
provisions McCall has been favoring, Gordon said.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Finds Ancient Egypt Drawings  </HEADLINE>
By MAE GHALWASH
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIN SOKHNA ROAD, Egypt (AP) -- Archaeologists aren't exaggerating
when they say ancient treasures abound in the sands of Egypt. So
many, in fact, that even a pilot from Iowa, out on a desert outing,
can make a notable discovery: cave drawings that could date back
thousands of years before the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   George Cunningham was in the desert 25 miles southeast of Cairo
looking for fossilized sea urchins, shells and plants -- a favorite
hobby -- when he spotted ''an interesting looking wall'' late last
month.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cunningham led Egyptian scholars to the site to
investigate the find -- a sort of cave in a limestone hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were astounded that this wall was there and that we had
never seen it,'' said Cunningham, of Algona, Iowa, who has worked
in Cairo for 2{ years as a helicopter pilot trainer for an oil
company. He is a frequent visitor to the stretch of desert where he
made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The cave drawings appear to be from three eras, according to
Egyptian experts. The earliest, which could date back to 7000-6500
B.C., are hunting scenes: men and women carrying bows alongside
what appear to be dogs or wolves.
</P>
<P>
   A later drawing appears to be religious: two gods or goddesses
in an arch alongside three shapely women -- probably goddesses as
well. It could date to the early Pharaonic dynastic period, around
3,000-2500 B.C., the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   From yet another era comes writing that includes hieroglyphic
elements, like a primitive version of an eye of Horus. Specialists
speculate that it could represent a transition between languages,
either before or after hieroglyphics.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham escorted several friends to the site. Among them was
an American diplomat, who sent photos of the cave to Gaballah Ali
Gaballah, the director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   That led to Wednesday's visit by some 15 archaeologists, who
fanned out around the cave pointing out the different symbols.
Exclamations of ''fascinating'' and ''it must be excavated''
punctuated their talk -- as well as a cautious: ''This is all
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers declined to make any evaluations Wednesday,
saying they needed time to excavate the site and study the
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   But Mohammed el-Saghir, head of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman
sector of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, who did not accompany
the team but saw photos earlier, says he is certain the find is of
value.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists have found similar drawings in caves in southern
Egypt. But, says el-Saghir, this may be the first time such
etchings have been found in northern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it could help mark the route that Stone Age nomads
took from southern Egypt to the Nile Valley to settle in what is
now Ma'adi, a posh Cairo suburb, el-Saghir said. Those Bedouin
later became the Ma'adi civilization, established around 3200 B.C.,
about 1,000 years before the Early Dynastic Period.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just very happy that I knew enough people to bring this
to the attention of the authorities and preserve it,'' a beaming
Cunningham said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opens Korean War Remembrance  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air Force leaders opened their remembrance of
the Korean War by warning that some of the same threats to
readiness that hampered the U.S. military in that conflict 50 years
ago are repeating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''If ever there was a lesson learned in the cost of letting
readiness slide, Korea is it,'' Secretary of the Air Force F.
Whitten Peters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peters noted that when the war started on June 25, 1950, the Air
Force, like the other U.S. armed services, had just ''drawn down
rapidly after the victory of World War II and as a result was
unprepared in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan said military budgets
also were historically low, as they are again today.
</P>
<P>
   ''History teaches us a lot of lessons if we'll just listen,''
Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating themes that are some of the main issues facing the
services today, the two top men at the Air Force spoke at a daylong
seminar on the 1950-53 war, which ended not in victory, but with a
truce that has left the peninsula divided between communist North
Korea and Democratic South.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar was the Air Force's first in a schedule of events to
commemorate the outbreak of the conflict. Other services also are
planning commemorations, and some are planned jointly with the
war's South Korean allies in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   A separate, three-day conference of Army historians meeting in
Arlington, Va., was analyzing some of the more painful aspects of
the conflict, including the capture of 13,000 U.S. soldiers by the
communist Chinese who ran prison camps on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The Army says only 3,500 survived, and a former military
physician held for nearly three years, retired Lt. Col. Bill
Shadish, gave a grisly first-hand account of camp conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dead in winter were stacked like cord wood because the
frozen ground was too hard to bury them,'' said Shadish, who now
lives in Redding, Calif. Many prisoners survived only on small
meals of grain, he said, and vitamin deficiency took a heavy toll
in disease, including some that showed up years after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Korean War 50th Anniversary Commemorative
Committee is planning a wreath-laying ceremony June 14 at the Tomb
of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, with Joint Chiefs
Chairman Gen. Henry H. Shelton and Bud Selig, commissioner of major
league baseball. Also expected to attend is Jerry Coleman, a Korean
War veteran and former professional baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the 50th anniversary committee, retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Nels Running, told reporters Wednesday that as part
of the committee's effort to get the private sector involved in the
commemoration, Selig has agreed that all major league ballparks
will fly the 50th anniversary flag on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The main Defense Department-sponsored event in Washington will
be a June 25 ceremony at the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the
National Mall. President Clinton is scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's seminar, Ryan said the military budget at the
start of the Korean War was at its ''second lowest level'' since
the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the first lowest point since Pearl Harbor is today ...
about 3 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was also fought during a time when the strategic interests
of the United States were stated in an unfortunate way -- where the
question of our resolve to be able to prosecute the conflict was in
question, not only within the United States, but transmitted
outside the United States in a very clear way,'' Ryan said. ''And
today we find ourselves in that same debate.''

<HEADLINE> Insurgents ask for details on $1 billion in budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democratic insurgents in the state Assembly
asked Wednesday for details on how more than $1 billion included in
the new state budget will be spent, and who will spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen Democratic Assembly members who comprise the Assembly
Majority Reform Caucus said it is unclear how money from several
well-funded state programs in the $77.5 billion budget will be
allocated.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the $350 million Transportation Multi-Modal
Program, $225 million for the Strategic Investment Program, $200
million for the 007-Commnity Projects Fund for member items and
$125 million for the Transportation Industrial Access Program.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators also asked for how $195 million remaining from
the Community Enhancement Facilities Program in the 1998 budget is
being spent.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was promised by the insurgent Democrats when they
came out publicly against Sheldon Silver as speaker in the
Assembly. The group called for reforms on how the ruling Democrats
run the Assembly and for Silver to be replaced by the chamber's
ex-majority leader, Michael Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to topple Silver failed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's complaints was that rank-and-file members have
ceded too much control over spending to the majority leaders of the
state Assembly and Senate. Those two legislators and the governor
have acquired virtually unfettered power to spend discretionary
funds totaling hundreds of millions of dollars for each men, the
reform caucus said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The members and the public are entitled'' to information about
the spending of discretionary money, the Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch declined comment on the
insurgents' request.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Reviews Sec. Chief's Role  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori says it's time for
Vladimiro Montesinos, his shadowy security chief, to step into the
light.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Fujimori said
Montesinos, widely feared for his spy network and the power he
exercises, needs to clear up a broad range of accusations against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Organization of American States to take
steps to improve democratic rule after his tainted re-election last
month, Fujimori said he was reviewing what role his controversial
spy chief might play in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect that his work will not continue to be secret,''
Fujimori said late Tuesday night at the Government Palace in Lima's
colonial downtown. ''At some moment he should come out into the
public light because he has to clarify all the accusations that
have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos has been accused of taking money from drug lords,
having links to death squads and spearheading smear campaigns
against Fujimori's opponents in the recent presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Montesinos' dark reputation, Fujimori has kept him close
by during his decade in power because he has proved highly useful
in defeating leftist rebels and undercutting Fujimori's political
opponents, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, a leader who has often blurred the line between
dictator and democrat, admitted that his government was an
''imperfect democracy'' that needed improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there is any country in the world that can say
it has a perfect democracy,'' the 61-year-old, bespectacled
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS on Monday stopped short of questioning Peru's
presidential election or imposing sanctions. Instead it resolved to
send a high-level mission to Peru to work on strengthening
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said he would welcome and work with the OAS mission but
would not accept its questioning his re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   He risked turning Peru into a pariah state by going ahead with a
May 28 runoff after his opponent Alejandro Toledo pulled out,
accusing him of planning to rig the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori discussed steps he was planning to strengthen
democratic safeguards in line with OAS demands.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to overhaul the judicial system to assure its
independence, giving special attention to reviving the
Constitutional Tribunal, which among other responsibilities reviews
violations of individual rights and threats to press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has been inactive since the Fujimori-controlled
Congress fired three of its seven members in 1997 after they ruled
that Fujimori could not be a candidate for a third consecutive
five-year term. Fujimori proceeded to run despite a constitutional
limit of two straight terms.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more importantly, Fujimori said he planned to
reduce the powers and size of the National Intelligence Service and
reassign excess personnel to other military branches.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence service, under Montesinos' command, has been
accused of spying on opposition politicians and independent
journalists viewed as threats to Fujimori's power. Critics say it
resorts to wiretaps, extortion, even death threats to intimidate
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori stopped short of saying he might fire Montesinos, but
neither did he rule it out, saying before he takes any action, his
security chief must take steps to clean up his image.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to give Montesinos a lot of credit,'' said Michael
Radu, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute in
Philadelphia, who has studied Peru for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not there because Fujimori likes him. He is there
because he has performed. He is a very brilliant person.''

<HEADLINE> Police say teen charged in baby's death couldn't find sitter  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - Police found the body of a 16-month-old
boy in the Passaic River on Wednesday, 2 1/2 miles from the spot
authorities say his mother threw him in the water when she couldn't
find a babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the body at 12:05 p.m. about two miles downstream
from the Great Falls, said Boris Moczula, Passaic County's first
assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was wearing a red and blue sweat suit and a diaper,
Moczula said. An autopsy was planned to determine cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old mother, whose name has not been released because
she is a juvenile, was arraigned Tuesday on charges of juvenile
delinquency stemming from the alleged murder.
</P>
<P>
   Officers began searching for the body Monday morning after
detectives notified them that the girl had hurled her child off a
footbridge when she failed to find a baby sitter, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said after throwing the baby into the water, the
teen-age mother went to visit her boyfriend for several hours
before returning home. It is unclear whether she told anyone what
she had done with the child, including the father.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the baby's father is no longer dating the
mother, but was still involved in his son's life and cared for the
child several times a week while the baby's mother went to night
school.
</P>
<P>
   The young mother drove to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical
Center late Sunday night to seek treatment for problems ''of a
psychiatric nature'' and while there revealed what had happened to
her child, Purdy said.
</P>
<P>
   Moczula said authorities have not decided whether to charge the
girl as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's attorney, Anthony Fusco, said there is no case
against her.
</P>
<P>
   ''All they have is a statement that probably isn't admissible,
and I'm not so sure that she gave a statement that's even true,''
Fusco said.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Oyster Funding, 2nd Ld-Writethru, 700  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Twenty-three Connecticut oyster farmers
are being asked to return more than $1 million in federal disaster
aid after the government determined the way they farm is not
prescribed by law.
</P>
<P>
   The government's demand, state farmers say, threatens their
livelihood. The president of a national industry group says it
poses a threat to oystermen across the country who use the same
farming method and rely on the same federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Long Island Sound was hit by two parasites, commonly
referred to as MSX and Dermo. El Nino conditions caused the water
temperature to rise above normal, triggering the infestation, said
Terry Backer, executive director of the watchdog group Soundkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, whose family has been in the oyster business since 1820,
received $67,000 of the $1.46 million doled out last year to 23
farmers who qualified through applications based on losses from the
1997 outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''They issue these payments to us and come back a year later and
say (they) made a horrible mistake and (they) need the money
back,'' said Backer. ''People depended on this money and they spent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is requesting the money back because the farmers
use a ''bottom culture'' method, rather than cages, to farm for
oysters. About 90 percent of the sound's oysters are bottom
growers, said Backer.
</P>
<P>
   A letter dated June 2 from the Windsor-based Farm Service Agency
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture says, ''The Connecticut State
FSA Committee has reviewed your application for 1998 Crop Loss
Disaster Assistance program (CLDAP) benefits for oysters and has
determined you did not raise the oysters in a controlled
environment ... As a result, the State Committee has also
determined that you were overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brule, acting state executive director for the FSA, signed
the letter. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere along the line human error occurred,'' said Larry
Mitchell, deputy administrator for FSA in Washington. ''We're still
investigating how that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the farmers did not qualify in 1998 for funding
under a non-insurance assistance program and should not have been
granted funding under CLDAP. The farming requirement ''is the
policy of the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm outraged at the Department of Agriculture, quite
frankly,'' said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-New Haven. ''Our oyster
farmers are not going to be punished for (the USDA's) mistakes. We
are going to exhaust every avenue to see that our farmers are not
devastated by the ineptitude of the Department of Agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLauro, who has contacted the USDA secretary, said the FSA
never spoke with farmers about alternate farming methods when
officials came soliciting applications for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, we think that's a misinterpretation of the
rule,'' said Backer of the FSA's farming restrictions. ''Can you
imagine looking out at Nebraska and seeing 200 acres of corn
planted in flower pots?''
</P>
<P>
   The same farming method is used on the Gulf Coast where about
two-thirds of the nation's oysters are farmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned about the challenges that are being
placed (in Connecticut) by the industry. It doesn't make sense,''
said Mike Vosin, president of the Molluskan Shellfish Institute,
which represents farmers, processors and distributors nationwide.
''I'm really appalled that this is happening in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, whose ancestors began farming in Louisiana after
immigrating from France in the 1700s, represents the seventh
generation to join the family business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Motivatit Seafood suffered great losses due to
Hurricane Andrew. Without the help of several million dollars in
federal disaster aid, the business may not have survived, said
Vosin.
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, who is also on the board of directors of the Gulf Oyster
Industry Council, which represents farmers from Florida to Texas,
said the industry must fight what is happening in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we are going to, as an industry nationally, respond
through the congressional delegation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, a Democratic state representative from Stratford, said
local farmers have a lawyer ready to fight the government's demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there are a lot of basic tenants of law to go through
this process,'' he said. ''If we need to go to federal court, we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Backer views the request as a contractual violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a promise. There was a contract. No one is disputing
the contract,'' he said. ''They had 90 days to catch this. It's
just horrendous.''

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal wants moratorium on tribal recognition decisions  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Attorney General Richard Blumenthal asked
federal officials Wednesday to stop issuing American Indian tribal
recognition decisions until the government figures out how to
better handle the job.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and the co-chairs
of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Blumenthal asked for a
moratorium on recognition decisions. He also urged the leaders of
the Senate committee to scrap a proposed bill that would that would
create a three-person commission appointed by the president to
decide which tribes are recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said tribal recognition should be decided by a larger
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be a moratorium on any recognition decisions and
changes in law until there's a national commission that can asses
the best process for these decisions to be made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's letters are in response to last month's surprise
announcement by the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs that his
agency can no longer handle the task of granting federal
recognition to tribes. BIA chief Kevin Gover said he would support
legislation removing the responsibility from his agency.
</P>
<P>
   Federal recognition makes tribes eligible for several federal
assistance programs and classifies them as sovereign nations. With
recognition often comes the power to open a gaming casino.
</P>
<P>
   More than 550 tribes are federally recognized and about 200
cases are pending.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the Golden Hill Paugusett, Schaghticoke, Eastern
Pequot and Paucatuck Eastern tribes are seeking federal
recognition. The latter two tribes have been granted preliminary
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The BIA requires reams of historical documentation from tribes,
and sometimes takes as long as 12 years to make a decision on a
request for recognition. Critics pressing for change say that's too
long.
</P>
<P>
   Schaghticoke Chief Richard Velky called Blumenthal's request for
a moratorium a ''slowdown tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how much slower the process can get,'' Velky
said. The Schaghticokes have been waiting more than three years for
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the Colorado
Republican and co-chair of the Indian Affairs Committee who
proposed the bill to set up a three-person panel to make
recognition decisions, also criticized Blumenthal's requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see where Mr. Blumenthal seeks to be helpful,'' the
spokesman, Chris Changery said. ''His requests will just continue
the delays that are already there.''

<HEADLINE> China Trade Supporters Fear Delay  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of normalizing trade with China
appealed Wednesday to Senate leaders for a final vote before July
4, even if it means accepting all House amendments.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door meeting, the Senate Finance Committee agreed to
pursue a no-amendment strategy in hopes of moving the legislation
quickly, said Ginny Flynn, spokeswoman for the committee chairman,
Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody in the room agreed with that strategy,'' she said.
''The committee is united.''
</P>
<P>
   Prohibiting amendments to speed passage would be highly unusual
in the Senate, which prides itself on being deliberative.
</P>
<P>
   Any changes made by the Senate would require the legislation to
be returned to the House. Also, the Clinton administration and its
congressional allies want to avoid a repeat of the bruising battle
in the House, which approved the legislation 237-197 last month.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by corporate America and most Republicans,
while organized labor, a key Democratic constituency, opposes it
fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10 moderate Democrats also delivered the same
no-amendment message Wednesday in letters to Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. Both leaders
support the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we recognize the importance of Senate prerogatives and
the right of each member to offer amendments, this legislation
merits a bipartisan effort to pass the bill as it has been sent to
us from the House,'' the Democrats wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The House added amendments to provide relief for U.S. industries
battered by surges in low-cost Chinese imports, and to set up a
watchdog commission to monitor human rights and trade practices in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the amendments were crafted carefully to pick up
enough Democratic support to win passage in the House, and that any
changes could mean new troubles for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate completely accepts the House version, the bill
would go right to the president for his certain signature.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end annual votes on China's trade status and
allow U.S. businesses to take full advantage of China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has wide bipartisan support in the Senate, but
opponents have threatened to use delaying tactics. With the
congressional calendar crammed with important spending bills needed
to keep the government functioning after Oct. 1, some lawmakers
have suggested the China bill might have to be delayed until the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 Democrats urged a final vote before July 4 are: Bob
Graham of Florida, John Breaux of Louisiana, Richard Bryan of
Nevada, Max Cleland of Georgia, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Joe Lieberman of
Connecticut, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Chuck Robb of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Oyster Funding, 3rd Ld-Writethru, 700  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Twenty-three Connecticut oyster farmers
are being asked to return more than $1 million in federal disaster
aid after the government determined their farming methods don't
conform to federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for aid, the government requires farmers to raise
oysters in the ''controlled environment'' of cages. The Connecticut
farmers use a ''bottom culture'' method, taking oysters out of
their natural beds. About 90 percent of the sound's oysters are
bottom growers, said Terry Backer, executive director of the
watchdog group Soundkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The government's demand, state farmers say, threatens their
livelihood. The president of a national industry group says it
poses a threat to oystermen across the country who use the same
farming method and rely on the same federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Long Island Sound was hit by two parasites, commonly
referred to as MSX and Dermo. El Nino conditions caused the water
temperature to rise above normal, triggering the infestation, said
Backer.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, whose family has been in the oyster business since 1820,
received $67,000 of the $1.46 million doled out last year to 23
farmers who qualified through applications based on losses from the
1997 outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''They issue these payments to us and come back a year later and
say (they) made a horrible mistake and (they) need the money
back,'' said Backer. ''People depended on this money and they spent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter dated June 2 from the Windsor-based Farm Service Agency
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture says, ''The Connecticut State
FSA Committee has reviewed your application for 1998 Crop Loss
Disaster Assistance program (CLDAP) benefits for oysters and has
determined you did not raise the oysters in a controlled
environment ... As a result, the State Committee has also
determined that you were overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brule, acting state executive director for the FSA, signed
the letter. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere along the line human error occurred,'' said Larry
Mitchell, deputy administrator for FSA in Washington. ''We're still
investigating how that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the farmers did not qualify in 1998 for funding
under a non-insurance assistance program and should not have been
granted funding under CLDAP. The farming requirement ''is the
policy of the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm outraged at the Department of Agriculture, quite
frankly,'' said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-New Haven. ''Our oyster
farmers are not going to be punished for (the USDA's) mistakes. We
are going to exhaust every avenue to see that our farmers are not
devastated by the ineptitude of the Department of Agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLauro, who has contacted the USDA secretary, said the FSA
never spoke with farmers about alternate farming methods when
officials came soliciting applications for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, we think that's a misinterpretation of the
rule,'' said Backer of the FSA's farming restrictions. ''Can you
imagine looking out at Nebraska and seeing 200 acres of corn
planted in flower pots?''
</P>
<P>
   The same farming method is used on the Gulf Coast where about
two-thirds of the nation's oysters are farmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned about the challenges that are being
placed (in Connecticut) by the industry. It doesn't make sense,''
said Mike Vosin, president of the Molluskan Shellfish Institute,
which represents farmers, processors and distributors nationwide.
''I'm really appalled that this is happening in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, whose ancestors began farming in Louisiana after
immigrating from France in the 1700s, represents the seventh
generation to join the family business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Motivatit Seafood suffered great losses due to
Hurricane Andrew. Without the help of several million dollars in
federal disaster aid, the business may not have survived, said
Vosin.
</P>
<P>
   Vosin, who is also on the board of directors of the Gulf Oyster
Industry Council, which represents farmers from Florida to Texas,
said the industry must fight what is happening in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we are going to, as an industry nationally, respond
through the congressional delegation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backer, a Democratic state representative from Stratford, said
local farmers have a lawyer ready to fight the government's demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there are a lot of basic tenants of law to go through
this process,'' he said. ''If we need to go to federal court, we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Backer views the request as a contractual violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a promise. There was a contract. No one is disputing
the contract,'' he said. ''They had 90 days to catch this. It's
just horrendous.''

<HEADLINE> Deliberations continue for a third day in boy witness trial  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The jury in the trial of a man accused
in the killings of an 8-year-old witness and the boy's mother
deliberated for a third day Wednesday without reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler Jr., 28, is accused of arranging the murders of
8-year-old Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke,
to keep the boy from testifying against him in a 1998 murder case.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the jury heard court clerks read back testimony
from Peeler's former girlfriend, Angelina Keene, who said that
Peeler urged her to move away from the area about two months before
the Jan. 7, 1999, killings because ''witnesses are going to get
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury also heard the testimony of Kybarris Taylor, a friend
of Peeler's who said Peeler offered to pay him $10,000 to ''take
out two people'' for him about a month before the killings. Taylor
testified that Keene overheard Peeler's request, and that she also
urged him to do the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't you do that favor for him? His life is in danger,''
Keene said, according to Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But Keene, under questioning from Peeler's defense lawyer,
testified that she didn't even know Taylor and had never overheard
Peeler ask anyone to kill two people.
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning its deliberations Monday afternoon, the jury has
reheard portions of testimony from 10 witnesses, including
Josephine Lee, the prosecution's star witness.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she acted as a lookout while Peeler's brother, Adrian,
shot the mother and son to death in their home. She also said she
overheard Russell Peeler ask his brother to kill them the day
before the murders.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Peeler's defense lawyers showed the jury letters Lee
wrote to her lawyer and former landlord in which she said she
didn't know anything about the murders and had lied to police about
the Peeler brothers' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler, who is accused of being the gunman, is scheduled
to be tried separately, after Russell Peeler's trial ends. Both
brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Delays Threaten Russia Waste Cleanup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Delays in funding may jeopardize
efforts to remove nuclear waste from a deteriorating ship being
used as a dump in Russia's far north, a top nuclear official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Norway and other nations earlier pledged to fund the cleanup,
but have since put off signing agreements to move the project
forward. According to the Interfax news agency, Russia's Deputy
Minister of Atomic Energy Valery Lebedev said the donor nations are
holding up efforts to remove the nuclear waste stored aboard a
small ship called the Lepse, which is anchored in Murmansk harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Murmansk is a major Russian seaport located just east of Norway,
the nation that has pledged the largest share of funding.
</P>
<P>
   Lebedev said Russia would not take responsibility for the
project's failure if donors were reluctant to sign agreements and
held up funding, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   Norway's Deputy Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide has denied the
project is in danger. He said France and the Nordic Financing
Cooperative are finalizing legal requirements with Russia before
signing on, and that their agreements will complete the funding
package.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that will go quickly,'' he said, adding that his
nation could not release its share until all the details are
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have called the small, run-down ship a
floating Chernobyl because of the radioactive waste stored
haphazardly in its hold. The waste is not in immediate danger of
leaking but cannot be safely removed using ordinary cranes.
Meanwhile, the vessel is slowly decaying in the harbor.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Better Russia, Baltic Ties  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL TARM
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) -- Top Clinton administration adviser
Strobe Talbott urged Russia on Wednesday to seek better relations
with the three former Soviet Baltic republics.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, deputy secretary of state and adviser to President
Clinton on Russian issues, also urged Moscow to stop what he said
were extreme statements directed at the republics.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has sharply criticized prosecutions in the Baltics of
elderly Stalinist agents on charges of crimes against humanity.
Moscow has also singled out Latvia and Estonia for allegedly
discriminating against their large Russian-speaking minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said a Russian government spokesmen had gone so far as
to speak about a ''rise of neo-fascism'' in Latvia and Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such charges, to put it mildly, are not supported by the
facts,'' he said. ''We're trying to bring about a better future for
everyone in the region. That means enhancing common aspirations,
not engaging in divisive and unwarranted accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott was speaking in Tallinn during a one-day meeting of
high-level U.S. and Baltic officials on key security and economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   A statement signed by Talbott and his Baltic counterparts at the
talks said that Washington continued to support the desire of
Baltic nations to join NATO -- another issue that has prompted
Russian criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltics have aspired to join the Western alliance ever since
they regained independence following the Soviet collapse in 1991.
But the Kremlin vehemently opposes Baltic membership, viewing it as
a potential threat to Russian security.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Buying U.S. Weapons Systems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon on Wednesday announced sales of
two weapons systems to Taiwan designed to improve the defensive and
navigation capabilities of its F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan will pay $122 million for 48 electronic countermeasures
pods, which are designed for use on F-16s to jam or interfere with
enemy anti-aircraft radar signals.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan also will pay $234 million for 39 sets of
Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods, which provide low-altitude navigation
and defensive capability.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are frequently criticized by China,
which views them as unwarranted U.S. interference in Chinese
affairs. The U.S. view is that sales of defensive arms are
justified under the Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the sales of electronic countermeasures pods
and Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods ''will not affect the basic
military balance in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States does not have formal diplomatic ties with
Taiwan, which split from China amid civil war in 1949. China
considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province and has not ruled out
using force to reunite Taiwan with the mainland.

<HEADLINE> More Pro-Israel Militiamen Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A military court on Wednesday found
another 24 former pro-Israeli militiamen guilty of collaboration
and sentenced most of them to one year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The former members of the now-defunct South Lebanon Army were
convicted as the country debated sentences handed down earlier in
the week against ex-SLA fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 appeared before the Military Tribunal in Beirut, the
second group to go on trial since the May 24 Israeli withdrawal
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The former militiamen were charged with collaborating with the
enemy, joining the militia or entering Israel, a country still
technically at war with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the military judges sentenced 16 of the 24
militiamen to jail for one year. Three others were sentenced to 18
months in prison. Two each received a two-year sentence and three
got three years each.
</P>
<P>
   The court, whose verdicts cannot be appealed, also fined 22 of
the militiamen $270 each.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent response to guerrilla warnings that revenge could
be exacted, court officials said the tribunal also ruled that some
convicts were forbidden from returning to their hometowns for up to
five years after serving their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,500 SLA members surrendered to Lebanese authorities
before and after the Israeli pullout, while about 7,000 Lebanese --
ex-militiamen and their families -- sought refuge in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the court tried and sentenced 77 former SLA fighters.
Forty-eight of them received a one-year prison term; the heaviest
sentence was five years.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences were seen as lenient by anti-Israeli guerrillas
and their supporters and harsh by relatives of the condemned and
some politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the main guerrilla group that fought the Israelis in
the occupied zone, has demanded tough sentences. Its leaders have
also warned that any freed ex-militiamen will not be safe in their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Christian politician Dory Chamoun -- whose late
father, ex-president Camille Chamoun, was among Christian leaders
who welcomed the Israelis during their 1982 invasion of Lebanon --
demanded an SLA amnesty similar to a 1991 pardon that covered
militiamen who committed crimes during the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened before that Lebanese collaborated with
Palestinians against the state. Others cooperated with the Syrians
when they were shelling residential areas, and they received an
amnesty,'' he was quoted as saying in Wednesday's An-Nahar
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said an amnesty would encourage people who fled to Israel to
return home.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lebanese joined the SLA voluntarily, but others served to
earn a living in the economically depressed border zone or were
recruited under the threat of imprisonment or expulsion of their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The militia, which was paid and armed by Israel, helped the
Israeli army for 18 years control the self-proclaimed security zone
in south Lebanon. The militiamen also controlled the lives of
120,000 people, jailing and expelling hundreds who were deemed a
security threat to them and the occupation.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Syphilis Outbreak Contained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A syphilis outbreak primarily among gay men
in Los Angeles County has been contained, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No new cases were reported since the first week of April, said
Diane Goodwin, spokeswoman for the county Department of Health
Services. The outbreak raised fears that HIV might spread at a
faster rate than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the new syphilis patients was 36, which
surprised authorities because that age group is considered to be
informed about preventing sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The county responded with a $560,000 campaign of condom
distribution, syphilis testing and precautionary advertisements
targeting the gay community, although officials noted the outbreak
also affected heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-three syphilis cases were reported between January and
late March, compared with the usual 100 in a year, Goodwin said. Of
the new cases, 53 were HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis, curable with antibiotics, is transmitted through
sexual intercourse or oral sex and is characterized by a lesion in
the mouth or on sexual organs, or a body rash, sometimes with a
fever and sore throat.

<HEADLINE> Race themes permeate Assembly debate, suggesting a divided New Jersey </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A divided New Jersey met - and fought - on
the Assembly floor this week.
</P>
<P>
   On one side were the wealthy suburbs filled with a lot of white
people. On the other side were the decaying cities, filled with
mostly minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Are these two separate New Jerseys, fighting it out for scarce
resources? Or is it politics?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a little of both.
</P>
<P>
   During debates Monday on various issues - school construction,
the census, paid police leave - several Assembly Democrats charged
that Republican measures were racist, discriminatory and
mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were unsuccessful in defeating any bill, they came
close.
</P>
<P>
   The school construction legislation, which would create the
largest school building program in state history, passed by only a
41-29 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican bill would force the state to use only an
actual census head count, rather than statistical sampling, when
redrawing legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and other opponents charged the method leaves
minorities, recent immigrants and city residents undercounted and
therefore underrepresented in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not racism, it certainly seems to be,'' Assemblyman
William Payne, D-Essex, said during Monday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that would allow certain police officers paid leave to
attend conferences also drew charges of racism because it failed to
include minority police groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say some Democrats are too quick to introduce
race into the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some members feel it's unfortunate that when there are policy
debates and differences of opinion on policy issues, that some
members of the Democratic caucus are quick to play the race card,''
said Chuck Leitgeb, spokesman for the Assembly Republicans. ''It
has nothing to do with race.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Guy Gregg, R-Morris, who sponsored the census bill,
said some Democrats are angling for a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, unfortunately, over the years, (racist) has become a
term that has been thrown around to strike a chord, with the
expectation of striking fear in the other side,'' said Gregg, who
is white.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats say it's important to discuss race - even if
it makes people uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, we shouldn't debate or question the motives behind people
who are apparently trying to diminish the power of the minority
vote?'' said Payne. ''If it's a sore that's festering, let's bring
it out into the open. If we're wrong, that's fine. But let's
discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, who is black, agreed
that lawmakers, white and black, should address the issue of race -
when the issue merits it.
</P>
<P>
   But he also wondered whether it was appropriate in every
instance Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the school construction measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly version of the bill gives lawmakers the power to
oversee construction in any district that receives 100 percent
state funding, which could be as many as 114 districts, including
30 ''special needs'' districts.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, some Democrats said the provision
discriminates against those 30 poor, mostly urban districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just the (special needs) districts that were affected
by this oversight,'' he said. ''Certainly, when you look at those
100-plus districts that this provision would affect, they're not
all districts serving the needs of poor and/or minority children.''
</P>
<P>
   But a bill that would provide paid leave for police officers to
attend conferences left out minority groups, Conaway added.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is interesting to note that there were no paternal police
organizations of color included in that bill, but Italians were,''
Conaway said. ''Why isn't every group included?''
</P>
<P>
   Because the bill included only groups that had asked bill
sponsor Assemblyman Nicholas Asselta, R-Cumberland, for help,
Asselta said. He also told minority members that he would
co-sponsor another bill including minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''After my answers to Assemblyman Payne, they were comfortable
because they voted for the bill,'' Asselta said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Strickland, director of the Garden State Coalition of
Schools, which represents wealthier districts, said introducing
race into the school construction program could be damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you take a look at the school construction bill as a whole,
lawmakers are dealing with all the issues - urban and suburban - at
a historic level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past 10 years, urbans and suburbans have worked
really productively together,'' she added. ''Side efforts that
might dismantle this really wholesome step forward are dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> Governor meets with police incident victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki hugged the mother of New
York City police shooting victim Patrick Dorismond and said he was
sorry for the family's loss, according to witnesses at their
meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki met Monday night for almost 45 minutes with more than a
dozen relatives of shootings, beatings and other incidents
involving police officers from New York City, according to state
Assemblyman Keith Wright, who also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hugged the Dorismond family, which I thought was a good act
of symbolism,'' Wright, a Manhattan Democrat, said. ''He did agree
to start a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News, which first reported the governor's
meeting with the families, also said Pataki told Marie Dorismond,
''All New Yorkers owe you an apology and our efforts to make sure
it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said the governor ''was
apologizing for their losses'' and made no apology for the official
actions of police or other agencies in the incidents which caused
the families' relatives to be hurt or killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not his place,'' Mucha said. ''He went in there to give
them an opportunity to have their say. As with any other situation,
he said we need to learn and there are always ways to look at a
situation and figure out ways that it can be made better.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani received much criticism
from minority groups for refusing to meet with the Dorismond family
or to apologize for some incidents of police violence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday outside City Hall about the governor's actions,
Giuliani said, ''I think it's perfectly appropriate for him to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And what I said before is that I have expressed my feelings
about that a couple of weeks ago and have also attempted to meet
with the (Dorismond) family twice,'' Giuliani said. ''I'm still
happy to do that, except they wanted a lawyer present.''
</P>
<P>
   That attorney is Johnnie Cochran, who is representing the
Dorismonds in their $100 million civil claim against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Once the grand jury decides if the Dorismond shooting involved
criminal behavior, Giuliani said he would like to try again to
reach out to the Dorismond family.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorismond was shot and killed in March by police
involved in a buy-and-bust operation in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the state Capitol meeting were relatives or
representatives of Amadou Diallo, Anthony Baez, Gary Busch, Anthony
Rosario, Hilton Vega, Malcolm Ferguson and Yong Xin Huang - all
killed or injured at the hands of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said the relatives, in Albany to help promote bills
sponsors said would make some police officers more sensitive and
less violence-prone, met for about 45 minutes with state Criminal
Justice Coordinator Katherine Lapp Monday. Pataki dropped by,
saying he could stay for only five minutes, but remained for nearly
45 minutes, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was an excellent first step,'' Wright said. ''The
families are somewhat frustrated by the process in Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Pataki said of Monday's meeting and the losses
suffered by the families, ''We can't just say it's unfortunate. We
have to look at what happened and learn from it.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor accuses owner of clinic of a massive fraud  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A prosecutor during opening statements Wednesday
accused the owner of a Manhattan cosmetic surgery clinic where a
liposuction patient once died of leading a massive fraud to cheat
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert C. Juman said Sonia Lafontaine
submitted nearly a half million dollars in bogus claims so cosmetic
surgery, which is not usually covered by insurance companies, would
be paid for anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Juman said some clients of the Lafontaine-Rish Medical
Association on 57th Street were told to lie to obtain free service
for procedures that could result in fuller lips and slimmer hips.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these people had no idea a fraud was being
committed,'' Juman said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor accused Lafontaine of performing medical
procedures herself, including removing lesions and unsightly veins,
even though she was not a doctor. He also said she convinced others
to submit insurance forms for procedures that were exaggerated or
never performed.
</P>
<P>
   But her lawyer, Myles Malman, said his client was ''victimized
and betrayed'' by her husband, Arthur Kissel, who remains a
fugitive in the case, and a doctor, Benito Rish, who served as her
mentor and friend for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rish pleaded guilty to insurance fraud in March and is awaiting
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ''She sits here alone at that table,'' Malman said of a client
who dabbed tears from her eyes shortly before opening statements
began.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this case is really about is a woman, 46 years old, who's
been working a long time very, very hard. She wanted everyone to be
beautiful healthy, medically healthy, spiritually healthy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lafontaine opened clinics in Canada in the 1980s that
were so successful that she started selling her own line of beauty
products.
</P>
<P>
   He said she decided in 1990 to open a clinic in Manhattan along
with a man she had met and married within several months and a
doctor who had taught her much of what she knew about the cosmetic
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Lafontaine was the victim of these two men in this
horrible situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, the clinic was under investigation by insurance
companies and the federal goverment. In January 1998, an overweight
Jersey City, N.J., man who wanted to be a police officer died of
complications due to anesthesia. The anesthesiologist later
surrendered her license to practice medicine.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Lafontaine faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Fate of Missing Gulf Pilot Probed  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
has ordered defense and intelligence officials to investigate the
fate of a Navy pilot shot down in the opening hours of the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Michael Speicher of Jacksonville, Fla., went missing
when his Navy F-18 Hornet was shot down on Jan. 16, 1991, in a
dogfight with an Iraqi fighter jet. He was the first American lost
in the war and the last still unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The military never searched for Speicher, but declared him
killed in action in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., announced Wednesday that the committee
has formally ordered the Central Intelligence Agency and Department
of Defense to conduct an assessment of Speicher's fate. While the
intelligence community has received several reports on the matter,
it has not produced its own assessment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is enough information both public and classified to
question the Navy's killed in action status for this American
serviceman,'' said Roberts, a member of the committee. ''We have an
obligation to this pilot and his family. What we do here is
symbolic of our obligation to every service man and women.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel also requested that the CIA and Defense Department
inspectors general -- the agency watchdogs -- recommend how the
government can keep from repeating mistakes made in Speicher's
case.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokeswoman Anya Guilsher said that the intelligence
community would cooperate fully with the committee's request. Larry
Greer, spokesman for the Pentagon's POW/MIA office, said the
Speicher case has been under Defense Department investigation since
the night he was shot down.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Defense, the Navy and other government
agencies, including the Intelligence Committee, have all been
involved throughout the investigation, which continues to this
day,'' Greer said. ''We in the Department of Defense have kept the
appropriate members of Congress and committees briefed at a
classified level on the Speicher investigation and will certainly
continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Intelligence Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
introduced legislation last month that would require the CIA to
assist the Defense Department in such cases. Specifically, it
directs the CIA director to strengthen data analysis in those
cases.

<HEADLINE> Bomber Kills Sri Lankan Official  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suicide bomber shattered Sri Lanka's
first-ever War Heroes Day, killing a Cabinet minister and 20 other
people Wednesday during a fund-raiser for the families of slain
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Minister for Industrial Development C.V. Gooneratne was
assassinated as he walked among supporters in his parliamentary
district in Ratmalana, an industrial suburb of the capital,
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   Gooneratne, the bomber, and 20 other people were killed, said
the director of Kalubowila Hospital, Dr. W.G. Gunawardena. The
doctor said the minister's wife was among seven people seriously
injured and that 53 others were treated at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing. But it was
similar to past attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
which has been fighting for 17 years to create a separate homeland
for minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers, outlawed in the United States, Sri Lanka and
India, have been fighting since 1983 to carve out an independent
nation for the island's 3.2 million Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the 18.6 million population. The war has left 62,000 people
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have a suicide unit, the Black Tigers, known for
targeting government officials and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement said the motive was to mar ''a day that
was specially meant to pay tribute to the war heroes battling to
maintain the ... territorial integrity of the nation.'' War Heroes
Day was declared to boost the morale of the 40,000 troops fighting
the rebels in northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has intensified in the last two months as the rebels
made a series of lightning advances in the north, overrunning
several army camps to arrive at the doorstep of Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart condemned the
''reprehensible act'' but urged a continuation of efforts to
resolve the bitter conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such terrorism should not and cannot detract from efforts to
reach a negotiated solution to the current conflict in Sri Lanka,''
he said. ''The United States stands firmly in support of a solution
that offers justice and human rights for all the citizens of a
unified, peaceful, and prosperous Sri Lanka.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the War Heroes Day ceremonies before the bombing, all
traffic in the capital stopped and people were told to observe two
minutes of silence as President Chandrika Kumaratunga in a
televised speech called the event ''the most sacred moment for the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jehan Perera of the Peace Council, an independent think tank,
said the bombing was probably the Tiger's response to the holiday.
He said Gooneratne was ''a soft target and a shocking choice'' for
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was not involved in the military end of the government. But
he used to go about quite freely,'' Perera said.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, mobs began attacking homes in Ratmalana
belonging to minority Tamils, a government official said on
condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   Perera said Gooneratne was very close to his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would be so angry and upset they would want to retaliate
at anyone,'' Perera said. ''They cannot capture the Tiger. So they
say these Tamil people are the nearest thing to a Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The government imposed a curfew on the bombed neighborhood and
two adjacent suburbs and barred journalists from the area. The
army's rapid deployment force surrounded a low-cost housing area in
the neighborhood and searched for suspects, a member of the force
told The AP.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor said the bomber had hopped out of a taxi and greeted
the minister before detonating the bomb in an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   G.A. Yohan, another survivor who had an injured arm and was
having trouble hearing, said: ''I was walking beside the minister's
entourage when the explosion took place. All I remember is falling
on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the bomber's severed head and limbs were scattered
around a traffic island.
</P>
<P>
   Police dragged one man from the scene. Later, officers said he
was being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have assassinated several high-ranking
politicians, including President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993 and
former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. The Tamil Tigers
denied they killed Gandhi and have never commented on Premadasa's
death.
</P>
<P>
   President Kumaratunga was blinded in the right eye when a woman
suicide bomber tried to assassinate her in December. Gooneratne was
the first member of Kumaratunga's government assassinated.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani reaches out ... tentatively  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - When he quit the U.S. Senate race last month,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani pledged to make an effort to reach out to
communities that complained about being overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has met with a handful of elected officials
largely ignored in the past, but has yet to visit neighborhoods
like Harlem and the South Bronx that feel particularly neglected.
</P>
<P>
   And because Giuliani has made similar promises before, his
resolve has been greeted with skepticism in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has had chats with people before, and afterward, there was
a deterioration in those relationships,'' said the Rev. Calvin
Butts, pastor of the influential Abyssinian Baptist Church in
Harlem and a frequent critic of the mayor. ''He's got to go out to
the communities, and even then, there will always be the question
of whether it is sincere or being done for political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has acknowledged that he is unsure of how to begin
healing the divide between City Hall and large segments of the
city's black and Latino communities.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent remarks, he is clearly feeling his way for a path
that is at once conciliatory, but does not betray his core beliefs
or alienate his largely white political base.
</P>
<P>
   During a television interview last month, the mayor acknowledged
his indecision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know. I don't know,'' he said about reaching out.
''There are people that feel that I don't take them into equal
consideration. And I always tried to deal with that with objective
facts, I always tried to deal with that by showing, 'Well, you
know, how can you say that? I've done as much for you as I have for
anyone else. I've done more in some cases.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''But maybe there's a different form of communication that I
have to learn,'' he added. ''I have to make people get to see the
real me, what I'm trying to do, what I'm trying to accomplish, and
break down some of the barriers that I've created.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's critics say he first must institute a series of
reforms, including civilian oversight of the police department and
greater attention to health care and housing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously it's not enough just to meet with elected
officials,'' said former Mayor David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   One meeting the mayor has not yet held is with the family of
Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed black man gunned down by police in
March. After the shooting, Giuliani released Dorismond's juvenile
record and suggested the victim had caused his own death.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani has steadfastly refused to offer the family his
condolences, he acknowledged last month that he should have tried
to be more ''human'' in his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose again this week after Gov. George Pataki
apologized to the Dorismonds for their loss - an action the mayor
has said he will not take for now because the Dorismond family
wants attorney Johnnie Cochran, who is representing the family in
its $100 million civil claim against the city, to be present during
a meeting with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor was looking for a heart-to-heart, not something with
lawyers,'' said Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, during the past two weeks, Giuliani has met with
Comptroller Alan Hevesi and Public Advocate Mark Green and has a
meeting scheduled Thursday with Manhattan Borough President C.
Virginia Fields, the city's highest-ranking black elected office
holder.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's meeting with Green, the city's second-ranking
elected official, was the first in four years. It lasted about five
minutes. And though the two have traded verbal firebombs for years,
Green said the meeting was cordial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed to have a better relationship on the issues we agree
on,'' said Green, who said topics included high technology and
health policy.
</P>
<P>
   Green remains unconvinced that the mayor is committed to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this is an era of new feeling but 99 percent of the
time he's had a government by enemies list and has treated any good
faith criticism as a beast to be eliminated. And that hurt the
city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani met with Bronx Borough President Fernando
Ferrer - for just the second time since Giuliani was elected in
1993 and for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the hour-long meeting was too little, too late, Ferrer
responded, ''It's never too late, its never too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts however, is of a different mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, I think it's best, as they say in the black church, to
turn him over to the Lord,'' said Butts.
</P>
<P>
   Translation? ''I'm through with him.''

<HEADLINE> Whitman touts water restrictions aimed at suburban sprawl  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, N.J. (AP) - Two days after new regulations limiting
sewers were released, Gov. Christie Whitman promised they would
curb suburban sprawl and help clean the state's polluted waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman on Wednesday came to the Delaware and Raritan Canal
State Park to promote 400 pages of rules linking sewer system
expansion to the state development plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not no-growth. It is directing growth to areas where we
can sustain that growth,'' Whitman said, her back to the
swift-moving river.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not barring development. We are redirecting
development,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the state's lakes, rivers, creeks and streams must
be protected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be willing to act when the quality and quantity of
that resource is threatened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules treat areas of the state differently, with new
requirements for builders looking to get sewer permits in less
developed areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Environmental Protection regulations would
require builders to perform a ''comprehensive'' environmental
assessment of the surrounding water before any new sewer permits
are issued.
</P>
<P>
   Developments of six or more homes using septic systems would
also be required to do that same assessment, as would commercial
developments on larger septic systems.
</P>
<P>
   In urban and heavily suburban areas, builders would be given
more leeway since sewers and roads are already in place to handle
new development.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rules also make it more likely that existing open space
will remain open space,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier environmental efforts targeted major sources of
pollution, Whitman said. Now the task is to reduce groundwater
pollution from fertilizers, motor oil, dirt and other substances
that wash into local streams, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Development not only taxes the ability of an ecosystem to handle
wastewater, more pavement means less area for runoff to drain,
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would also require a water cleanup plan for each of
the state's 20 watershed management districts, land areas that
drain into a common river or other waterway. Local officials,
environmental groups, sewer plant operators, builders and others
would join in drafting that plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to suffer the consequences of people changing their
oil in their cars and not dealing with it effectively,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we are in the state where people have to be part of the
process,'' Whitman said. ''Can it be done? It has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the proposal has no statutory power.
Loopholes allow too much of the state's open space to be developed
and millions of gallons of sewer capacity are still allowed in
unused permits, some environmentalists charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Again we have what sound like good rules. But when you read
the rules you find loopholes big enough to drive a subdivision
through,'' said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of
the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, state Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco,
R-Union, and other Republican lawmakers called on the DEP to keep
sewer system operators off the community boards called to clean the
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they understood there might be problems, but the
fact that the Whitman administration has tried something is
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're saying now is nobody ever tried to do this before.
This is a big step forward,'' said Barbara Lawrence, of NJ Future,
a citizen's group overseeing the state development plan.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe: We'll Release Cubans  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Two Cuban doctors seeking political
asylum say armed Zimbabwean security agents and Cuban diplomats
abducted them in the middle of the night in an attempt to force
them back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The two were taken to neighboring South Africa on Friday and
later that day were about to be put on a connecting flight to Cuba
when they yelled for help and slipped a desperate note to airline
employees, saying they had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The airline refused to transport the two, and Drs. Noris Pena
Martinez, 25, and Leonel Cordova Rodriguez, 31, were returned to
Zimbabwe, South African police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After repeatedly denying knowledge of the physicians'
whereabouts, the Zimbabwe government said Wednesday there had been
an attempt to deport the Cubans. It promised to release them and
allow the doctors to seek asylum, said Kris Janowski of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. refugee official, who was allowed to visit the two
Wednesday at a detention center outside Harare, reported they were
in good health, Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has long maintained close cultural and ideological ties
with Cuba, and President Robert Mugabe, once a leading Marxist,
counts Cuban President Fidel Castro among his closest political
allies.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana on Wednesday, the wife of Rodriguez, Rosalba Gonzalez,
said she was not surprised by her husband's defection attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always wanted to leave Cuba so he could live better,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said she has been overcome with worry since learning of
her husband's dramatic efforts to prevent being deported home to
the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I'm going to die.... I am worried for him. I don't
know what is going to happen,'' said Gonzalez, sitting in a chair
in her living room next to the couple's 3-year-old daughter
Giselle.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have to stay here, I can, I don't really care,'' the
33-year-old said. ''As long as he can resolve things and stay there
in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Martinez were among a group of 152 Cuban doctors
and medical workers sent to assist Zimbabwe's health service in
recent weeks under a Cuban ''doctor diplomacy'' program.
</P>
<P>
   They sought asylum two weeks ago at the Canadian diplomatic
mission in Harare. Diplomats there referred them to the U.N.
refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   But they were detained and forced out of the country before
their scheduled asylum interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fears for their safety emerged after copies of their note,
written on three pages torn from a South African police notebook,
were faxed to the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva and reached Cuban-
American lobbyists in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors wrote in broken English that they believed they were
under the protection of the U.N. agency when two Zimbabwean
security officers raided the house where they were staying just
after 4 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are traveling kidnapped to Cuba,'' read the note, a copy of
which was obtained by The Associated Press. ''Please, we are very
concerned about our lifes, and the well being of our family in
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman George Charamba said the two were seized
after they left a refugee holding center to stay with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow this country to be used as a stepping stone
for people seeking asylum in another country,'' Charamba said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency protested the handling of the case to
Zimbabwean authorities, said Oluseyi Bajulaiye, the agency's chief
regional representative.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the doctors did not know they were forbidden to
leave the refugee center, and Zimbabwe's attempt to deport them
violated the country's refugee laws as well as international law,
Bajulaiye said.
</P>
<P>
   In their note, the doctors said Cuba's ambassador to Zimbabwe,
Rodolfo Saracino, a second embassy official and the head of the
Cuban medical mission in Zimbabwe had prevented them from
contacting the U.N. refugee agency after they were seized. The
three Cuban officials were at the Harare airport when the doctors
were escorted onto the flight to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, with one of the world's highest ratios of doctors, has
sent medical staff to several developing countries, including South
Africa, where Martinez' father is reportedly working. Hundreds of
Zimbabwean physicians have been trained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Martinez said they were prevented from traveling
outside Cuba until they were assigned to the medical mission.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Health Plans 'Average'  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans generally give their health
insurance plans good marks, even though about half report problems
ranging from minor billing difficulties to being denied treatment,
a new survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   More people in managed care plans with lots of restrictions
reported problems than people with traditional health insurance,
according to a survey of 2,500 people released Wednesday by the
Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as Congress decides whether to pass legislation
giving patients a stronger hand in dealing with health plans and
managed care organizations. The Senate was expected to debate a
patients' bill of rights on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of people in the study rated their health
plans as average or better and over 80 percent said dealing with
their plans had been positive.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent gave their plan a ''poor'' or ''failing'' grade
and 15 percent said dealings with the plans had been negative.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggested that people in managed care plans with lots
of restrictions were less upbeat about their insurers than those in
traditional fee-for-service health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four percent of people in plans that charged more for
using outside doctors, required referrals for specialists and made
beneficiaries choose primary care physicians gave their insurers a
''C'' or less. Fifty-three percent gave them an ''A'' or ''B.''
</P>
<P>
   That compared with 74 percent of people with traditional
insurance who gave their plans an ''A'' or ''B.'' About 24 percent
rated traditional insurers as average or lower.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to encountering problems with health plans, people
in strict managed care plans reported more difficulties, with 62
percent saying they had a problem within the past year, compared to
49 percent in less strict managed care plans and 32 percent in
traditional plans.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the
survey shows that the debate over patients' rights is ''grounded in
real patient experiences, not just anecdotes,'' but noted that many
problems are ''more hassle than horror story.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignani, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, an HMO trade group, said the survey's findings were welcome
''because they offer health plans valuable information that they
can use in identifying areas that need further attention.''

<HEADLINE> Attorney: Second man to plead guilty in killing of rabbi's wife  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Because he wants to ensure that ''the truth
comes out,'' the second of two men who say they were hired by a
Cherry Hill rabbi to kill his wife will plead guilty Thursday, his
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul M. Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken, will admit to the Nov. 1,
1994, killing of Carol Neulander, Daniels' lawyer, Craig Mitnick,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels will plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter and
robbery, Mitnick said. His alleged accomplice, Leonard Jenoff,
pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in his best interest to do this,'' Mitnick said, adding
that his client already has confessed to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick said Daniels wants to take responsibility for his part
in the killing, but also ''wants to make sure the rabbi takes
responsibility for what he believes the rabbi's role in this was.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to make sure the truth comes out,'' Mitnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, admitted in court last week that he
hit Carol Neulander in the back of the head with a lead pipe in her
Cherry Hill home. He has said the Rabbi Fred Neulander agreed to
pay $30,000 for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Camden County Assistant Prosecutor James P. Lynch has said
Daniels was ''the primary actor in striking the blows.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitnick said Daniels, ''a paranoid schizophrenic and a very
weak human being,'' was coerced into taking part in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was manipulated by both Jenoff and the rabbi - Jenoff,
directly, and the rabbi, indirectly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 58, who founded Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue
with his wife in 1974, allegedly wanted her killed so he could
continue having an affair with Philadelphia radio personality
Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   He believed a divorce would jeopardize his position as senior
rabbi at the synagogue. He resigned three months after the killing,
however, after reports surfaced about two extramarital affairs he'd
allegedly had with members of his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, who was charged in the killing in 1998, maintains his
innocence. He faces charges of accomplice murder and conspiracy to
commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels was to appear before Superior Court Judge Linda
Rosenzweig Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for Neulander's trial.

<HEADLINE> House Boosts Utah Preservation Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill aimed at preserving Utah territory made
famous as a hide-out for outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
grew stronger Wednesday as House Democrats pushed through an
amendment expanding the area.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would create a 1.3 million national conservation
area in the San Rafael Swell, a dramatic sandstone uplift 35 miles
wide and 85 miles long in the desert of southeastern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the original measure did not go far enough to
restrict off-road vehicle use and could have undermined wilderness
protection for the entire area.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats won approval of an amendment enlarging the
conservation area from under 1 million acres to nearly 1.3 million
acres. The measure also would ban mining in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The House did not immediately vote on the measure after
approving the amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the original measure, including Utah's Republican
congressional delegation and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, say
it was a compromise to protect a natural jewel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members are hearing from the extreme environmental groups that
this is anti-wilderness legislation or some other untruths like
that,'' said Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah. ''Apparently some of these
extremist groups would rather raise money than protect land.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents included the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and the
Sierra Club, which sent e-mails to members asking them to urge
their representatives to kill the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill is anti-wilderness because it would continue the
abuse of this land, and its arbitrary boundaries would divide or
exclude some wilderness-quality areas,'' said Rep. Maurice Hinchey,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has not designated any of the area as
wilderness, the Bureau of Land Management manages about half of the
proposed conservation area under wilderness guidelines, said Rep.
Mark Udall, D-Colo. Those rules ban nearly all activity other than
hiking or horseback riding, including mining, vehicle or bicycle
use or building any structures.
</P>
<P>
   The House agreed -- by a one-vote margin, 212-211 -- to require
the BLM to manage the land at least as restrictively as it does
now.
</P>
<P>
   The swell, a kidney-shaped bulge on what used to be an ocean
floor, is so rugged and remote that Cassidy and his infamous Hole
in the Wall gang used it as a hide-out after robbing miners in the
late 1800s. The desert in and around the swell has become a popular
area for off-road vehicle users as well as hikers, kayakers and
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a national conservation area to preserve
the swell and adjoining areas called Factory Butte and Muddy Creek.
It also would declare 2.8 million-acre Emery County, which
encompasses most of the swell, as a ''Western legacy district.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would provide up to $1 million a year for a decade
in federal money to help promote tourism and protect historic sites
in the county.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give the BLM four years to develop a management
plan for the conservation area, which opponents say gives off-road
vehicle users time to wear new trails into the land and further
damage it. The management plan would have to be developed with
input from local officials, off-road and other recreational users,
environmentalists and the general public.

<HEADLINE> Court papers show prosecutors leaning on Brooklyn terrorism suspect </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Prosecutors tried to compel an Algerian arrested
in Brooklyn to cooperate against his alleged co-conspirators in a
plot to sneak explosives from Canada into the United States, court
papers released by prosecutors Wednesday show.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers detailing the case against Abdel Ghani Meskini were
released by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White after they were filed in
Montreal in an effort to extradite Mokhtar Haouari for a trial in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A message left with a lawyer for Meskini was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, an Algerian, is accused of playing a central role in a
terrorism plot that resulted in the December capture of Ahmed
Ressam, another Algerian, as he crossed the border from Canada into
Port Angeles, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   An inspection of Ressam's car after it rolled off a ferry boat
revealed explosives and timing devices with Ressam's fingerprints
on them hidden beneath a mat covering the vehicle's spare tire
well, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A slip of paper found on Ressam contained Meskini's telephone
numbers, leading authorities to his Brooklyn residence, where they
arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   After the arrest, Meskini provided investigators an extensive
statement corroborated by other evidence in the case, including
telephone records, the government said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Meskini has not agreed to be a witness against Haouari,
that does not preclude the use of Meskini's statement against
Haouari,'' prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The government said in the court papers that it was prepared to
try to force Meskini to testify against Haouari, even offering him
limited immunity so that his testimony would not be used against
him at his own trial.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that Meskini after his arrest had tried to make several
consensually recorded telephone calls to Haouari at the direction
of arresting officers but had been unsuccessful at getting a
response.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, someone picked up the telephone, telling Meskini
that Haouari was not at home and that he should not call again
because the phone was tapped, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, 32, has pleaded innocent to nine charges including
possessing and transporting explosives with the intent to cause
damage or injury.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari and Meskini are accused of conspiring since October 1997
to support members and associates of a terrorist group. They are
also accused of conspiring to transfer fake or stolen U.S.
immigration identity cards and passports of other countries and of
using fake credit and bank cards.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 77; Nasdaq Is Up 83  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks closed higher Wednesday after
a Goldman Sachs analyst predicted IBM would have a strong year. The
rosy prospects for IBM helped pull investors off the sidelines,
where they had been fitfully awaiting a judge's ruling on
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stocks came on very strongly once they found a catalyst,''
said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter
Ltd. in New York. ''It wasn't anything terribly dramatic, but
there's a lot of money on the sidelines, and a fervent desire to
get it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.29 to 10,812.86, while
the Nasdaq composite index rose 82.89 to 3,839.26. Both indexes
recovered from early declines.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also higher; the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 13.52 to 1,471.36.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market seems to be on the path of least resistance, and
that is to the upside,'' said Bleier, noting that investors are
continuing to buy stocks even after solid gains last week that
could have set up a big bout of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks continued a steady recovery from their swoon in
March and April, led by IBM, which rose $8.875 to $121.25.
Well-known Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro said orders were
strong in the past two months, and she said investors may be
undervaluing the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology companies also fared better. Microstrategy, a
software maker that has struggled since admitting it would have to
restate earnings for the past few years, rose $9.625 to $37.625 as
investors anticipated that the company may soon receive financing
from an outside source.
</P>
<P>
   And biotechnology stocks continued their most winning streak.
Immunex rose $4.204 to $36.313 after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration expanded its approval of the company's Enbrel
rheumatoid arthritis drug to more patients.
</P>
<P>
   The good news from a diverse range of technology companies
helped distract investors from their concerns over Microsoft. After
the close of trading, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
issued his order to split the computer software company into two
separate businesses. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates vowed to appeal
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 87.5 cents to $70.50 during the regular session,
then rose to $72 per share after the decision was released.
</P>
<P>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines rose $2.25 to $28.75. KLM and British
Airways confirmed they have begun talks that could lead to a
merger. An alliance would create the world's third-largest airline,
behind United Airlines and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways edged up 37.5 cents to $59.938.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, trading was quiet. Analysts said interest rate
worries, which eased last week amid a slew of reports that signaled
a modest economic slowdown, haven't truly left the market. Many
investors are waiting for more information as they try to discern
whether the Fed may finally be finished raising interest rates to
cool the pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said the Fed
may have to force U.S. economic growth to a more substantial
slowdown. But he said he believes the slowdown can take place
without derailing the economy's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several considerations provide optimism that the outcome will
be a benign one -- a soft landing as opposed to a hard landing,''
Meyer told the Boston Economics Club.
</P>
<P>
   The next crucial piece of data for Fed economists and investors
will be the Producer Price Index, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.02
billion shares, compared with 1.13 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.89 to 516.54.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.1 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 0.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.4 percent lower.

   Gorbachev, who presided over the breakup of the Soviet Union,
suffered only a scraped knee in the accident, said lifeguard Carlos
Segura Roman.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev and a companion were drawn out by the current while
swimming Sunday at Costa Rica's Puerto Viejo de Limon beach, 125
miles southeast of San Jose, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''An ocean current began taking them out to sea, toward an area
where there are rocks and coral reefs,'' said Segura Roman.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't in danger of drowning, but they were at risk of
getting banged up,'' said the lifeguard, who towed the pair back to
shore with a flotation device.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev's swimming companion wasn't identified. He was
accompanied to the beach by his daughter, Irene, and his
granddaughter, Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   The former leader was in Costa Rica to give a speech at a
private university and left the country on Monday. The Russian
consulate in San Jose said it had no additional information.

<HEADLINE> McCain Still Presses Finance Reform  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, who sought the White House
on a platform of campaign finance reform, pressed the Senate on
Wednesday to require a secretive new generation of political groups
to disclose their donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is (a) dark, uncontrolled sector of the political
landscape,'' McCain, R-Ariz., said in remarks on the Senate floor.
''It a danger to our electoral system.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, nonprofit groups that engage in
campaign-style activity would be required to disclose both their
donors and their expenditures. Currently, there is no disclosure
requirement on these groups, nor are there limits on the donations
they can accept.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's proposal came in the form of an amendment to an
unrelated bill that deals with the military, and a vote was set for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time since his White House campaign ended
that the Arizona Republican brought his signature issue to the
floor of the Senate, although he did so in a far more modest form
than previous comprehensive proposals that included a ban on
so-called soft-money.
</P>
<P>
   Those earlier efforts have ended in gridlock, with McCain and
his allies, principally Democrats, unable to gain the 60 votes
needed to overcome a filibuster backed by the GOP leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, McCain cited comments made in the past by
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, and other critics to the effect
that disclosure that they favor disclosure of political donations,
as a means of guarding against scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was designed to force disclosure on so-called 527s
-- groups named after section 527 of the tax code -- created in 1974
for political groups to enjoy certain tax advantages without
publicly disclosing anything about themselves. These groups fall
outside the purview of federal election law by declaring that they
engage in issues, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   To operate legally, they cannot coordinate their activities with
candidates who benefit from their ads, and all sides insist there
is no communication between them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they are beginning to play an increasingly
prominent role in politics. One group ran ads favorable to Texas
Gov. George W. Bush at a time when McCain was still challenging for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Democrats have filed a lawsuit against the GOP
whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, alleging that he illegally oversees
the operation of several 527s.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attempt to inject campaign finance issues into the
defense bill was seconded by Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who
said the two men would soon propose a separate amendment to ban
so-called soft money.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democrats led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., indicated they would seek a vote on Thursday on yet
another issue unrelated to the military -- a proposal to strengthen
the hand of patients dealing with their HMOs.

<HEADLINE> GOP Accuses HUD of Wasteful Spending  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans moved Wednesday to cut $2.5
billion from President Clinton's proposed budget next year for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the agency of
wasting nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee approved a $30 billion budget
next year for HUD, $2.5 billion less than Clinton sought. The
action was taken on a broad $101 billion spending bill that also
would fund the Department of Veterans Affairs, NASA and other
agencies. The full House could take up the bill as early as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not tolerate having Americans' hard-earned money
frittered away on ineffective policies and mismanaged projects,''
Rep. Mark Green, R-Wis., said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said that when
Republicans were insisting on budget cuts a year ago, ''We heard
from all of these agencies, 'Oh we can't afford that. That's
squeezing our turnip too tight. There's not enough blood left.' Yet
we found these examples of this waste and inefficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to congressional leaders, White House budget chief
Jack Lew warned that administration officials would urge Clinton to
veto the bill. He cited its reductions from the president's
proposals for housing, the environment, space and science, as well
as its proposed elimination of the Americorps community service
program, a Clinton favorite.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the cuts were ''an attack on the
poorest and most vulnerable families in America,'' saying they
would eliminate plans to provide 120,000 poor families with new
rental assistance vouchers and $30 million for reclaiming polluted
urban ''brownfields.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., a leading Republican on housing issues
who is also running against Hillary Rodham Clinton for a Senate
seat, said in a statement: ''We continue to be presented with
evidence that shows ... taxpayer dollars being wasted by HUD.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are simply raising questions with an agency that
consistently fails to manage itself in a manner that taxpayers
deserve,'' said Lazio, who chairs a banking subcommittee on
housing.
</P>
<P>
   HUD has long been a favorite target of suspicion by some
Republicans in Congress, who see it as an example of big, inept and
wasteful government. Several years ago, HUD was labeled
''high-risk'' by auditors at the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's allegations consisted mostly of details released in
earlier congressional hearings or reports by HUD's inspector
general.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was an inspector general's report last year which
found $935 million in subsidy overpayments in HUD's assisted living
programs. Another report found ''little if any'' measurable
evidence that $8.5 million spent on HUD's new ''storefront
operations'' has benefited HUD customers.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Denies bin Laden Link  </HEADLINE>
By SHAFIKA MATTAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- The leading defendant in a terrorism trial
told the court Wednesday he had no links to the Saudi militant
Osama bin Laden and that police had obtained his confession through
torture.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the defense case, Khader Abu Hosher, 36, told the State
Security Court his interrogators had hung him upside down and
beaten him severely.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hosher is the alleged leader of 28 men on trial in the State
Security Court for belonging to an outlawed group that conspired to
carry out terrorist attacks on American and Israeli tourists in
Jordan. They are also charged with illegal possession of explosives
and firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the accused are in police custody. The remaining 12
are outside Jordan and are being tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   All 28 are suspected of having links with bin Laden, a
Saudi-born millionaire who is wanted in the United States for
allegedly plotting the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. The bombings claimed 244 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment sheet does not identify the outlawed group, but
the military prosecutor, Lt. Col. Mahmoud Obeidat, has told
reporters the suspects were linked to al-Qaeda -- or ''the base'' --
a terrorist organization allegedly led by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Obeidat and other officials say the accused planned to attack
U.S. and Israeli tourists during New Year's celebrations at Mount
Nebo -- where tradition says Moses saw the Promised Land -- and a
Christian settlement along the Jordan River said to be the site
where Jesus was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never seen or met Osama bin Laden,'' Abu Hosher told
the court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ten other defendants also read out statements to the court,
denying the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was adjourned until June 15.

<HEADLINE> Federal regulators allow to psychiatric hospital remain open  </HEADLINE>
ngfonflspr
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Conn. (AP) - Citing improving conditions, federal
regulators on Wednesday decided not to cut off funding to a
psychiatric hospital where two patients died in less than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Health Care Financing Administration ''rescinded the
termination track'' of St. Francis Care Behavioral Health hospital,
said David Banks, special assistant to the regional director of
HCFA.
</P>
<P>
   The ''termination track'' could have led the loss of Medicare
and Medicaid funding. St. Francis Care , formerly Elmcrest
Hospital, was placed on the termination list following the January
death of a 30-year-old female patient.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Beninato died after being overmedicated. She had taken a
mix of 12 different tranquilizers, anti-anxiety drugs and muscle
relaxers.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators found hospital workers failed to develop an
adequate treatment plan for Beninato and then failed to properly
monitor her condition.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Benianto's death, St. Francis Care announced that
it had fired two top-ranking hospital administrators, made other
administrative changes and submitted a plan of correction to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis also agreed to a state consent decree calling for
the oversight of an independent monitor. As part of that decree,
St. Francis agreed to pay $125,000 to a state drug abuse prevention
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate the fact that the Health Care Financing
Administration has recognized the considerable strides that have
been made and our commitment to providing high quality,
compassionate behavioral health services while ensuring the safety
and well-being of the patients entrusted to our care,'' said Dr.
Edward S. Johnson, a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA will also be permitted to inspect the hospital at any time
during the next year, Banks said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is similar to a consent decree signed by St.
Francis and state regulators two years ago. That agreement was
reached after Andrew McClain, an 11-year-old state foster child,
died of suffocation after a mental health aide put him in a
restraint hold.

<HEADLINE> Comets 81, Mystics 54  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cynthia Cooper scored 20 points and blew open
the game single-handedly by scoring nine in a row at the end of the
first half as the Houston Comets rolled past the Washington Mystics
81-54 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper strolled down the lane for back-to-back layups, converted
a steal into a fast-break layup and hit a 3-pointer in a 16-2
half-ending run that put the Comets (5-1) up 39-24. The Mystics
(2-2) didn't get close again as they fell to 0-6 lifetime against
the three-time WNBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper finished 8-for-12 from the field. Sheryl Swoopes also had
20 points for the Comets, making 10 of 15 shots. Tina Thompson
added 17 points and went 3-of-4 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw led the Mystics with 16 points, but she made
just seven of 17 shots after entering the game with a 57 percent
field goal percentage on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had been shooting 52 percent as a team, but managed
just 39 percent against the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the Mystics' star tandem, Nikki McCray, didn't
fare any better, making just two of 10 shots, including 1 of 7
3-pointers, and finished with five points. Point guard Andrea Nagy,
whose eight assists per game led the league going into the game,
had only three assists and four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shot 59 percent, including 58 percent from 3-point
range.

<HEADLINE> Former CBS news executive Blair Clark dies in Princeton  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Blair Clark, a former CBS news executive
who also managed Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign, died
Tuesday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   He died at Princeton Medical Center after complications from
colon surgery, according to his son Timothy Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Easthampton, N.Y., Clark was raised in Princeton, heir
to the Clark Thread fortune. His father, William, was a federal
judge in Newark and a friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Like Roosevelt, Clark considered himself a traitor to his class,
his son said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came from a conservative background, but through his own
force of intellect he became a true liberal,'' Timothy Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was close friends with the late poet Robert Lowell, a prep
school friend who dedicated a book to him, and President John F.
Kennedy, a Harvard University classmate.
</P>
<P>
   While at Harvard, Clark served as editor of the Harvard Crimson
and enlisted Kennedy to work on the college paper, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark began his career in journalism as a reporter for the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, then spent five years in the U.S. Army during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he took $60,000 he inherited from his grandmother and
founded The New Hampshire Sunday News. His star reporter was Ben
Bradlee, who is now vice president of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really bright and thoughtful,'' Bradlee said. ''He
thought about the role of newspapers, the role of television. He
played an important role by being good at what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark worked for the Boston Herald and Traveler before joining
CBS News as a foreign correspondent in Paris in 1953. He came
stateside in 1956 to cover the presidential campaign and then
anchor ''The World Tonight'' for CBS Radio Network.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Kennedy offered to make Clark ambassador to Morocco,
but he became vice president and general manager of CBS News
instead, according to Kaiser's book.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark was in that position, CBS hired reporters Mike
Wallace, Morley Safer and Dan Rather. The news broadcast was
expanded from 15 minutes to a half hour - a first for network
television. In addition, Walter Cronkite was appointed to succeed
Douglas Edwards as anchor of ''The Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a time when television news was being invented. There
was a lot of disagreement within the hierarchy about how the job
should be done,'' Cronkite said, adding that professional
disagreements with Clark never interfered with their longtime
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blair brought a high sense of news integrity to the news
business. He made some people uncomfortable - those who were
inclined to sensationalize,'' Cronkite said.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as associate publisher of the New York Post, Clark
became the campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate
Eugene McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's role in the campaign was part of Charles Kaiser's book
''1968 in America'', which focused on McCarthy's presidential bid
and the anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   Clark worked as a freelance writer from 1969-75. He was the
editor of The Nation magazine from 1976-78. He also conducted a
seminar on the press and politics at Princeton University in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said Clark never lost
his zeal. Three weeks ago, Clark proposed that Moynihan help him
preserve the Manhattan townhouse that once belonged to Roosevelt by
endowing it to Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blair Clark was a member of that great generation of American
journalists who saw the onset of the Cold War and reported it for a
generation,'' said Moynihan. ''He was a man of perfect honor and
beautiful character.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark had two sons, Timothy and Cameron, with the late Jessie
Holladay Philbin. The couple divorced in 1960. Cameron died in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Timothy, Clark is survived by his second wife, Joanna
Rostropowicz, their son, Ian Clark, and a stepson, Tomasz
Malinowski; a sister, Anne Martindell; and a brother, William
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Wednesday. Kimble Funeral
Home of Princeton is handling the arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Cuts OKd for Next President  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to
prohibit President Clinton from making deep unilateral cuts in the
nation's nuclear arsenal, but agreed to ease that prohibition for
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   With Senate Democrats crying foul, the Senate voted 51-47 --
largely along party lines -- to reject an effort to lift the
five-year old prohibition completely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Senate went along with a proposal by Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., to allow the
president to make such warhead cuts only after a Pentagon review
every four years.
</P>
<P>
   That review is not set to be done until December 2001, after
Clinton has left office.
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes as U.S.-Russian efforts to negotiate further
warhead reductions are tangled in a related dispute over U.S. plans
for a national anti-missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
contender, has said that if elected, he would reduce the U.S.
arsenal to its ''lowest possible number'' and suggested he would do
so whether Russia agreed with the reductions or not.
</P>
<P>
   But current law -- first passed in 1995 and renewed each year
since then -- prohibits the president from reducing nuclear warheads
below the 6,000 level called for in the Reagan-Gorbachev era START
I treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both Russia and the United States have more nuclear weapons
than we need. This has been studied to death. Governor Bush has it
right,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who led the unsuccessful
effort to lift the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said the prohibition ''was put in here as a consequence
of not trusting this particular president.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as the Senate worked on a $309.8 billion defense
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In other action on the bill, the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   --Voted 96-1 to allow military retirees 65 years and older to
continue to participate in the Defense Department's free health
care plans. Now, these retirees must switch to Medicare when they
turn 65; there are 1.8 million military retirees. Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., voted no. Not voting were Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   --The Senate also adopted, by voice vote, a proposal to allow
disabled retirees to collect full disability compensation without
waiving a portion of their retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   --Rejected 63-35 an effort to force two new rounds of military
base closings.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the House approved a $288.5 billion Pentagon
spending bill for next year by 367-58. The measure would outspend
Clinton's fiscal 2001 request by $4 billion and is $22.4 billion
more than this year's total.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes money for a 3.7 percent military pay raise. It
also has $4.6 billion for continued development of a national
missile defense system and $4 billion for buying 10 F-22 fighters
and continued development of the radar-evading aircraft, the
world's most expensive fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The START II agreement, ratified by the Senate in 1996 and
conditionally ratified last month by Russia, would reduce the U.S.
missile arsenals from 7,200 to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads by
2007.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions added by the Russian Duma have been criticized by
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and other congressional conservatives. START II reductions have not
taken place. Russia has 6,000 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia are now negotiating a START III
treaty that would cut warheads even further, to 2,000 to 2,500.
Russia has proposed going as low as 1,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an effort to hobble the president,'' said Sen. Carl
Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services
Committee. ''I do not believe it would be offered if the president
were of another party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., also a member of that panel,
said: ''The ultimate goal is to have a careful ... review and make
sure we do not unilaterally disarm this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the next president should be given increased
flexibility to reduce nuclear arsenals, suggesting Clinton had come
back empty-handed from last weekend's summit meeting in Moscow with
Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Coalition to Reduce
Nuclear Dangers, said the Senate had left in place another
restriction, one denying funds for any presidential reduction in
the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of being
launched within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his May 23 speech on national security, had proposed
doing just that, saying he wanted to remove some missiles from
''hair-trigger status.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican-led Congress is desperately trying to find a
way to stop additional reductions -- even opposing reductions that
George Bush said he would support,'' Kimball said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tunnel Found Linking Gaza, Egypt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian security forces on
Wednesday unearthed a tunnel between Egypt and the Gaza Strip
apparently used to smuggle goods into Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Zanoon, the Palestinian security chief in charge of the
Rafah area where the tunnel was found, said five suspects have been
arrested. Police were to close the 150-yard-long, 9-yard-deep
tunnel later Wednesday, which Zanoon said was used to smuggle
Egyptian food and other products into Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says such tunnels are used by militants to smuggle
weapons into the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Zanoon said he reported the discovery to an Israeli liaison
committee, noting it was the 26th such tunnel uncovered by
Palestinian security in the last two years.

<HEADLINE> Practice Bomb Lands Near SC Factory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMTER, S.C. (AP) -- An F-16 fighter jet released a practice bomb
off target, dropping it just outside a battery factory Wednesday, a
spokesman for the McEntire Air National Guard Base in Eastover
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured when the practice bomb slammed into the
ground in an open field near the Yuasa Corp. plant south of Sumter.
The bomb carried the explosive charge of a shotgun shell and smoked
to indicate where it landed.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 was supposed to drop it during a training run near the
Manchester State Forest about 10 miles away, said Maj. Les Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just what we call an inadvertent release,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said military officials had ruled out pilot error, but
were still trying to figure out why the practice bomb fell off
target.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Says He May Quit Baseball  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker might not go to the minor leagues.
He's even considering whether to walk away from baseball
altogether. And how would he make a living?
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be a stockbroker, probably,'' the outspoken reliever
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments since being sent to Triple-A
Richmond, Rocker told radio station WKLS-FM that he's upset about
the way he was treated by the Atlanta Braves. He also said he never
threatened Sports Illustrated reporter Jeff Pearlman, who wrote the
story exposing Rocker's offensive comments against gays, minorities
and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves fined Rocker $5,000 for inappropriate conduct and
said he was sent to the minors to work on his control.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'm even going down or not,'' Rocker said
during a 30-minute appearance on ''The Regular Guys'' morning show.
''I'm still pretty chapped about the whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves downplayed Rocker's comments, saying he was just
frustrated. Manager Bobby Cox said the pitcher even stopped by
Turner Field on Wednesday to pick up his gear.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to report,'' said Cox, who didn't get a chance to
speak with Rocker. ''Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   A baseball source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Rocker's advisors have told him to report to the minors. But it was
unclear if Rocker planned to follow their advice, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Several players reacted with amusement when told that Rocker was
considering a new career path. Outfielder Brian Jordan, who called
Rocker a ''cancer'' after Sunday's confrontation with Pearlman,
smiled in disbelief and held his hands over his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unbelievable,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Kerry Ligtenberg added, ''I knew he was interested in
that, but I don't know if he's qualified. I don't think you can
just become a stockbroker. Maybe he could be a day trader.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who has not spoken with reporters since his demotion,
has made regular appearances on WKLS, known in Atlanta as ''96
Rock,'' since joining the Braves in 1998. Last month, the station
arranged a meeting with Andrew Tellers, the 24-year-old California
man who mooned Rocker during a game at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was originally scheduled to be on the morning show Monday
but backed out after the confrontation with Pearlman, said
Christopher Calandro, the show's executive producer. The pitcher
called in Wednesday, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been wanting him to come on for a while,'' Calandro
said. ''Then all the stuff happened with Pearlman. He was committed
to do the show, so we were the benefactor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves last year but has 25 walks in 18 1-3
innings this season, said he might quit rather than go to the
minors. He has until Thursday to report to Toledo, Ohio, where
Richmond was playing a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a pretty raw deal of raw deals this time,'' Rocker told
the radio station. ''There's plenty of things I can do besides
dealing with the headaches of this garbage every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked of returning to college to earn his business degree.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something to be said for having a job that is not just
a complete headache,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interview focused on his run-in with Pearlman, which
occurred in a tunnel near the Braves clubhouse a couple of hours
before Sunday's game against the New York Yankees. The reporter was
in Atlanta to do a story on the rematch of last year's World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a minute and a half, I yelled at him,'' Rocker said. ''I
didn't use profanity. I told him what a bad article I thought it
was. ... I told him a lot of stuff he put in the article didn't
need to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he blames Pearlman for causing the public outcry that
followed publication of the remarks in December. Rocker was
suspended for a month and fined $20,000 by commissioner Bud Selig,
but an arbitrator reduced the sanctions to a two-week suspension
and $500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also believes he should get an apology from Pearlman for
''the pain and suffering he caused.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He, of course, put the blame for everything on me,'' the
pitcher said. ''He said he was just doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said the confrontation with Pearlman was blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I scold this guy for a minute and a half and instead of
standing there and taking it like a man, he has to run back and
say, 'John Rocker yelled at me,''' Rocker said. ''Looking back,
maybe I shouldn't have. But the only repercussions that guy got to
face was to get scolded for a minute and a half, instead of being a
man and saying, 'I'm sorry for everything you've been through.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pearlman, Rocker made threats like ''Do you know
what I can do to you?'' and ''This isn't over between us.'' The
pitcher denied making those statements.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said he is tired of dealing with scrutiny from the media
since his infamous interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can only politely decline so many times,'' he said.
''Every second or third question is about that. They don't have any
respect for your wishes. They're trying to stir up a can of
worms.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz said it was understandable for
any player to be upset about getting sent to the minors. He has not
spoken with Rocker but expects him to report to Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fully understand all the feelings he might be experiencing.
I've heard hundreds and thousands of players say it before,''
Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, I've not heard anyone say they're going to be a
stockbroker. But I've heard a lot of things in frustration from a
lot of players.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio attacks HUD, says he and Congress have reformed housing  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio said Wednesday that Congress,
not the Clinton administration's Department of Housing and Urban
Development, has led the charge on housing reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's attack - the second on HUD in two days - came as
Congressional Republicans detailed what they said was fraud and
waste at the agency under Andrew Cuomo, a backer of Lazio's Senate
rival Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials fired back Wednesday, saying Lazio has been
ineffective in his role as chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing.
</P>
<P>
   ''As for Mr. Lazio, he has distinguished himself as the chairman
of the committee that has never enacted housing legislation,'' HUD
spokesman David Egner said. HUD officials said while Lazio has been
successful at attaching his initiatives to spending bills, he has
been unable to get significant legislation passed through his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio never mentioned Cuomo by name but the two New Yorkers have
sparred over housing policy in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Wednesday that ''Congress has been able to able to
enact major housing and community development reform legislation,
oftentimes in spite of opposition from the Clinton-Gore
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are simply raising questions with an agency that
consistently fails to manage itself in a manner that taxpayers
deserve,'' the Republican lawmaker said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp late Wednesday said Egner's assertion was untrue
and pointed, for example, to a bill the congressman helped pass
this year smoothing over obstacles to home ownership and helping
teachers purchase homes in the districts where they work. Egner
countered that the legislation has yet to be passed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio used his attack Wednesday as another opportunity to tout a
laundry list of his own housing initiatives, including a 1998
overhaul of public housing that put in place work requirements for
many tenants as well as his efforts to make affordable housing
available to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Housing was also the focus of a speech Lazio made Tuesday to the
New York Conference of Mayors in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, including House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, on Wednesday said HUD had wasted almost $1 billion even as
the agencies own literature showed that millions of people were
suffering from housing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Egner called the GOP's complaints ''a transparent attempt to
divert attention from the Republican budget cutting knife which
today is poised to carve $2.1 billion from HUD.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey praised Lazio at the Capitol Hill event, even though the
Long Island lawmaker could not attend because of a scheduling
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''The work that Rick has done on public housing I think has done
so much to make these housing organizations more effective in the
lives of real people. It's one of the areas that I would celebrate
as great legislative service from the heart,'' the Texas Republican
said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Greene Hurt After Stint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Toronto's Todd Greene filled in at his old
position and wound up on the disabled list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who has been playing outfield for the Blue Jays, was
forced into duty at catcher Tuesday night when Alberto Castillo was
ejected for arguing a called third strike in the fifth inning. The
Blue Jays' other catcher, Darrin Fletcher, is plagued by a sore
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, while making a throw to second, caught his right spikes
in the dirt and strained a knee ligament in the seventh inning.
Fletcher was forced to work the final two innings behind the plate
despite his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was placed on the 15-day DL, his spot on the roster taken
by catcher Josh Phelps, who was called up from Double-A Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered Anaheim's catcher of the future, Greene battled
shoulder problems and was released in spring training by the
Angels. He was no longer able to catch regularly after hitting .243
with 14 homers and 42 RBIs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Greene signed with the Blue Jays and was assigned to Triple-A
Syracuse, where he hit .297 with seven home runs and 14 RBIs before
being called up May 19. Greene is hitting .273 with one homer and
one RBI in five games for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who hurt his shoulder while making a throw to second
last weekend, hopes to be able to catch regularly by Friday's game
against Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Trade Denis to Columbus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Avalanche goalie Marc Denis, a former
first-round draft pick who served as the backup to Patricks Roy,
was traded to the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday for
the 32nd pick in this month's NHL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Denis, 22, went 9-8-3 with three shutouts in 1999-00, his first
full season with the Avalanche. He played sparingly late in the
year as Roy pursued Terry Sawchuk's career victory mark of 447. Roy
has won 444 regular season games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The past years have proven to us that a draft pick could be
very valuable for the future of this hockey club,'' Colorado
general manager Pierre Lacroix said. ''(With) the depth of our
goaltending and with the expansion draft coming very soon, we had
to do something regarding our goaltending situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche risked losing Denis in the upcoming expansion
draft, which will require all NHL teams to make players available
to the Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild, who will begin play this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Roy, 34, has one season remaining on a two-year, $15 million
contract, and the Avalanche have two young goaltenders playing for
the Hershey Bears, their minor league affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   David Aebischer, Colorado's seventh-round draft pick in 1997,
was 29-23-2 with a 3.31 goals-against average for Hershey last
season. The 22-year-old from Switzerland shared time with
24-year-old Frederic Cassivi, who was 14-9-3 with a 3.01 GAA.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Blue Jackets signed free agent right wings
David Vyborny and Martin Spanhel, members of the Czech Republic
team that won the gold medal at the recent world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Vyborny was the third-leading scorer in the world championships
at St. Petersburg, Russia, with 10 points in nine games, while
Spanhel had two points during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season in the Czech Extra League, Vyborny led
Sparta Praha to the championship with 63 points in 50 games,
ranking him second in the league in scoring. Spanhel finished with
48 points in 52 games for Keramika Pizen in the same league.
</P>
<P>
   Vyborny was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers in 1993 and Spanhel
by the Philadelphia Flyers in 1995. Both played one season in North
America, then returned to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Send Johnson to Minors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Reliever Jonathan Johnson was optioned
to Triple-A Oklahoma on Wednesday by the Texas Rangers after he
pitched three innings in an 11-6 loss to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's spot on the Texas roster will likely be filled by
outfielder Gabe Kapler, who was scheduled to finished a three-game
rehabilitation stint with Double-A Tulsa on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler has been on the disabled list since May 4 with a tear in
his upper right quadriceps. He is expected to rejoin the Rangers on
Friday, when they begin a nine-game trip with three games at
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was called up Tuesday to replace Ryan Glynn, who made a
spot start for the Rangers on Monday night and then was sent back
to Oklahoma. Glynn pitched eight shutout innings and allowed just
two hits as Texas beat Los Angeles 2-0 for its only win in the
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   In his only appearance with the Rangers, Johnson allowed two
unearned runs and three hits.

<HEADLINE> S.C. now clear to join nuke waste compact with N.J., Conn.  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - South Carolina no longer will be the final
resting place for most of the nation's low-level nuclear waste, the
governor said Wednesday as he signed legislation to join New Jersey
and Connecticut in a disposal agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''After years of discussion we have finally come up with a
solution to our nuclear waste problem in South Carolina,'' Gov. Jim
Hodges said as he signed the bill into law. The first-term Democrat
had pledged to end what he said was the state's reputation as the
''nation's nuclear dumping ground.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey and Connecticut are expected to grant South
Carolina's petition to join the Atlantic Compact, said John Clark,
a senior aide to Hodges. South Carolina would be admitted July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased that the governor has signed the
legislation,'' said Amy Collings, spokeswoman for the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection. ''We look forward to
welcoming South Carolina to the compact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnwell County landfill now takes nuclear waste from
throughout the nation. By joining the compact, South Carolina can
accept shipments from only those two states.
</P>
<P>
   With about 3 million cubic feet of storage remaining, state
officials say the Barnwell site would fill in eight to 10 years if
waste kept coming at current rates.
</P>
<P>
   The new law limits New Jersey's and Connecticut's disposal space
to a total of 800,000 cubic feet. That is to ensure enough space
for waste generated when South Carolina's nuclear power plants are
decommissioned in about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New Jersey's waste comes from medical uses and academic
research, Collings said.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact Commission in
1995 after then-Gov. David Beasley said he was tired with North
Carolina's failure to build a replacement for the Barnwell
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina then reopened Barnwell to all other states,
intending to use the increased revenue for education, but the
amount of money never reached projections.
</P>
<P>
   That revenue will decrease, but the law says the Legislature
must maintain the education funding using other state revenue.
</P>
<P>
   By joining the Atlantic Compact amount of low-level nuclear
waste buried at Barnwell would be cut in half by 2002 and continue
to be restricted each year through 2008, Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people now work there for Chem-Nuclear Systems Inc.,
and 15 to 20 employees eventually could lose their jobs, said
Clark, Hodges' aide.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was something people were a little leery of when the
process started,'' said Sen. Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg.
</P>
<P>
   But the $12 million paid to South Carolina by New Jersey and
Connecticut will help fund economic development projects in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will easily be able to make up for a loss of jobs'' with
the cash infusion, said Barnwell County Councilman Flowe Trexler.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina would have two governor-appointed members on the
compact commission, which would be headquartered here. The other
states would have one each, giving South Carolina veto power.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also creates a Governor's Nuclear Advisory Council
to oversee the Barnwell site and make recommendations on
management, use and handling of nuclear material.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Crisis Forces Cutbacks  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A financial crisis in the Coast Guard budget
has forced reductions in air and sea operations, resulting in
increased response time in some rescue missions and fewer drug and
migrant interdictions, the Coast Guard Commandant said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral James M. Loy, testifying to the House Transportation
panel on the Coast Guard, said budget constraints have made it
impossible for the Guard to fully carry out its mission. ''It
breaks my heart to say so, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Loy also apologized to the subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Wayne
Gilchrest, R-Md., for not telling it earlier that this year's
budget wouldn't be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Congress fully funded the $4.2 billion budget for the Coast
Guard requested by President Clinton for the fiscal year 2000 that
started last October. But that budget did not include money for
military pay increases and other personnel benefits approved in a
separate Defense Department bill.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Loy said, ''$75 million worth of bills have sort of
accrued on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has deferred maintenance on aircraft and vessels
and diverted funds from law enforcement. In January Loy directed
his Atlantic and Pacific area commanders to reduce cutter days and
flight hours by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce on
Wednesday, the regional commander there warned of drastic
scalebacks if Loy can't get more money from Congress for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absent success in obtaining this funding,'' said Rear Admiral
Thad W. Allen, commandant of the 7th Coast Guard District, ''we may
be faced with much deeper cuts that would reduce our law
enforcement presence in the Caribbean by as much as 90 percent for
the remainder of the fiscal year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has identified a $225 million shortfall for this
fiscal year, including some $71 million in immediate obligations,
according to subcommittee figures. The immediate costs include $18
million in medical expenses, $15 million for housing, $15 million
for recruiting and retention and $7 million for increased fuel
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The House has approved $37 million for the Coast Guard in an
emergency spending bill bogged down in the Senate. The Senate
instead has inserted $262 million in emergency operating expenses
as part of a fiscal year 2001 military construction spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its operating expense pressures, the Coast Guard is also
looking toward the long-term modernization of its cutter and
aircraft fleets. That ''Deepwater Project'' could cost $10 billion
over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Loy said the president's proposed budget of $4.7 billion for
2001, a 14 percent raise, would be adequate to meet the Coast
Guard's basic needs. But he cautioned that new prescription drug
and medical benefits for military retirees contained in a defense
bill now working its way through Congress could again create
problems for Coast Guard accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Gilchrest complained that the Coast Guard did not raise these
issues in recent hearings about next year's budget. ''I don't want
to see these same problems next year,'' he said. ''We cannot put
the public's safety at risk.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 4, Royals 2  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Darryl Kile scattered seven hits and struck out
10 as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Kansas City Royals 4-2
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals got a pair of RBI hits from Edgar Renteria and
took two of three from the Royals without three regulars, including
Mark McGwire. McGwire, who has 21 home runs, sat for the second
straight game with a hamstring injury and has missed 13 games due
to injury this season.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina and Ray Lankford also were sidelined with
hamstring injuries.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kile's 22nd career complete game and first since April
29, 1999 against St. Louis when he was pitching for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Kile (9-3) joined Randy Johnson of Arizona as the only nine-game
winners in the NL. He topped his victory total from last season, an
8-13 disaster in Colorado, in only his 13th start.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Royals batters took called third strikes, and Kile struck
out four in a row in one stretch. In his last start on Friday, Kile
ended a string of forgettable interleague outings when he allowed
three hits and a run in eight innings in a victory over the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He's now 2-6 with a 4.96 ERA in 11 interleague starts.
</P>
<P>
   Kile also got his second hit in 29 at-bats when he singled with
two outs and scored on Renteria's two-out hit in a two-run second.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria had an RBI double and Eric Davis, McGwire's replacement
in the cleanup slot, had a run-scoring single off Miguel Batista
(2-5) in the first. Royals right fielder Jermaine Dye missed
Placido Polanco's knee-high fly ball, allowing the ball to roll to
the warning track, for a three-base error in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals scored in the sixth when pinch hitter Scott Pose drew
a leadoff walk, Johnny Damon singled and Mike Sweeney hit a
sacrifice fly. Joe Randa added an RBI single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Batista allowed four runs, two earned, in five innings. He's
lost his last four starts, giving up 15 earned runs in 23 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Injured Cardinals third baseman Fernando Tatis, out since
April 29 with a torn groin, hit an upper-deck home run in batting
practice. He's not expected to return until after the All-Star
break. ... The Royals fell to 13-21 on the road, but are 17-7 at
home. ... Dye and Damon, the left fielder, made catches at the wall
in the second. Dye leaped to rob Craig Paquette of extra bases and
Damon's was more spectacular since he bobbled the ball when he
slammed into the wall. ... Despite losing the last two games, the
Royals had their first winning trip of the season at 5-4. ... The
cross-state rivals have each won six games in the series. ...
Batista is 0-3 for his career against the Cardinals, allowing 25
earned runs and 41 hits in 29 innings.

<HEADLINE> Sparring Over UN Women's Document  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Women's rights activists accused the
Vatican and some Islamic and Catholic countries of blocking
consensus on a U.N. document to accelerate the drive for equality
of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of anti-abortion and religious activists countered
that they had far more support for their conservative approach to
women's rights and blamed rich Western states for pushing ''radical
language'' on sexual rights, homosexual rights and abortion for
stalling negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The group released a letter signed by 23 members of the U.S.
Congress expressing ''great alarm'' that the U.S. delegation to
this week's conference is calling for increased access to abortions
and mandatory training to perform them -- and is promoting ''a new
and dangerous term, 'sexual rights.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will mean not just special rights for homosexuals but could
mean the right to sexual expression for children. Moreover, it may
allow for the spread of prostitution,'' said the letter, which was
addressed to all 188 U.N. member states.
</P>
<P>
   The charge and counter-charge came just two days before the end
of the week-long meeting to review progress toward women's equality
since the landmark U.N. women's conference in Beijing five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were meeting in small groups into the night trying to
meet a self-imposed deadline of Thursday afternoon to reach
consensus on a final text.
</P>
<P>
   During months of closed-door negotiations on the final document
before the conference began Monday, delegates said the Vatican and
a handful of Islamic countries including Algeria, Iran, Libya,
Pakistan and Sudan held up action on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   This week, human rights and women's activists and U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson warned against attempts
to roll back the gains from Beijing. And governments from South
Africa to China demanded that the conference adopt a
forward-looking plan to implement the 150-page Beijing platform for
action, which calls for equality in health, education and jobs and
an end to the increasing poverty of women.
</P>
<P>
   Gita Sen, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management who
heads a grassroots women's organization, told a news conference
Wednesday there is ''strong and growing support'' from Latin
America, Africa, Turkey, India, Mexico and many other countries for
a final document that will reaffirm and move forward the Beijing
platform.
</P>
<P>
   But she said at the top of the list of states stalling final
agreement were the Vatican, Nicaragua, Libya, Sudan and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this hard core will move,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, Sen said, the conference should adopt the final
document by consensus ''so that the tyranny of this miniscule
minority can be ended.'' She said nations opposed to the document
could still express reservations, just as they did at Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Wednesday, a coalition of conservative
anti-abortion and religious groups held a news conference to
counter what they claimed was ''political spin'' by the West that
only a few countries were holding up negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a lie,'' said Austin Ruse, president of the Catholic
Family and Human Rights Institute. He said the coalition's position
had broad support, though none of its members named any other
countries who backed its positions.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the impasse on ''radical language being pushed by the
rich Western states.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruse accused the those countries of engaging in ''sexual
colonialism'' which attempts ''to spread through the developing
world the kind of personal immorality that has utterly failed the
rich West.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Glynn, spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations, countered that the United States believes that access to
family planning and reproductive health information will lead to
fewer abortions in the world -- ''which we support.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the Beijing platform recognized for the first
time that human rights include the right of women to control their
own sexuality without ''coercion, discrimination and violence.''

<HEADLINE> Rocker a No-Show at Minor Leagues  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAUMEE, Ohio (AP) -- John Rocker was a no-show for a second
straight day, leaving officials of the Atlanta Braves organization
wondering whether he will report to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has until Thursday to join the Class Triple-A Richmond
Braves, who opened a three-game series with the Toledo Mud Hens on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond manager Randy Ingle said he had no idea if or when to
expect Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your guess is as good as mine,'' Ingle said before the game.
''He might come around that corner right now, he might show up in
the middle of the night or even tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Rocker told Atlanta radio station WKLS that
he may quit baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'm even going down or not,'' Rocker said.
''I'm still pretty chapped about the whole situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's plenty of things I can do besides deal with the
headaches of this garbage every day,'' he said. ''I'd be a
stockbroker, probably. There's something to be said for having a
job that's not just a complete headache.''
</P>
<P>
   The parent Braves said Rocker was sent down because of poor
pitching performances.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves a year ago for the National League
champions, had 10 saves in 11 opportunities and a 3.93 ERA with
Atlanta this season, but had walked 25 batters in 18 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was demoted one day after confronting a Sports Illustrated
reporter who wrote a story in December about Rocker's offensive
views on foreigners, gays and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A Richmond spokesman said team officials haven't heard from
either Rocker or his agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a whole lot we know,'' Ingle said. ''We don't know
when he'll be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingle said he was to meet with Atlanta assistant general manager
Frank Wren to discuss how Rocker should be used.
</P>
<P>
   Ingle, who coached Rocker in 1996 and 1997 in the minors, was
unaware of Rocker's comments on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be really surprised if he quit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both teams insisted they wouldn't let Rocker's
situation bother them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not affecting the mood or morale in the clubhouse,''
Richmond second baseman Steve Sisco said. ''Our team hasn't been in
the headlines. Only one name has been in the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Sisco said he would be shocked if Rocker quit the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mud Hens appeared anxious to bat against Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants to face him,'' Toledo infielder Chris Lemonis
said. ''We know he's a great pitcher. All of that other stuff,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Security was increased at Ned Skeldon Stadium, even though
Rocker was not there. A plastic fence was erected to keep fans away
from a walkway both teams use on the way to the field, and both
clubhouses were closed to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 media passes were issued for the game between two
teams that are among the three worst in the International League.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves beat the Mud Hens 10-1 before a crowd of 4,563, less
than half the capacity of the stadium but larger than most of the
Mud Hens' crowds this season. Many of those on hand were there for
a Shriners Night promotion that traditionally draws well.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wood of Perrysburg, Ohio, who described himself as a
Braves fan, was hoping to get a look at Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't support what he said, but I don't think he deserved
this much,'' Wood said. ''I love the attitude he has on the field.
He just goes a little off the edge.''

Ruling May Frost Microsoft's Relations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Much of the high-tech industry has been gradually
distancing itself from Microsoft since the software giant's legal troubles
began, and that tendency is likely to accelerate regardless of whether today's
breakup ruling is upheld on appeal. While still an industry powerhouse,
Microsoft's name no longer carries the weight it once did because operating
systems have become less crucial components in the increasingly important

Population Growth in India Explodes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It has taken thousands of years for the population of
India to swell to 1 billion, but it may take just 100 years for India to add
another billion. How successful the Indian government is in boosting literacy
rates and sexual education among females in the next several decades will be
critical in determining just how quickly the population there increases, the
author of a new report on world population says. India is home to one-sixth of

reduce poverty among American women but scored a ''B'' -- its best grade -- for

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago sued a federal law enforcement agency on
Wednesday seeking confidential data concerning gun buyers
nationwide in an effort to bolster its $433 million lawsuit against
the firearms industry.
</P>
<P>
   The city is seeking a nationwide list of those who have bought
more than one gun in a five-day period. That list is kept on a
databank maintained by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   City officials claim that manufacturers deliberately market guns
to criminals, and they want the ATF's list to track major gun
dealers -- who possibly supply street gangs -- by purchasing
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ATF spokesman Tom Ahern said that handing over the list would
violate the privacy rights of law-abiding gun purchasers and that
personal information on the list could jeopardize investigations
and the safety of undercover ATF agents.
</P>
<P>
   The city filed suit in 1998 against 23 gun manufacturers and 13
suburban gun dealers to recoup losses incurred by gun violence.

<HEADLINE> Rancher Convicted in Murder Plot  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Nearly a decade after the murder
of Amazon environmental activist Expedito Ribeiro de Souza, a
Brazilian court convicted a rancher of ordering the killing and
sentenced him to 19{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cheering erupted in the courtroom as Jeronimo Alves Amorim was
sentenced late Tuesday night in the Amazon River port of Belem,
1,400 miles northwest of Rio.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, 1991, Souza was leaving union headquarters when he
was shot and killed. His predecessor and several other union
leaders had died the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists protested that officials had done nothing
to protect Souza, despite frequent death threats for his opposition
to the unequal distribution of land and the rampant destruction of
the rain forest by ranchers and loggers.
</P>
<P>
   The international outcry brought results. Gunman Jose Serafim
Sales was convicted of pulling the trigger and sentenced to 24
years in 1995, while Amorim's ranch foreman Francisco de Assis
Ferreira got 20 years for hiring Sales to kill Souza.
</P>
<P>
   Sales later escaped from prison and is at large, while Ferreira
is out on parole.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction could signal a change in Amazon-style justice,
which historically has favored land owners, said Malu Maranhao,
spokeswoman for the Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission in
Goiania, near the capital of Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,169 victims of land violence documented by the Catholic
church between 1985 and 1998, she said only 86 cases have gone to
trial and just eight defendants accused of ordering a killing have
been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Land violence is notorious in huge Para state, where 700
farmworkers have been killed in the past 15 years, according to
church figures. Nowhere was it worse than in Rio Maria, a frontier
town some 300 miles south of Belem, where Souza was head of the
Farmworkers Union.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Lead Pacers 33-18 in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal, overpowering Rik Smits and
every other Indiana defender who sagged on him, scored 15 points on
7-of-8 shooting Wednesday night as the Los Angeles Lakers took a
33-18 first-quarter lead over the Pacers in the opener of the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's early offensive strategy obviously was to take the
ball inside to Smits and have him go against O'Neal, with the hope
that it might get the Lakers center in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal did not foul once in the quarter, and he also had
five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Smits had four points and missed four shots, including an
airball on his first shot of the game, a short hook.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' Kobe Bryant added eight points on 4-of-6 shooting
in the first 12 minutes, including a driving dunk over the 7-foot-4
Smits.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made 15 of 22 shots (68 percent), while Indiana was
7-of-20 (35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson hit all three of his shots and scored eight points
for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller of the Pacers missed all six of his shots and went
scoreless. He had a couple of in-and-outs from 3-point range and he
also failed to score on two drives -- with O'Neal swatting one shot
away and Miller losing control of the ball on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper added eight points and four assists for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal put the Lakers up 5-2 with a basket and free throw with
10:22 left in the first quarter, and Los Angeles continued to open
up the lead.

<HEADLINE> Former CBS Exec Blair Clark Dies  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Blair Clark, a former CBS news executive
who also managed Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign, has died.
He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, heir to the Clark Thread fortune, died Tuesday at
Princeton Medical Center of complications from colon surgery,
according to his son Timothy Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark joined CBS News as a foreign correspondent in Paris in
1953 and later anchored the ''The World Tonight'' for CBS Radio
Network.
</P>
<P>
   He became vice president and general manager of CBS News in
1961. While he was in that position, the news broadcast was
expanded from 15 minutes to a half hour -- a first for network
television -- and Walter Cronkite took over as anchor of ''The
Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Blair brought a high sense of news integrity to the news
business. He made some people uncomfortable -- those who were
inclined to sensationalize,'' Cronkite said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clark began his career in journalism as a reporter for the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, then spent five years in the U.S. Army during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he took $60,000 he inherited from his grandmother and
founded The New Hampshire Sunday News. He worked for the Boston
Herald and Traveler before joining CBS.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the network, he served as associate publisher of
the New York Post, then became campaign manager for Democratic
presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Clark worked as a free-lance writer from 1969-1975. He was the
editor of The Nation magazine from 1976-1978.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was born in Easthampton, N.Y., and raised in Princeton. He
attended Harvard University, where he served as editor of the
Harvard Crimson and enlisted John F. Kennedy to work on the college
paper, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blair Clark was a member of that great generation of American
journalists who saw the onset of the Cold War and reported it for a
generation,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Timothy, Clark is survived by his wife
Joanna Rostropowicz, son Ian, stepson Tomasz Malinowksi, a sister
and a brother.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes penalty enhancer for hate crimes  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Criminals who select victims on the basis of
their personal characteristics such as race or sexual preference
would face heightened penalties in New York under a bill approved
Wednesday by the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning their longstanding opposition to so-called hate
crimes legislation, Senate Republicans allowed the chamber to vote
on a measure proposed by fellow Republican Gov. George Pataki. It
passed, 48-12.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would boost penalties for more than 50 kinds of crimes
if it can be proven that an offender acted with bias against some
objectionable aspect of a victim when committing the crime. Those
personal characteristics include a victim's age, gender, sexual
orientation, religion, race, disability and country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for people found guilty of hate crimes to be
sentenced to penalties a step higher than their offenses would
normally carry. For instance, a person convicted of a crime that is
a Class E felony - subject to as much as four years in prison -
would be sentenced under the terms of a Class D felony if the
offense was a hate crime, and face up to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of nine states without a hate crimes law on the
books, proponents of the bill said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Roy Goodman, a Manhattan Republican, called the hate crimes
bill he has long sponsored a landmark which will combat the
''darkest impulses'' of warped people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've done something that is both noble in intent and
practical in application,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate's 36 Republicans are usually unanimously in
favor of legislation they allow to reach the floor of their
chamber, there was dissension in the GOP ranks Wednesday. Senators
who blocked the bill in the past argued that singling out some
crimes for higher penalties was unfair to victims of non-bias
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Serphin Maltese, a Queens Republican who once chaired the
state's Conservative Party, said the bill's message seemed to him
like something out of a George Orwell novel - ''We are all equal,
but some are more equal than others.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Should a person, an elderly woman mugged on a street corner,
be afforded less protection ... than those protected under this
statute?'' Maltese asked. ''My reply is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Marchi, R-Staten Island, argued that no one can say
that hate-crime laws have actually worked in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has no demonstrable value,'' Marchi said. ''Nowhere has
this made any difference at all, not one scintilla. Can you cite
one example where this has worked beneficially at diminishing
crime, at diminishing hatred? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republicans in favor said they had their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leader Joseph Bruno said the measure may be
''more perception'' than an effective crime-fighting bill, but he
acknowledged that it may be the right time to send the message
anyway. He voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all 12 senators voting against the bill were
Republicans: John DeFrancisco of Syracuse, Hugh Farley of
Schenectady, John Kuhl Jr. of Steuben County, William Larkin of
Orange County, Thomas Libous of Binghamton, Maltese, Marchi, George
Maziarz of Niagara Falls, Patricia McGee of Chautauqua County,
Michael Nozzolio of Seneca County, Dale Volker of Erie County and
James Wright of Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' 26 votes in favor of the bill were crucial to its
passage.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is unlikely to be the final word on the subject in
2000 by the Legislature. The state Assembly, which has approved
hate crime bills for the past 11 years, passed a more expansive
measure than the Senate version this year.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of bills said they thought the Senate, Assembly
and governor would have little trouble reconciling the differences
in the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Senate Republicans justified their opposition to
hate crimes bills by arguing that it is unfair to single out one
class of crime victims as being more ''important'' than others
because penalties are higher if they are attacked. Gay and lesbian
groups have long argued that the real source of opposition was
reluctance on the part of the Senate to pass any legislation which
could be seen as sympathetic to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups, Jewish anti-defamation organizations and others
jockeyed Wednesday to take credit for being long-standing advocates
of a hate crimes bill and for supposedly putting decisive pressure
on the Senate to finally take up the measure.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democratic candidate for U.S.
Senate, said that she appeared in Albany in April specifically to
promote the hate-crimes bill and would push for national
legislation if elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Hevesi, a Queens Democrat, said the bias bill will
not by itself stop bigoted behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the end,'' he said. ''This will not stop bias
crimes from occurring. We need to educate. ... Nobody's born a
racist. That is a learned behavior.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees 7, Expos 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez allowed four hits in eight
innings and the New York Yankees stole a season-high five bases
Wednesday night in a 7-2 win over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (6-4), who pitched his first career complete game at
Montreal on June 9, 1998 in his only previous start against the
Expos, allowed one hit in the first five innings -- Vladimir
Guerrero's 18th homer, a two-run drive the first.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out five and walked two before Allen Watson
finished with a perfect ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams went 2-for-5, including a two-run single in the
fifth off Carl Pavano (6-3) that put New York ahead 4-2. Williams
also had two of the five steals off Charlie O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada hit a two-run homer off Mike Johnson in the six-run
fifth that helped the Yankees improve to 4-2 on the road in
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, who went 2-for-4 with a steal, had an RBI single in
the third that pulled the Yankees to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee reached in the fifth when shortstop Geoff Blum threw away
his grounder for an error, took third on Derek Jeter's single and
scored the tying run on Paul O'Neill's single.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams' go-ahead hit, Tino Martinez then hit his
career-best fourth triple to make it 5-2 and chase Pavano.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano, allowed six runs -- five earned -- and seven hits in 4 1-3
innings, his shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Jose Vidro, who returned to the lineup after missing
the last four games, hit a leadoff single in the sixth and two-out
single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hernandez has allowed a staff-high 16 homers. ... Martinez
had three triples for Seattle in 1995. ... The Yankees' bullpen has
a major league-best 2.69 ERA and has allowed just five homers. New
York relievers are 12-3. ... Yankees 2B Chuck Knoblauch missed his
third straight start and may be placed on the 15-day disabled list
due to a strained left forearm. ... New York is 31-24 in
interleague play. ... The Expos have four players with 40 or more
RBIs. Guerrero leads the team with 51, followed by Lee Stevens
(45), Rondell White (41), and Vidro (40). Montreal has never had
more than one player drive in 100 runs or more in the same season.

<HEADLINE> Guyana Army Said Deploying Troops  </HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- Guyana is reportedly deploying more
troops on its border with Suriname even as foreign ministers
negotiate to settle a new flare-up in the South American countries'
long-standing dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A Guyanese army official confirmed reports of arriving troops
from residents in villages along the Corentyne River, which divides
the two South American countries on the northeastern shoulder of
South America.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a few
hundred soldiers had been sent to the border, but would give no
further details. Local police, employees at a telephone company
outpost and workers at the area's main Mahogany Hotel also reported
the troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the countries became more tense on Saturday
after Surinamese army boats forced a Canadian-owned oil rig out of
disputed waters near the border.
</P>
<P>
   The rig, owned by Toronto-based CGX Energy, was preparing to
drill under a concession granted by the Guyanese government.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministers Clement Rohee of Guyana and Erroll Snijders of
Suriname met Tuesday in Trinidad but reached no agreement.
Negotiators will meet again June 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very difficult problem and I don't think we'll find
solutions overnight,'' Snijder said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's meeting, Guyana had asked that CGX be allowed
to continue drilling while the two countries debate how to divide
up resources in the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
   Suriname rejected the proposal and instead proposed drawing a
border extending from the Corentyne River at a 10-degree angle.
Guyana says its border is at a 24-degree angle.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Pipeline Ruptures, Spills Gas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Mich. (AP) -- An underground transmission pipeline
ruptured Wednesday morning, spilling thousands of gallons of
gasoline into a drain that carried it to the Grand River,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents living within a one-square-mile area of the leak site
in Blackman Township, just north of Jackson and about 80 miles west
of Detroit, were asked to voluntarily evacuate their homes after
the 9 a.m. spill, said County Administrator Chet Taraskiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler declared a local state of emergency Wednesday
night, Taraskiewicz said. He did not know how long the evacuation
would last.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported and a cleanup was under way,
Taraskiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the leak, which spilled between 15,000 and 100,000
gallons of gasoline, was not immediately known, Taraskiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline rose to ground level, then began flowing into the storm
drain that eventually carried it to the Grand River.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical and natural gas service was cut off to nearby homes
and businesses, and residents in nearby rural areas were urged not
to use water from private wells.

charges he improperly touched a 13-year-old female patient in his

</P>
<P>
   Shukla, 34, was to be arraigned Thursday on three charges of
indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   A message left for Shukla prior to his arrest Wednesday was not

<HEADLINE> Phillies 5, Devil Rays 4  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ron Gant hit a tiebreaking homer and Pat
Burrell had his first career three-hit game to lead the
Philadelphia Phillies over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-4 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Gant broke a 4-all tie in the seventh with his 10th homer -- an
upper-deck shot. It was the 55th homer into the left-field upper
deck seats in Veterans Stadium history.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 draft, entered in a
0-for-12 slump that included seven strikeouts. He gave the Phillies
a 4-3 lead with a two-out, two-run single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock (1-4) pitched 1 1-3 innings to win his first game
with the Phillies. He retired all four batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley pitched the ninth for his fifth save in as many
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guthrie (1-1) allowed no hits and two walks in his last
three outings -- a span of 19 batters -- before Gant's homer.
Right-handed hitters were 3-for-20 against him before the homer.
</P>
<P>
   After Tampa took a 3-1 lead in the fifth, Gant cut it to 3-2
with an RBI double that scored Doug Glanville. Gant moved to third
on the throw home and Bobby Abreu and Mike Lieberthal walked to
load the bases before Burrell lined a single to left, scoring Gant
and Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person had allowed just two hits before the fifth. Randy
Winn tied it at 1 with an RBI single. Jose Guillen gave the Devil
Rays a 3-1 lead with a two-run triple off the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   It was Guillen's second triple of the game. His last triple
before Wednesday was in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen tied it at 4 with a two-out double in the seventh that
scored Winn, who had walked. Guillen also prevented a run by
throwing out Lieberthal at the plate to end the fifth after Kevin
Jordan singled.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell doubled to lead off the second and scored the first run
of the game on a two-out double by Desi Relaford.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mickey Morandini preserved the 4-4 tie in the
seventh with a leaping catch on a liner by Vinny Castilla with two
outs and runners at the corners. Castilla was the first batter
Brock faced.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Relaford is 12-for-24 with runners in scoring position
since May 4. ... Burrell, not known for his defense, made two nice
fielding plays in the sixth. ... The Devil Rays had won four
straight at the Vet before Wednesday's loss. ... Phillies reliever
Scott Aldred underwent successful surgery Wednesday to repair a
tear in his left shoulder. He will miss the remainder of the
season. ... Abreu extended his hitting streak to nine games with a
first-inning single.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 6, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Frank Thomas makes his first pinch-hit
appearance of the season and hits the first pinch homer of his
career. That's how things are going these days for the Chicago
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' two-run homer topped Ken Griffey Jr.'s three-run shot
Wednesday and rallied the White Sox to a 6-4 victory and three-game
sweep of the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' sixth-inning homer off Rob Bell (4-4) sent the White Sox
to their seventh victory in eight games and finished an impressive
road trip by the AL Central leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went 7-2 in Seattle, Houston and Cincinnati to improve
the AL's best record to 35-23. The White Sox are 12 games over .500
for the first time since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''You come in here and play a team that just swept (Minnesota)
and you get three wins on them, that's an outstanding trip,''
manager Jerry Manuel said. ''I'm proud of the way they hung in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's reminiscent of the Cincinnati team that got on a roll on
the road last June and surprised everyone by winning 96 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody was asking questions about the White Sox,
like they were about us last year,'' Reds first baseman Sean Casey
said. ''But they're for real. They're definitely a team to be
reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   They were at their best during their first three-game road sweep
of the season. Chicago scored 27 runs on 37 hits in the series,
piling up four homers, 11 doubles and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're playing the exact same way that we played last year,''
Reds manager Jack McKeon said. ''They've got some young guys that
they're juggling around and they're getting good pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds completed their longest homestand of the season at 5-7,
wasting a chance to open a lead in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are headed for bragging-rights series this weekend --
the Reds for three games in Cleveland; the White Sox for three at
Comiskey Park against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 12 hours after the White Sox finished a 17-run, 19-hit
spree against four Reds pitchers, they relied on Thomas -- the
catalyst in that win -- to set up another.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's three-run homer in the first off Jim Parque (6-2)
allowed the Reds to take a 3-1 lead into the sixth. Brook Fordyce
hit into a run-scoring forceout for the second out, bringing up the
pitcher's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel had been saving Thomas for the right spot to pinch hit.
He sensed this was it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he had thrown enough pitches to where a fresh hitter
could put a good swing on it,'' Manuel said. ''And there's no
better hitter than Frank Thomas.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who has been a designated hitter but not a pinch hitter
this season, was 3-for-12 career off the bench. He pulled a 1-1
pitch for his 13th homer of the season and a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been DHing most of the season, so it's not like I was ice
cold,'' Thomas said. ''I kept loose during the game knowing I was
going to pinch hit. It was a good time right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas emerged from a 2-for-21 slump the last two games. He hit
a three-run homer and drove in four runs in Tuesday's night
offensive avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Abbott added a two-run double in the seventh off Scott
Williamson as part of a three-hit, three-RBI game. Bob Howry struck
out the side in the eighth and Keith Foulke pitched the ninth,
converting his 13th consecutive save chance after giving up Pokey
Reese's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Parque settled in after having trouble with the first three
batters. Reese led off the first with a hard single up the middle
and Barry Larkin hit a soft opposite-field double off the handle of
his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey then hit a high, arching fly to left that carried over
the wall for his 16th homer. Griffey is 6-for-15 career off the
left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has only two homers and three singles in his last 35
at-bats, leaving his average at .215.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The White Sox are 29-26 in interleague play. Cincinnati is
26-23. ... Carlos Lee's first-inning single extended his hitting
streak to a career-high nine games (15-for-34). ... Parque's seven
strikeouts matched his career high. ... Paul Konerko, who spent the
second half of the 1998 season with the Reds before being traded to
Chicago, was 3-for-5 with a pair of walks in the series against his
former team. ... Griffey's homer was his 414th, tying Darrell Evans
for 27th on the career list. ... Bell struck out in both of his
at-bats, leaving the rookie 0-for-18 with 12 strikeouts. He also
threw two wild pitches, raising the Reds' total to 47, most in the
majors. ... Dante Bichette was 0-for-4, ending his hitting streak
at 10 games. ... Benito Santiago's sidearm throw from his knees
caught Tony Graffanino trying to steal second base in the eighth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Vickie Johnson had 22 points and 12
rebounds as the New York Liberty beat the Detroit Shock 73-69
Wednesday night for their first road victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips added 20 points and 10 rebounds for New York
(2-3), which dealt the Shock (1-2) their second straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Canty led Detroit with a career-best 22 points,
including 14 as the Shock took a 37-34 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and Johnson combined for 26 points in the first half
for New York, and the rest of the team managed only eight.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips cut Detroit's lead to one with the opening basket of
the second half, but New York wasn't able to go ahead until Tamika
Whitmore's three-point play made it 56-55 with 9:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore's basket increased the lead to three, and the teams
traded baskets for the next several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After Canty's basket pulled the Shock within 68-67 with 1:37 to
go, Whitmore was called for a 3-second violation. Canty was fouled
by Phillips on a drive to the basket and hit both free throws to
put Detroit ahead by one with 1:14 to go.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson answered with a leaning jumper to put New York ahead
70-69. When Canty's driving layup rolled off the rim, Phillips
grabbed the rebound, and Elena Tornikidou fouled Johnson. She hit
both free throws to make it 72-69.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Tamicha Jackson missed a long 3-pointer, and Becky Hammon
ran down the long rebound for New York. Hammon was fouled and went
1-for-2 from the line to seal the victory.

<HEADLINE> Md. Gov. Halts Execution  </HEADLINE>
By TOM STUCKEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Gov. Parris Glendening halted an execution
for the first time Wednesday, commuting convicted murderer Eugene
Colvin-El's sentence to life in prison without the possibility of
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening's action comes after other states' reassessments of
the death penalty and six days after Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush blocked an execution for the first time as
governor in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin-El, who was twice sentenced to death for fatally stabbing
a woman during a robbery, had been scheduled to be executed next
week. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected his appeal, leaving him no
other apparent legal recourse.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening, a Democrat, has twice refused to commute a death
sentence, but he had been under intense pressure from minority and
religious groups to stop the execution of Colvin-El.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents argued that Colvin-El, who is black,
should not be put to death while the state is studying whether
capital punishment is administered in a racist manner.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the 18 men facing execution in the state are black.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin-El's supporters also argued he was convicted on skimpy
evidence -- fingerprints found outside the house where the murder
victim was found.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening said he had allowed two previous executions to take
place because he felt with absolute certainty that the men had
committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that Colvin-El committed this horrible crime,''
Glendening said. ''But I do not have the same level of absolute
certainty that I had in the first two cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Colvin-El was sentenced for murdering Lena Buckman of Cocoa
Beach, Fla. She was stabbed 28 times with a kitchen knife Sept. 8,
1980, on her 82nd birthday, at her daughter's home in Pikesville.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore County prosecutors contended the circumstantial
evidence was ''overwhelming'' and Colvin-El was the greatest
impediment to his own defense in 1981, refusing to allow his
attorney to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals to spare Colvin-El's life had come from Cardinal William
Keeler of Baltimore and prominent politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican death
penalty supporter, ordered a moratorium on executions in his state
while death penalty procedures are examined for fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week blocked the execution of Ricky McGinn, convicted
of the 1993 rape and murder of his stepdaughter, by approving a
30-day reprieve to allow for DNA tests.

<HEADLINE> US Settles Suit with Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
By VILMA PEREZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The United States agreed Wednesday
to fund Puerto Rico's huge public housing system at the same level
as U.S. states, ending a 25-year fight by local officials who
viewed the inequality as discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the
agency was trying to rectify ''an injustice against Puerto Rico''
by boosting funding for day-to-day operations by 23 percent, from
$87 million to some $107 million annually, and rewriting its
funding formula.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made a mistake,'' Cuomo said at a news conference in San
Juan to announce the deal, which settled a 1996 lawsuit filed by
Gov. Pedro Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 3.8 million people, has the
United States' second largest public housing authority after New
York City -- a total of 332 housing projects with 56,887 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   But HUD funded housing under a formula, written in 1974, that
gave it less money per resident than in U.S. states, Cuomo said. He
said HUD would review its funding formula to take into account the
large number of housing projects in Puerto Rico's smaller towns.
</P>
<P>
   The island will also receive $49.4 million over four years in
additional housing grants, Cuomo said. Current HUD funding for the
housing authority is a total of $261.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Mets 11, Orioles 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo homered, tripled and drove in
two runs to lead the New York Mets to an 11-3 victory over the
steamed Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Already on their longest road trip of the season, the Orioles
found out before the game that they would have to fly home
Wednesday night before returning for Thursday's makeup game.
</P>
<P>
   The series was extended one day by Tuesday's rainout, but there
were no hotels available in the New York City area, necessitating
the long commute. Baltimore's fifth loss in six games didn't do
much to lift the team's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were happy for 5{ innings, as Scott Erickson (2-3)
overcame a shaky first when he allowed solo homers to Alfonzo and
Mike Piazza, and Baltimore led 3-2. But New York scored nine runs
over the next two innings spoiling Baltimore's day.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Abbott led off the sixth with a triple and scored on Jason
Tyner's sacrifice fly to tie the game. Derek Bell, in a 3-for-47
slump, hit a broken-bat single that took a bad hop off shortstop
Mike Bordick's chest. Alfonzo followed with a triple in the
right-field corner to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   After a pair of walks, Todd Zeile hit an RBI single and Jay
Payton had a sacrifice fly off Al Reyes to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets broke the game open with five runs in the seventh on
Robin Ventura's bases-loaded walk and two-run singles by Zeile and
pinch-hitter Benny Agbayani.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mahomes (2-1) pitched one scoreless inning in relief of Rick
Reed for the win. Reed, making his first start since May 27 because
of an injured rib cage muscle, allowed three runs and eight hits in
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken hit his 413th career homer for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner had an adventurous night in left field in his second major
league game. He dropped Ripken's fly ball in the fourth inning,
allowing a run to score. But he made up for the miscue when he
threw out B.J. Surhoff at the plate later that inning trying to
score on a flyout. Tyner made a strong throw on the fly and Piazza
blocked home plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, Tyner went over to the left-field stands
to catch Bordick's foul pop, but a fan reached his hands into
Tyner's glove and caught the ball. Bordick was ruled out on fan
interference.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back homers by Alfonzo and Piazza in the first
marked the eighth time the Mets hit consecutive homers this season.
Piazza's drive went 448 feet and landed in the parking lot beyond
the left-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken homered in the second, and the Orioles tied the game on
Tyner's error in the fourth. Baltimore went ahead in the fifth when
Erickson got his first career hit and scored on Delino DeShields'
double. Erickson had been 0-for-11.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Erickson allowed six runs and six hits in 5 1-3 innings.
... The Mets entered with six triples before getting two in the
sixth. That marked their first two-triple inning since Rich Becker
and Rey Ordonez did it on May 19, 1998, against Cincinnati. ... The
Orioles expected to return home by 1 a.m. and planned to leave
Baltimore at 2:30 p.m. Thursday for the 7:10 p.m. start.

<HEADLINE> Cunningham Agrees to Join Cowboys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Former Minnesota Vikings quarterback
Randall Cunningham agreed Wednesday to join the Dallas Cowboys as a
backup to Troy Aikman, CNN-SI reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys faxed a contract offer to the free agent quarterback
on Tuesday, saying they hoped for a quick decision, with a
mini-camp scheduled to begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've already let them know,'' Cunningham told CNN-SI from his
home in Las Vegas. ''We were working on that (salary) cap stuff
today. I'm about a day away from officially being a Cowboy. In my
heart I've already made the decision. There's nothing really in the
way of me signing with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy. I know my role with them. I'm going in as a
backup. It's good to know where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Dalrymple, the Cowboys' director of public relations, was
unable to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard anything about it,'' Dalrymple told The
Associated Press on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones did not immediately return a message
left by the AP on his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 37, who is entering his 15th NFL season, said he
plans to fly to Dallas on Sunday and attend the Cowboys' mini-camp
next week at the team's Valley Ranch complex in suburban Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's role will be as a veteran insurance policy for
Aikman, who has missed part of the last two seasons because of
concussions. Cunningham led the Vikings to the NFC championship in
1998, when he was 259-of-424 for 3,704 yards with 34 touchdowns and
10 interceptions. Last season, he was 124-of-200 for 1,475 yards
with eight touchdowns and nine interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed Cunningham will earn about $1 million from the
Cowboys in 2000 between his base salary and signing bonus. The deal
includes an incentive package that could add another $500,000 or so
to the contract if Cunningham winds up playing a significant
portion of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings gave Cunningham a $1 million roster bonus on March
1, payable over the course of the 2000 season. That means
Cunningham's 2000 salary could be over $2 million between that
payout from the Vikings and his anticipated Cowboys salary.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota released Cunningham last week to create room under
their salary cap. He signed a 5-year, $28 million contract before
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's strength isn't timing and accuracy, which are key
components of the Cowboys' offense. But for more than a year, the
Cowboys have been discussing adding a change-of-pace quarterback as
a backup.

Monday of lung cancer. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   BenMiriam helped found the city's Gay Community Social Services

</P>
<P>
   BenMiriam lost that case and, the next year, was fired from his
job as a clerk-typist at the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission largely because he was gay and wore capes and dresses to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union took his case and in 1978,
the Supreme Court ordered the commission to reconsider his firing
in light of new regulations, enacted in 1975, which specified that
no one could be disqualified from federal employment solely on the
basis of sexual orientation. BenMiriam received back pay but chose
to work for the U.S. Department of Labor.

<HEADLINE> Dismissals Sought in Columbine Suits  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jefferson County attorneys asked a federal judge
Wednesday to dismiss four lawsuits filed by families of Columbine
victims saying the lawsuits unfairly blame the sheriff's department
for the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although it is natural to assign blame after a tragedy of this
magnitude, the law does not support the attempts to blame law
enforcement officers and government officials for atrocities
committed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,'' assistant county
attorney William Tuthill said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tuthill said dismissal motions were filed Wednesday. He did not
return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Families of 10 victims of the April 20, 1999, shootings at
Columbine High School have sued in federal court, alleging that
sheriff's deputies failed to act fast enough to rescue the students
and a wounded teacher who later died and failed to properly train
deputies, dispatchers and 911 operators.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold fatally shot 12 students and a teacher before
committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also state that the sheriff's department could have
prevented the tragedy by investigating threats made on Harris' Web
site against another Columbine student more than a year before the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rouse, an attorney for families of five of the shooting
victims, said he was not surprised by the county's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not suing the Jefferson County sheriff for what the two
gunmen did. We are suing because of how the sheriff's department
handled the response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Jefferson County attorney's office said a
report issued last month by the sheriff's department showed
officers performed ''both appropriately and admirably.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the federal lawsuits, the families of five
Columbine victims have lawsuits pending in state court.

<HEADLINE> Twins 2, Astros 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jay Canizaro hit a two-run homer in the seventh
inning and Joe Mays combined with three relievers on a six-hitter
as the Minnesota Twins beat the Houston Astros 2-0 Wednesday night
in the first shutout at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lowest-scoring game among the 31 games played in the
ballpark, which opened this year. Previously, there had been a pair
of four-run games, including Minnesota's 3-1 win Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was blanked for the first time in 86 games since the New
York Mets did it last Aug. 25. The Astros had put together the
longest active streak of games without a shutout in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Canizaro's homer was the 106th in the ballpark, just 12 fewer
than the entire 1999 total in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Mays (3-7) didn't allow a hit until the fourth, when Jeff
Bagwell and Moises Alou singled. In all, Mays allowed four hits and
struck out a season-high eight. He escaped a bases-loaded situation
in the sixth by striking out Ken Caminiti, Alou and Richard
Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Miller gave up one hit in two-thirds of an inning, LaTroy
Hawkins gave up one hit in 1 1-3 innings, and Eddie Guardado got
the final out for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds (5-3), winless in five starts since May 10,
allowed two runs and nine hits in seven innings. He worked out of a
one-out, bases-loaded jam in the second by striking out Mays and
Canizaro.
</P>
<P>
   But Canizaro hit his third homer in the seventh following a
single by pinch-hitter Corey Koskie.
</P>
<P>
   Twins pitchers, who had a 5.08 combined ERA coming in, allowed
only one run and 12 hits in the last two games, taking the series
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who had three hit batters in 1998 and 1999 combined,
hit two in the first two innings, raising his season total to five.
</P>
<P>
   Astros outfielders threw out a pair of runners in the first six
innings. Hidalgo threw out Jacque Jones from center trying to
stretch a single in the fourth and right fielder Lance Berkman
threw out Matt Lawson following a single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Astros are 0-29 when trailing after eight innings. ...
Counting Cristian Guzman's stolen base in the first inning, catcher
Mitch Meluskey is now 4-for-35 in throwing out basestealers this
year. ... The Twins have hit 36 of their 45 homers off
right-handers. ... The Twins are 21-2 when leading after the
eighth. ... Minnesota got its second shutout.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 12, Braves 8  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Carlos Delgado homered twice and had a
career-high six RBIs, and Kevin Millwood gave up a career-high nine
runs in another dismal start by an Atlanta starter as the Toronto
Blue Jays beat the Braves 12-8 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado hit a grand slam in the fifth and added a two-run shot
in the ninth to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (4-5) gave up five runs in the first after Gold Glover
Andruw Jones misplayed a liner that should have been the third out.
The Braves, who have lost four of their past six games, fought back
to tie the score at 5 in the fourth, but Millwood couldn't get
another out.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart led off the fifth with a single, Craig Grebeck
followed with one of his three doubles, and Raul Mondesi walked to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Millwood hung a 1-2 breaking ball to Delgado, who went the
opposite way to left for his sixth career grand slam. Delgado's
second homer, his 22nd of the season, came against Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto leads the AL with 96 homers, including five with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, whose 2.68 ERA a year ago ranked second in the NL, had
never given up more than seven runs in a game. His ERA this season
climbed to 5.14.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta starters, long considered the best in the game, have a
10.92 ERA during the first six games of this interleague homestand,
surrendering 38 earned runs in 31 1-3 innings. Twice against the
Blue Jays, they gave up five runs in the opening inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan and Reggie Sanders each drove in three runs for the
Braves, who outhit the Blue Jays 16-9 even though Chipper Jones
wasn't in the lineup. Last year's National League MVP sprained his
right ankle Tuesday and isn't sure when he'll return.
</P>
<P>
   Grebeck doubled in the first and Millwood issued back-to-back
walks to Delgado and Jose Cruz Jr. with two outs. Then, Alex
Gonzalez hit a bases-loaded liner to center that totally fooled
Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a two-time Gold Glove winner, backpedaled a couple of
steps, then turned and threw up his arms as if he expected the ball
to hit him. Instead, it sailed over his head and to the wall while
three runs came home. The Jays weren't through in the first as
Alberto Castillo had a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had an RBI double in the first and brought home two more
runs with a double in the third. But Andres Galarraga was thrown
out at the plate on Jordan's second hit -- running through a stop
sign by third-base coach Ned Yost -- and that cost the Braves a run
when Sanders followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga redeemed himself in the fourth with a two-out,
run-scoring double, tying the game at 5 and knocking out Clayton
Andrews, who allowed 10 hits in his first major-league start.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Andrews' embarrassment, he blooped an apparent single
to right field in the fourth. But Jordan was playing so shallow
that he came up throwing, beating Andrews to first by a half-step
for a most unusual 9-3 putout.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin Cubillan (1-0) picked up his first major league win
despite allowing three runs in 2 1-3 innings. Javy Lopez homered in
the fifth and Sanders added a two-run shot in the seventh to knock
out the Blue Jays rookie.
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Koch shut down the Braves over the final two innings
for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Grebeck's three doubles tied a career high. He previously
did it July 1, 1992, while playing for the Chicago White Sox at
Cleveland. ... The teams scored 45 runs in the three-game series.
... Koch was clocked at 100 mph on three straight fastballs to
Jordan before throwing a 90 mph breaking ball. ... Sanders stole
his 200th career base in the second inning.

<HEADLINE> Magnitude 6.2 Quake Rocks Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENGKULU, Indonesia (AP) -- For the father of 8-year-old Theresia
Kurniasari, one of Indonesia's earthquake victims, the only
consolation is that she was sleeping when she died.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred friends and relatives from the rubble-strewn town of
Bengkulu, many nursing injuries, paid their last respects Wednesday
to the little girl in a pink dress lying in an open coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the magnitude 7.9 quake devastated communities
on the island of Sumatra, Theresia was laid to rest with a simple
funeral service in a Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   ''A wall collapsed on her,'' said the father, Djunaidy, who like
many Indonesians goes by only one name. ''Her aunt carried her from
the house, but when they tried to wake her she was asleep. Jesus
had called her soul to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake rocked the region but
there were no immediate reports of new damage or injuries, the
Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   The new quake hit at 6.45 a.m. Thursday and was centered about
125 miles southeast of Bengkulu in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the lastest quake, about 100 homeless people blocked
a key road near the town protesting what they said was a slow
government response to the disaster. About 30 police struggled to
diffuse tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is no good. No aid has reached here yet. We
need tents food and medicine,'' said Yudi, 40, a protester going by
just one name. His 5-year old son was injured in the quake and his
home flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims and Christians who live in this quake-prone corner of
the Indonesian island chain are picking through the wreckage of
their ruined homes as they mourn their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   With telephone lines down and roads torn apart by crevasses,
nobody is sure exactly how many died in the quake late Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Local media reported 117 dead, but hospital staff and police put
the number of fatalities lower. An emergency government task force
reported 94 dead, 930 badly hurt and 934 slightly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Residents whose homes are intact are afraid to sleep inside and
face a fourth night outdoors. Hundreds of aftershocks followed the
initial quake, which was felt in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, more
than 310 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of the simple houses in Bengkulu and small towns that
line the quake-cracked road along the Indian Ocean coastline either
have been flattened or badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency relief arrived in Bengkulu on Wednesday. Military
planes and warships brought medicine, tents and food. Singapore,
the United States, Australia, Japan and Thailand have pledged aid.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations and Red Cross staff were hampered by heavy rain
as they tried to assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Two Dutch vessels and one Indonesian navy ship were set to
deliver food and medicine by helicopter Thursday to badly hit
Enggano Island, near the quake's epicenter in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 refugees from Enggano, home to 1,800 people, crossed
to Bengkulu on Wednesday and said they had lost everything and
urgently needed food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel from two other Dutch navy ships and one frigate from
Belgium were set to help restore electricity and rebuild Bengkulu's
hospital, which is swamped with casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons were performing operations under shelters fashioned
from old parachutes. Dozens of injured people took refuge under
leaky plastic sheets in the hospital parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need medical supplies, we need more tents. We need blood
and operating equipment,'' said Dr. Ahmad Budiono. Health officials
also feared a scarcity of clean water might trigger disease.

<HEADLINE> Rockers 83, Miracle 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Eva Nemcova tied her career high with 23 points
and Chastity Melvin scored six of her 22 in overtime as the
Cleveland Rockers beat the Orlando Miracle 83-79 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the third straight for the Rockers (3-1), who
only won seven games all last season and had never beaten Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Miracle moved out to a 19-8 lead with 14:08 left in the
first half, but Cleveland responded with a 16-2 run to go ahead.
There were 16 ties and nine lead changes overall.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando (3-2) led 43-41 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's Nykesha Sales (game-high 24 points) opened the second
half by hitting a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-0 run put the Miracle up 60-50, but the Rockers cut the
lead when Suzie McConnell Serio and Nemcova hit consecutive
3-pointers as the team went on a 10-0 run to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's Adrienne Johnson broke the 73-73 tie in overtime with
a layup. The Rockers tied it up again when Melvin hit two free
throws. Taj McWilliams then made a driving layup for the Miracle
but two bad passes allowed Cleveland to score and pull ahead 79-77.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hit an 18-foot jumper to tie the game 79-79. Sales threw
a bad pass, and Nemcova hit a 3-pointer to put the Rockers up for
good.
</P>
<P>
   Merlakia Jones had 10 points and four rebounds for the Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales went 4-for-5 on 3-pointers and grabbed six rebounds for
Orlando. McWilliams had 16 points and eight rebounds, while Cintia
dos Santos had 11 points and Shannon Johnson 10.

<HEADLINE> UN, OAU To Probe Togo Executions  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations announced Wednesday it
was launching an investigation into the deaths of hundreds of
people in Togo in 1998, allegedly at the hands of the country's
notoriously repressive paramilitary police and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will be carried out jointly with the
Organization of African Unity and is being conducted with the full
support of the Togolese government, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said it was premature to speculate about whether the
probe would recommend punishment for the perpetrators. Previous
U.N. commissions of inquiry -- for Rwanda and more recently East
Timor -- have resulted in calls for an international criminal
tribunal to bring to justice those resposible for mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International last year documented what it called a
pattern of repression in Togo under its dictator-turned-president,
Gnassingbe Eyadema. The human rights group said repression reached
a high after June 1998 elections, when Eyadema prematurely ended
ballot counting and declared himself the winner.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote results were announced, hundreds of people,
including members of the military, were killed by the security
forces, Amnesty said in the May report. Corpses were washed up on
the beaches of Togo and neighboring Benin for days afterward, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was released, the Togolese government announced
it would take legal action against the human rights organization.
But after international pressure mounted on Eyadema, the government
consented to an international investigation into the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Togo, his statement said, has promised to cooperate fully with
the investigation, which is expected to begin ''in the near
future.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Highlights His Role in Economy  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is making a ''progress
and prosperity tour'' through battleground states to spotlight his
plans to keep America's booming economy going as voters appear
split on whether he would do any better than George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The planned tour, which the Democratic presidential candidate is
to begin next week, is meant to fuel his aggressive drive to define
his image -- and his message -- in positive and upbeat terms. At the
same time, Gore plans to begin rolling out a series of new domestic
policy addresses, starting with a speech next Tuesday on a proposal
to protect the future of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make our campaign about ideas, not insults, because
we have an important story to tell the American people -- about the
dreams we have realized and the work that's still undone, about how
far we have come these past seven years and how much farther is
left to go,'' Gore said Wednesday, previewing this theme at a
Democratic Party fund-raiser in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the Medicare speech, Gore will propose putting the payroll
taxes that fund a portion of the health care program ''off budget,
off line and into an ironclad lock box'' so that Congress can't use
the money for tax cuts or other spending, campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the late 80s and early 90s, one of the challenges that
faced Social Security was that Republicans were constantly
raiding'' its surpluses, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to ensure that as the government collect more money
than needed to fund Medicare, which provides health care to about
40 million elderly and disabled people, those surplus funds are
used only to pay down the national debt. Gore believes doing so
also would help hold down interest rates and keep the economy
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big issue in this campaign is who is going to maintain
economic security, and taking Medicare off budget is the next
logical step in ensuring long-term economic security,'' Lehane
added.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Gore's Medicare proposal were first reported by
the Washington Post in a story posted on its Web site Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials, meanwhile, said the tour would last at
least a week and possibly stretch to two, hitting Kentucky,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and other key battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   The public is not yet convinced Gore is the best choice to keep
the nation's strong economy going after an unprecedented 1990s
expansion. Polls indicate voters are about evenly divided on
whether Gore or Bush, the two-term Texas governor, is the best
candidate to continue the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial and political analysts suggest the high-tech
economy and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan should get the
credit rather than President Clinton or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is so clearly happening with Gore is that he is not
getting credit for the economy,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''Economic indicators are
almost always good predictors of a presidential election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has trailed Bush by 5 to 10 points in many national polls,
though recent surveys suggest the race may be closing five months
ahead of Election Day. Bush also has a commanding lead in the
state-by-state contest, according to polls.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, in policy speeches, has promised to keep the
country's economy growing by investing the surplus in popular
programs like Social Security and by paying down the debt. Gore
refers to the highly regarded former Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin as ''my tutor'' and refers frequently to Bush's ''risky
schemes'' for deep tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign swing comes as the Democratic Party launches
pro-Gore ads in 15 states, including in battlegrounds such as Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think it's a good move,'' said Eric Rademacher,
co-director of the Ohio Poll at the University of Cincinnati.
''Stressing the economy would be a positive -- anything that Gore
can do to bring some more favorable images to his candidacy and the
campaign would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore trails Bush by 9 points in Ohio, a state Rademacher noted
has gone for the winner in all but two presidential elections in
the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that issues such as the economy, Social Security and
health care are uppermost in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans suggest Gore's economic pitch may fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's questionable whether his message that he is responsible
for the nation's prosperity and good financial times will sell in
middle America,'' said Leslie Gromis, an adviser to Republican Gov.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania. ''Voters have come to see the vice
president as somebody who is willing to say anything and take
credit for anything.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Up by Six Heading Into 4Q  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal had 10 points in the third
quarter after scoring 21 in the first half and the Los Angeles
Lakers held a 77-71 lead over the Indiana Pacers heading into the
fourth quarter of the NBA Finals opener Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who fell behind early and trailed by double digits
much of the first three quarters, rallied from a 67-51 deficit to
close within 71-69 on Mark Jackson's jumper with 1:30 remaining in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Indiana didn't score again in the period, while Kobe Bryant
scored on two drives and Brian Shaw, who had missed three earlier
3-point tries, made one with two seconds left in the quarter to
give the Lakers some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers center Rik Smits also drew his fourth and fifth fouls on
one Lakers' possession in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Reggie Miller, who missed seven shots and went
scoreless in the first half, finally got his first points with two
free throws 3:45 into the third period. He added his first field
goal some three minutes later, on a short bank shot.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter was the second time the Pacers had made a run,
only to see the Lakers pull away.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were up 33-18 at the end of the opening quarter, but
Indiana started the second with a rush.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Travis Best, the Pacers reeled off a 13-4 streak,
narrowing the gap to 37-31 four minutes into the period. Best hit
two jumpers and fed Jalen Rose for a 3-pointer to spur the Pacers'
spurt to begin the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson called for a timeout and the
Lakers responded with an 11-2 run over the next four minutes to
open the lead back to 48-33. They led 55-43 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, O'Neal went 10-of-14 from the field and had
seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Croshere came off the bench to lead the Pacers with 11
points first-half points, nine in the second quarter, and Rose had
10.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's offensive strategy in the first quarter was to take
the ball inside to Smits and have him go against O'Neal, with the
hope that it might get the Lakers center in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The plan didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, overpowering Smits and every other Indiana defender who
sagged on him, scored 15 points on 7-of-8 shooting as the Lakers
led by 15 after the first quarter. O'Neal did not commit foul in
the period.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 104, Pacers 87  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Livin' large and livin' easy. That was how
Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers began the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal put up numbers worthy of a champion, scoring 43 points
and grabbing 19 rebounds as Los Angeles kept a comfortable lead
most of the way and defeated the Indiana Pacers 104-87 in Game 1 on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, O'Neal was an unstoppable force against an opponent
with few options for slowing him down. Whether they single-teamed
him or used double-coverage, nothing really worked for the Pacers
in trying to stop the Lakers' 7-foot-1 center.
</P>
<P>
   Making 12 layups and dunks, six jumpers from inside 12 feet and
three hook shots, O'Neal had everything working. He shot 21-for-31
and left to a standing ovation with 2:33 remaining after throwing
down his final dunk of the night to give the Lakers a 98-81 lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the league's MVP, also had three blocks and four
assists, getting two of those assists early in the fourth quarter
after the Pacers had their lone strong stretch of the night to pull
within two points.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Neal's highest-scoring game since getting 46 points in
Game 1 of the first round against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant added 14 points, Ron Harper 12 and Rick Fox added 11
for the Lakers, who didn't have the emotional letdown their coach
feared after their stunning comeback in Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Indiana's Reggie Miller who shrunk under the
pressure, shooting an abysmal 1-for-16 and scoring just seven
points.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson led Indiana with 18 points, while Austin Croshere
added 16 and Jalen Rose and Rik Smits had 12 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles outrebounded Indiana 48-36 and controlled the game
in so many ways, giving credence to those who argued that they
present too many matchup problems for a Pacers team that could be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what they were early as O'Neal got going right
way.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's line at the end of the first quarter read 15 points, on
7-for-8 shooting, five rebounds and one assist -- the latter stat
coming when he passed out of a triple-team and found Harper alone
in the corner for a 3-pointer that made it 33-16 late in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Harper made all three of his shots in the first quarter while
Bryant went 4-for-6, twice driving through traffic with ease to
convert a dunk and layup. Los Angeles shot 15-for-22 in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As well as things went for O'Neal, they were equally bad for
Miller as he missed all six of his shots. Miller had his first shot
of the second quarter emphatically rejected by Robert Horry and
didn't score from the field until past the midpoint of the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He missed every shot he took the rest of the night, and the
Lakers shrugged off the Pacers' only run with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana pulled within six early in the third on a 3-pointer by
Rose, but O'Neal scored on a putback, Horry dunked off a feed from
Bryant and Fox scored on a give-and-go layup off an assist by Derek
Fisher to quickly build the lead back to 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were making it look easy, no matter which end of the
court they were on. Midway through the third quarter, Jackson drove
to the basket and had his shot swatted away by Bryant. O'Neal then
converted a short jumper, drew Smits' fifth foul and banked in a
putback for a 69-57 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But that was about the point when the Pacers started executing
their offense as well as they had all night. Three foul shots by
Miller, a three-point play by Jackson, consecutive baskets by Dale
Davis and a reverse layup by Jackson made it 71-69, giving the
Lakers their first scare of the night.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles got its lead back to six by the end of the third
quarter, and O'Neal had a dunk and two assists in the first two
minutes of the fourth as the Lakers quickly got their lead back to
double digits.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into a blowout from there as the Lakers closed the
game with a 33-18 run.
</P>

Notes: Among the courtside regulars, actress Salma Hayek made the
boldest fashion statement by wearing a purple wig. ... Pacers
third-string center Zan Tabak, who won a championship in 1995 with
Houston, played the final 32 seconds of the first half. Tabak
hadn't seen any action since the second round against Philadelphia.
... Pacers forward Chris Mullin got into the game with 6:33 left in
the fourth. He did not score. ... Lakers rookie Devean George sat
out with a sprained left ankle. He is expected to be available for
Game 2.
