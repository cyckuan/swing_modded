<HEADLINE> Turkish PM on Possible Integration With Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit declared on Tuesday that an "enhanced" integration between
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side would be the alternative if
the solution on Cyprus is not based on a two-state confederation.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the statement in northern Nicosia controlled by the
Turkish Cypriots at the celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary
of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July, 1974, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that "if the final solution is not a confederation
between two Cypriot states, there are two alternatives: Either the
present status quo will continue, or Turkey and the 'Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC) will integrate at a higher
level, as much as is deemed necessary."
</P>
<P>
"The reality of two states on the island can no longer be
overlooked," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash also said the
solution to the Cyprus issue should be based on two separate
states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkey-TRNC Association Council Monday agreed on
further steps to strengthen the shaky Turkish Cypriot economy,
which has been enduring severe embargoes for years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-dominated
north and the Greek Cypriots-controlled south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bizonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have be achieved.

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg Stocks Weakened Due to Profit-taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Johannesburg Stock
Exchange was weakened Tuesday by profit taking among resources
stocks, neutral South African consumer inflation data and a 500
million rand (83 million U.S. dollars) bond auction.
</P>
<P>
The all-share index was 0.81 percent down and resources fell
1.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other major indices were all weaker with the industrial index
down 0.79 percent and financials dipping 0.63 percent. A fresh
20-year low in the gold price to 252.05 dollars pushed the
all-gold index 12.7 points down to 800.8.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's trade was quiet with the market skimming profits off
resources stocks like Sappi, Sasol and Impala Platinum.
</P>
<P>
The local equity market weakened slightly on the release of
relatively neutral consumer inflation data for June which was up
year-on-year to 7.3 percent compared with 7.1 percent in May. The
overall consumer inflation figure for June was 0.1 percent more
than the consensus forecast by South African economists of 7.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The local equity market was also weaker on the back of
international markets with the Dow Jones Industrial Index down
35.14 points to 11,152.54 and the S&AMP;P 500 down 13.40 points to
1394.25.
</P>
<P>
Equity dealers said U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's monetary policy testimony to the Congress Thursday
would provide direction to the South African market.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan is likely to paint a picture of a resilient U.S.
economy facing the potential of inflationary pressures. The tone
of Greenspan's speech is expected to be balanced but spiked with
warnings.
</P>
<P>
The further drop in the bullion price resulted in gold counters
like Gold Fields of South Africa dropping 3.17 percent and
Anglo-gold falling 1. 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reiterates Commitment to Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Tuesday telephoned Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein reiterating
his commitment to all agreements concerning the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Barak briefed Abdullah on
his visit to the United States as well as Israel's efforts to
revive the peace process in the region, Jordan's official news
agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Barak, during his visit to Washington, had
set a 15-month timetable for reaching comprehensive peace deals
with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday in Gaza
called the timetable "unacceptable" and demanded that Israel
immediately implement the signed agreement, particularly the Wye
River Memorandum signed last October.
</P>
<P>
In response, Barak said in Washington that there's "no reason
to wait" to implement the Wye pact to pull out 13 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah told Barak that Jordan would support all efforts to
put the peace process back to track and stressed the urgency for
Israel to abide by all agreements.
</P>
<P>
The peace process remained virtually deadlocked under the
three-year tenure of Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak's hard-line
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
During a brief visit to Amman last Wednesday, Barak had
pledged to honor all agreements already reached between Israel
and Palestinians and to make efforts to resume peace talks with
Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Liberia to Destroy Collected Weapons: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The west African country of
Liberia will on next Monday hold a ceremony to destroy weapons
collected in a two-year search operation at the end of a seven-
year civil war, the United Nations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Close to 8,000 serviceable and about 1800 unserviceable arms
plus 1.2 million rounds of ammunition were collected in the period
from November 1996 to February 1997, according to a U.N.
background press release.
</P>
<P>
This was compounded with the disarmament and demobilization of
20332 fighters, including 4306 child soldiers and 250 adult female
fighters, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
The weapons destruction, seen as the largest in Africa in
recent years, will be held on Liberia's Independence Day of July
26.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will be observed by heads of states from the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) including
Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and representatives of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The destruction is being carried out following Liberis's
decision last month to destroy all the weapons collected.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. and ECOWAS gave warm welcome this decision," said the
U.N. press release.
</P>
<P>
The destruction exercise estimated to cost 2 million U.S.
dollars is financed by the U.N. out of a special trust fund.

<HEADLINE> Main European Markets Fall in Quiet Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON July 20 (Xinhua) - Main European bourses ended in red
Tuesday dragged down by technology losses on Wall Street and
reaction to the US trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Trading was thin across the board in Europe, with traders
pointing to a certain amount of nervousness ahead of testimony
Thursday by US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to the
House.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 closed 92 points lower at 6392.0, a drop of
1.4 percent, as a relatively quiet corporate news session left
investors to worry about overextended stock valuations.
</P>
<P>
The Govenment's concerns about mortgage lending continued to
hurt banking shares on the session. Standard Charterted was down
23p at 1038p, NatWest fell 63p to 1273p, and Schroders slipped 51p
to 1401p.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 fared no better as it shed 70 points to
close more than 1.5 percent lower at 4548.31.
</P>
<P>
Index heavyweight France Telecom was a key decliner, continuing
the weak run it has seen since it announced a 1.5bn euro
investment in Nasdaq-listed UK cable operator NTL on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax fell more than 2 percent on the day as
tumbles by tech firms such as business software group SAP sent the
market down after a two-week consolidation phase near year highs.
</P>
<P>
The Dax index fell 2.4 percent to 5491, down 133 points as an
improvement in the economic environment in western Germany failed
to support the market.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Economic Situation Remains Stable: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Albania's financial and economic
situation during the first half of this year was stable, Albanian
Finance Minister Anastas Angjeli said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy operated during the six months in
conformity with the government's programs for this year, the
minister said when he released an analysis report on the country's
economic work.
</P>
<P>
The government will fulfill its target for an eight percent
growth of the Gross Domestic product (GDP) for this year, Angjeli
said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to be kept below seven percent, he was
quoted as saying by local media.
</P>
<P>
However, Angjeli said, the revenues from the taxes, including
customs tariffs, registered 29.6 billion lek (about 221 million
U.S. dollars), falling short of the targeted 32.1 billion lek
(239.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The shortfall is mainly due to the non-realization of the plan
in the customs, which cashed 16.8 billion lek (125.4 million
dollars) or 87.1 percent of its target.
</P>
<P>
Some negative factors fueled the fall, including the impact of
the Kosovo crisis which caused delays of the country's some
imports, corruption in the customs and smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said, the expenditures of the state
during the first half of the year were under control, registering
70.9 billion lek (529.1 million dollars), far lower than 80
billion lek (597 million dollars) planned.

<HEADLINE> Joint Military Commission Set up to Implement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A Joint Military Commission (JMC)
was set up here Tuesday to implement the ceasefire agreement
signed 10 days ago by the warring countries involved in the
11-month war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up at a one-day meeting attended by
ministers of foreign affairs and defense of Angola, DRC, Namibia,
Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe, Zambian Minister of State House Eric
Silwamba announced here at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) and the Movement
for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) were unable to attend today's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Each of the warring countries has submitted two names of their
senior military experts as part of the committee.
</P>
<P>
A Political Committee was also set up at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Organization for African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim swill soon appoint a neutral chairman for the
joint commission. The consultations with all the parties concerned
is still going on.
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged the OAU chief to expedite his efforts so
that the JMC can start its work in earnest and immediately.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will gather in Lusaka again as soon as the
neutral chairman is appointed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting expressed hope that the on-going efforts by Zambian
 President Frederick Chiluba to secure the signature of the RCD
and MLC will be successful as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The parties signatories as witness to the ceasefire agreement,
namely Zambia, the United Nations and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) also participated Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the ceasefire agreement the JMC will be responsible for
executing peace-keeping operations until the deployment of the UN
peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
The JMC together with the OAU and U.N. will draw up a
definitive schedule for the orderly withdrawal of all foreign
forces from DRC.
</P>
<P>
Because of the disagreement over who would on behalf of the CRD
sign the agreement all the rebel groups did not sign the agreement
in the regional summit held here on July 10.
</P>
<P>
CRD split into two factions in May -- one led by Emile Ilunga
and the other by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by SADC to mediate a peaceful
solution to the war, will help CRD settle the leadership problem
and they will sign the agreement after it is resolved.

<HEADLINE> Barak Says No Reason to Delay Wye Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister said
on Tuesday that he had no intention to delay the implementation
of the Wye agreement on pull back from the West Bank despite his
15-month goal for comprehensive peacemaking with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"We do intend to implement" the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement,
reached last October between former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a complaint by Arafat earlier in the day
when he said in Gaza that the U.S.-Israel 15-month timetable for
making peace deals with the Arabs was "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept this," Arafat said, returning from a meeting
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "We accept only the
immediate and speedy implementation of Wye River Memorandum and
the Hebron Protocol and the other agreements."
</P>
<P>
Barak said he agreed with him, "It won't take that long," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration also was responding to Arafat's
remarks, saying it would do whatever to move the peace forward.
</P>
<P>
"There's clearly a sense of urgency. We're going to work to
do whatever we can to move forward with the peace process,"
White House spokesman David Leavy said.

ATHENS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigoris Niotis Tuesday discussed with U.S. State Department
special coordinator on terrorism Michael Sheehan ways of
strengthening bilateral cooperation to deal with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, Niotis said that this was a dialogue

<P>
He said that the Greek Foreign Ministry coordinated and

Sheehan has reportedly been in Greece since last week and has
already contacted Greece's Public Order Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Leader Dismisses Plan to Set up Tutsi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ugandan leader
Tuesday dismissed reports that President Yoweri Museveni and
Vice-President of neighboring Rwanda, Paul Kagame, are
masterminding a plan to establish a Tutsi empire.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's First Deputy Prime Minister, Eriya Kategaya, said in
Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam that the problems of the Great
Lakes region especially in Rwanda and Burundi are more complex
than the ethnic conflicts between Tutsis and Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya, who was also the Foreign Minister of Uganda, was
responding to questions from journalists and students from more
than seven universities in Africa and the United States at a
gathering in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said when Major Pierre Buyoya seized power in Burundi in a
military coup, Uganda was mobilizing the Great Lakes region
countries to isolate Burundi, despite the fact that Buyoya is a
Tutsi leader.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Uganda deserves to be called a traitor rather than a
collaborator to the so-called Tutsi empire in making because
Uganda is at odds with Burundi in many issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kategaya alleged that Uganda's intervention in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was entirely based on
protecting its territory and countering invasion of the rebels who
were fighting Uganda from the DRC land.
</P>
<P>
On the links between Ugandan President Museveni and Rwandan
Vice- President and military strongman Kagame, he said the two
leaders have been struggling to protect their borders against
foreign aggression in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Ugandan Prime Minister later officially
inaugurated the Uongozi Institute of Dar es Salaam.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 More Congo(B) Refugees Arrive in Gabon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 more refugees from
Congo (Brazzaville) have arrived in Gabon since two weeks ago, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) regional
office said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The movement of refugees affected six provinces in Gabon with
the number of arrivals standing at 1,500 two weeks ago, according
to the UNHCR regional office.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the Republic of Congo worsened late last month and
more arrivals are feared after the town of Pointe Noire was
reportedly shelled on July 17.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has distributed limited quantities of emergency aid
including medical supplies, food and blankets, and is arranging
for more local food purchases.
</P>
<P>
Staff report that refugees have been taken in by the local
population but many are sleeping in packed shelters of their own
construction, or in the open. Some Congolese are already making
their way to urban centers.
</P>
<P>
One of the most urgent needs is for safe drinking water. The
UNHCR is planning six wells in several of the main shelter sites
and is trying to obtain purification kits for use elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) are preparing to vaccinate the most
vulnerable recent arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Additional UNHCR personnel have arrived in Gabon and more may
be sent. The local Red Cross will help with the distribution of
relief items.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Fulfill Kosovo Deployment in 2 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia will complete the deployment
of its peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo in two weeks, a top
military officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Alexander Popov, deputy commander of the Air
Borne Troops, told the Echo of Moscow radio station that over 50
percent of Russia's 3,600 troops have already been dispatched to
the Yugoslav province. To speed up the deployment, Russia has been
sending the troops by air, by sea and by railroad, Popov said.
</P>
<P>
"The contingent is formed on a basis of the Air Borne Troops,
the Army Aviation and communication units. A separate medical unit
formed on the basis of the Military Medical Academy in St.
Petersburg will also operate in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Popov said the troops are made of "professional servicemen
younger than 40 and involved in the operation based on a
contract."
</P>
<P>
"Each candidate to the contingent underwent a professional test
and a psychological test of his adaptation ability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Popov said one or two Russian peacekeeping battalions will be
stationed in the Kosovska-Kamenika settlement in the American
sector. One Russian battalion will be present in the French sector
and two battalions will be stationed in the Malisevo and Rahovec
settlements in the German sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no problem in the fulfillment of joint
tasks in Kosovo by Russian and NATO servicemen, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Probe Allegations Against Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Committees on Ethnics,
Judiciary, Security and Intelligence were Tuesday authorized to
investigate allegations against the Speaker of the House of
Representatives Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari.
</P>
<P>
Following a rowdy debate over the fate of the speaker, the
session of the 360-member lower house of the National Assembly
adjourned for one day to discuss the issue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The speaker has been under pressure by various sections of the
West African country to resign since The Lagos-based News magazine
made the allegations on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The magazine alleged that Speaker Buhari lied about his age and
 qualifications in order to secure his position, which ranks
fourth in Nigeria's constitutional hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that the speaker was only 29 year old but he
claimed to be 36 so as be qualified for the speaker's post which
is demanded by the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to adjourn the debate over the fate of the
speaker came hours after the house broke up in uproar over a
motion by five members to authorize a committee of the house to
investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Barely 30 minutes into the impassioned debate, Deputy Speaker
Chibudon Nwuche was forced to adjourn the house as the debate
between supporters and opponents of Speaker Buhari became rowdy.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy speaker, the Wednesday session will
take place behind closed doors.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Privatize  Shares in Fruit Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has decided to sell its
shares, over 80 percent of all, in the national fruit processing
company Sonafruit, the Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Jean Marie Vianney Shumbusho, Executive Director
of the National Privatization Secretariat, the Rwandan government
manages Sonafruit in partnership with a local cooperation which
owns about nine percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
The fruit-processing plant was launched in November 1979 with
an initial capital of 102,000 U.S. dollars which were invested in
the extraction of juice from passion fruits.
</P>
<P>
Sonafruit has the capacity of producing 200 tons of fruit juice
per year.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sell out its shares because of heavy losses
noted in the in Sonafruit since 1994 because of the war and
genocide which was marked by looting-sprees, despite the profit of
15,413 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sonafruit's revenues drastically fell to 9,000 dollars in 1996,
and it experienced a deficit of more than 15,000 dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Rwanda also intends to sell its
shares amounting to more than 80 percent of the shares of another
government parastatals dealing with food (Oprovia) and animal
feeds processing (Sopab) because of similar economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Twenty state-owned enterprises or parastatals have so far been
divested since the launching of the privatization program in
1996. Eighty percent of the enterprises so far sold were
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
"Out of 8.5 million dollars supposed to have been raised from
the divested parastatals, however, only 1. 8 million dollars, or
21%, have been deposited in state coffers," Ngabonziza noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's objective in privatizing those
enterprises is to disengage the state from commerce and trade,
leaving it to the private sector so as to reduce budgetary and
administrative burden on the state and to reform or change the
management of enterprises for better economic performance.
</P>
<P>
It is said that over 6,000 former employees of the above
enterprises have been laid off since 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Six Countries Engaged in Steel Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Steel producers from six
countries showed signs of engaging in illegal pricing practices
and could face punitive tariffs, the U.S. Commerce Department said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The department said it had evidence that companies in France,
India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and South Korea illegally "dumped"
in the United States cut-to-length plates, a type of steel thicker
than the more widely used hot-rolled and cold-rolled varieties.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was the third favorable one in two days for the U.S.
steel industry, which blames low-priced steel shipments for
massive layoffs. The cases cover two steel products that together
accounted for 15 percent of all imports in the first five months
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry has blamed low-priced imports for
thousands of layoffs and have charged more than a dozen foreign
countries and their steel producers with unlawful pricing
practices.
</P>
<P>
The department proposed tariffs ranging from 4 percent to 59
percent against the six countries involved in the cut-to-length
case, although one company in South Korea was tentatively
exempted.
</P>
<P>
The tariffs would come on top of the 1 percent to 23 percent
tariffs imposed Monday against all of those countries except
Japan, which was not targeted in a companion complaint filed by
the industry. The Commerce Department ruled that those five
countries may have given subsidies that artificially lowered
prices.
</P>
<P>
As a result of both rulings, the U.S. Customs Service will
collect a bond or deposit on some cut-to-length shipments in case
tariffs are later applied retroactively. Final rulings are due
later this year.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the U.S. steel industry also won a ruling on
cold-rolled steel, a higher-grade variety. The U.S. International
Trade Commission, in a 6-0 ruling, found evidence of harm to U.S.
cold-rolled producers.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department must now determine whether there was
dumping of cold-rolled steel, which is used in washing machines,
refrigerators and some internal auto parts.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Firmer on Huge Export Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency
rand ended the day much stronger against the U.S. dollar, gaining
4.70 cents from its previous close.
</P>
<P>
The rand was last at 6.1220 per dollar from 6.1690 Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was due to a huge export order and the selling of dollars
by London players.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they believed quite a few London players have been
sitting long of dollars for some time now.
</P>
<P>
The rand Tuesday tested an intra-day best level of 6.1150, and
a worst intra-day level of 6.1700 early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The South African consumer price inflation (CPI) data released
Tuesday morning did not have any impact on the rand. The CPI
figure came in at 7.3 percent year-on-year for June, within
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The only concern for the rand was the weak gold price which
Tuesday stabilized below the psychological 253 dollars per ounce
level.
</P>
<P>
Gold was last at 252.30 dollars per ounce after opening at
252.80 dollars.
</P>
<P>
It had closed Monday's trading at 253.15 dollars in New York.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Offshore Oil Fields Cause Little Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Offshore oil fields have caused
little pollution in the Angolan sea, environmentalists said in
Angolan capital Luanda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Xavier, spokesman of the on-going seminar on prevention
of petroleum pollution, noted that according to the full
investigation of the environment protection agencies, 50 percent
of the grease on the Angolan sea had been created by navigation
while the exploration and production of petroleum had create only
two percent of the grease.
</P>
<P>
Although petroleum exploitation has not posed an imminent
threat to the eco-environment, the industry has to make further
efforts to reduce pollution and ensure the sustainable development
in the sea and ocean, Xavier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The seminar from Monday to Thursday was sponsored by the U.N.
International Maritime organization and the international
association of petroleum industry for environment protection.
</P>
<P>
With a daily output of 750,000 barrels of oil, Angola is the
second biggest producer of crude oil in Africa. Most of Angola's
oil fields are off the shore in northern provinces of Zaire and
Cabinda.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Expect Maize Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is expected to
produce a total of 6.982 million tons of maize in the 1998/99
season, according to the latest estimate of the National Crops
Estimates Committee (NCEC) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This estimate is 8.1 percent higher from the 6.456 million tons
forecast in the fifth estimate, but still well down on the first
estimate of 7.267 million tons because of a heat wave in February
and March.
</P>
<P>
Cool, wet weather has, however, now led to the rise in
estimates. During the 1997/98 season South Africa produced 7.082
million tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC Tuesday raised its estimate for commercially-grown
maize to 6. 588 million tons from 6.062 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The National Crops Estimates Committee forecast for sunflower
seed grew 9.8 percent to 1.099 million tons. This will be the
largest sunflower seed harvest in 30 years, and well up on the
1997/1998 crop of 562,067 tons.
</P>
<P>
The sorghum crop forecast remained at 155,900 tons. The soya
beans crop estimate was steady at 174,800 tons.

<HEADLINE> First Evidence Found for PCBs Link to Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have found the
first firm evidence to prove Chemical PCBs a major substance to
cause breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
A banned pesticide called mirex is also linked to the killer
disease, according to a three-year study reported to be the
largest ever done in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a parallel study by Canadians shows exposure to DDT
appears to make breast cancer spread faster when it does occur.
</P>
<P>
The two papers were made known Tuesday in a report of the
"Ottawa Citizen" newspaper before the opening of a world
conference on breast cancer here next week.
</P>
<P>
Canadian researchers will confirm to the 1,000 delegates from
55 countries that trace amounts of pollution can lie in the fatty
tissue of the breast for lifetime and cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
"These two studies are beginning to say to us: maybe there are
things out there in the environment that are causing cancer," Dr.
Kristan Aronson of Queen's University was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies of chemicals in the bodies of women with
breast cancer failed to show a link between the cancer and PCBs,
an industrial oil banned in Canada in 1977.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN July 20 (Xinhua)--A team of 14 German police officers,
including a woman, is due to leave for Kosovo two days later, said
the Federal Criminal Office based near Bonn on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first international deployment of German police
investigators in a crisis-affected region, and the task "is not
without risk", the office said at the farewell of those officers.
</P>
<P>
Thus, top priority in the mission will be the safety of the
officers, stressed the office.
</P>
<P>
Germany has planned to send 210 police officers and additional
criminal experts to Kosovo, as part of the 3100-strong
international police forces to be stationed there.
</P>
<P>
The personal selection was based first on voluntariness, with
strict standards being set for the officers' career experiences,
stress stability, knowledge of foreign languages, and healthy
situation, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Being stationed in the city of Prizren, the first 14 officers
will soon begin their investigation on the alledged "war crimes"
during the past Kosovo conflicts. Further police teams are
expected to arrive there two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily sent the team off by
saying "I wish good lucks and achievements for you in this
important assignment."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concerns over their personal safety. " You
will travel in a state where violent spirales have still not
reached an end," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Might Stop Revoking Palestinian Residency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel might change a long-held
policy of revoking the residency permits of Arab residents of
Jerusalem who have left the city for more than seven years, new
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think the time has come to change this policy and stop
canceling residency for residents of East Jerusalem," Sharansky
told Israel Radio. He said he would raise the issue with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak when he returns from a U.S. visit Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians and human rights groups accused Israel of
attempting to reduce Palestinian population and cement Israeli
control over Jerusalem by revoking residency permits of those
Palestinian residents who have lived abroad or outside the city
for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
At least 5,385 of about 200,000 Palestinian residents in
Jerusalem have been stripped of their residency rights since
1967, when Israel seized the eastern part of the city from Jordan
control, the Israeli human rights group B'tselem said.
</P>
<P>
Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and claims the whole
city its "eternal and undivided capital." Palestinians want East
Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
According to current Israeli laws, Palestinian residents in
East Jerusalem who live abroad or outside the city can retain
their residency rights if they visit the city at intervals not
longer than seven years.
</P>
<P>
But since 1996, the Israeli government of hard-line Benjamin
Netanyahu quietly changed the implementation of the laws,
revoking residency rights of those residents who were living
outside, even if they returned sporadically.
</P>
<P>
B'tselem said 2,083 residents were stripped of their residency
in the three years of 1996 to 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot talk about a united Jerusalem without proper
treatment of the residents of East Jerusalem. We need to do
everything to ensure residents of the east receive equal
treatment to those in the west," Sharansky said while touring the
overcrowded branch of his ministry in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
His support for a change in the current policy of revoking
Palestinian residency will be regarded by the Palestinians as a
goodwill gesture from the new Israeli government, which has
promised to move forward the peace process with Israel's Arab
neighbors, including the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Tuesday agreed to offer 196 million euro (192 million U.S.
dollars) as humanitarian aid to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The new grant brought the humanitarian fundings by the
executive body of the 15-nation bloc for the crisis to a total of
378 million euro (370 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the new offer, 146 million euro (143 million dollars) will
be available immediately for humanitarian actions while the
remaining 50 million euro (49 million dollars) will be kept as a
contingency reserve.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 650,000 people have returned to Kosovo and a
humanitarian challenge is to provide adequate winter shelter for
the returnees before cold weather sets in starting in September.
</P>
<P>
The Europea Commission also pointed out that the "situation in
Serbia needs special attention". More than 100,000 Serbs and Roma
have so far arrived from Kosovo in Serbia and the exodus
continues, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
Many Serb and Roma refugees are now living in makeshift
collective centers and will face a difficult winter in a country
already devastated by the war that just ended.

<HEADLINE> Feature: New CA Division Helps Clients Capitalize on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Internet technology is
touching every aspect of our lives, but perhaps the area that has
experienced the most noticeable change is in the way business
operate. When an organization embraces Internet technology as part
of their business processes, they can immediately notice the
impact on their operation.
</P>
<P>
Today, companies from all industries across the world are
capitalizing on Internet technology to communicate with their
clients and business partners, to link their distributed systems,
and to conduct business.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that e-commerce is hot, after all, consumers
spent 8 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, and that figure is expected
to grow to roughly 130 billion U.S. dollars in the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
The Economics and Statistics Administration of the U.S.
Department of Commerce estimates that by 2002, Internet commerce
between businesses will likely surpass 300 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Businesses use the Internet to lower purchasing costs, reduce
inventories and cycle times, provide more efficient and effective
customer service, lower sales and marketing costs, and realize new
sales opportunities.
</P>
<P>
To help clients take complete advantage of this trend, Computer
Associates International (CA), the world's mission-critical
business software leader, recently launched "inter-biz solutions",
a new division dedicated to assisting worldwide clients,
suppliers, and partners to capitalize on e-commerce business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
According to inter-biz president, Reuven Battat, "inter-biz can
give organizations of all sizes the ability to develop realtime
links in the chain community. That means not only collaborating
between and across multiple businesses, but optimizing
efficiencies by using CA's proven three-dimension technology
interfaces to visualize the entire business process -- from order
to shipping to revenue recognition."
</P>
<P>
"As the leader in enterprise management solutions, CA is taking
its knowledge and experience and applying it to make today's
businesses as successful as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inter-biz creates realtime business management solutions that
reach beyond standard supply chain management and enterprise
resource planning strategies.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, CA is using the same technology that
catapulted the new software, Unicenter TNG Framework, into the
infrastructures of millions of clients and partners -- to address
the challenges of business application integration.
</P>
<P>
TNG stands for the next-generation, meaning the software is
designed to meet the demands of the future consumption.
</P>
<P>
This extensive business management framework, named BizWork,
uses core CA technologies -- including Unicenter TNG,
3-dimension-visualization and Neugents neutral network pattern
recognization -- as a new foundation for inter-and intra-business
communication.
</P>
<P>
BizWork provides an array of partner, vertical and homegrown
applications with the ability to plug in and achieve enhanced
value through an entirely new business management infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Inter-biz leverages the resources of CA's application business
units -- inter-biz supply chain group, inter-biz banking group,
inter-biz financial group. All these are associated with some
famous software companies.
</P>
<P>
The combination of these organizations creates a powerful
delivery vehicle that offers clients access to CA's complete
spectrum of enterprise management, financial, manufacturing, and
human resources applications, e-commerce supply chain management,
logistics, and educational programs.
</P>
<P>
These business unit applications will be utilized with core CA
technologies to create a brand new business paradigm.

<HEADLINE> 2 Bodies Set Up to Supervise Truce in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Defense and foreign ministers from
the belligerent countries have set up two bodies to implement and
supervise a cease-fire to the 11-month conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba said here
Tuesday that ministers from Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, the DRC,
Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi had set up a ministerial-level
committee and a Joint Military Commission (JMC) to supervise the
cease-fire agreed in Lusaka on July 10.
</P>
<P>
"We met with fellow ministers from the belligerent countries
together with their army commanders and chiefs and took the first
step to set up the body to supervise the cease-fire," Silwamba
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the political committee would act as the supreme
supervisory body while the countries waited for the United Nations
to deploy peace- keeping forces to the third biggest country in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said the Joint Military Commission would be in charge
of the day-to-day monitoring and implementation of the cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire is still on shaky ground because Rwanda and
rebels fighting to overthrow Congolese President Laurent Kabila
have so far refused to endorse the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister said that he had invited the two rebel
factions, led by Jean Pierre Bemba and Emile Ilunga, to Lusaka and
he was hopeful they would ratify the agreement in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said the Joint Military Commission would meet later
Tuesday to work out guidelines and practical details of the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
And a U.N. team of peace-keeping experts has arrived in the
Zambian capital and would hold talks with the commission to work
out peace-keeping requirements and financial details, he added.

MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said Tuesday that relations with the United
States are of great importance for Russia and Moscow intends to
broaden them in all areas.
</P>
<P>
He told a regular press briefing that talks held by the two
countries' presidents in Cologne, Germany, helped overcome "the
alienation (in bilateral relations) that appeared during the
Kosovo crisis."
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and U.S. Vice President
Albert Gore are scheduled to hold talks soon. The two will
co-chair an intergovernmental commission for economic and
technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said Moscow "has always viewed this mechanism as an
important factor of promoting Russian-American partnership."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia "has never violated any of its
commitments" in dealings with Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The freezing of relations with NATO after the beginning of air
strikes on Yugoslavia does not refer to bilateral relations with
the Alliance's member-countries," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the Kosovo settlement had finally been put on a
peaceful track largely due to Russia's and the United States'
diplomatic efforts."

<HEADLINE> Spain's PM in Lebanon for Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar Tuesday night arrived here for talks with Lebanese officials
on the Mideast peace process and economic cooperation between
Spain and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Aznar is due to meet Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime
Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is the third leg of Aznar's current Middle East tour
which has already taken him to Syria and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Aznar
pledged to exert efforts to help revive the Arab-Israeli
negotiations stalled during the three-year tenure of Israeli
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was ousted by Labor
leader Ehud Barak in the country's May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Aznar was quoted by Syrian officials as saying that Spain was
ready to make efforts to push the peace process forward under the
land-for-peace formula carved out in the 1991 Madrid peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
Another main event during the Spanish prime minister's stay in
Beirut would be the signing of a protocol under which Lebanon
will get a Spanish donation of 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Nasser Saidi
has said that the protocol will enhance cooperation between the
two countries in both private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's annual imports from Spain exceed 162 million
U.S. dollars while Lebanon exports 5.5 million dollars worth of
goods a year to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, heading a high-powered Spanish economic delegation, came
here from Amman where he had held talks with King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to visit Israel and the Palestinian
self-ruled areas during his Mideast trip.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Condemns Israeli Attack on U.N. Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday condemned the most recent Israeli attack on
United Nations personnel in Lebanon and called Israel to take
measures to ensure their safety.
</P>
<P>
Annan issued a statement through his spokesman, urging the
Israeli Government "to take all necessary measures to ensure that
Israel Defense Forces (IDF)/de facto forces (DFF) respect the
non-combatant status of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL)".
</P>
<P>
On Monday a U.N. position in south Lebanon was shelled by the
IDF/DFF and hit by two artillery rounds, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It was only because of the quick reaction of the Finnish
troops manning the position and a great deal of luck that there
were no casualties," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. positions were previously hit by Israeli forces in May
and June. Annan described Monday's incident as "deeply unsettling"
following the death of an Irish soldier by such shelling on May
31.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL was established on March 19, 1978 by the U.N. Security
Council resolution 425 after Israel invaded south Lebanon in
retaliation for a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) raid
launched from the Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL has been given the mandate to confirm Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon, restore international peace and security and help
Lebanon to restore effective authority.

<HEADLINE> Inmates Take Guards Hostage in Turkish Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Inmates have taken guards hostage
at 14 prisons across Turkey to support two prisoners on a hunger
strike at a prison, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some inmates serving prison terms on terrorism charges took
eight guards hostage at Ankara Ulucanlar Prison Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the action was carried out to support
a hunger strike in Eskisehir Prison started by two members of
Turkish Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army (TIKKO), who want
to be transferred to another facility.
</P>
<P>
The two TIKKO members were incarcerated because of a bomb
attack against Cankiri governor Ayhan Cevik on March 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed and seven others wounded in the bomb
attack.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that no visitors would be allowed at Ulucanlar
Prison because of the continuing situation at the prison.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a prison revolt occurred at Cankiri
Prison early Tuesday and some prisoners took 14 guards hostage.
</P>
<P>
Cankiri Prison officials said that the purpose of this revolt
was also to show support for the hunger strike in Eskisehir.
</P>
<P>
The agency also reported that some prisoners have also taken
five guards hostage in Bursa Prison and three guards hostage in
Canakkale Prison after midnight.

<HEADLINE> India Says No Military Solution to Kashmir Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- India said Tuesday that there
was no military solution to the Kashmir dispute with neighboring
Pakistan and asked Islamabad to come to terms with its history and
geography.
</P>
<P>
In a speech summarizing the nearly-ended conflict in Kashmir,
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said his country was
prepared to resume dialogue with Pakistan but asked the latter to
take "concrete and tangible" steps to facilitate the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"While India remains ready for dialogue, the pace at which it
can move forward will depend entirely on when and how the state of
Pakistan, and what it has now become, permits it to do so," Singh
said in his speech "Kargil and Beyond."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he did not see any possibility of
turning the line of control (LOC) into a permanent border between
India and Pakistan, at least now.
</P>
<P>
He echoed what Indian officials said earlier that New Delhi
would like to renew the Lahore process and asked Pakistan to
facilitate a resumption of the process by reaffirming the
inviolability and sanctity of the LOC, the de facto border between
the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The minister indicated that India would increase defense
spending following the conflict in Kargil in Kashmir, saying one
simple message from Kargil was that "adequate resources have to be
made available for national defense" and that technological
upgradation could not be postponed.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated Indian conditions for talks with
Pakistan, mainly to stop intrusion and cross-border terrorism, and
to reaffirm the inviolability and sanctity of the LOC.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue with Pakistan could only be resumed after realization
of these conditions, he added.

<HEADLINE> Launch of U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) --The launch of U.S. space shuttle
Columbia was postponed until Thursday following the leakage of
hydrogen gas in its engine compartment, the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A hydrogen leak scare halted the launch countdown for Columbia
Tuesday morning, delaying Eileen Collins' debut as the first
female space shuttle commander by at least two days.
</P>
<P>
The countdown stopped with just seven seconds remaining -- less
than a half-second before the shuttle engines were to ignite.
</P>
<P>
A launch controller detected what appeared to be a dangerous
buildup of hydrogen gas in Columbia's engine compartment and
ordered the cutoff. The reading from the gas detector turned out
to be wrong, launch director Ralph Roe said.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced this is not a real leak," Roe said, "and we
have no serious concern with launch."
</P>
<P>
Roe said the launch team would try again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was a huge disappointment for Collins and her crew, as well
as for the numerous female notables gathered for the early-morning
launch of not only the first woman to lead a U.S. space mission
but the world's most powerful X-ray telescope.
</P>
<P>
Technicians will have to replace six igniters, needed to burn
off hydrogen vapor below the engines before they are fired. At the
same time, engineers will try to determine why one of two
hazardous gas detectors provided an erroneous reading.
</P>
<P>
Columbia was to have blasted off at 12:36 a.m. (local time) in
Cape Canaveral in Florida State of the United States, carrying the
1.5-billion-U.S.-dollar Chandra X-ray Observatory, which is
already a year late getting up because of technical problems.
</P>
<P>
The launch controller monitoring the gas detectors first
noticed a hydrogen spike with 16 seconds remaining in the
countdown. He began a manual cutoff at the eight-second mark, as
quickly as he could, and computers shut everything down one second
later.
</P>
<P>
Had Columbia's three main engines fired, it would have forced a
full month's delay in order to replace them. Roe said the operator
made the right call.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in years that a countdown was called off
so close to launch.

<HEADLINE> African Experts Discuss Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of national
desertification funds is one of the ways to combat desertification
and droughts in Africa, Zimbabwean Minister of Mines, Environment
and Tourism Simon Moyo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The others are resource management and partnership with
international institutions, the minister said when opening a
three-day workshop on capacity building and the promotion of an
enabling environment to fight the spread of deserts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Moyo as saying that Africa has
been struggling to convince the world that desertification is
threatening the global environment, more so in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the past, efforts to arrest desertification and drought had
been elusive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moyo attributed past failures in trying to arrest soil loss to
unfair international trade trends and unfair commodity pricing
which worked against Africa.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a fair trading system, education,
communication, acquisition of resources and technology transfer
would ensure the sustainable development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We need capacity, finance, and technology from the developed
world to combat desertification and mitigate droughts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the workshop are now pinning their hopes on
the Regional Action Program being carried out under the auspices
of the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF).
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary of the foundation Abel Thoahlane said that
desertification and drought have negative effects on sustainable
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
These are leading to poverty, poor health, malnutrition, lack
of food security and other problems caused by migration and
displacement.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by more than 40 participants
representing specialized institutions in Africa and Western Europe
in Zimbabwean capital Harare.

progress made on european defense.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to draw up a road map for more effective
European defence procurement and said they would promote defence
industry restructuring.

<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's cabinet has approved the

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Revive Asian Monetary Fund Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will propose the idea of
establishing an Asian Monetary Fund again when world leaders meet
at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
early next year in Bangkok, Thailand News Agency (TNA) reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted by
TNA as saying that the fund would be a facility to help Asian
countries fighting the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Citing that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was proven
that it was unable to effectively resolve financial problems in
every region, Supachai said the proposal may help to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the idea needed to be further consulted and
debated among its advocates and opponents.
</P>
<P>
The idea, initiated by Japan a few years ago, that a fund be
set up to help bail out Asian economies with financial problems
had faced opposition from the United States, which feared the fund
would weaken the IMF's role, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the conference, focusing on finance and
investment, trade and development in the context of globalization,
will issue a "Bangkok Declaration" which would be a blueprint for
joint efforts in economic development for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will host the UNCTAD meeting on February 12-19 next
year. The meeting, to be opened by UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, will be joined by about 180 world leaders.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Int'l Community to Help Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday urged the
international community to help solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing on the 25th anniversary of the
Turkish invasion of the island, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the international community could no
longer remain indifferent to the Cyprus problem. Dealing with this
problem was now urgent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Turkey could not pretend to be a modern
state when it defends the invasion of Cyprus and undermines every
effort made for the settlement of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Greece would contribute with all
the means at its disposal so that within the framework of
international legality a solution might finally be reached to the
Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Concerned over Israel's Indecision to Carry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday expressed concern
over Israel's hesitation to carry out the Wye interim peace deal
before the final status talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's indecision could wear away credibility of the Mideast
peace process and gives signals contrary to what we have believed
and hoped for," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"Doubts have started to appear concerning the extent of the
sincerity and feasibility of advancing toward peace," Moussa told
reporters after a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to push the peace
talks with the Palestinians forward. But he has also proposed to
combine the implementation of the Wye accord into the final status
talks. The Palestinians have rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered peace agreement signed in October calls on
Israel to hand over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians. The former hardline Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, suspended the implementation in December.
</P>
<P>
Moussa urged Israel to fully implement the peace deal to boost
confidence in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. "We want to
ascertain that the agreements will be implemented and that we move
towards a real peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo earlier in the day and held talks with
Mubarak at a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo. The two
leaders also discussed Arafat's worry over U.S. role in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During his current visit to the U.S., Barak on Monday agreed
with U.S. President Bill Clinton to form a joint strategic
committee to help Israel reach peace with the Palestinians. They
also decided to meet every four months to ensure that the
peacemaking stays on track.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have complained that the new strategy was an
attempt by Israel to turn Washington into its partner, rather than
a mediator.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called for "an honest role" played by the U.S. in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is the quality of the U.S. role, which
should remain that of an honest mediator" ... and "objective in
its stance towards the two sides," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects Spanish Role in Peace Process: King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
Tuesday called on Spain to play a key role in the Middle East
peace process by using its good relations with all parties
concerned in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian ruler made the appeal during his talks with
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar who is in Amman for a
two-day visit on bilateral ties and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah called on Spain to use its influence
to help revive the Middle East peace process which was activated
in the Madrid Middle East Peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Aznar exchanged views on what they saw as positive
developments in the region after the swear-in of Israel`s new
Prime Minister Ehud Barak earlier this month, Jordan`s official
news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Barak had pledged to comply with all agreements the Jewish
state had signed with the Palestinians during a brief visit to
Amman last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Aznar also agreed to consolidate the cooperative
and friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said Spain understood the economic difficulties of Jordan
and would spare no efforts to help alleviate its foreign debt
burden which stood at some 6.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish leader left Amman Tuesday evening for Lebanon to
continue his five-day tour of the region.

<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- United States Ambassador to Egypt Daniel Kirtzer said
a number of U.S. firms were studying the investment of billions of
U.S. dollars in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The statement were made during Kirtzer's meeting on Sunday with
members of the Egyptian-U.S. Friendship Association, Al-Hayat
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The oil production of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) went down by 295,000 barrels daily in
June compared to the figures of May, Al-Hayat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total production of the OPEC members stood at 25.8 million
barrels a day in June, compared to 26.1 million a day in May,
according to the Middle East Economic Survey. The figures are in
line with the output cuts decided in March.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Agriculture Bank (SAB) signed three
contracts involving 5.7 million rials (1.5 million dollars) to
finance three projects of plant laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The SAB said in a statement Monday that the procedures were
undergoing for financing the three out of 17 similar projects to
produce saplings of palm trees, potato plants and fruit trees,
Al-Hayat reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government is expected to announce this
week a 600-700-million-dollar bond issue in euros and dollars, the
daily As Safir reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Minister George Korom as saying that
the coming issue is part of a 2-billion-dollar foreign currency
bond issue authorized by parliament under the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's Deputy Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian said on
Monday that the country's electricity and water sector need over 1
billion dollars in foreign exchange annually.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Marginally Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's year-on-year
consumer inflation rate rose by 0.2 percentage points to 7.3
percent in June from 7.1 percent in May, Statistics South Africa
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) for metropolitan areas as well
as the seasonally adjusted index had risen by 0.5 percent from May
to June, the state statistical bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Upward pressure came from the transport index which increased
due to the 12-cent-a-liter hike in the petrol price. Large
monthly increases for tobacco products as well as housing and
household operation also boosted the indices.
</P>
<P>
But the percentage point cut in prime and mortgage rates toward
the end of June did not feature in the released statistics. Its
inclusion would have lowered the increase in the headline
inflation figure, said economists.
</P>
<P>
Annual core inflation rose to 8.0 percent in June from 7.8
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Upward pressure on core CPI again came mainly from the
transport index which rose due to the petrol price increase at
retail level.
</P>
<P>
The core index, which excludes mortgage payments, rose by 0.6
percent month-on-month compared to the 0.7 percent month-on-month
increase in May.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase of the CPI in June, economists are
predicting inflation to fall in coming months as more interest
rate cuts are expected.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Send Police Officers to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN July 20 (Xinhua)--A team of 14 German police officers,
including a woman, left Bonn on Tuesday for Kosovo, said the
Federal Criminal Office based near Bonn.
</P>
<P>
It is the first international deployment of German police
investigators in a crisis-affected region, and the task "is not
without risk", the office said at the departure of those officers.
</P>
<P>
Thus, top priority in the mission will be the safety of the
officers, stressed the office.
</P>
<P>
Germany has planned to send 210 police officers and additional
criminal experts to Kosovo, as part of the 3100-strong
international police forces to be stationed there.
</P>
<P>
The personal selection was based first on voluntariness, with
strict standards being set for the officers' career experiences,
stress stability, knowledge of foreign languages, and healthy
situation, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Being stationed in the city of Prizren, the first 14 officers
will on this Thursday begin their investigation on the "war
crimes" during the past Kosovo conflicts. Further police teams are
expected to arrive there two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily sent the team off by
saying "I wish good lucks and achievements for you in this
important assignment."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concerns over their personal safety. " You
will travel in a state where violent spirales have still not
reached an end," he said.

<HEADLINE> Killings of S. African ANC Supporters Could Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The killing of seven African
National Congress (ANC) supporters allegedly by the United
Democratic Movement (UDM) supporters could have been purely
criminal, both parties said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seven people were shot dead Monday night in Thokoza on the
East Rand outside Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted UDM's Gauteng leader
Lulama Mshumpela as saying that he was convinced the killings had
a criminal motive.
</P>
<P>
"It became clear after consultation with the local community
and security forces in the area that these killings were not
political in nature, but purely criminal."
</P>
<P>
While there were claims that the killings had a political
motive, the organization could not exclude the possibility that
the killings had criminal objectives which were conveniently
camouflaged in political violence, the ANC said in its reaction.
</P>
<P>
The UDM leadership in Gauteng met Tuesday to discuss the
killings, and Mshumpela said he was assured that the UDM was not
involved at all.
</P>
<P>
He said the perpetrators were exploiting the fact that there
seemed to be some kind of mistrust between the UDM and the ANC.
</P>
<P>
He called for a meeting between Gauteng Premier Mbhazima
Shilowa, the UDM and the ANC in a bid to resolve the situation.
</P>
<P>
Concern was also expressed by both parties about the fact that
police, who were deployed in the area on Monday afternoon because
of tension, failed to prevent the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
By late Tuesday afternoon police had still not made any
arrests, but East Rand police and members of the South African
National Defense Force launched a massive search operation in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The ANC supporters were gunned down with AK-47 rifles around
9:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) following tension between them and a group of
UDM supporters earlier in the day which resulted in police being
deployed to the area.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses alleged that UDM supporters from the nearby
Greenfields were responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Violence between the ANC and UDM has gripped the East Rand
since the beginning of the year, especially in Greenfields and
Phola Park.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Conduct Census in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will conduct its first
national population census next month since 1989, Chairman of the
Census Steering Committee, Cyrus Maina announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's national census in 1989 found that the population of
the east African country stood at 20 million.
</P>
<P>
Maina urged officials involved in the operation to have uniform
 interpretation of the census questionnaire and denied the
speculation that the comming census was beset with logistical
problems.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, including Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi, had criticized questionnaires, saying that they omitted some
vital data.
</P>
<P>
Maina said that all district commissioners had been recruited
as census officials in their respective districts to ensure that
the census succeeds.
</P>
<P>
He said the national census officials are under strict
instructions to ensure that all citizens, including the nomadic
communities, are counted in.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Kenyan population has already hit 30
million.

<HEADLINE> German Economy Report Urges More Individual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Economics Ministry Tuesday
issued its economic report, which said the business and
individuals should take more responsibility, but not demand too
much from the state, to secure a long-term growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
While presenting his first economic report since assuming
office last autumn, Werner Mueller, minister of economics, said
that for the modernization of German economy, enterprises and
citizens must lower their demands on the government.
</P>
<P>
The report, more clearly explaining the cabinet's economic
policy, called on the citizens to be ready for a drastic reform
and re-construction on Germany's social welfare system, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
One of the most ambitious goals set by the report is to cut the
state quota from the present 48 percent to 40 percent in four
years. The quota stands for the portion of state spending in the
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Thus, the report urged structural reforms on the social welfare
system, reduction of the government's public responsibility, and
demolition of state-subsidized industrial sectors such as coal
mining.
</P>
<P>
The spending cut will result in an eased tax burden on
individuals and the business, and will contribute to job creation,
explained Mueller.
</P>
<P>
A substantial reduction on social wellfare fund, especially the
unemployment relief, is indicated in the report.
</P>
<P>
The government will concentrate more financial resources on the
training course of the employed labor force and help those
unemployed better qualified for jobs, but not appease the jobless
with big money, it said.
</P>
<P>
Linked with those issues, the report demanded a slowed-down
increase of Germany's salary standard, which is already the
world's highest.
</P>
<P>
The annual wage negotiations, in which the unions, the
employers and the government compromise on next year's wage
standard, must bring about "productive progress" in job creation,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Mueller said that income increase should not depend on more tax
burden and more state budget. "It is unsocial if the job becomes
too expensive only because the state is too expensive," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The report, sharply criticized by the unions since part of its
contents was opened last week, was backed by prominent German
business leaders and the conservative opposition. Now the
government should adopt a realistic policy as has depicted in the
report, they said.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Hundt, president of the German Employers' Association,
said the report "knows the right direction." But, he added, what
the report says is totally opposite to the real economic policy of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's coalition cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The opposite Christian Democratic Union (CDU), an advocate of
relieving the state burden, said Mueller's report would win
support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Friedlich Merz, deputy chief of the CDU's parliamentary
fraction, further demanded a cut of the state quota by 10 percent.
It would mean a 400-billion-mark waive in Germany's state budget,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Given N.Irish Peace Review Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced on Tuesday that the former U.S. Senator George Mitchell,
who helped broker the Good Friday Agreement last year, will act as
a facilitator in the review of the deadlocked Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair revealed the role after a meeting with his Irish
counterpart Bertie Ahern and Senator Mitchell at Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
Senator Mitchell, who chaired the talks that led to the Good
Friday Agreement, will meet Ulster Unionists later on Tuesday,
before travelling to Belfast to meet the province's other
political parties, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The review will focus on three agreed aspects of the agreement.
Those include the way how to implement an inclusive power-sharing
executive, the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons by May
2000, and the manner of the handover as determined by the
Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Blair was quoted as saying that "The review will then go on to
determine how to overcome the difficulties which exist and the
practical implementation of these difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said it was important Northern
Ireland's political parties continued proper dialogue to overcome
the problems that prevented the formation of a power-sharing
executive last week.
</P>
<P>
Ahern echoed that, saying that despite this year's setbacks
fundamental progress had been achieved. Earlier, Ahern met Ulster
Unionist leader David Trimble at the Irish Embassy in London. Both
men described the hour-long meeting as useful.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Trimble said he had no intention of quitting as
Northern Ireland's first minister after the resignation of his
deputy, the SDLP's Seamus Mallon.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he wanted the review of the peace process to be
completed as quickly as possible. Also, he was insistent that the
May 2000 deadline for completing the decommissioning of terrorist
weapons set down in the Good Friday Agreement must be met.

<HEADLINE> UK, Italy Push for Single European Energy Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Italy will organize a
European energy conference next year to push forward the creation
of a single market for electricity and gas in Europe, Britain's
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that Italy and the UK would jointly organize a
conference in the first half of next year, involving industry and
governments from all member states," Reuters quoted the DTI as
saying in a statement after talks in London with Italian
officials.
</P>
<P>
"The conference will discuss the implementation of a real
single market in energy, and solutions to problems which have
arisen in the past," the DTI statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued by Britain's Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry Stephen Byers and Italy's Industry Minister
Luigi Bersani after a British-Italian summit in London.
</P>
<P>
The European Union began the process of liberalizing its energy
markets with the entry into force in February of the Electricity
Directive, which stipulates that the largest 25 percent of all EU
customers must be allowed to buy their supplies on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
A similar directive for gas allows 20 percent of consumers to
switch supplier from August 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
Moving his ministry's budget estimates for 1999/2000 in
Zanzibar, the minister said that the progress in the
telecommunication sector on the isles have attracted both
investors and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Karume told the House of Representatives that the telephone
lines in Zanzibar have increased to 25,000, providing better
telecommunication services to people in urban and rural areas,
especially to tourist hotels along the coastal line, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Three telephone lines are shared by less than 100 people in
Zanzibar, which has a population is close to 800,000, the minister
said, adding that this is rarely seen in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Karume, the Tanzania Telecommunication Company
Limited (TTCL) owns 16,000 lines in the isles, Mobitel company has
2,000 customers, Tritel has 1,000 clients and Zantel has a
capacity of 7,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the four telecom firms will support Zanzibar's
economic diversification program following the slump of prices of
cloves in the world market, Karume said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Says No Reason to Delay Wye Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister said
on Tuesday that he had no intention to delay the implementation
of the Wye agreement to pull back from the West Bank despite his
15-month goal for comprehensive peacemaking with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"We do intend to implement" the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement,
reached last October between former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a complaint by Arafat earlier in the day
when he said in Gaza that the U.S.-Israel 15-month timetable for
making peace deals with the Arabs was "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept this," Arafat said, returning from a meeting
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "We accept only the
immediate and speedy implementation of Wye River Memorandum and
the Hebron Protocol and the other agreements."
</P>
<P>
Barak said he agreed with him, "It won't take that long," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration also was responding to Arafat's
remarks, saying it would do whatever to move the peace forward.
</P>
<P>
"There's clearly a sense of urgency. We're going to work to
do whatever we can to move forward with the peace process,"
White House spokesman David Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Issues Global Y2K Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 20 (Xinhua) -- More actual fixing of computer
systems will get done but more anxieties will arise as the
inevitability of January 1, 2000 draws closer, said a new global
Y2K study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Merrill Lynch's global research survey, potential
reactions caused by fear of the unknown, rather than actual fixing
of computer systems, is emerging as the main investor concern when
the race to prepare for Y2K enters the home stretch.
</P>
<P>
There are in fact two Y2K problems, the U.S. financial
organization said. The first, that of actually fixing systems, is
largely being solved. Even in the emerging markets, information
and awareness have improved markedly. The second Y2K problem is
based on what is feared: How serious do corporate and individual
consumers think that the Y2K problem will be and will their
response exacerbate or ameliorate the situation and affect fund
flows?
</P>
<P>
To the extent that those fears are acted upon, Merrill Lynch
said, investment and funds flows could be altered.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, where depositors have not had to worry
about the safety of their money for more than 60 years, a recent
Gallup Poll found that 42 percent of adults expected ATM machines
to fail in the new year. The central bank is putting an extra 50
billion U.S. dollars into circulation at year-end to accommodate
possible cash hoarding.
</P>
<P>
Banks are expected to come to the capital market to raise funds
in case they face possible Y2K liquidity issues, a factor which
itself may raise depositors' anxiety issues, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
Overall, spending on Y2K issues is likely to produce a more
efficient global system. Nevertheless, some investments in Y2K
fixes produced little economic return for companies -- they were
simply a cost that had to be incurred to stay in business. But
those funds can now be redirected to other information technology
spending.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch's economists anticipate a buildup of inventory in
the fourth quarter of 1999 as companies and consumers indulge
their fears and stockpile components and supplies. That could
accelerate second half GDP growth in both the United States and in
the recovering countries of Asia and Europe. The corollary to that
would be a modest slowing of economic growth in the first quarter
of 2000 as the inventory is worked off.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Urged to Sign Cease-Fire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Tuesday called on relevant African countries to
persuade the rebel movements in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo to sign the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The council made the appeal after hearing a briefing by the
Secretariat on the situation in the central-west African republic
following the signature of the accord in Lusaka, Zambia, on July 10
by six African governments involved in the conflict of the D.R. of
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential press statement issued after closed-door
consultations, the council said its members reiterated their
dismay over the fact that rebel movements did not join the
signatories to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their call on the governments of Rwanda and
Uganda and others who have influence to make all the necessary
efforts for the purpose, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Council members welcomed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
preliminary report on the deployment of a peacekeeping mission
to the republic.
</P>
<P>
They saw Annan's report setting forth proposals for initial
actions that could be taken by the United Nations to implement the
peace accord fully and promptly and to encourage the rebels to
sign the agreement without further delay.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in the D.R. of the Congo has left over 700,000
displaced out of the less-than- 3 million population, according to
Annan's report on July 15.

<HEADLINE> Men of U.S. Apollo 11 Honored With Aviation Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The men of U.S. Apollo 11
received the prestigious Langley Gold Medal for aviation at a
ceremony here Tuesday to mark the 30th anniversary of the first
landing on the moon.
</P>
<P>
Neil Armstrong, who commanded Apollo 11 and the first man to
walk the moon, Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins "blazed a path
farther than any we have known," said U.S. Vice President Al Gore
at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin landed the Apollo lunar
module they called Eagle on the moon's Sea of Tranquillity. Hours
later, Armstrong descended a ladder and became the first to walk
the lunar surface. Collins remained in lunar orbit aboard the
command ship, Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Gore, speaking at the ceremony staged beside the Apollo 11
command ship, said the astronauts accomplished their mission with
what would now be regarded as primitive equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Apollo 11 onboard computer, he said, had less than one
thousandth the memory storage of a modern handheld electronic
organizer and could hold data equal to only about one-twentieth of
a typical floppy disk in modern computers.
</P>
<P>
"It is even more astonishing that their mission was pulled off
with the technology that was available then," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
The Langley Gold Medal, named for American aviation pioneer
Samuel P. Langley, had been awarded only 21 times previously. The
first recipients were Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1909.

<HEADLINE> Feature: 3-D Technology Will Enliven E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>

</P>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Just sit down and wear the
toy-like blue-and-red movie glasses, called View Finder, a Latin
American correspondent can see three-dimension views.
</P>
<P>
He can not help shake his head from time to time in a bid
to duck the coming car in order to avert a head-on collision, and
avoid the pointing finger of the instructor simply to protect his
high-bridged nose.
</P>
<P>
Once related to children's toys such as the View Finder,
three-dimensional special effects have come a long way. And if
computer graphics companies are correct, the technology is poised to
change the way people do business on the Internet, the worldwide
link-up networks.
</P>
<P>
The display is under way on the sideline of the annual meeting,
held by the world-famous Computer Associates InternationaL (CA),
which ran through July 18-24.
</P>
<P>
To capitalize on the fast-growing world of 3-D technology,
Viewpoint Digital, a graphics division of CA, has amassed a vast
library of 3-D images and is pushing the technology's business
applications to the 25,000 CA annual meeting participants.
</P>
<P>
The computer software giant is holding its annual convention in
New Orleans in the southern United States.
</P>
<P>
The message they are selling is that 3-D has a serious side,
that the same technology used to make Godzilla crush San Francisco
or create the star ship Enterprise which can be used to sell
products on line.
</P>
<P>
Forget pictures of terrible monsters, companies are instead
being encouraged to post 3-D images of their products, which
customers can spin around and look at from any angle.
</P>
<P>
Such a change would be a departure from the familiar flat images
that now dot Web pages.
</P>
<P>
"We're here to get companies to think 'breakthrough,'" Viewpoint
President Martin Plaehn said.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the 3-D technology, "people will see and think
things visually," Charles B. Wang, CA's chairman and chief executive
officer, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Think visually," Viewpoint staff told conventioneers who
stopped by their booth to check out dazzling 3-D video footage and
have their faces digitized.
</P>
<P>
One Viewpoint client, The Sharper Image, was at the conference
to endorse the business advantages of 3-D visualization. The
high-tech toy-and-gadget company began incorporating 3-D images on
its Web site in March 1999, and its on-line sales for 1999 have
already topped last year's total and show no sings of slowing, said
Meredith Medland, director of the company's Internet division.
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans-based "Times-Picayune" newspaper said Tuesday
that the Sharper Image is just one of several companies to use the
on-line application of 3-D technology.
</P>
<P>
However, going 3-D isn't cheap. Prices for Viewpoint graphics
range from 5 U.S. dollars to more than 1,000 U.S. dollars a pop, and
entire libraries of images can cost about 20,000 U.S. dollars. This
is just a fraction of what somebody would spend building the same
image from scratch, Plaihn said.

and incitement leading to violence and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The dumping of nearly 3,000 tons of toxic wastes, shipped from
Taiwan last November, prompted violent protests and caused panic
among the residents in Sihanoukville.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, enraged by the danger of the wastes, destroyed the
building of the goods-inspection office and looted the villa of
the city's deputy governor Khem Bo.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the two insisted they were not involved in
any illegal activities, just to monitor the demonstrations and
provide legal advise to the protesters.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's giant oil company,
Petronas, will issue U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to raise funds
in foreign capital markets in view of the improved economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Petronas is going to the bond market to raise funds following

worth 1 billion U.S. dollars in May which was oversubscribed after
successful road shows in key Asian, European and American
financial capitals, Petronas President Mohd Hassan Marican said

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 21 (Xinhua)-- Beijing is taking down all
commercial billboards along the city's main thoroughfare, Chang'an
Avenue, in the vicinity of Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
"No commercial advertisements should be seen from the Tian'
anmen Square Rostrum," said a Beijing government official.
</P>
<P>
"Billboards on Chang'an Avenue are not suitable for traditional
architecture here," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll lose around 20 million yuan if our billboard is removed,
" said the head of Kodak (China) Ltd. that put up the largest
billboard in Asia there in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The removal of billboards is part of the government effort to
give the Tian'anmen Square and Chang'an Avenue a new look to greet
the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. A facelift
of the square has just finished after eight months' work.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 311 billboards along the street are subject to the
removal, ads companies are expected to suffer a total loss of more
than 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"We have encountered many obstacles from the companies who put
up billboards here. However, most companies have agreed to
cooperate," said an official in charge of Chang'an Avenue's
renovation.
</P>
<P>
The billboards will be moved to the Airport Highway and the two
commercial streets of Xidan and Wangfujing near Tian'anmen,
according to the official.

A solemn image will now return to Chang'an Avenue, the
political heart of China, he said, adding that this is also
appropriate for the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the People

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks' Losses Soar in First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks have been
suffering deepened losses in the first half of this year due
mainly to provisions against possible loan defaults.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's second largest private commercial bank, Thai Farmers
Bank, reported to the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) on
Wednesday an unaudited result with a significant loss of 17.3
billion baht (467.6 million U.S. dollars) for the first half of
this year against 3.92 billion baht (105.9 million dollars) over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai Military Bank also reported a huge loss of about 5.97
billion baht (161.4 million dollars) during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Ayudhya, the country's fifth largest bank, reported a
net loss of 15.6 billion baht (421.6 million dollars) in the first
half of 1999, a steep increase from 7.4 billion baht (200 million
dollars) loss in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
DBS Thai Danu Bank, majority owned by Development Bank of
Singapore, posted a net loss of 9.97 billion baht (269.5 million
dollars), rising from 5.33 billion baht (144 million dollars) for
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank of Asia, taken by ABN-Amro Bank, registered its
loss at 1.8 billion baht (18.6 million dollars), better than 6.7
billion baht (181.1 million dollars) loss in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Three banks, including the state-own Krung Thai Bank, Bangkok
Bank, and Siam Commercial Bank, are yet to report their second
quarter result to SET.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that all banks are expected to post hefty losses
for the second quarter and the first half of this year as
provisioning against non-performing loans (NPLs) continues, due to
the central bank's June 30 deadline for all banks to meet at least
40 percent of the total required provisions.
</P>
<P>
NPLs in the system represented 47 percent of total loans at the
end of March.

<HEADLINE> Spain's PM Holds Talks With Lebanese Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar Wednesday held talks with Lebanese leaders on the Middle
East peace process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He met with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, House Speaker
Nabih Berri on Wednesday and Prime Minister Salim Hoss Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Aznar expressed optimism on the future of
the peace making in the region, saying there were favorable
conditions for the resumption of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But he said that there were obstacles challenging the revival
of peace talks, adding that courage was required to overcome
them.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish prime minister pledged efforts to advance the peace
process under the 1991 Madrid peace conference and the
implementation of the United Nations resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the U.N. after Israeli first
invasion of Lebanon in 1978, called for a unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Aznar also co-chaired with Hoss a
signing ceremony for a protocol under which Lebanon will receive
100 million U.S. dollars soft loan from Spain and a memorandum of
understanding to enhance trade.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the 11th source of import for Lebanon, with annual
imports exceeding 162 million dollars while Lebanon exports 5.5
million dollars worth of goods a year to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, heading a high-powered Spanish economic delegation,
arrived here from Amman Tuesday night where he had held talks with
King Abdullah after a visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to visit Israel Wednesday afternoon and
the Palestinian self-ruled territories during his current
Mideast tour.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Mekere Morauta, prime minister of
Papua New Guinea (PNG), said on Wednesday that the country's "One
China" policy remains intact.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed to Xinhua, Morauta said that "normal
procedures for opening diplomatic relations with other countries,
which have applied since independence, were not properly followed
in the case of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"Papua New Guinea's long-standing 'One China' policy of
maintaining state-to-state relations with the People's Republic of
China, therefore, remains intact," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he directed the Department of Foreign Affairs to
prepare options for cabinet which will allow PNG to honor existing
agreements and further strengthen relations with China.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed by officials on important foreign policy
issues, Morauta expressed "the greatest surprise and concern at
the irregular way in which the former government attempted to open
'formal diplomatic ties' with Taiwan."

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes New Guinea's "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua)-- China today welcomed what it called
the "wise decision" by Papua New Guinea's new government to cancel
its communique on "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said that the Chinese
government appreciates the decision made by the new government
headed by Prime Minster Mekere Morauta to pursue the principles of
the 1976 communique on diplomatic ties between China and Papua New
Guinea and to correct the erroneous actions of the former
government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement today, Morauta said that his government is
sticking to the "One China" policy, safeguarding diplomatic ties
with the People's Republic of China, and devoting itself to
furthering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the communique on "establishing diplomatic ties"
by the former government with Taiwan on July 5 as invalid and
unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that everyone knows that there is but one China in
the world and the Government of the People's Republic of China is
the sole legitimate government of China and that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory. Taiwan authorities, she
said, resort to any means in their "money diplomacy" in an attempt
to create "two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan" in South Pacific
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Such wanton and despicable action in attempting to split the
motherland will meet with strong opposition from the Chinese
people, including Taiwan compatriots, and also criticism from the
people of South Pacific, including those of Papua New Guinea, and
the people of the rest of the world, Zhang said, stressing that
Taiwan authorities' attempt to split the motherland will surely be
met with complete failure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government pays great attention to developing
friendship and relations of cooperation with Papua New Guinea, and
the forging of diplomatic ties has proven that it is in the long-
term and fundamental interests of the people of both countries to
develop bilateral cooperation in various fields, Zhang stressed,
adding that the Chinese government and people are willing to join
the government and people of Papua New Guinea to further the
friendship and relations of cooperation into the 21st century.

people in their strive for establishing an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Manages to Prevent Pork Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- To prevent corruption in the
disposition of the countrywide development fund (CDF) of members
of Congress, the Philippine government has set in place a new
electronic system of public bidding to ensure transparency in all
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday in a radio
program that the CDF that will be released to congressmen and
senators could not be viewed as pork barrel since the disposition
of the funds will be in accordance to the government's pro-poor
programs.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the only role the legislators will take in
the disposition of the CDF would be the identification of projects
in their respective legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
Instead of giving the funds directly to the legislators,
Estrada said, it will be the concerned government agencies that
will handle the public bidding, which will be open for public
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has instructed the Department of Budget and
Management to distribute to all government departments the
software for the electronic bidding system it has developed, to
ensure transparency.
</P>
<P>
Even in the identification of projects, he said, only projects
that are included in the pro-poor priority program shall be funded
out of the CDF.
</P>
<P>
"The release of the funds will only be focused on irrigation,
farm-to-market roads, socialized housing and school buildings.
These are the only projects they could identify for funding out of
the CDF," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Estrada abolished pork barrel when he assumed office last year
because of the wastage in limited government resources.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that over 20 percent of the country's national
budget is wasted on corruption, part of which is traced to port
barrel misuse.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian army on Wednesday seized
three tons of narcotics near Zahedan, the southeastern border
province of Sistan-Baluchestan, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Iranian army also confiscated an
amount of arms and 20 camels carrying the drugs, but the
smugglers fled from the country after armed clashes with Iranian
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Iranian army seized over 16 tons of
various narcotics and the Iranian security forces seized 14 tons
of drugs in the province since the beginning of the Iranian
calendar year (started on March 21).
</P>
<P>
Iran launched large-scale anti-drug campaigns after the Iranian
Majlis (parliament) passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989 and
the number of confiscated narcotics increased drastically in
recent years with 195 tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iran seized 54 tons of various drugs during the first three

BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will take alternative
measures other than waiting for voluntary repatriation to
accelerate and simplify the process of the return of Lao refugees,
the Thai Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that officials from Thai and Lao foreign
ministries and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) held a consultative meeting on July 20 in the Lao capital
Vientiane to discuss strategies for the return of the Lao refugees
in Ban Napho Camp in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that voluntary repatriation should be
considered as the first option, but after it was proven to be
inefficient "alternatives recognized as being acceptable under
international practice would be examined", according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
A technical committee composed of representatives from the
three parties will convene within two weeks in Thailand to
consider the modalities for the return to ensure all refugees in
the camp will be repatriated by the end of December, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR will provide adequate repatriation and reintegration
assistance to the returnees in recognition of their special needs,
taking into account their long-term stay in the camp, according to
the statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- France's national carrier Air France
will resume flights to Algeria, probably next week, after nearly
five years of suspension in the wake of a terrorist attack in late
1994.
</P>
<P>
Air France said on Wednesday that a technical mission of Air
France will leave for Algiers next week to evaluate the conditions
of security at the Algiers airport, the scene of a hostage-taking
by Islamic militants of an Air France Airbus plane in December
1994.
</P>
<P>
The hostage-taking ended in a bloody storming by a special unit
of the French army, triggering all European air companies to stop
flights to Algeria, which was in the heyday of an Islamic
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Air France refused on Wednesday to comment on a report by the
Algerian press that it will resume flights next week.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, three private air companies of Algeria have
accused the French government of prejudice by rejecting their
demand for licenses to fly from Algeria to France.
</P>
<P>
The three companies, Khalifa Airways, Sahara Airlines and
Antinea Airlines, plan to fly commercial planes from Algiers to
Paris, Lyon and Marseille.
</P>
<P>
Air Algerie, Algeria's state air company, is the only air
company flying tens of thousands of passengers from Algeria to
France each week.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has appealed to France to resume flights as soon as
possible, because Air Algerie, which has only 40 planes, cannot
provide enough flights to an increasing number of passengers.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Suffers Big Loss over Fish Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has so far lost 10.4
million U.S. dollars of its total income from fish exports since
the European Union put a ban on fish from Uganda in March this
year, a local report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fish income hit its highest in Febuary when it earned
the country 4.1 million dollars, according to Marina Reusens,
secretary general of Uganda Fish Processors and Exporters
Association (UFPEA).
</P>
<P>
The figure declined to 3.7 million dollars in March and it has
continued to fall. In May, Uganda exported only 490 tons of fish,
down from 1,200 tons in January.The figure is expected to fall
further because the European market is being saturated with fish
from other suppliers, Reusens said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general said due to catching fish with poison,
Uganda had lost the European market and it would be difficult to
regain it.
</P>
<P>
Another UFPEA official said they have put in place quality
control systems, including hazard contamination checks for all the
11 member companies to follow so as to ensure that the quality of
fish for export is maintained.

<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the World Bank have
pledged 16 million U.S. dollars and nine million dollars
respectively for the reconstruction of war-ravaged Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Joe Blell, Sierra Leonean High Commissioner to Nigeria, said at
a diplomatic forum organized by the Nigerian Association of
Foreign Affairs Correspondents that his country looked forward to
receiving the money, Nigerian newspaper Daily Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said on Tuesday that the money would enable his country to
rebuild the economy ravaged by an eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
On the recent peace agreement brokered by some African
countries in Togolese capital of Lome on July 7, the envoy
expressed optimism that the agreement would succeed "because of
the calibre of people involved in the making of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by the Sierra Leonean government and the
rebel Revolutionary United Front provides for the participation of
the rebels in the government, including their leader Foday Sankoh
who would head a government department responsible for minerals.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the west African country estimate about 100
million dollars would be required for reconstruction as the
country's infrastructure virtually collapsed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the rebels agreed to lay down their
weapons in return for a share of power in a government of national
unity.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Failed Reform Helps Preserve Bamboo Slips: Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
concluded that the bamboo and wooden slips that were discovered in
1996 in a 1,700-year-old well in a downtown part of Changsha, the
capital of Hunan Province, had been preserved because of failed
political reforms in the state of Wu (222-280) during the Three
Kingdoms Period (220-280).
</P>
<P>
One of the archaeologists, Qiu Donglian of the Changsha
Cultural Relics Work Team, says that the 100,000 slips, the
largest number ever found in one place in China, are one of the
most significant archaeological finds in China in this century.
</P>
<P>
He says that they recorded economic development and political
and legal systems, and culture and education during the Wu and
were buried in the well the year after political reforms failed in
237.
</P>
<P>
After two years of research, archaeologists have decided that
the slips were not buried to protect them from damage during
periods of warfare because in fact the kingdom and its neighboring
states were at peace at the time they were buried. They agreed
instead that the slips were removed after the failure of political
reforms and were kept in the well as canceled documents.
</P>
<P>
Around the year 235, Sun Quan, the king of Wu, had a plan to
centralize his kingdom, but most local officials in the kingdom
went on doing things their own way. Sun decided to implement
strict reforms in centralizing supervision and archival controls
of local governments, but locals officials and some senior central
government leaders wanted to stop the reforms.

<HEADLINE> 2 People Die, 14 Hospitalized Because Of Paint Fumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Two construction workers died and
another 14 people were hospitalized in the Chinese capital after
breathing air that contained excessive amounts of a toxic chemical.
</P>
<P>
Workers discovered 4 of them lying on the ground at a
construction site in the downtown area early Tuesday morning. They
had been painting a new building, and 2 of them were already dead.
They were believed to have drowned after falling in a puddle when
they passed out. The other 2 and 12 workers who came to the rescue
were soon hospitalized, after complaining of dizziness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the National Poisoning Control Center, after
inspecting the site and taking air samples, concluded that the men
had inhaled excessive amounts of dimethylbenzene xylene from the
paint. Levels were 10 or more times higher than the safe level,
according to Zhang Shoulin, one of the staff members, who
explained that the chemical agent could harm the central nervous
system and circulatory system and result in a coma or death.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Life Times reported today that the 14 are out of
danger but that 3 are still under intensive care.

<HEADLINE> Four Chinese Executed For Police Car Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese men were given death
sentences at a public trial today in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region for blowing up an emergency police car and for
homicide.
</P>
<P>
Their sentences were carried out immediately after the trial.
Nine other people involved were given prison sentences ranging in
length from four to ten years for robbery and aiding and abetting
the four defendants.
</P>
<P>
The Yinchuan Intermediate People's Court found that Xie Jianwen,
Yang Jie, Yang Jun, and Zhang Yanbin stole 120 kg. of dynamite and
940 detonators from a storehouse at the Lingxin Coal Mine early on
the morning of March 31 and, on the morning of April 20, buried
the dynamite on a remote stretch of road in Yinchuan. They then
asked an accomplice, Lu Wenlin, to phone the "110" emergency line
and when a police car arrived on the scene they detonated the
explosives. Three policemen in the car were killed instantly and a
fourth who was still alive was killed with a knife.
</P>
<P>
To cover up their crimes, Xie Jianwen, Yang Jie and Yang Jun,
then killed Lu and another accomplice on April 27 and buried their
bodies in a sanddune. Xie and Yang Jie then fled to the city of
Foshan in Guangdong Province and during their stay at a local
hotel, killed a roommate and took some cash from him.
</P>
<P>
The four men were given the death sentence in the first ruling,
but one appealed the sentence to a higher court on the grounds
that the punishment was excessive. The Higher People's Court of
Ningxia however upheld the original ruling.

<HEADLINE> China to Help Another 20 Million People Escape Poverty (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21(Xinhua) -- The Chinese government says it is
determined to help another 20 million people get out of poverty by
the end of next year, according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Wen Jiabao told a recent national conference on
poverty relief that when the government's plan is fulfilled, the
number of people living in poverty will drop from last year's 42
million to some 20 million, thus generally meeting the central
government goal of providing adequate food and clothing for most
rural people by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
For the past two decades, and in the past 5 years especially,
China has made a strenuous effort to help rural areas get rid of
poverty by allocating a large amount of funds for economic
development, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the number of rural people living
below the poverty line had dropped from 250 million in 1978 to 42
million last year, and a marked improvement had been made in the
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
This has helped both economic growth and social stability and
means a great success for China and the rest of the world,
especially in view of the fact that the number of people living in
poverty worlwide has been increasing markedly, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the governments at various levels to make an even
greater effort to further reduce poverty because the conditions of
people living in poverty are extremely difficult.

Making proper use of the funds is vital to the success of

misusing the funds will face severe penalties.
</P>
<P>
Wen asked local governments to help rural people in poverty-
stricken areas to improve farm production conditions and
infrastructure to help them increase their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Coastal regions and other relatively developed regions need to
make a contribution to the poverty relief effort in the interior
so that the national economy develops in a more coordinated way,

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Stay in Hospital for Up to 2 weeks: Hospital Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian President
Soeharto has suffered a mild stroke and would remain in hospital
for the next one to two weeks, the chief of the Pertamina Hospital
where Soeharto has been admitted said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"His treatment would take one to two weeks," Sudjono
Hartoadmodjo said at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He said Soeharto was originally scheduled to have a routine
medical check-up at the hospital on July 24.
</P>
<P>
"But yesterday (July 20) he felt listless and pain around his
head and he was rushed here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudjono confirmed that Soeharto was taken to his VVIP room on
the sixth floor in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
"Had he walked, he would have been worse," he said.
</P>
<P>
The medical team which examined Soeharto has found signs of a
mild stroke. But after giving him treatment, he has begun to get
well.
</P>
<P>
Sudjono denied any risk of death. He said Soeharto did not
suffer cerebral hemorrhage and can communicate but has been
forbidden to walk around.
</P>
<P>
He said strokes usually result from high-blood pressure, aging
and smoking and not from psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years, went to Germany to
undergo treatment for high blood pressure and kidney problems in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Separately, former Vice President Try Soetrisno said the health
condition of the former president is improving.
</P>
<P>
"His health condition is improving but examinations should be
continued," he said, confirming that he visited Soeharto in his
room Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"He did not say any word, because he had to rest. I only looked
at him. I did not want to disturb him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Influential Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid, Coordinating
Minister for People's Welfare/Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono,
Transmigration Minister Hendropriyono, Communications Minister
Giri Suseno and a number of government officials on Wednesday
failed to visit Soeharto in his VVIP room at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Alwi Shihab, who accompanied Wahid, told reporters that all
visitors were barred one meter away from the room where the
78-year-old former president is confined.

BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will take measures to
ensure that its workers in Israel will not be deprived of their
eligible benefits and welfare, a senior Labor and Welfare Ministry
official said here Wednesday.
</P>

Prasong Ranananda, permanent secretary for the Ministry of

workers the minimum wages or legally required overtime pay.

Meanwhile, Thai Foreign Ministry Spokesman Don Pramudwinai said
 Thai Ambassador to Israel Domedej Bunnag is expected to meet
Israeli Labor Minister this week to discuss the issue and seek
help in addressing the problem.
</P>

overtime pay of 120 baht (3.2 dollars) a day.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Short Life Span Predicted for Zambia's Major Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The life span of Zambia's major
copper mines will not exceed 30 years, a resident geologist has
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency Wednesday quoted Fidelis Chanda as saying in
northern Zambia that the copper deposits at Nkana, Nchanga and
Chambeshi mines only have life spans of no more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Only Konkola Deep Mine has another 50 years' life span, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The geologist therefore concluded that mineral explorations
should be encouraged in the new mines because it is difficult and
expensive to continue mining in the old mines where the deposits
are difficult to find deep underground.
</P>
<P>
The new explorations such as those at the Lumwano Mine in
North-Western province which has virgin deposits of copper ore
must be encouraged, particularly that the price of copper has been
dropping in the international market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chanda is attending a three-day international geological
correlation program conference in Kitwe in northern Zambia. The
meeting has attracted participants from Europe, Asia, the United
States, the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
Australia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, exploration is undertaken in the region to
ascertain the mineral deposits potential where they have not been
fully exploited.
</P>
<P>
Nkana and Nchanga are the two biggest copper mines in the
copper- producing country.

HOHHOT, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Large numbers of fossilized shells

Region.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have unearthed five honeycomb-like fossil

have many layers of small ball-shaped shells about five
centimeters thick. Local officials say they discovered the fossils
by accident during work on the city's sewage system recently.

Archeologists say the fossils prove the theory that the
Mongolian Plateau was an ocean and are useful for the study of
biological evolution and the age of various geological strata.
</P>
<P>
Field studies have found fossils scattered widely and in large
numbers around the discovery site and the local government has
taken steps to protect the site for large-scale excavation in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Meetings End Before ASEAN Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) closed on Wednesday their two
preparatory meetings ahead of the 32nd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting
(AMM) scheduled for July 23 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The text of a draft communique was completed by ASEAN officials
at the end of the ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC) meeting and the
Senior Officials' Meeting (SOM), a Singapore Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The draft communique will now be submitted to the ASEAN foreign
ministers for consideration and adoption, she said.
</P>
<P>
She also said a commission will be formed on Saturday to
implement the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free
Zone which was signed by ASEAN in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be made up of the ASEAN foreign ministers,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign ministers from ASEAN member countries are
arriving in Singapore to attend the annual ministerial event.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN includes Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
This year's AMM will for the first time bring together all the
10 Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Foreign Minister Shunmugam Jayakumar said in his
closing speech at the ASC that ASEAN has emerged from the
financial and economic crisis in better shape than last year.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN's reputation and credibility may have been dented, but
one year from Manila, ASEAN's luster is slowing but surely being
restored." he added.
</P>
<P>
The last AMM, the 31st, was held in Manila, the Philippines,
last July.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA), adopted at the
ASEAN summit in Hanoi last December, will be an agenda item for
this year's Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) on July 27 and 28.
</P>
<P>
The HPA aims to strengthen ASEAN's priorities in areas of
economic recovery, sustainable development, environmental issues
and external relations.
</P>
<P>
The PMC involves all the 10 ASEAN member countries and their 10
dialogue partners, including China, Russia, the United States,
Japan and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
During the AMM meeting here, Jayakumar said, the ASEAN foreign
ministers will for the first time have an informal retreat on
Friday to discuss among themselves issues related to ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He expected the meeting to be "fruitful and constructive," but
added, "Not everything can be settled at one meeting."
</P>
<P>
The AMM meeting will be followed by the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) on Monday, which involves the 22 ARF members, including
China, Russia, the European Union and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Gives Support to Science High Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- As the first step to set up science
high schools all over the country, the Philippine government has
given strong support to 16 regional science high schools in the
last year, a report of the Presidential Palace said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said these schools have been furnished with
information technology equipment like computers, fax machines,
videocassette recorders and TV monitors in the last year.
</P>
<P>
On top of the heftier public investments in these schools, the
government has also tapped support of private institutions for the
supply of computer hardware, computer library materials and
science laboratory equipment to these schools, said the report.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the plan, the government conducted last summer a
special training program for 10,000 high-school teachers in
science, math and English subjects.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the government plans to train 26,000
more public-school teachers under the multi-year
Philippine-Australian Project in Basic Education.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the government wants to establish one science
high school in every province "to provide useful education for
those who want it but cannot afford it," said the report.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Falls Over Foreign Debt Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's shilling fell sharply
against the U. S. dollar at Tuesday's opening at the forex market
after the government admitted it had delayed repaying its
external debt.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading Tuesday, the shilling had dropped from
an average of 72.19 shillings to the dollar to around 74
shillings, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Francis Masakhalia said Monday that due
to "administrative delays", the government was late in paying 12
million U.S. dollars in foreign debt repayments but denied a local
newspaper report that it was defaulting.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that Kenya never defaulted on its
undertakings, and would continue to honor external debt
obligations as they fall due.
</P>
<P>
Speculators moved in to buy foreign exchange in the hope that
the government will move into the market for its forex needs,
weakening the shilling drastically.
</P>
<P>
The shilling fell on Tuesday, hitting a low of 74.00/50 to the
dollar, but was later helped by coffee inflow to recover
73.45/85.

GUANGZHOU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, used 1.8 billion U.S. dollars of
overseas funds in the first six months this year, up 1.6 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, foreign direct investment (FDI)
made up 1.6 billion U.S. dollars of the total, up nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The city's exports also have begun to recover due to factors
including the economic recovery in Southeast Asia, increased tax
rebates for export companies, and private companies being allowed
to engage in foreign trade independently.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the city exported 4.4 billion U.S.
dollars worth of commodities, down by 8.5 percent from the same
period last year, but the decrease was eight percentage points
lower than that in the first quarter of the year, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Central China City Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's
Hubei Province approved 112 foreign-funded projects in the first
half of this year, a local government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The contracted investment of these projects totals 509 million
U.S. dollars, up 43 percent over the same period of last year,
said Qin Feng, an official in charge of the city's Foreign
Investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the 73 newly approved foreign-funded enterprises, 61 are
engaged in industry and real estate, and their combined
contractual value accounts for 90 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The contracted investment of enterprises funded by the United
Stated, Japan, and Europe nearly doubled, though Hong Kong still
remains the mainstay of overseas investment in Wuhan. Nearly 40
percent, or 30 of the foreign-funded firms approved in the first
six months are Hong Kong companies.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,590 foreign-funded enterprises have been
established in Wuhan bringing in a total investment of 12 billion
U.S. dollars since the first one was approved in 1984. The city
ranked seventh in China in terms of the use of overseas investment
last year.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang's Handicrafts Popular Among Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- With more overseas tourists coming
to northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, local
handicrafts have become very popular and an important source of
income for many local residents.
</P>
<P>
Tourists come to Xinjiang not only to enjoy the natural scenery,
but also to buy various handicrafts made by the people of local
minorities such as Uygur, Tajik and Kirgiz, according to local
tourism officials.
</P>
<P>
Kashi, a major border town in southern Xinjiang, has become one
of the most important tourist sites in the region with its famous
bazaar selling handicrafts ranging from musical instruments to
jewelry, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 800-meter-long bazaar, with a history of more than 150
years, features more than 90 shops selling bronze ware, gold and
silver jewelry, carpets, tapestries, silk, knives and all sorts of
other handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
Memeti Yiming, the owner of a musical instrument shop at the
bazaar, said his shop is frequented by foreign tourists attracted
by the different kinds of hand-made folk instruments.
</P>
<P>
He said he can earn more than 3,000 yuan a month, much higher
than the average income of the local residents.
</P>
<P>
"To increase my business, I have been teaching myself English
and Japanese," he said.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of Xinjiang, handicraft such as hats and boots
have also become very popular among tourists, according to tourism
officials, who believe the tourism industry in Xinjiang has great
potential.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jun, director of the Xinjiang Economic Research Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that handicrafts
are vital to Xinjiang's tourism industry, which will surely boost
the region's economic development.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Seeks Lamb Settlement With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has formally
requested consultations to settle a dispute with the United States
over its lamb export under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules,
New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted New Zealand Minister for International Trade Lockwood
Smith as saying the request was lodged last Friday, following the
U.S. decision to impose trade restrictions on New Zealand and
Australian lamb imports.
</P>
<P>
The initiation of dispute settlement consultations is the first
 step toward obtaining a binding decision by the WTO on the
legality of the U.S. measure.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand's request for dispute settlement consultations is
a serious step and it has not been taken lightly," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"But the trade barriers imposed by the U.S. against New Zealand
lamb imports are in our view contrary to WTO rules," he added.
</P>
<P>
The first dispute settlement consultation is likely to take
place in Geneva next month, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. President Bill Clinton endorsed an
across-the-board tariff on all imports of lamb from New Zealand
and Australia, two major lamb suppliers to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the United States has imposed a 9-percent
tariff on existing volumes of lamb imports from the two countries
and a 40-percent tariff on imports above that level. Both tariffs
are scheduled to reduce over three years.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Clinton signed the decision, New Zealand Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley issued a statement, describing the decision
as "totally unacceptable." It "will lead to World Trade
Organization action," she said.

<HEADLINE> Waldner Once Again Tops China's "Blacklist" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jan-Ove Waldner, Vladimir Samsonov
and Zoran Primorac are once again listed as the top threats to
Chinese table tennis players bidding for a clean title sweep at
the Netherlands' World Championships early August.
</P>
<P>
"Waldner, Samsonov and Primorac remain our main rivals, just as
they were two years ago," said Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua, who
nicknamed the all-mighty European table tennis trio as "Three
Tigers."
</P>
<P>
Waldner, 33, the only table tennis "Grand Slam" winner and one
of the sport's all time greats, has been causing troubles to
Chinese since 1980s when Cai was a player. Samsonov has become
China's headache for just several years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which won all but the men's singles in the
1997 World Championships, aim to wrap up all five gold medals in
Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The "blacklist" of title contenders from outside China, which
was drawn by Cai Zhenhua and his assistant Lu Yuansheng, rates the
top three European players as China's major threats among six "
very strong rivals".
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the only player in the world who has won the Olympic,
World Championship and World Cup titles, used his experience to
regain the world singles championship in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
"Waldner is a magician, an artist of table tennis," Cai said. "
He may play poorly in a lesser tournament, but in a major event,
he can easily motivate himself."
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, from Belarus, beat five Chinese en route to picking
up the singles silver in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Primorac, twice World Cup winner, has regained his top
form after winning the Brazilian Open on June 27.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Jorg Rosskopf, current World Cup holder, Asian Games
champion Kim Taek Soo of South Korea and former world champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien of France will also pose great threat to
Chinese, said Cai.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yuansheng expects Chinese women players to meet strong
challenges from former Chinese playing for their adopted countries
or regions.
</P>
<P>
"The main rivals will be these familiar with our styles and
tactics," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Topping Lu's list of possible rivals are Chen Jing of Chinese
Taipei and Chire Koyama of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, the 1988 Olympic champion, won the silver medal for
Chinese Taipei both in the 1993 Worlds and the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Koyama caused an uproar in China with an upset victory over
China's then world No. 1 Deng Yaping at the Hiroshima Asian Games
in 1994. She skipped the individual events in the 1995 Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"We have devised new tactics against our possible challengers,"
Lu said. "The Chinese players have strong confidence even though
Deng Yaping has called it quits."
</P>
<P>
Deng, muti-world champion, has opted out of the championships
to focus on her English-language study in Nottingham University in
Britain.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Book Fair '99 that
features over 360 publishers and book companies worldwide was
opened Wednesday at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Book
Fair covers a total exhibition area of 20,000 square meters and
displays a variety of newly released titles.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Anna Lai, acting executive
director of the Trade Development Council, said the flourishing
publishing industry is a catalyst to cultural development as well
as a corner stone for the free flow of information.
</P>
<P>
"It also contributes to Hong Kong's economic development and
enhances competitiveness of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR)," Lai noted.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1990, the annual Book Fair has been
playing a major role in the growth of the local printing and
publishing industry, she added.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, Hong Kong was the second largest supplier of books
for both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, and ranked third for the
United States," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing a marketing platform for publishers and
book companies, the Fair also includes seminars of renowned
Chinese writers and offers a forum for copyright trading for
agents and publishers in its trade section -- the International
Copyright Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Book Fair will run through July 26.

JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As Prime Minister Ehud Barak wrapped up his six-day visit to
the United States Tuesday, sources said they expect a reaction
from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to Barak's feelers within six
to eight weeks. They said Barak laid out specific suggestions to
U.S. President Bill Clinton regarding the resumption of talks with
Syria, and they were in the process of being relayed to Damascus
by U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat said
he does not accept Barak's proposal for a 15-month timetable for
completing peace agreements. He insisted that Israel waste no
time in implementing the commitments it undertook in the Wye
River Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Reliable sources in Washington said Iran had passed on
messages to Israel through mediators, suggesting that the two
sides negotiate a deal over the release of the 13 arrested
Iranian Jews. But Israel rejected the suggestion, saying that the
issue of arrested Jews should not be linked with the issue of
relationship between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Export Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's export earnings have been
on the rise this year compared with 1998, the Export Board of
Zambia (EBZ) disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Executive director of the board Johnson Mwenya said
non-traditional exports during May 1999 recorded earnings worth
23.08 million U.S. dollars compared with 22.13 million dollars in
April.
</P>
<P>
"On a year to year basis, earnings in May were about two
percent higher than the same month in 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
While copper exports previously earned about 80 percent of the
country's foreign exchange revenue, the non-traditional exports
now are accounting for about 33.2 percent of its foreign exchange
earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, The Post, Wednesday quoted Mwenya as saying
that despite the fact that international prices of most
commodities had continued being somewhat poor, non-traditional
exports earnings would eventually move to positive growth with the
onset of the marketing season for agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
"Primary agricultural commodities earned 12.6 million dollars
from January to May," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwenya said the primary agricultural products sector was the
largest, contributing between 20 to 30 percent to visible
non-traditional exports annually.
</P>
<P>
He said fresh flowers and vegetables were also doing extremely
well having earned 20.8 million dollars and 7.9 million dollars
respectively from January to May.
</P>
<P>
The five major markets for Zambia's exports, in terms of
significance, are the Netherlands, Britain, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, South Africa and Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Standing Committee,
which met here for two days, and senior officials from the
regional grouping Wednesday ended their preparations for the
annual ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for July 23 and
24.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC) meeting was held to prepare
the agenda for the 32nd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) which for
the first time brings together all the 10 Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Foreign Minister Shunmugam Jayakumar said in his
closing speech that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) has emerged from the financial and economic crisis in
better shape than last year.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN's reputation and credibility may have been dented, but
one year from Manila, ASEAN's luster is slowing but surely being
restored," he added.
</P>
<P>
The last AMM, the 31st, was held in Manila, the Philippines,
last July.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA), adopted at the
ASEAN summit in Hanoi last December, will be an agenda item for
this year's Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) on July 27 and 28.
</P>
<P>
The HPA aims to strengthen ASEAN's priorities in areas of
economic recovery, sustainable development, environmental issues
and external relations.
</P>
<P>
The PMC involves all the 10 ASEAN member countries and their 10
dialogue partners, including China, Russia, the United States,
Japan and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
During the AMM meeting here, Jayakumar said, the ASEAN foreign
ministers will for the first time have an informal retreat on
Friday to discuss among themselves issues related to ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He expected the meeting to be "fruitful and constructive," but
added, "Not everything can be settled at one meeting."
</P>
<P>
A Singapore Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday that the
officials at the ASC were going through the documents prepared for
the AMM, including the text of a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
She said there had been no substantive problems over the text
and it was just a "matter of finding the language acceptable to
everyone."
</P>
<P>
The AMM meeting will be followed by the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) on Monday, which involves the 22 ARF members, including
China, Russia, the European Union and the United States.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Indonesia.

TOKYO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Wednesday, which was stirred by Tuesday's decline on Wall Street

</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parliament Approves Extra Job Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The extra budget cleared the House of Councilors (upper house)
with the support of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and
its coalition partner, the Liberal Party (LP).
</P>
<P>
On July 8, the Japanese government adopted the supplementary
budget, the first for the current fiscal year which began April,
hoping it would create more than 700,000 new jobs to tackle the
country's massive unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The job budget was approved by the House of Representatives (
lower house) last Thursday and by the upper house's Budget
Committee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The extra budget allocates 519.8 billion yen to a general
account. Along with 23.1 billion yen (about 189 million dollars)
in new spending allotted to special accounts such as one covering
employment insurance, the amount of fresh government spending for
job increase totals 542.9 billion yen (4.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The general-account portion of the auxiliary budget features
204.7 billion yen (1.7 billion dollars) in spending for the
central and local governments to hire about 300,000 more workers
on a temporary basis within two years.
</P>
<P>
Other major pillars of the supplementary budget are 200.3
billion yen (1.6 billion dollars) in spending to tackle the low
birthrate, and 90.0 billion yen (738 million dollars) to create
150,000 new jobs in 15 promising industries including medical and
welfare sectors, telecommunications industries and environment-
related businesses.
</P>
<P>
Japan's unemployment rate stood at a record of 4.8 percent in
March and April, dropping in May slightly, to 4.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champ Liu Says World Singles Title Could Be His </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Dual Olympic table tennis champion
Liu Guoliang said it was time to have the world singles
championship to his credit.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is simple and direct -- the world singles title," said
Liu, the singles-doubles champion in the Atlanta Olympic Games and
1996 World Cup winner.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast-attacker predicted that he would be
unstoppable as long as he had a flying start in the 45th World
Championships to be held early August in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The first three rounds will be the most difficult since I have
to adjust myself to best form," said Liu. "If I enter the singles
semifinals, the gold medal will be mine for sure."
</P>
<P>
Liu finished second to teammate Kong Linghui in the 1995 Worlds
and fell apart under the barrages of less known Yugoslavian
Aleksandar Karakasevic in the second round of last championships.
</P>
<P>
"I will try not to lose concentration in early rounds and I
always play better in later rounds," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu is set to be bundled with twice World Cup winner Zoran
Primorac of Croatia in July 31 draw which seeds players according
to world rankings.
</P>
<P>
"I will meet Primorac in the semifinals if we both make it,"
Liu said. "I'm sure I will overcome him."
</P>
<P>
Liu also said he respected Kim Taek Soo but was not afraid of
him despite three straight losses to the South Korean, arguably
the world best topspin player in penhold grip.
</P>
<P>
Liu has a good record again Europeans and has beaten reigning
world champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden five times in a row.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who has never won the world singles championship, is just
one trophy away from Waldner's greatness. Waldner is only "Grand
Slam" winner of Olympic, World Championship and World Cup singles
titles in the world.
</P>
<P>
Liu shot to fame as a 16-year-old at the expense of Waldner in
the China Open months before the 1992 Olympic Games, winning in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang, whose name means "pillar of the country" in
Chinese, was thus hailed as a reviver of the Chinese traditional
penhold style, which was predicted to end up in a Darwinian-style
extinction as more players were turning to handshake grip.
</P>
<P>
Playing a modified penhold style, Liu sticks rubbers onto both
sides of the racket and plays top spins with backhand.
</P>
<P>
Liu's upset victory over Waldner, who had been taking Chinese
as easy preys since two-time world champion Jiang Jialiang retired,
was a morale booster for the Chinese penholders. Most of them have
resorted to this modified style.
</P>
<P>
Waldner regarded his first loss to Liu as a mere lack of
concentration, promising to give the Chinese youngster a lesson in
their next meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was Liu who gave Waldner a lesson.
</P>
<P>
Leading by five points and with as many serves in his hands,
Waldner wilted under barrages of Liu's backhand top spins and
forehand flat shots, bowing out of the men's singles competition
at the 1995 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Liu's third fight with Waldner was a clash of two contrasting
styles and the world best servers. It turned out that Liu was a
summit too high for Waldner to scale as the Swede's rallying play
was a mere interlude to Liu's winner smashes.
</P>
<P>
En route to the final against Waldner, Liu had beaten European
aces Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, Zoran Primorac of Croatia,
Patrick Chila of France and Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
In the Italian Open final last October, Liu trounced the Swede
three to nil. Three months later, Liu downed Waldner in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Despite an impressive record against Europeans, Liu often falls
victim to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
He has never beaten Kong Linghui in major competitions and
holds a poor record against Wang Tao, who didn't make the
Eindhoven-bound squad.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Trade Expected to Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The volume of Sino-Russian trade
for the first five months this year was 2.257 billion U.S. dollars,
up 0.7 percent, and showing an increase for the first time in two
years, according to Customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures show that 1.82 billion U.S. dollars of
this trade were in imports, up 34 percent, while only 430 million
U.S. dollars were in exports, a decline of 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists estimate that this trend will be unchanged over the
next few months, and imports will continue to rise, though the
percentage may be decline slightly.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Russian bilateral trade now shows signs of recovery, and
we are quite positive about its further development," said a
Russian trade official.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the total volume of trade between the
two countries in 1997 was 6.12 billion U.S. dollars, 10.6 percent
less than 1996. The figure last year was 5.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the Chinese currency, its relaxed import
policy, and its more positive fiscal policy this year have all
inspired the domestic need for raw materials and some types of
machinery.
</P>
<P>
The economic recovery of Russia, the increase of its foreign
reserves, and the abolition of its 3 percent additional tax on
imports on March 1 have also contributed to the trade rebound.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are now striving to accelerate their
domestic economic reforms oriented toward economic globalization,
improve the trade environment, increase their proportion of the hi-
tech products, and develop their cooperation in raw materials,
timber, nuclear power, chemicals, electronics, and light
industries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Algeria Close to Arms Deal: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is close to
concluding a 700-million-rand (117-million-U.S. dollar) deal to
sell Rooivalk helicopters to Algeria, The Star newspaper quoted
South African ambassador to Algeria, Mo Shaik, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shaik said that the whole Rooivalk deal is very close to
conclusion, and other sources said a decision was expected in
September, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The deal, if successful, would be the first overseas sale of
the South African-made helicopters. South Africa's state-owned
arms manufacturer Denel has been struggling to sell the aircraft
on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources as saying that negotiations were
taking place with the Algerian government about a possible initial
order for one squadron of about 10 to 12 aircraft for a total of
up to 700 million rand, depending on exact numbers, equipment and
logistical support arrangements.
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility of a further three squadrons being
purchased, which would push the total order up to nearly three
billion rand (500 million dollars), providing a tremendous boost
for Denel and the South African arms industry as a whole, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has already bought two unmanned Seeker reconnaissance
aircraft systems from South Africa for about 100 million rand
(16.7 million dollars) and is negotiating with Denel for the
possible purchase of tank turrets and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Shaik said Algeria had imposed the same conditions on the deal
that South Africa imposed in its recent major arms purchase from
European countries, meaning that some of the production could take
place in Algeria.

<HEADLINE> Manila Woos Back Former Teachers Working Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
mounting a program to woo former teachers now working as domestic
helpers abroad to come home and teach in public schools, the
Presidential Palace said Wednesday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The release said the program is part of the government's policy
to provide local jobs to returning overseas Filipino workers
(OFWs).
</P>
<P>
To carry out the program, the government recently sent a team
to Hong Kong to conduct a refresher course and, later, a Licensure
Examination for Teachers (LET) for almost 1,400 former teachers
now working as OFWs there.
</P>
<P>
The release said 529 of the 1,382 examinees passed the LET
test, of whom 250 have already decided to return home and teach in
public schools in their home provinces.
</P>
<P>
An order has also been issued by the government to fill up
unfilled teaching positions in the country with qualified ex-OFW
applicants not covered by the program, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
OFWs were dubbed by the government as "modern-day heroes"
because their annual remittances exceed 5 billion U.S. dollars and
"their exemplary qualities of sheer hard work have earned the
recognition and admiration of the world," said the release.

<P>
The seminar which ends Wednesday has drawn about 150
participants, including representatives from the European Union,
non-governmental organizations from Britain and France as well as
agriculturists from Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> China Boasts World's Largest Seed Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- With over 310,000 varieties, China
boasts the world's largest reserve of seeds, according to an
agronomist in this capital of northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
China now has two major seed storehouses, one in Beijing and
one in Xining, according to agronomist Ma Xiaogang.
</P>
<P>
The one based here is an auxiliary of the Beijing-based Chinese
Crop Seeds Storehouse, which is housed in China's Academy of
Agricultural Science.
</P>
<P>
Ma, also a deputy director of the Crops Department of the
Qinghai Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Science, said that
the Xining storehouse was established to better preserve the seeds,
which are vital for China's agricultural development and research.
</P>
<P>
He said the cool and cold weather in Qinghai is ideal for
keeping the seeds, adding that the local storehouse is
computerized so that information about any kind of seed can be
easily obtained.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, the seeds in the seed bank include wheat, rice,
maize, a variety of herbs, and vegetables and wild plants.
</P>
<P>
Now, all the seeds are kept in freezers with the temperature
set at 10 degrees below Zero Celsius.
</P>
<P>
"Under this temperature, the seeds can be kept alive for 80 to
100 years," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
This winter, an additional 30,000 types of seeds will be sent
to the Xining storehouse, bringing the total to some 340,000, he
said.

URUMQI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Alataw Railway Station in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region led the nation

</P>
<P>
The station handled some 1.74 million tons of goods in the
first half, up 70 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Alataw Pass, 90 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide, is a

In 1990, the State Council, China's highest government body,

ANKARA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- One person has been killed and
seven others wounded in an armed attack by Kurdish rebels in
eastern Turkey, the country's Anatolia News Agency reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An unspecified number of rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) opened fire Tuesday night at people in a

The PKK militants' attack prompted a large-scale operation by
the Turkish security forces in a bid to capture the attackers, who
fled after the firing.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a war since 1984 for an independent
state in southeastern Turkey. More than 37,000 people have been

HARBIN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A new batch of bombs with a total
weight of two tons, left by the Japanese invaders more than sixty
years ago, were recently discovered in the oil-producing city of
Daqing in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Among these 24 are gas bombs, and large one with a diameter of
155 millimeters, which is believed to be the first of its kind
uncovered in China.
</P>
<P>
The bombs are covered with layers of rust. The gas bombs
contain either mustard gas or chlorine, meant to kill by
suffocation and fester the skin after detonation.
</P>
<P>
Experts have confirmed that many of the bombs had already been
exploded, additional material evidence that Japanese troops
massacred the Chinese with gas bombs during their invasion.
</P>
<P>
The 24 gas bombs will be stored and the others will be
detonated deep under ground.

<P>
Earlier in April, one bomb containing bacterial material, and
five other gas bombs, were found in Heilongjiang's Dongning county

YUSHU, QINGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Flooding caused by heavy
rainfall at the sources of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers this
summer has claimed the lives of 4 people and damaged 1,500 houses
and seven bridges in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of
Qinghai Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 1,286 livestock sheds and 170,000 cu.m. of
roadbeds have been destroyed by mud slides and flooding caused by
unusual weather in the area so far this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Plateau is the source of the Yellow, Yangtze and
Lancang rivers. The sources of the Yangtze and Lancang rivers have
an average elevation of 4,200 meters, and with a cold climate and
high elevation, heavy rainfall and hail is very rare in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Yushu Prefecture saw heavy rain and hail in May and
June which led to flooding and mud slides. In June alone, Yushu's
rainfall was double that of the normal annual average rainfall
there.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall in Yushu and Qumarleb counties in May and June was 20
percent above normal.
</P>
<P>
The successive and frequent heavy rainfall on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau this year indicates a change in the ecological environment
of the area, and this phenomenon will have to be studied further,
according to local meteorologists.

GDP) declined four percent in 1998 from the previous year, the
third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
As a result of climbing unemployment rates, which rose from 3.2
percent in 1997 to 4.6 percent in 1998, Macao households had less
income and individual consumption went down 1.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With regard to public departments, the suspension of pay rises
among civil servants and the reduction of public expenditures made
public consumption contract 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
What was worse, the income from gambling sector, the major
pillar of government revenue, plummeted 15.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, individual and public investments in fixed assets
decreased 10.6 percent from those in 1997.
</P>

Port for six weeks for unloading, but the unloading work could not
be started as the rice was found rotten.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Food has imported 100,000 tons of rice from
foreign countries and about 27,000 tons were carried to the Mongla
sea port by three ships, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unloading of rice from the ships has been suspended as
complaint was made that the imported rice was unfit for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a well-organized gang of miscreants is pilfering the
rotten rice from the ships regularly and selling it at Mongla and
other local markets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On May 19 this year, a foreign ship reached Mongla Port
carrying 7,100 tons of rice from India, of which 740 tons were
fond unfit for human consumption, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some 26,140 sacks (2,000 tons) of rice were
imported from India in February this year, of which 23,140 sacks
were found decomposed when reaching the southeastern Chittagong
Port.
</P>
<P>
The government, after examining the quality of the rice,
ordered the Food Department to use only 3,000 sacks of the rice
and the Parliamentary Committee on Food Ministry decided in late
June to return 23,000 sacks of the decomposed rice.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh experienced a most severe flood last year, which
lasted for two and a half months and hit two-thirds of the
country, damaging some 850,000 hectares of crops and causing an
estimated loss of 3.5 million tons of grains. To meet the food
shortage, both the government and the private sector took measures
to import huge quantities of grains.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Protection Project Built Near Three Gorges Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dalaoling State Forest Park in
central China's Yichang, the city nearest to the Three Gorges
Project, is now completed after two years of development, and has
won the approval of expert appraisers.
</P>
<P>
The park, 45 km from the dam site, has an area of 1,967
hectares covered with about one thousand plant varieties,
including 52 listed by the state as precious and rare. Sixteen of
these rare plants were transplanted from the Three Gorges
Reservoir Area and nearby areas at a high elevation.
</P>
<P>
China has been constructing a giant dam near the Three Gorges
at the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the country's longest,
and the project is expected to be completed by 2009.
</P>
<P>
According to several surveys, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area
is home to 3,014 types of plants, 1,630 of which are found only in
China. The area is also home to 5,000 large and very old trees.
</P>
<P>
However, the areas where many of the plants are concentrated
will be inundated, and could possibly be lost for forever upon
completion of the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
While organizing activities to protect this plant diversity,
the office of the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee of
the State Council was lavish with funds for the creation of the
park to reduce as much as possible the negative impact on plants
in the dam area.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Deputy leader of Chart Pattana
Party (CPP), Thailand's second largest ruling party, has resigned
the post and withdrawn from the party's executive committee,
Channel 9, Thai state television, reported Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Sompong Amornviwat told reporters Tuesday that he resigned
because party leader Korn Dabbaransi and Secretary-General Suwat
Liptapallop kept all political businesses in their own hands.
</P>
<P>
Sompong lost his labor minister portfolio in the cabinet
reshuffle early this month, which he denied as the reason for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
However, Korn told reporters Tuesday that Sompong's resignation
may have something to do with the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
It is the first open conflict within a ruling party after the
cabinet reshuffle on July 10.
</P>
<P>
CPP is now the second largest party within the ruling coalition
with 51 representative seats in the lower house. The cabinet
reshuffle had been repeatedly postponed because CPP failed to
decide its line-up on time due to fierce internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that CPP now holds the balance of the
ruling coalition after the reshuffle, and its internal conflict
will have a direct impact on the stability of the government.

an increase of 16 percent. Forty-eight projects involved
investments of more than 10 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The contracted investment from the United States alone

Losses incurred by state-owned enterprises in Shanghai were
reduced in the first six months, but no detailed figures were
available.
</P>
<P>
However, Shanghai's economic growth still faces such problems
as low demand among local residents and declining prices. The

KATHMANDU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali workers will not be

The UAE government's decision to stop issuing new visas to
workers from South Asia was aimed at reducing the demographic
imbalance of foreign workers there.
</P>
<P>
UAE stands third among the Gulf countries after Saudi Arabia
and Qatar in terms of presence of Nepali workers. There are
roughly 13,000 Nepalese working in UAE.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved a loan
of 85 million U.S. dollars on Tuesday for Colombia to improve and
expand coverage of water and sewerage services in the city of
Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
The loan will support the Cartagena Water Supply, Sewage and
Environmental Management Project, which will improve living
standards and reduce urban pollution throughout the city, the bank
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Lack of sewerage services and the contamination of Cartagena
Bay and the surrounding coastline and lakes have not only
generated severe hazards to public health, sanitation, and
environmental problems, but are a serious impediment to the
sustainable economic development of Cartagena, whose economy
depends heavily on tourism, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to improve the water and sewerage services of
Cartagena, particularly in the city's poorest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The project will also facilitate the environmental cleanup of
the bay of Cartagena, Cienaga Lake, and the surrounding Caribbean
coastline by providing adequate collection, treatment, and
disposal of the city's wastewater.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Taekwondo Hopeful Juana Away From SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's taekwondo hopeful
Juana Wangsa Putri sets to skip from the Brunei Southeast Asian (
SEA) Games next August, and focus on the Sydney Olympics next year,
an official of the country's taekwondo governing body (TI) said.
</P>
<P>
TI General Secretary Zarkasih Hamid said the decision had been
taken in the hope that Juana would be spurred on to win a medal at
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Our target in the Olympics is winning a medal, so Juana will
be rested (from SEA Games) to avoid being scathed," he was quoted
by The Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Juana secured a berth for Sydney Olympics after reaching the
best four places in the World Championship in Croatia early this
month. After her return from Croatia, the federation's officials
duly pondered whether Juana should compete in Brunei given the
idea that the 22-year-old would be one of the best prospects for
Indonesia to reap a gold medal reward.
</P>
<P>
However, the Olympics aspiration appears to be tense. According
to Zarkasih, a medal in the Olympics has been the federation's
long-term goal, and he felt it was necessary to maintain Juana's
as well as the others' form.
</P>
<P>
The federation plans a training camp in South Korea and a
tryout to the Netherlands in preparation for the Olympics.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela will continue to reduce their foreign sales of crude to
stabilize the world oil market, Mexican Energy Secretary Luis
Tellez said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tellez told reporters that he reached agreement with his Saudi
Arabian counterpart, Ali Naimi, to maintain cuts in their crude
exports in order to hike oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said he was looking forward to the visit to Mexico of
his Venezuelan counterpart, Ali Rodriguez, next week, for talks on
the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the Rodriguez visit, there are no plans to
increase crude exports, in spite of the increase in oil prices
over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has agreed with other independent producers and the
Organization of Petrol Producing Countries (OPEC) to hold back
from the markets around 5.1 million barrels per day. Mexico's
quota is around 325,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The restriction helped the price of Mexica's crude rise from
below 8 dollars per barrel to a two-year-high of 17.10 dollars per
barrel last week.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, the world's fifth largest crude producer, obtains 30

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's gross domestic
product (GDP) may fall by more than 1.5 percent this year,
Industry Secretary Alieto Guadagni told a press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the country's economic recession has lasted four
months, he predicted a fall in industrial activity of up to 11
percent. He conceded that so far there is no sign of recovery,
only of an economic standstill.
</P>
<P>
The administration is likely to take tactical steps to deal with
individual problems, since the country is threatened by a "
deflation of international prices more severe than those of the
1930s," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary attributed Argentina's shrinking foreign trade
mainly to falling international prices instead of lower
competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Says U.S. Responsible for 1981 Epidemic Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban Public Health Ministry on
Tuesday accused the U.S. government of introducing the hemorrhagic
dengue fever to the island in 1981, which caused the death of 158
people.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Health Minister Carlos Dotres, the then Chief of the
Pediatric Services in Havana, said the epidemic was not only a "
genocidal activity" but also an "aggression" against the economy
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Dotres said that among the victims of the epidemic, 101 were
children and that at that time, this "caused a psychological
situation between the sick person and other family members, which
was and is to this day, a trauma that has caused tension
throughout the country."
</P>
<P>
The official said that due to the four-decade-long economic
blockade by the United States, Cuba has had many problems in
obtaining necessary medicines for the treatment of sick people.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Dotres is a witness testifying in a trial against the U.
S. government, which began on June 5 and in which eight Social
Organizations sued the U.S. government for damages.
</P>
<P>
So far around 170 witnesses have testified in the trial, the
largest in Antilles islands which is being held in the Superior
Tribunal of the Palace of the Revolution, in Havana.
</P>
<P>
The accusations include political, military, economic,
biological, diplomatic, psychological, terrorist and espionage
actions.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Posts 16.2M Pesos Profit in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Debt-laden Philippine Airlines
(PAL) finally posted a net income of 16.2 million pesos (405,000
U.S. dollars) in May, the first in two years, The Manila Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted PAL president Avelino Zapanta as saying that
it was the result of the airline's implementation of sweeping
cost-cutting measures and the increasing customer demand.
</P>
<P>
"The collective effort of the PAL staff to increase revenues
and reduce costs resulted in profits for the company," Zapanta
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zapanta admitted the airline made a profit also
because it paid lower interest expenses on its debts according to
its rehabilitation plan than what it should have paid if PAL did
not suspend debt payments.
</P>
<P>
Zapanta said total revenues amounted to 2.24 billion pesos (56
million dollars) in May, while total expenses amounted to 1.74
billion pesos (43.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, PAL's income from operations for May of 503.8
million pesos (12.6 million dollars) was the highest ever achieved
by the flag carrier for a single month in its 58-year history.
</P>
<P>
PAL is carrying out a rehabilitation plan to pay its
2.2-billion-dollar debt after the company got the required
additional capital infusion of 200 million dollars on June 4.

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Crack-Down on Shoddy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The State Quality and Technical
Supervision Administration vowed here yesterday to intensify its
crackdown on fake and shoddy products.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the crackdown will focus on
poor quality products, especially those used in people's daily
life and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the administration yesterday said the
administration will also fight against acts that threaten to
impair healthy economic development and disturb normal market
order.
</P>
<P>
Quality inspectors will target enterprises producing large
quantities of fake products, their raw material suppliers and
sellers in an iron-fisted campaign in the following few months.
</P>
<P>
The circular stressed that those manufacturing fake products
using famous domestic or foreign brands, and those caught several
times turning out fake products, will receive heavy fines but also
legal penalties.
</P>
<P>
It called for closer cooperation among quality inspectors,
public security officials, and officials with the industrial and
commercial administrations, to remove all poor quality products
from the market.
</P>
<P>
More media coverage was also urged by the circular, to expose
fake product manufacturers and discourage the illegal business
practice.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's PDI-P's Leadership Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) concluded its leadership meeting in the West Java
town of Depok Tuesday, resulting in various decisions, including a
strategy to smooth its chairwoman's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
PDI-P Secretary General Alex Litaay said the closed-door
meeting, attended by party leaders from all over the country,
agreed on two main agenda items: the party's strategy in the next
general session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) and
the legislative candidates.
</P>
<P>
Litaay, however, declined to elaborate on the party's strategy
at the MPR session, saying that it will remain a secret because,
if such a strategy is announced, it will be used by PDI-P
competitors from other parties attempting to foil it.
</P>
<P>
He said such a strategy includes making a strategic alliance
with other political parties which win seats in the House of
Representatives (DPR), but again Litaay declined to announce which
political parties have been approached by PDI-P.
</P>
<P>
"Such a strategic alliance is very important because we are
aware that we need their support, but it is premature if I mention
with whom we will create this strategic alliance," he was quoted
by The Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted some reliable sources as saying that officials
of PDI-P have approached officials of the National Mandate Party,
the National Awakening Party and other Islamic parties which won
significant seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
Litaay said the meeting reaffirmed Megawati Soekarnoputri's
presidential candidacy. Party leaders have been instructed to
protect Megawati's path to the new millennium presidency.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also decided to set up guidelines by which the
party would name its legislators in the DPR. The party's
guidelines are intended to prevent possible vote-buying in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The chapters and branches themselves will select the
candidates and decide the final list for the House. We want to
have legislative candidates who will fight for the aspirations of
the people, especially the people who voted for them," Litaay
said.
</P>
<P>
An indication that party legislators are prone to vote-buying
attempts was revealed by chairman of the party's Jakarta chapter
Roy B.B. Janis.
</P>
<P>
"A dozen PDI-P legislative candidates have been offered money
to vote for another presidential candidate," Janis said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia elects its president and vice president through an
indirect election system, under which the people's rights to elect
their leaders is entrusted to members of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
The 700-member MPR, which incorporates the 500-member
parliament and 200 provincial and community appointees, will meet
in November to elect a new president and vice president and
establish the 1999-2004 State Policy Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary count by the National Elections Committee (PPI)
put PDI-P in the lead with 33.7 percent of the votes and an
estimated 154 seats in the House, while the ruling Golkar Party
came second with an estimated 120 House seats after it secured
22.4 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Though still considered premature, talks about the next
president have been dominated by Megawati and incumbent President
B.J. Habibie, who have been nominated by PDI-P and Golkar
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate to Ratify Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged the Senate on Tuesday to ratify a nuclear-test ban treaty
that was signed by 152 countries.
</P>
<P>
In a Rose Garden press conference at the White House, Clinton
said, "The question now is whether we will adopt or whether we
will lose a verifiable treaty that will bar other nations from
testing nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Clinton signed in
1996, has been held up by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will enter into force only after all 44 countries in
the Conference on Disarmament including the United States approved
it. It has been approved so far by 41.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the test ban treaty is now imperiled by the
refusal of some senators even to consider it," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"If our Senate fails to act, the treaty cannot enter into force
for any country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Helms and his supporters argue the treaty could threaten
America's ability to deliver an effective nuclear strike, should
one be needed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the nation already has "a robust nuclear force,
and nuclear experts affirm that we can maintain a safe and
reliable deterrent without nuclear tests."
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance right now to end nuclear testing forever,"
Clinton said. "It would be a tragedy for our security and for our
children's future, to let this opportunity slip away."

<HEADLINE> Villa Seal Boateng Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Aston Villa have finally completed the signing of Coventry
City midfielder Goerge Boateng.
</P>
<P>
They have also welcomed Israeli international Najuan Garayeb to
the club.
</P>
<P>
Dutchman Boateng's move across the Midlands has been one of the
most drawn out transfer sagas of the summer, with Coventry holding
out for their asking price of five million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Villa said the deal is worth 4.5m, while they have paid one
million to Hapoel Haifa for the 25-year-old Israeli left-back, who
failed a medical at Tottenham earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Dutch under-21 international Boateng arrived at Highfield Road
for a cut price 250,000 from Feyenoord a year-and-a-half ago - as
his contract expired with the Dutch club.
</P>
<P>
He has impressed since, particular during the first two
victories in Coventry's history at Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
Villa manager John Gregory stepped up his interest when the
combative yet skillful Dutchman scored twice in the Sky Blues' 4-1
win last season.
</P>
<P>
He has also wanted to sign Garayeb for some time, but Spurs
looked to have sneaked in and signed him at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
But their interest went cold when a medical report revealed a
knee problem - something which obviously does not concern Villa.
</P>
<P>
The two new arrivals dramatically increase the foreign
contingent at the Birmingham club - trebling the number of non-
British players.
</P>
<P>
Finnish third-choice goalkeeper Petr Encklemen was the only
foreigner still at Villa following Australian Mark Bosnich's
departure to Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
The announcements complete a busy 24 hours in the transfer
market for Gregory, who released striker Stan Collymore on a three-
month loan to Fulham.

LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- World triple jump record holder
Jonathan Edwards has pulled out of the World Championship trials
in Birmingham this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Edwards has been struggling with an injury to his left foot
since the European Cup in Paris a month ago and feels he should
not risk jumping with next month's World Championships in Seville
fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
"It is purely a precautionary measure," Edwards said.

"The injury has been niggling me since the Paris meeting and
obviously I don't want to risk further complications with Seville
being so close.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, although I am training I am also taking
every opportunity to make sure I am okay for Seville."
</P>
<P>
Despite missing the trials, Edwards is certain to be named, if
fit, in the British team for the championships in Seville, which
take place August 20-29.

<HEADLINE> Hillsborough Policemen Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Two former senior policemen on duty
during the Hillsborough disaster are to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and former
Superintendent Bernard Murray face charges of manslaughter over
two of the 96 Liverpool football fans who died. They are also
charged with willful neglect of public duty at the 1989 disaster.
</P>
<P>
Duckenfield, 54, of Bournemouth, Dorset, and Murray, 57, of
Pontefract, West Yorkshire, were in charge of crowd control at the
Sheffield Wednesday ground during the FA Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
</P>
<P>
The private prosecution against Duckenfield and Murray is the
first criminal case arising from the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, which brought
the prosecution, were at Leeds Magistrates Court to hear
stipendiary magistrate Nigel Cadbury rule after a nine-day hearing
that both men should stand trial at Leeds Crown Court on 24 August.
</P>
<P>
The decision was greeted with joy by members of the support
group, who have fought for 10 years for a prosecution over the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Liverpool fans named in the charges, John Alfred Anderson,
62, and James Gary Aspinall, 18, were crushed to death with others
on terracing at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Last week stipendiary magistrate Cadbury rejected a defense
argument that a fair trial could not take place.

<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain has told Indonesia not to
use British-supplied equipment in East Timor, Foreign Office
Minister Geoff Hoon told Parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have reminded the Indonesians that under no circumstances

Hoon said in the House of Commons when asked about reports that a
British-made Hawk jet belonging to the Indonesian air force was
used last week in East Timor's capital Dili.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks were sold to Indonesia by British Aerospace Company,
which says it is convinced the aircraft could not be used for
attack on the local population in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Hoon made the comments after a United Nations statement on
Monday that the militias had been using threats and intimidation
in a bid to disrupt registration for next month's referendum in

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Knighted by Queen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson was knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace, crowning
his team's "treble" success on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex, 57, was created a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's
Birthday Honors List in June. He is only the eighth football
manager or player to receive a knighthood.
</P>
<P>
The honor is the culmination of a season which saw his team win
an unprecedented haul of the FA Cup, Premiership and European Cup
trophies.
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex said: "The Queen told me she doesn't think it will
ever be achieved again - and she's right.
</P>
<P>
"The culmination of three trophies was the pinnacle of my
career and it has been rewarded with a knighthood."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he also talked to the Queen about their mutual
interest in horses. "Her Majesty said she hoped I would have time
for my horses - I own two and have shares in four," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Football management is such a pressurized thing - horseracing
is a release. I'm also learning to play the piano - I'm quite
determined - it's another release from the pressure of my job."
</P>
<P>
Already a CBE - Commander of the British Empire - the 57-year-
old from Govan, Glasgow, is a working-class boy who now graces the
biggest stages of world sport.
</P>
<P>
When he was 12 years old he chose football to try and escape
poverty wages in the shipbuilding industry.
</P>
<P>
His footballing career began at Rangers, and he then played for
Queen's Park, St Johnstone, Dunfermline, Falkirk and Ayr.
</P>
<P>
Management followed with East Stirling, St Mirren and a very
successful spell with Aberdeen before he moved south of the border.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United are going for even greater glory next year in
the World Club Championships in Brazil after controversially
pulling out of the FA Cup.

<HEADLINE> Formula One Considers Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Formula One chiefs are looking into
plans for safer run-off areas at circuits in the wake of Michael
Schumacher's crash in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
International Automobile Federation (FIA) safety experts are
working on a special surface to help slow cars when they plunge
off the track.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher broke his right leg after his Ferrari careered over
a gravel trap at Silverstone and smashed head on into a tyre
barrier.
</P>
<P>
The accident on July 11 ruled him out of Formula One for three
months, ending his world championship hopes.
</P>
<P>
FIA technical advisor Peter Wright said: "Gravel beds don't
work as badly as people think, but we have a lot of data on how
well cars brake on the track and off it.
</P>
<P>
"We have put forward the idea that maybe in some cases you
would be better off with a specially designed tarmac than gravel.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the perfect solution, but it is something that we
are looking at very seriously."
</P>
<P>
Fellow drivers criticized the run-off area after the race,
claiming it failed to slow Schumacher sufficiently before he hit
the wall.
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted by the FIA showed that the German struck the
barrier at 107 kph, much slower than initial estimates suggested.
</P>
<P>
FIA president Max Mosley said: "The gravel was not efficient in
Michael's case. He (Michael) said it didn't feel as though he was
slowing at all.
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem you have is that a car goes out of control
and ideally you want to stop it before it hurts someone, and that
was always the idea with gravel," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- UK Athletics have confirmed that
British international 400 meters hurdler Gary Cadogan failed an
out of competition drugs test on November 28 of last year.
</P>
<P>
A urine sample given by Cadogan included traces of banned
substance nandrolone and he was suspended on March 31, pending a
disciplinary committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics procedures dictate that any information regarding
a potential doping case remain confidential until the outcome of
the disciplinary committee is known.
</P>
<P>
But the case was made public by an IAAF newsletter and UK
Athletics felt they then had no option but to confirm the case.
</P>
<P>
David Parry &AMP; Co, lawyers acting for Cadogan, released a
statement criticizing the IAAF for making the case public.
</P>
<P>
The statement read: "Mr Cadogan has been informed by UK
Athletics that his entitlement to confidentiality has been
breached by the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
"That breach is in contravention of the agreement between the
various athletic bodies, namely athletes who face drug charges are
entitled to the matter being kept confidential until there has
been a proper lawful finding as to whether or not the athlete is
guilty.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Cadogan is appalled at the IAAF's behavior and is seeking
an inquiry as to the circumstances of the breach and an apology
from the IAAF's president.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Cadogan is innocent and is satisfied that innocence will be
proved before the appropriate tribunal in due course."

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says Kosovo War Lengthened by NATO Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Tuesday that the air war against Yugoslavia may have
been prolonged by the difficult process of getting 19 NATO allies
to agree on strategy.
</P>
<P>
Testifying in the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cohen said
he shared the frustrations voiced by the supreme NATO commander,
U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, over the conduct of the war and the
difficulty of achieving consensus among 19 NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Clark suggested in Tuesday's editions of the Washington Post
that he was hamstrung, forced to sacrifice basic warfare logic to
maintain the political cohesion of the alliance. Clark suggested
this micromanagement prolonged the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said, "This should not come as a shock to this
committee...It was very difficult to take 19 different countries
and get an effective campaign under way without some bumps in the
road."
</P>
<P>
"The action was limited in the initial stages," Cohen said.
"There were restraints placed upon the commanding officer, Gen.
Clark. It was slow. In some cases too slow to achieve a consensus.
All of that is true. It did not go as smoothly as it should have."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen also said Kosovo remains dangerous and
unstable and he cannot tell how long U.S. peacekeepers must
remain. "I don't think we can put on any time line in terms of how
long."
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 U.S. troops participated in the operation in
Kosovo. There are 50,000 international troops deployed in the
province of Yugoslavia.

<P>
HAIKOU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southernmost
province, is taking a series of measures to open up further to the
outside world and improve its investment environment, in a bid to
attract more overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the Asian financial crisis, Hainan has witnessed a
sharp reduction in both contracted volume of overseas funds and
direct overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
To absorb overseas funds more efficiently, the provincial
government plans to give priority to optimizing its industrial
structure and investment sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province will stress large projects, as well as
medium-sized and small projects which have high scientific and
technological contents.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has played an important role in boosting
the economic development of the province. In the eleven years
since the establishment of the island's provincial status, Hainan
has utilized 8.65 billion US dollars worth of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to introduce 600 million US dollars-worth of
overseas investment this year to tap its rich natural resources,
including oil and natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Flood Projects Around Taihu Lake Pay Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The anti-flood projects in the
Taihu Lake area have helped avoid economic losses of more than 9.2
billion yuan (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) in this year's flood
season.
</P>
<P>
The 2,400-sq-km Taihu Lake is the country's third largest fresh-
water lake. It is located on the border between the provinces of
Jiangsu and Zhejiang, two of East China's economic powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Tailai, deputy director and chief engineer of
the Taihu Administration Bureau, the dikes surrounding the lake
have helped store and discharge nearly 4.6 billion cu m of flood
water since this year's rainy season started.
</P>
<P>
He said that the anti-flood projects were the first in China
for which World Bank loans were used.
</P>
<P>
The projects started in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"If it were not for these anti-flood projects, the current
water level of Taihu Lake would be 40 cm higher than it is, and
the lake valley would have 900 million more cu m of flood water
this year," Wu explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic losses avoided this year are
estimated to be equivalent to twice the total cost of the projects.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Resume Peace Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- United States President's special
assistant Tony Blinken said here the U.S. will do its utmost to
help resume peace talks on the Cyprus issue, the Cyprus News
Agency (CNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday at an event to mark the 25th year of the 1974
Turkish invasion and occupation of 37 percent of Cyprus island,
Blinken said a settlement in Cyprus is one of Bill Clinton's
"highest foreign policy priorities".
</P>
<P>
Blinken said the U.S. will work towards the resumption of the
talks on Cyprus in line with a statement issued by the G-8 (seven
most industrialized nations plus Russia) in June.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on June 20 at the end of their annual
summit in Cologne, Germany, the leaders of G-8 urged the Greek and
Turkish Cypriots to enter talks without setting any pre-conditions
and negotiate in good faith until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Blinken outlined the two challenges ahead: getting the two
parties in Cyprus at the table and finding a settlement that would
meet the needs of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north, backed by Turkey, and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern
third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
with Athens.
</P>
<P>
International efforts towards a solution to the Cyprus issue
has remained deadlocked as the Turkish Cypriots refuse to enter
talks unless their breakaway state, now only recognized by Turkey,
be recognized by the international community.

</P>
<P>
China Welcomes New Guinea's "One China" Policy
</P>
<P>
China today welcomed what it called the "wise decision" by
Papua New Guinea's new government to cancel its communique on "
diplomatic ties" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said that the Chinese
government appreciates the decision made by the new government
headed by Prime Minster Mekere Morauta to pursue the principles of
the 1976 communique on diplomatic ties between China and Papua New
Guinea and to correct the erroneous actions of the former
government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement today, Morauta said that his government is
sticking to the "One China" policy, safeguarding diplomatic ties
with the People's Republic of China, and devoting itself to
furthering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the communique on "establishing diplomatic ties"
by the former government with Taiwan on July 5 as invalid and
unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that everyone knows that there is but one China in
the world and the Government of the People's Republic of China is
the sole legitimate government of China and that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory. Taiwan authorities, she
said, resort to any means in their "money diplomacy" in an attempt
to create "two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan" in South Pacific
and other regions.

<HEADLINE> Man Utd Beats Shanghai Shenhua 2-0 (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- European Cup heroes Old Gunnar
Solskjaer and Teddy Sherinham struck again to help English giants
Manchester United to sink Chinese league leaders Shanghai Shenhua
2-0 for the third consecutive victory in their Australian and
Asian tour here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Solskjaer, who scored the stunning injury time winner in United
's 2-1 triumph over German side Bayern Munich in the European Cup
final this May, was sent through into the box by a pin-point long
cross on the stroke of the hour and buried the ball into the right
corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
The baby-faced Norwegian turned from a goal scorer into a goal
maker ten minutes later when he flipped a cross outside the box to
set up his European Cup co-scorer Sherinham.
</P>
<P>
The second half substitute for Andy Cole made no mistake,
dodging an advancing Shenhua defender and beat the goalie Ou
Chuliang with a typical cool finisher.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition match was a sold out event with all 80,000
tickets snapped up by adoring local fans five weeks in advance.
</P>
<P>
But the notable absences of the icon midfielder David Beckham,
cited as being recovering from injury, head coach Alex Fergerson
who masterminded United's glorious treble of Premier League, FA
Cup and European Cup this season, and the ironman captain Roy
Keane to some extent dampened the soccer-crazy country.
</P>
<P>
The home side didn't seem to be awed and daunted by a second-
string United which  rested several key players including
heartthrob Ryan Giggs. Led by former Shenhua captain Fan Zhiyi who
now plays for English first division side Crystal Palace, the
local eleven played some decent football in the first half and
earned several realistic scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts were capped by a 29th minute goal-bound raking
header by Fan, only pushed aside by full-stretched United
goalkeeper Raimond Van Der Gouw.
</P>
<P>
Not until United's assistant manager Stephen McClaren made four
changes at the second half did the 1995 Chinese league champions
slide into submission.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bosnich, United's newly-signed first-choice Australian
goalie, and Dwight Yorke, the team's top scorer, made a fleeting
appearance in the later stages of the game.
</P>
<P>
The English treble champions beat Australian national side
twice last week in the Australian leg of their pre-season tour.
</P>
<P>
They now moves on to Hong Kong, China, the last stop of their
tour.

<HEADLINE> Flood Crest Passes Through Hubei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province is
calling for all-out efforts in fighting the current floods,
although the major part of the flood waters has already passed
without mishap through the most dangerous section of the Yangtze
here.
</P>
<P>
The flood peak was recorded as 38.3 m this morning and evening,
slightly lower than the highest peak of 38.31 m last year.
</P>
<P>
After passing the Jingjiang section, which is most vulnerable
to dyke breaches because of its zigzagging and narrow river
courses, the flood waters are pressing downstream to Wuhan and
Honghu Lake.
</P>
<P>
The call for renewed efforts is in view of the fact that 1,234
km of the Yangtze's banks in the province are still besieged by
flood waters, which are above the danger levels. As many as 340,
000 people are standing guard on the banks.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Economy Expected to Grow Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) have foreseen a 6 percent to 7 percent growth
in the South Korean economy this year, compared with the previous
estimate of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted that the economy will grow by 5 to 6
percent the next year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast came at a two-week semiannual consultation meeting
between Seoul and the IMF, which started on July 6, said the
Finance and Economy Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index is expected to rise by less than 2
percent this year and 3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF held that Seoul's monetary policy may need to be
adjusted to address possible inflationary pressures as the degree
of slack in the economy is reduced.
</P>
<P>
South Korea agreed to reduce the share of the budget deficit in
the gross domestic product from the previous 5 percent to 4
percent this year and further cut it to 3.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to increase South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves, which had amounted to 61 billion U.S. dollars by the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
The IMF forecast this year's current account surplus would drop
to 20 billion U.S. dollars from 40 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, South Korea said it would, during the third
quarter of this year, repay the remaining 4 billion dollars of the
initial 13.5 billion dollars it received from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has received 19.5 billion dollars from the IMF as
part of a 58 billion dollars package arranged in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to continue IMF supervision over South
Korea's economy until the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
They will hold policy consultation meeting again in January and
July next year.

leading grain producer of the country, despite the severe drought
in spring.

<P>
The average wheat output 5,285 kg per hectare, an increase of

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Construction Falls Sharply in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) --The Commerce Department reported
Wednesday that construction of new homes and apartments fell
sharply in June to the lowest level in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, housing starts were on 1.57 million units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, a drop of 5.64 percent from May,
the Department said. That marked the lowest level since May 1998,
when new housing starts were at 1.541 million.
</P>
<P>
June's performance followed a big jump in new home construction
in May after having dipped sharply in April.
</P>
<P>
The Department's report said housing starts were down or held
steady in most parts of the country. The West suffered the biggest
drop in new housing construction, falling 14.8 percent in June to
352,000 units while the South reported a 4.6 percent decline in
new housing starts to 701,000 units. Housing starts in the
Northeast held steady at 159,000 units in June and were actually
up a small 0.3 percent in the Midwest to 359,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The overall drop in housing starts in June reflected a steep
decline in the construction of single-family homes, but an
increase in apartment construction.
</P>
<P>
In June, single-family home construction fell 8.7 percent to
1.27 million units, while apartment construction rose 10 percent
to 297,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Economists said home building and other construction activity,
driven by low mortgage rates, were a key contributing factor to
the strong economic growth in the early part of the year. But the
pace of home sales has cooled in recent months, reflecting rising
mortgage rates. Sales of new homes fell 5.1 percent in May and
sales of existing home dropped 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's report comes as home builders have voiced concerns
about shortages of skilled construction workers and building
materials, such as gypsum wallboard, insulation and bricks.
</P>
<P>
Home builders also have begun citing rising lumber prices and
rising interest rates as other important concerns.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates have been creeping up for the past two months.
Their high of 7.71 percent was set at the beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of new housing starts authorized by
building permits, a good barometer of future activity, rose 1.9
percent in June.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sends Experts Abroad to Study Waste Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Determined to find a permanent
solution to the garbage problem in Metro Manila, the Philippine
government has sent technical experts to Europe, Japan and the
United States to study their system of waste management.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace announced this move in a statement,
saying the government is determined to put an end to the garbage
disposal problem.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the government is doing all it can
to prevent a repeat of the protest by residents of Rizal Province
against the reopening of the San Mateo landfill in the province.
</P>
<P>
The San Mateo landfill was reopened Tuesday only after an
agreement was reached among the Metro Manila Development
Authority, the Office of the President and the Rizal Province on
the extension of the landfill for about a year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement assured Rizal residents that an action plan will
be drawn up to set in place a more environment-friendly garbage
disposal system.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that Metro Manila's garbage problem would have
been averted had the former Ramos Administration listened to the
advice of a Japanese expert for the government to look for an
alternative landfill site.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we have sent our technical people to Europe, the
United States, and Japan to study their system of waste
management," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement assured the residents of San Mateo in Rizal that
the government will study a possible waste management system so
the government wouldn't have to bother them with Metro Manila's
garbage.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Slams Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today condemned Lee Teng-hui's
separatist remarks and urged its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits
Exchanges Foundation (SEF), to stop attempts to split the
motherland and return to the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Members of the board of directors of ARATS convened a meeting
here today and stressed that the "one China" principle is the
foundation for the mutual development of cross-Straits relations
and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The directors expressed deep regret that some leading officials
of SEF have echoed Lee Teng-hui's separatist remarks by claiming
that cross-strait talks are "state-to-state talks", renouncing its
principle of adhering to "one China" and damaging the foundation
for future contacts between the two associations.
</P>
<P>
The directors stressed that the turbulent relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits in the past decade or so have
shown that only by abiding by the "one China" principle can the
relationship proceed positively and smoothly, and can a peaceful
reunification of the motherland be possible.
</P>
<P>
They said that creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"
or promoting "Taiwan's independence" hurts the fundamental
interests of all Chinese people and endangers the livelihood of
the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Tang Shubei, executive vice-
president of ARATS.

<HEADLINE> "Separatism Is A Dead End" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The separatist forces and the
handful of "independence for Taiwan" activists on China's island
province of Taiwan are doomed to be pilloried by history, along
with Lee Teng-hui, says a Xinhua commentary entitled "Separatism
Is A Dead End" today.
</P>
<P>
As is well known, Lee is to blame for the trumpeting of "
independence for Taiwan" because he has gone all out to discourage
and suppress those on the island who advocate the reunification of
the motherland and oppose separatism, the article says, referring
to a saying widespread there that it is Lee Teng-hui who has
breast fed the "independence for Taiwan" forces.
</P>
<P>
Lee has also used his power to inject his idea of "independence
for Taiwan" into concrete policies, thereby time and again rocking
the cross-Straits situation and simultaneously pulling Taiwan
compatriots into danger, the commentator says.
</P>
<P>
His "two states" remarks were acclaimed by the splittist forces
and "independence for Taiwan" activists, especially by the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), whose ringleaders even said
that Lee's stance is exactly the DPP's consistent policy, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, a DPP official suggested granting honorary DPP
membership to Lee for doing what the separatist forces and "
independence for Taiwan" activists have failed to do, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed that his "two states" remarks were based on the
cross-Straits reality. So, what is the reality, then? the
commentator asks.

<HEADLINE> Young Kennedy's Body, Airplane Wreckage Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The wreckage of John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s small plane was located Wednesday, with Kennedy's body still
aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in the Massachusetts
State of the United States, senior government sources said.
</P>
<P>
"They've got the fuselage and John Kennedy's in it," said a
government source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation.
There was no immediate information about the bodies of Kennedy's
wife and sister-in-law, who also were on board the plane when it
crashed on July 16.
</P>
<P>
Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee, who was overseeing the
search, canceled a round of morning TV appearances and went to the
USS Grasp, the ship where the wreckage was to be deposited after
being raised from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
The heightened activity took place after ships from the Navy,
Coast Guard and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration spent Tuesday night scouring a site 11 kilometers
southwest of the Martha's Vineyard coast, a spot that
investigators had speculated was the likely splash point for the
plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34. Kennedy,
the pilot, planned to drop off his sister-in-law on the island and
continue to his cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Do More for Disabled Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Health Department of the
Philippines has turned its focus on persons with disabilities
(PWDs) and has taken measures to strengthen its program for them.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Romualdez, secretary of the Health Department lamented
Wednesday that only 2-3 percent of the country's disabled have
access to rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason, he said, why the department had to come up
with a community-based rehabilitation program for the disabled,
launched during the National Disability Prevention and
Rehabilitation Week which started on July 19 and to end on July
23.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to apply primary health approaches in
rehabilitation services that involve the use of indigenous
materials in caring for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
"Rehabilitation centers -- which are physical therapy clinics
-- have more complete set of equipment and can be found in most
hospitals," Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country has 186 rehabilitation centers nationwide
and the program operates in 42 percent of the provinces, 6 percent
of the municipalities and 7 percent of the cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1997 national registration of PWDs done by the
government, the national prevalence rate of disability is 0.76
percent, with Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao registering the
highest rate of 2.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
From among the registered PWDs, orthopedic and visual
impairment ranked highest with 28.2 percent and 27 percent,
respectively. Other disabilities are hearing (17.7 percent),
speech (13.8 percent) and mental (13.3 percent).

<HEADLINE> "Separatism Is A Dead End" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the later period of the Liberation War, some of the
defeated Kuomintang military and political personnel fled to
Taiwan, making it possible for the two sides to stay apart and
confront each other for the time being, the commentator recalls,
pointing out that temporary separation of the people on both sides
of the straits can not change the fact that there is only one
China in the world and that Taiwan is part of China, and that the
people on both sides of the straits all belong to one nation and
are all Chinese.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 countries and most international organizations
recognize that there is only one China in the world and that
Taiwan is part of China. That is why Lee's "two states" remarks
shocked the international community. Some major countries have
reiterated their "one China" stand and asked Lee to stop making
trouble and refrain from undermining the world peace and stability,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in a recent telephone
conversation with President Bill Clinton of the United States that
China is not committed to abandoning the use of force on the
Taiwan issue, and that China will never sit idle if anyone engages
in "Taiwan's independence" and foreign forces interfere in China's
reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui is a splittist, going against the historical trend,
the article says, pointing out that Lee is also a traitor to the
entire Chinese people as he attempts to divide the motherland's
territory and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
As far as the international community is concerned, Lee is a
trouble-maker and is doomed to failure because he has
miscalculated the situation, the article concludes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Telecoms Group Dell to Expand Business in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. telecommunications group
Dell plans to expand its business in Montpellier, southwest France,
by establishing a tele-marketing and technical assistance regional
center there.
</P>
<P>
Dell will in three years employ 550 people and will use the
center to treat all telephone and electronic calls of its
customers in southern Europe and distribute its products in the
region, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted local officials in
French Catalonia as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The executive officer and founder of Dell, Michael Dell,
decided to concentrate his group's business activities in
Montpellier in October 1998 when he visited the city, where Dell
established its branch company, Dell-France, in 1992 with a staff
of 250 people.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, Dell was choosing between Montpellier and Rome
as the seat of its southern Europe headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In order to obtain the contract, the French central and local
governments will offer Dell preferential treatment in land
management fees and make millions of francs of investment in the
project, said the AFP.
</P>
<P>
The local government of Montpellier plans to establish an
information high-technology zone, in which Dell will build its new
business center, said the AFP.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls For More Active Fiscal Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that China has to step up the pursuit of an active
fiscal policy in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech read to a national conference on China's
finance work, Li said that China has decided to take a series of
major measures to step up the active fiscal policy in the second
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that
the measures are designed to promote consumption, investment and
exports, accelerate economic restructuring, and maintain a rapid,
healthy and sustainable growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He called on the finance sector to increase revenue and
restructure the mix of expenditure so as to guarantee adequate
funds for the implementation of fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the country has seen a satisfactory increase of
fiscal revenue in the first half of the year, he said that the
implementation of the major macroeconomic policies in the second
half of the year will need a large amount of money. He called for
governments at all levels to increase fiscal revenue by stepping
up crackdowns on tax evasion and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He called for the establishment of a centralized taxation
system based on computer networks. He also emphasized that the
country will continue to fight against smuggling.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that over the next six months, fiscal
expenditures will focus on such urgent areas as implementing the
measures of the active fiscal policy, guaranteeing grain risk
funds, and funds for social security and scientific and
educational development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the country adopted its new fiscal system
five years ago, it has failed to shift the system from the
traditional functions of implementing the budget to those of
conducting macro-economic control, regulating economic activities
and enhancing supervision.
</P>
<P>
He said that in recent years activities in violation of
financial laws have become rampant in almost all areas of the
economy. He noted that violators are "becoming increasingly
evasive" and the amount of money involved is "astonishingly large".
He called for immediate and stern measures to stop these
activities.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the financial authorities at all levels to
enhance the current eduation of leading officials in theoretical
study, political awareness and good conduct.
