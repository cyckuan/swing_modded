<HEADLINE> Housing Slows but Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home builders, struggling with a shortage of  
workers and supplies in the face of red hot demand, cut back on 
activity for the second straight month in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Friday that new homes and  
apartments were begun at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.77 
million units last month. The 1.3 percent drop in activity followed 
a 1.6 percent decline in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Both months followed a 12-year high of 1.82 million starts set  
in January. Analysts said the slowdown was welcome relief for an 
industry that built more homes for all of 1998 than it had in 11 
years and was facing shortages of workers and building materials in 
some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the government said output at the nation's  
factories, mines and utilities edged up a tiny 0.1 percent with its 
limited strength coming at utility companies and manufacturers of 
high-tech products such as computers and communication equipment, 
which posted a 1.4 percent rise in March. Auto production was down 
0.5 percent last month following a 1.7 percent surge in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the housing and factory production reports  
depicted a U.S. economy that is benefiting from strong consumer 
demand. This has offset the jolts manufacturing has suffered from a 
steep plunge in overseas demand following the Asian currency 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing economists said they looked for demand to remain strong  
for most of this year, in part because of a belief that mortgage 
rates will rise only slightly from the 30-year lows hit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide survey by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company,  
showed 30-year mortgages dipped to 6.87 percent this week after 
having hit a 10-month high of 7.11 percent in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers,  
said he did not look for rates to rise more than a quarter-point 
from where they are currently because of his view that inflation 
will remain low this year and the Federal Reserve will not be 
forced to push interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic softness in Europe and Japan and interest rate cuts  
overseas will help take pressure off our rates,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of  
Home Builders, said the small decline in construction starts in 
February and March came as builders were struggling with worker 
shortages and difficulty in getting supplies of such materials as 
gypsum wall board. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of these shortages, Seiders said, the time it was taking  
to complete a home had risen by about 20 days from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is symptomatic of a market that is really in high gear,''  
Seiders said. ``Builders are telling us that extreme shortages of 
workers and materials are causing them to have to stretch out 
completion times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While such shortages would normally trigger worries at the  
Federal Reserve of an economy that is overheating, the overseas 
weakness and its depressing effects on American exporters in 
manufacturing and farming have kept the lid on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed report on factory output showed that U.S. industry  
operated at just 80.1 percent of capacity in March, the lowest 
operating rate in nearly seven years. The low capacity utilization 
rates mean that production bottlenecks have not formed even though 
the economy is now in the ninth year of economic expansion, the 
longest period of uninterrupted growth in peacetime history. 
</P>
<P>
	Permit applications for new home construction dropped 6 percent  
in March, the biggest decline in four years, after a 2.1 percent 
fall in February. But the declines were coming from exceptionally 
high levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in construction reflected a small 0.1 percent dip in  
single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 1.4 million 
units. Apartment construction was down 5.9 percent to an annual 
rate of 365,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness was led by a 28.9 percent plunge in activity in the  
Northeast, where builders started work on 150,000 units at an 
annual rate. Construction in the South was down 4.3 percent to an 
annual rate of 821,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing construction rose 12.7 percent in the Midwest to an  
annual rate of 400,000 units and was up 7.9 percent in the West to 
an annual rate of 395,000 units.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Man To Be Tried on Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) -- A former state park employee  
accused of sodomizing two women and shackling them in padlocked 
collars has been ordered to stand trial on kidnapping and sexual 
torture charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say David Parker Ray, 59, held the women as sex  
slaves in separate days-long episodes of abuse earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	During a preliminary hearing, the women said they were abducted,  
chained, tortured sexually with objects and given electric shocks. 
One woman was allegedly attacked last month, and the other came 
forward at that time with the story of a similar ordeal in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Neil Mertz said Friday the evidence was  
sufficient to show Ray may have committed the crimes outlined in 
the 25 counts against him. Bond was set at $1 million. No trial 
date has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's co-defendant, Cynthia Lea Hendy, had the charges against  
her reduced from 25 to five counts of conspiracy and being an 
accessory. A proposed plea agreement was pending for her that would 
put her in prison for at least 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is also a victim,'' said her attorney, Xavier Acosta. ``At  
sentencing time, we will present a truer picture of her 
victimization in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another defendant, Dennis Roy Yancy, is charged with murdering a  
woman who vanished from an Elephant Butte bar two years ago. FBI 
agent Doug Beldon has said that Yancy, whose preliminary hearing is 
to be held separately, is a known associate of Ray and Ms. Hendy. 
The couple lived together in Ray's Elephant Butte home. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Ron Lopez said there were other victims who  
have not yet been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	One alleged victim, a 22-year-old Albuquerque woman, screamed at  
Ray and wept on the witness stand as she testified Thursday, 
describing how she broke free after three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman said she fought back with an ice pick and fled Ray's  
lakeside mobile home. Except for the padlocked metal collar and 
chain on her neck, she was naked as she ran down the street seeking 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray also is accused of abducting and torturing a Truth or  
Consequences woman a month earlier. In her testimony, the woman 
said she managed to persuade Ray and Ms. Hendy to release her after 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Truth or Consequences woman said she called police after  
hearing about the Albuquerque woman's ordeal. She said she had been 
afraid to report it earlier.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Fundraiser Faces Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A businessman indicted on 17 counts of making  
illegal contributions to the campaigns of President Clinton and 
others faces more charges in an indictment announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An indictment issued in Washington in September accused Mark B.  
Jimenez of illegally giving candidates nearly $40,000. Those 
charges were incorporated into Thursday's indictment, which also 
accuses him of conspiracy, tax evasion and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez was Florida's largest donor to the national Democratic  
Party in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez, a Philippine national, fled in December and is believed  
to be in that country. The Department of Justice said it would seek 
his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The businessman is accused of conspiring to defraud the Federal  
Elections Commission by using corporate money for campaign 
contributions. The indictment says Jimenez got employees of 
companies he owned and controlled to give money to Clinton, Vice 
President Al Gore and candidates for the U.S. House and Senate, 
then reimbursed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez is also accused of defrauding the IRS by taking business  
deductions for personal expenses and political contributions made 
with money from Future Tech International, Inc. Jimenez was chief 
executive of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer at the company Friday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez promised to raise $25,000 in connection with a  
Clinton-Gore fundraiser in September 1995. He produced $1,000 
personal checks from 25 employees, who were later reimbursed via 
payroll, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez's companies also allegedly defrauded a business partner,  
computer hard-drive manufacturer Quantum Corp., by billing it for 
ads that were never placed in Puerto Rican and South American 
publications as well as PC magazine, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills were accompanied by faked copies of the ads, the  
document said. Quantum was cheated out of more than $600,000, 
according to the release. 
</P>
<P>
	A call seeking comment from Quantum was not returned Friday.

<HEADLINE> Tyco Denies Job Cut Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Tyco International denied today that it has  
finalized plans to cut 4,000 jobs at AMP Inc., the electronic 
component maker that Tyco acquired two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco officials said AMP would undergo a restructuring with  
layoffs, but refused to confirm or deny the 4,000 job reduction 
tally reported by Barron's last weekend in an article quoting 
company Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no plan that's been finalized, no numbers and no  
timetable,'' said spokeswoman Maryanne Kane. 
</P>
<P>
	AMP, which has already eliminated 4,200 jobs in the past year,  
is one of the world's largest makers of connectors for electric and 
electronic devices that are put into products ranging from 
refrigerators to missiles. The company, based in Harrisburg, Pa., 
has been hit hard by the Asian economic crisis and a failed 
expansion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to have AMP regain the leadership in its  
market,'' Tyco Senior Vice President Brad McGee said in an 
interview on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee said he had no details about where the jobs would be cut.  
AMP has about 45,000 workers at 125 plants in more than 50 
countries. Most of its 68 U.S. plants are in Pennsylvania and North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	No Tyco jobs will be cut, McGee said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyco, which is based in Bermuda and has its U.S. headquarters in  
Exeter, N.H., is the world's largest supplier of fire protection 
systems, electronic security services and flow control valves. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco completed its $11.3 billion purchase of AMP two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Expected To Call It Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY HARRY ATKINS   	
</P>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Is the Great One gone? It sure looks that  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	And the announcement was expected to come at an afternoon news  
conference at Madison Square Garden, where the New York Rangers 
have called a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was to meet again in the morning with James Dolan,  
president and CEO of Cablevision, which owns the Garden and the 
Rangers. Dolan wanted to add his voice to those asking the game's 
greatest player to stay for a 21st NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team was putting a farewell in motion. A club  
representative called The Associated Press today, saying Gretzky 
requested 30 copies of a picture distributed by the news agency in 
which Gretzky is waving to fans after Thursday night's game against 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 2-2 tie with the Senators, Gretzky fought back  
tears and said his decision to retire was all but final. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are obviously pointing in that direction,'' he  
said. ``I'm really at peace in my mind about this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, wearing gray slacks and an open-neck white dress shirt,  
frequently had to stop for breath as he described how hard it will 
be to finally skate out of hockey and into the history books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this for a long time,'' said Gretzky, whose  
Rangers are out of the playoffs and play their final game Sunday 
against Pittsburgh in New York. ``But I didn't want to be 
disruptive to the team during the playoff drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not once during the 45-minute news conference did Gretzky ever  
use the ``R'' word. Still, everything he did pointed to him leaving 
the game at the end of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless a miracle happens between now and Saturday, I'll  
probably make it official,'' Gretzky said. ``It's not official 
right now. It's not 99 percent official. When I make the decision, 
it will be 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, someone's cell phone rang at the side of the podium.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tell 'em I still haven't decided,'' Gretzky said quickly,  
finally laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Thursday night was Gretzky's final game in Canada, it was  
some farewell party. The 18,449 fans lucky enough to score a ticket 
to the Corel Center saw to that. 
</P>
<P>
	With 4:43 left in the third period and the scored tied 2-2, the  
fans began to chant ``One more year'' as the teams headed to their 
benches for a TV timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the place went crazy as the screen on the scoreboard  
hanging over center ice began replaying Gretzky highlights, listing 
all his championships and many of his offensive records -- all to 
the music of Carly Simon's ``Nobody Does it Better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camera in the stadium also picked up one banner that read:  
``Thanks, Mr. Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky raised his stick and waved at the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I was 16 years old and playing for $21 a  
week,'' Gretzky said. ``And the fans in Ottawa gave me ovations 
then, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, the arena spotlight picked up Gretzky as he  
skated from the New York net to the boards in front of the Rangers' 
bench. As he leaned there smiling, all the Ottawa players skated 
over and one by one shook his hand. The Rangers, in a semicircle, 
tapped their sticks on the ice in a salute to the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's wife, Janet, was crying in the stands as her husband  
was announced as the game's only star, and the building erupted in 
more cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa fans weren't finished with their lovefest. They  
remained on their feet, cheering and applauding until Gretzky came 
out for a curtain call. He circled the ice, waved, smiled and 
headed down the tunnel toward the dressing room again. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't nearly enough. The fans continued to cheer for 10 more  
minutes until Gretzky, this time without any pads under his 
sweater, came out for a second curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume started building during warmups before the game  
between Gretzky's Rangers and the Senators at the Corel Centre. 
Then, the crowd roared when his name was announced in the starting 
lineup moments before the Canadian national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who has been bothered by injuries this season, skated  
23 shifts. He played 23 minutes, 9 seconds, but took only two 
shots, none during the five-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the Wayne Gretzky of 1988,'' he said. ``I still think  
I can contribute. But it's an 82-game grind. Teams in this league 
play hard every night. I'm thinking about those 82 games next year, 
no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators took a 1-0 lead on Nelson Emerson's goal with 55  
seconds left in the first period, but even that didn't produce the 
buzz the Great One did every time he stepped on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a great roar of anticipation at 7:36 of the third  
period when Gretzky fed a beautiful lead pass to John MacLean 
streaking in on Ottawa goaltender Damian Rhodes. But the roar 
turned to a moan when MacLean missed the shot and a chance for 
Gretzky to add to his point total had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky will retire as the NHL's all-time leading scorer. In  
1,486 games, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 2,856 
points. He was named the league's most valuable player nine times 
and led the league in scoring 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Leetch and Adam Graves also scored for New York. Ottawa's  
Marian Hossa tied it with 6:48 left in the third.

<HEADLINE>  40 Killed by Colombia Mudslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The search for survivors from a pair of  
mudslides in western Colombia slowed Friday, after rescuers 
recovered 40 bodies and only one couple remained missing, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of torrential rains, mudslides on Thursday buried  
several blocks of the town of Argelia, 150 miles west of Bogota. 
The first slide occurred before dawn, the second after 
firefighters, police and civil defense workers had arrived to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivor Maria Dolores Villa said she tried to warn the new  
relief workers that the area was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shouted to stay away, but they had come to rescue a young  
girl and just kept at it,'' the El Espectador newspaper quoted her 
as saying. ``I saw the mountain break into two and bury them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the disaster could have been prevented.

<HEADLINE>  40 Killed by Colombia Mudslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The search for survivors from a pair of  
mudslides in western Colombia slowed Friday, after rescuers 
recovered 40 bodies and only one couple remained missing, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of torrential rains, mudslides on Thursday buried  
several blocks of the town of Argelia, 150 miles west of Bogota. 
The first slide occurred before dawn, the second after 
firefighters, police and civil defense workers had arrived to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivor Maria Dolores Villa said she tried to warn the new  
relief workers that the area was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shouted to stay away, but they had come to rescue a young  
girl and just kept at it,'' the El Espectador newspaper quoted her 
as saying. ``I saw the mountain break into two and bury them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the disaster could have been prevented.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole town is in mourning, but as always happens in  
Colombia, people die first and find solutions later,'' Jhon Jairo 
Castillo, director of Argelia's disaster committee, told The 
Associated Press in a telephone interview.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Organ Donation Up 5.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of organ donors jumped 5.6 percent  
last year, the first substantial increase in three years, as more 
older donors were recruited and hospitals began working more 
closely with transplant coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase to 5,479 donors enabled about 600 more transplants  
in 1998 over 1997, the Department of Health and Human Services said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organ donation saves lives, but the need for organs is still  
greater than the supply,'' HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 people die each year waiting for a transplant. At  
the end of 1998, there were 64,423 people waiting, a number that 
has been growing much faster than donation has. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was most dramatic among donors age 60 and older,  
jumping 10.8 percent to 782 donors. Older patients have 
traditionally been passed over by organ banks and hospitals because 
their hearts, kidneys and livers tend to be less healthy than 
organs from younger patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the need for organs has grown and organ transplant  
methods have improved, organ banks have increasingly been asking 
families of older patients to donate. 
</P>
<P>
	Donations also rose 9.6 percent for donors age 40 to 59. It  
edged up only slightly for younger groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The HHS also credited a new federal rule that requires hospitals  
to report all deaths to the organ banks that are responsible for 
approaching families about donation and coordinating transplants. 
Experts believe some 3,000 to 4,000 potential donor families are 
never asked about donation. The rule aims to ensure that hospitals 
do not overlook patients who may make suitable donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's increase came despite a high-profile controversy  
that many feared would make families nervous about donation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centers on how to allocate the scarce organs that  
are donated. The network that runs the transplant system and many 
transplant hospitals want the system to retain its geographic 
boundaries, with organs offered to local patients first. The 
Clinton administration wants organs offered to the sickest patients 
first, even if they are in another city or region. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ultimately put off the administration's proposed  
changes while the issue is being studied by the Institute of 
Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the controversy has helped us,'' said Richard  
Luskin, president of the Association of Organ Procurement 
Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The one area of agreement has been the need to increase the  
number of donors. 
</P>
<P>
	A public service campaign has been urging people to tell their  
families if they want to be organ donors, since polling shows most 
people never discuss the issue. ``Share your life, share your 
decision,'' is the campaign's tag line. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, a ceremony will be held in Washington to recognize  
families of people who donated. Some 200 people who donated their 
own kidneys or their loved ones' organs plan to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics for 1998 were compiled by the United Nework for  
Organ Sharing and released by the HHS. They also show: 
</P>
<P>
	--The increase in donation was 6.6 percent among whites and 7.8  
percent among Hispanics. But the number of black donors did not 
increase and the number of Asian donors dropped 8.4 percent. There 
is considerable concern about donation rates among blacks, which 
are already lower than other races. 
</P>
<P>
	--The increase was largest in the region made up of Michigan,  
Indiana and Ohio, at 13 percent. Next was the region of Iowa, 
Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado, at 11.3 percent. 
The Oklahoma-Texas region registered a 9.1 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	--There was no significant increase in New England; the region  
consisting of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and 
New Jersey; and the region covering Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, 
North Dakota and South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	--Other regions' increases were near the national average. No  
region recorded a decrease.

<HEADLINE> Homes Destroyed by Florida Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Bob Dufresne sat in his van this  
morning, hoping his home wasn't one of the 40 burned to the ground 
by a wind-driven blaze that raced through the sun-baked 
neighborhoods of Port St. Lucie. 
</P>
<P>
	He heard the house behind his was gone. He remembered seeing  
bushes across the smoky street start to burn as he fled with his 
wife, Gail. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I left, the fire was heading straight for it,'' Dufresne  
said of his home as he stared at police lights at a roadblock 100 
yards away. ``I don't know if it's standing or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 60 homes in this eastern Florida community were  
damaged by the fire Thursday. Police Lt. Steve Claus said at least 
40 were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas of the rain-starved state, more than 150 people  
were forced out of their homes by fires that burned some 2,500 
acres in Osceola and Collier counties. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths or serious injuries were reported. Authorities were  
still worried about hot spots today -- the fire had been considered 
out late Wednesday, but flared as it was fanned by winds gusting to 
30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials say that without any significant rain, conditions  
are ripe for a repeat of last summer's blazes that scorched 500,000 
acres and forced 100,000 residents from their homes. Drought-like 
conditions have already prompted an emergency declaration from the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Port St. Lucie, with a population of nearly 80,000 and home to  
the New York Mets spring training camp, is 105 miles southeast of 
Orlando on Florida's Treasure Coast. It is home to many retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it was contained, the fire here charred 2,400 acres as it  
moved toward an area with about 200 homes, state emergency 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 homes lost power and authorities kept watch for  
looters. Some people, who were forced from their homes, were 
escorted back into their neighborhoods early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki Roenbeck was one of many residents gathered at a roadblock  
just before midnight hoping to get back to their homes. She had 
just arrived from work, where she had watched news reports of 
burning homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get to my house,'' Ms. Roenbeck, 36, pleaded  
with a deputy, her voice shaking. ``My husband called me at 4 
o'clock and that's the last I've heard from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dee Braley, 29, was sitting on her car smoking a cigarette,  
waiting for permission to go to her home just a street away. Hours 
earlier, she had refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came by one time and told me I had to evacuate and I just  
stayed,'' she said. ``And then they came back and said `Ma'am, 
you'll have to go now or we'll have to physically remove you. I 
didn't feel like arguing with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She gathered a bag with insurance papers and clothes before  
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even sure if they're matched,'' Ms. Braley said.  
``When I walked outside it was hard to breathe. It was like a black 
fog. It burned your eyes and you could feel it in your chest.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Looks at Corporate Bond Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel has approved legislation  
prodding securities regulators to act to make price data on 
corporate bonds as clearly available as information about stocks 
and government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote Thursday, the House Commerce finance subcommittee  
approved the bill written by Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., sending it 
to the full Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would order the Securities and Exchange Commission  
to adopt new rules governing price disclosure in the corporate bond 
market. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has endorsed the legislation, 
saying that incomplete information on bond prices makes investors 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Wall Street bond dealers, meanwhile, has offered its  
own electronic system for reporting prices at which they buy and 
sell corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater numbers of ordinary investors have started buying  
corporate bonds, which now have a U.S. market of $2.4 trillion -- 
nearly twice the size of the municipal bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate bonds are considered integral to the stock market's  
performance, because it would be difficult to make sound judgments 
on a company's stock without accurate data on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their rapid growth, lawmakers and federal regulators  
believe corporate bonds have fallen behind stocks and other bond 
markets in the openness of their prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an SEC review of bond markets, the National  
Association of Securities Dealers agreed last year to adopt rules 
requiring dealers to report all corporate bond transactions to the 
NASD and develop systems for immediate disclosure of transaction 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, a self-policing group that operates the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, also has said it will improve its efforts to detect fraud 
in corporate bond trading. While the SEC review found that the 
overall bond market was running smoothly, it uncovered anecdotal 
evidence of possible insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike stocks, the vast majority of bonds are not traded in a  
central market. They are bought and sold over the telephone by a 
relatively small group of dealers that includes major brokerages 
such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Lab Says Needles Were Reused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- At least 3,600 people who had blood  
work performed at a lab are being warned to get tested for AIDS and 
hepatitis after a technician admitted reusing needles since June 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Any patients sent to the SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratory  
since the technician began working there could be at risk, state 
health officials said Friday. Letters warning of the risks are 
being mailed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the risk of anyone being infected is extremely  
low,'' said Dr. Jon Rosenberg, the state epidemiologist directing 
the investigation. Still, ``we believe these people have the right 
to be notified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technician, a woman in her 50s who has since been fired,  
typically worked alone. She told investigators that she washed the 
needles with water and diluted hydrogen peroxide, then put them in 
clean needle containers before drawing blood from patients with 
difficult-to-pierce veins. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how often she did this, or why, although  
investigators who interviewed her said she apparently didn't do it 
maliciously. Her name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing she said that suggests she was deliberately  
putting patients at risk even though at some point she realized 
that it was wrong,'' Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline only learned what she was doing after a co-worker  
discovered the needles being washed in a sink and ``was 
nauseated,'' said Dr. Ed Kaufman, national medical director for 
SmithKline Beecham labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we are both shocked and baffled by this practice. It's  
a breach of medical care,'' Kaufman said at a news conference with 
Rosenberg. ``She can't explain why she did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said the risk of anyone being infected is low because  
drawing blood is less likely to transmit viruses than injections, 
because she claimed she only reused needles occasionally and 
because the hydrogen peroxide would kill some viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, doctors at Stanford University Hospital, which is  
adjacent from the lab, were alarmed. The lab is not affiliated with 
the hospital 
</P>
<P>
	``It breaks a lot of rules we teach our staff here not to do,''  
said Jim Schweikhard, director of environmental health and safety 
at the hospital. ``It really puts patients at risk for various 
diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technician, who was trained as a phlebotomist in 1984 and  
certified to draw blood by SmithKline after a company training 
program, also worked at 10 other laboratories in the San Francisco 
Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and county health departments ``are intensively  
investigating every one of those places'' although they have no 
evidence she reused needles elsewhere, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it learned of the problem on March 22, SmithKline has  
reviewed training procedures at its 800 blood test sites across the 
country, and is satisfied that its training procedures are 
adequate, Kaufman said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air Loses Delta Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Delta Air Lines is dropping its flight  
partnership with Korean Air following yet another fatal plane crash 
by the foreign carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Wednesday, Delta had said it stood by its ``code-share''  
arrangement, despite the dissemination of an internal report by two 
Korean Air pilots raising safety concerns at the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Under code-sharing, passengers traveling to Asia on a Delta  
ticket might make some legs of their trip on planes operated by 
Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta would not code-share with any carrier it did not believe  
to be safe,'' Delta spokesman Clay McConnell said Wednesday. He 
reaffirmed the statement after the crash Thursday of a Korean Air 
cargo jet in Shanghai, China. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Delta announced suspension of its partnership and  
said it would not book passengers on flights operated by Korean Air 
pending review of the airline's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta will begin immediately to contact Delta customers booked  
on KAL-operated flights to assist them in making alternative travel 
arrangements,'' the Atlanta-based carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's internal safety review stemmed from the carrier's  
troublesome track record: More than 700 people killed in 20 years, 
among them 228 who died when a Korean Air Boeing 747 flew into a 
hill on Guam in August 1997 and 269 killed when a Soviet MiG 
fighter shot down KAL Flight 007 after the 747 strayed into the 
Soviet Union's airspace in September 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, United Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, has  
had 140 passenger deaths in the same two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Korean Air picked 19 of its pilots to participate in  
an internal safety review. A report written by two of them 
highlighted a number of incidents: 
</P>
<P>
	--During an airport approach, a copilot responded to air traffic  
instructions intended for another plane and veered off course. The 
captain responded by hitting him on the back of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
	--While planning an airline flight, a crew did not discuss the  
expected weather or the amount of fuel necessary. Such decisions, 
they said, should be made by the captain alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the report: In-flight newspaper reading by flight crews.  
Alternate landing sites not approved for the size of plane flown. 
Arguments between a pilot and a dispatcher about how much fuel to 
load for an ocean crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report surfaced recently on the Internet. While the airline  
confirmed its authenticity, Korean Air officials said the findings 
were exaggerated and out of line with observations made by the 
other 17 pilots in the safety review. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found some issues, but nowhere near the degree of these  
two pilots,'' said airline spokeswoman Penny Pfaelzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hardy, a captain and Korean Air's deputy director of flight  
operations, said: ``What they ended up reporting in that document, 
they ended up pumping out, a lot of that is like barroom talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy said Korean Air has had problems, but the Guam crash  
marked a turning point for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident prompted senior management to begin a $114 million  
safety overhaul, including a top-to-bottom review of Korean Air's 
flight operations. The carrier also recruited more experienced 
pilots from Western carriers and hired safety consultants from 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's being done here is to take this airline and this flight  
operations department and make it state-of-the-art,'' Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's problems may stem in part from its rapid growth.  
Thirty years ago, it was an eight-plane local carrier. Using former 
pilots from South Korea's air force, it has exploded into the 
world's 13th-largest passenger airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, the two pilots, whom Korean Air refused to  
name, said some problems are rooted in a culture in which pilots 
defer to their seniors, even when they make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently, in some Korean cockpits, there is a volatile  
cocktail of complacency, arrogance, apathy and a lack of 
self-discipline,'' the pilots wrote. ``These attitudes must be 
removed from the flight deck at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees safety of  
U.S. skies, said Korean officials are responsible for the safety of 
the airline. The agency could ground an individual plane for safety 
problems, but under international aviation treaties, South Korea's 
government has responsibility for maintaining the carrier's safety 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Thursday's crash, which occurred shortly after  
takeoff, is under investigation, but an airline executive said it 
may have been the result of a terrorist act. It killed the 
three-member crew and at least five people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other signs of lingering problems at Korean Air.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a company jet skidded off a runway while landing in  
Pohang, South Korea and split in two. Nineteen passengers were 
injured. In September, another plane overshot a runway, and a month 
before that, a Korean Air Boeing 747 skidded off a runway in Seoul 
and tore off its landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	After the runway accidents and several other minor incidents  
last year, South Korean officials ordered the carrier to cut back 
domestic flights by 15 percent for six months. The restriction is 
to end April 25.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Rules Irish Infractions Minor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- NCAA enforcement officials have  
recommended that contact between a former Notre Dame booster and up 
to a dozen Irish football players be ruled a secondary infraction, 
meaning no major sanctions would be levied against the program, 
school officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee on Infractions, an independent body composed of  
individuals from member institutions, will make a final decision on 
what penalties the Irish face. Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Moore 
said school officials will also have to appear before the 
committee, but it has not received final word on when a hearing 
will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the staff's recommendation, but the case is not  
finished yet,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the committee accepts the recommendation, the Irish will  
avoid the more serious sanctions that accompany a major violation, 
including losing scholarships or television privileges, recruiting 
restrictions and postseason bans. 
</P>
<P>
	According to NCAA rules, secondary infractions result in a wide  
range of minor sanctions, including probation without penalties to 
a minor loss of scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	No current players are in danger of losing eligibility, Moore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA officials did not return calls seeking comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The announcement brings the university one step closer to an end  
in its 13-month investigation of contact between Kimberly Dunbar 
and players. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar, now serving a four-year prison term for embezzlement,  
used money she stole from her employer to purchase gifts, trips and 
jewelry for up to a dozen current and former Irish players. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, however, is only interested in her interaction with  
Irish players after June 1995, the date it ruled that Dunbar became 
a representative of the university through her membership in the 
defunct Quarterback Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Dunbar has testified in court records she  
gave a former player $5,000 to pay off a sports agent who 
threatened to reveal his contact, paid for a weekend jaunt to Las 
Vegas with Derrick Mayes, and paid for the families of several 
players to travel to games. 
</P>
<P>
	She also has a child with former Irish player Jarvis Edison.  
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA cleared five players on the 1998 team of any wrongdoing  
after Dunbar paid for them to attend a Chicago Bulls game. The five 
donated the cost of the trip to charity at the university's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were dealing with a situation where there was just a great  
deal of it that we couldn't know,'' Moore said. ``These events took 
place in the context of a series of personal relationships between 
Kimberly Dunbar and various players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a case as if she were giving things to the entire  
team or huge numbers of players. It was generally an individual and 
an individual's friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar's former employer, Jerry Dominiack, has sued Dunbar's  
mother, sister and five former Notre Dame players -- Edison, Lee 
Becton, Ray Zellars, Mayes and Kinnon Tatum -- to recoup some of the 
more than $1.4 million she embezzled from Dominiack Mechanical Inc.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Partners Sue Marge Schott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A fight over who will buy control of the  
Cincinnati Reds from Marge Schott has wound up in court, with 
limited partners of the team suing Schott to enforce their right to 
match outside offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott's partners in the Reds' ownership sued her Thursday in  
Hamilton County Common Pleas Court because she tried to sell her 
controlling interest in the team to a group led by her cousin, 
after she had already received an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides planned to meet this afternoon with Judge  
Robert Ruehlman to discuss when a hearing could be scheduled. James 
Burke, lawyer for the Reds' limited partners, said he wanted the 
judge to preserve the status quo until hisa side can argue its 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott told the limited partners on Monday that she intended to  
sell for more money to a group headed by Stephen Schott, who is the 
cousin of her late husband. The limited partners asked the court 
Thursday to block that proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Steve Schott agreement was a transparent, legally invalid  
attempt to extract an additional $12 million from the limited 
partners and obtain a $2.68 million 'commission' for Steve 
Schott,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners contend that they have the right to buy her  
shares because they matched an earlier offer from a group headed by 
Larry Dolan, a Cleveland lawyer who is the brother of Cablevision's 
chairman Charles Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners contractually have the right to match any  
offer that Marge Schott receives for her shares in the club. She 
agreed last November to sell rather than face another suspension 
from baseball from objectionable remarks she made about minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan's group offered $65 million for all but one of Schott's  
shares in February, and the limited partners notified Schott that 
they intended to match. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners have asked the judge to rule that Dolan's  
offer was binding, giving the partners a chance to buy out Schott 
by matching the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners filing the lawsuit are the Great American  
Insurance Co. owned by Carl Lindner; American Laundry Machinery 
Inc. owned by George and Anthony Strike, and William J. Reik. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schott did not return telephone calls today to her home or  
office. Her lawyer, Frank Kelley of Lansing, Mich., did not return 
a call to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley, the former attorney general of Michigan, told The  
Cincinnati Enquirer that he was handed the lawsuit at 5:30 p.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't unexpected,'' Kelley told the newspaper. ``It's a  
55-page document and I haven't had time to study it.''

<HEADLINE> Stottlemyre, Hayes Ejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and San  
Francisco third baseman Charlie Hayes were ejected from Friday 
night's game in the sixth inning after Hayes charged the mound and 
punched the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Both dugouts and bullpens emptied, and it took umpires several  
minutes to restore order. Hayes had to be restrained by teammate 
Barry Bonds even after the altercation ended. Bonds wrapped his 
arms around Hayes and walked him off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona manager Buck Showalter argued Stottlemyre shouldn't have  
been ejected, saying at one point to the umpires, ``What's he 
supposed to do, not defend himself?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Stottlemyre was forced to leave, shouting at a Giants coach  
as he walked off. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred with one out in the sixth and Arizona  
leading 8-3. Ellis Burks walked, J.T. Snow singled, Hayes hit into 
a fielder's choice and Brent Mayne followed with a single to drive 
in Burks. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hayes went to second, he charged toward the mound and took a  
wing, striking Stottlemyre on the shoulder. Stottlemyre, known as a 
fierce competitor with a sometimes nasty mouth, tumbled to the 
ground entangled with Hayes. Matt Williams charged from third and 
tackled Hayes and the dugouts emptied in a giant heap. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second dugout-clearing incident for Arizona. The  
Diamondbacks charged the mound at Dodger Stadium in the second game 
of the season when Williams thought Chan Ho Park was throwing at 
his head. Stottlemyre was pitching that day for Arizona, too.

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Great Wayne Gretzky Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky, simply the best hockey player  
ever, announced his retirement today after two unforgettable 
decades on the ice, walking away from the game he loves despite 
pleas from friends and family not to go. 
</P>
<P>
	And so the 38-year-old Great One will say goodbye in Sunday's  
season finale against Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	No one could change his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	Not his wife, not the prime minister of his native Canada, not  
even his idol Gordie Howe, who advised No. 99 to wait at least a 
few more months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game,'' Gretzky said earlier this week. ``No  
matter what happens, I'm going to miss it more than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His departure marks the second time in three months that one of  
the world's premier athletes -- and the best in his sport -- has 
chosen retirement. But unlike Michael Jordan, who left after 
winning his sixth NBA championship, Gretzky ends his career with a 
disappointing New York Rangers team that didn't even make the 
playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to go out like Michael Jordan did, but it's  
not a perfect world. ... It's not going to happen that way, not 
this year, but it is nice to be able to say people do want me to 
play more,'' Gretzky had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the 10-time scoring champion and nine-time MVP  
decided to leave sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
	Classy and fair-haired with a charismatic smile, if Gretzky was  
a superstar in the United States, he was a virtual demigod in his 
home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians have been aware of Gretzky since he was a peewee, and  
can recite such minutiae as the 104 goals he scored in 62 games at 
age 8, or the 378 goals in 82 games when he was all of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	With his magnificent skills and a humble, gentlemanly manner,  
Gretzky was a perfect goodwill ambassador for hockey. He has been 
the NHL's biggest box-office draw for most of his 20 years in the 
league, and never has been shy about that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,486 games with teams in Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis  
and New York, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 2,856 
points -- 1,000 points more than runner-up Howe scored in his Hall 
of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	Such achievements can't be predicted, not even for a teen-ager  
who breaks into the World Hockey Association and has no trouble 
keeping up with the rugged men of that league. By his second pro 
season, Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers were part of the NHL, which 
merged with the WHA in part to get their budding star into its 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-scoring Oilers featured such future Hall of Famers as  
Mark Messier, Paul Coffey, Jari Kurri and Grant Fuhr, but they 
always were Gretzky's team. And they replaced the hallowed Montreal 
Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs as Canada's team in winning four 
Stanley Cups in a five-year span from 1984-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the unthinkable: In his prime, Gretzky was traded to  
the Los Angeles Kings, mainly as a cost-conscious move by Oilers 
owner Peter Pocklington, who later would be vilified in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	But that 1988 deal brought a new challenge, and not  
surprisingly, Gretzky was up to it. Kings games became an ``in'' 
thing in LA. Hollywood's stars turned out to see Gretzky, and the 
Kings' newfound popularity eventually led to teams in hot-weather 
cities like Miami, Tampa, Fla., Anaheim and San Jose, Calif., 
Dallas, Phoenix and Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	After being traded to St. Louis in February 1996, Gretzky signed  
as a free agent with the Rangers that summer and remained the most 
recognizable and influential force in hockey. His third and final 
season in New York was one of the most discouraging for Gretzky, 
who missed 12 games due to a neck injury, while the Rangers missed 
the playoffs for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	He had played in 223 straight games since joining the Rangers.  
The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc. In 
1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Kings to the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky did not want a ``farewell tour'' next season with fans  
and teams showering him with accolades as he played his final games 
around the league. He did get a taste of it, though, as fans 
responded to Gretzky at various arenas as the season came to a 
close and the possibility he would retire loomed larger. 
</P>
<P>
	At what turned out to be Gretzky's final game in Canada, the  
18,449 fans in Ottawa on Thursday night chanted ``One more year!'' 
during the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, the arena spotlight picked up Gretzky as he  
skated from the New York net to the boards in front of the Rangers' 
bench. As he leaned there smiling, all the Ottawa players skated 
over and one by one shook his hand. The Rangers, in a semicircle, 
tapped their sticks on the ice in a salute to the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's wife, Janet, was crying in the stands as her husband  
was announced as the game's only star, and the crowd roared again 
and didn't stop until he made two curtain calls 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one important milestone  
for the NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the year 
gave him 1,072 as a professional, moving him past boyhood hero 
Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the staggering total, which includes playoff goals,  
in 20 NHL seasons and one in the WHA. Howe scored his total during 
his 26 years in the NHL and WHA. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky had 56 goals in the WHA with Indianapolis and Edmonton  
to go along with his overall total of 1,016 in the NHL.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Man To Be Tried on Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) -- A man on Friday was ordered  
to stand trial in the abduction of two women who said they were 
held in bondage and sexually tortured. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Neil Mertz said the evidence was sufficient to  
show David Parker Ray may have committed the crimes outlined in the 
25 counts against him. The charges include kidnapping, criminal 
sexual penetration and aggravated battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond was continued at $1 million cash. No trial date was set.  
</P>
<P>
	Charges against Ray's co-defendant, Cynthia Lea Hendy, were  
reduced from 25 to five counts of conspiracy and being an 
accessory. A proposed plea agreement would put her in prison for at 
least 12 years. Hendy waived a preliminary hearing earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defendant, Dennis Roy Yancy, is charged with murdering a  
22-year-old woman who vanished from a bar two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	During a two-day preliminary hearing, the two women testified of  
being abducted, chained, sexually tortured with objects and given 
electric shocks. One woman escaped and reported the attack, and the 
other came forward at that time with the story of a similar ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women said were assaulted in a trailer near Ray and Hendy's  
mobile home. The trailer, called the ``toy box,'' contained 
chemicals, surgical tools, sexual devices, a gurney, pulleys, 
weights, and video cameras, investigator John Briscoe testified 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found ``instructions on how to handle excuses  
given by a captive,'' Briscoe said. ``Don't let her get to you, if 
she's worth taking, she's worth keeping,'' the instructions read. 
``To intensify her fear, tell her she will be kept as a sex 
slave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both women said they listened to an audiotape, described as an  
orientation tape, that told them what they would experience during 
their captivity. It said, ``Once we get tired of you, we'll get rid 
of you,'' one of the women testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators searching the mobile home also found blood, hair  
and feces, a cattle prod and a coffin-like box that had hooks for 
restraints at each end and was equipped with an electric fan and a 
vent, Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Ron Lopez said there were other victims who  
have not yet been identified. ``I don't think he was after somebody 
who was willing. He likes to see the pain and the torture,'' Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's attorney, Jeff Rein, had argued that some of the charges  
should be dismissed, saying his client did not hold a gun used to 
threaten the women and that the two victims' injuries were not 
sufficient to prove great bodily harm.

<HEADLINE> Sheen Takes Card Collection Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charlie Sheen is taking his baseball cards and  
going home. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor is removing his collection from the All-Star Cafe,  
where three former employees have been charged in the theft of some 
of the valuable cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 27 cards stolen last year were a rare Honus Wagner  
card, a sheet of 25 unseparated 1934 cards and a 1933 card of 
Hall-of-Famer Napoleon LaJoie, the FBI said Thursday. All but two 
cards have been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I'm pleased that the investigation is a success thus  
far, I am deeply saddened that such precious artifacts have been 
mutilated in the hands of amateurs for the pursuit of greed,'' 
Sheen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says two employees stole cards in March and April 1998  
from display cases in the ``Charlie Sheen Room,'' then sold them to 
a memorabilia dealer with the help of a co-worker and another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen's spokesman said the actor will remove all his baseball  
memorabilia from All-Star Cafes in New York and Las Vegas. A 
spokeswoman for the restaurants did not return a call for comment.

	Pentagon To Seek Reserve Call-Up  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is preparing to ask that 33,000  
reserve forces be activated to serve in the Balkans and President 
Clinton is likely to approve the request, government officials said 
today. The call-up request is likely to be presented to the 
president early next week. It will call for volunteers in 
maintenance and support personnel, mostly from the Air National 
Guard to handle duties such as refueling and aircraft servicing. 
The call-up would be the biggest since more than 200,000 reservists 
were activated during the Persian Gulf War.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO pounded military targets in the  
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and hit key sites around the 
Yugoslav capital Belgrade today, while refugees arriving from 
Kosovo reported an intensified push by Serb forces to empty whole 
communities of ethnic Albanians. Thousands of ethnic Albanians have 
been crossing over into Macedonia and Albania in what observers 
believe may be a final push by Yugoslav forces to rid Kosovo of its 
ethnic Albanian population. Refugees say Serb forces have shelled 
and shot at some of them as they made their way toward the borders.

	Clinton Finds Time for Fund-Raising  
</P>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- President Clinton is returning to the  
fund-raising circuit today even as he tries to maintain public 
focus on the U.S. military's engagement in Kosovo. Between a 
fund-raising luncheon in Michigan and a dinner near Boston, Clinton 
plans to meet with support personnel at military bases and with 
Detroit-area residents involved in Kosovo humanitarian relief 
efforts. Clinton canceled a fund-raising swing through western 
states at the outset of the conflict. But with NATO airstrikes into 
their fourth week administration officials are determined to show 
they are also tending to normal business.

winner today of a presidential race in which all six other 
contenders pulled out to protest fraud. Bouteflika, 63, a former 
foreign minister, was elected with 73.8 percent of the vote, the

million units in March, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, 
compared to a revised 1.79 million construction rate in February.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Signs Monson Long-Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Dan Monson, who coached Gonzaga within a  
win of the Final Four, has signed a 10-year contract, university 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the contract, which contains options for additional  
years, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson had been courted by a number of bigger schools after the  
Bulldogs posted the best record in school history, 28-7, including 
the loss to eventual national champion Connecticut in the NCAA West 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gonzaga made me a very flattering offer I am excited to  
accept,'' Monson said before leaving for a coaching clinic in 
Nashville, Tenn. ``I have been very happy with my arrangement with 
Gonzaga over the past 11 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson's players were happy as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have a coach of his caliber return to lead us  
for another year,'' junior Richie Frahm said, speaking on behalf of 
the team. ``He inherited a program which had been strong in the 
'90s and made it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Roth said negotiations with Monson for a  
new contract began in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted Dan to know he is wanted at Gonzaga,'' Roth said.  
``We knew his name would be associated with several job 
opportunities and we thought it was in his best interest and ours 
to put our offer on the table first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson became head coach March 1, 1997, after former coach Dan  
Fitzgerald resigned in the face of an NCAA investigation. Monson 
had been assistant coach and associate head coach for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trustees, regents, university community, and especially  
myself, couldn't be more pleased with Dan's acceptance of our 
contract,'' Gonzaga President Rev. Robert Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, who was born in Spokane and graduated from the  
University of Idaho, was an assistant coach at Oregon City, Ore., 
and a graduate assistant at the University of Alabama-Birmingham 
before coming to Gonzaga in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth also announced that Mark Few, an assistant for eight years,  
has been promoted to associate head coach. Assistant coaches Bill 
Grier and Scott Snider also will return next season.

<HEADLINE> NFL Europe League To Start Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawrence Phillips gets another chance at pro  
football when his Barcelona Dragons open the NFL Europe league 
season this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows he has to get through a lot in the next few months,  
but so far I have been 100 percent pleased with everything,'' said 
Dragons coach Jack Bicknell, who took Phillips in the 10th round of 
the league draft after he was cut in training camp last summer by 
the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never sat down and told him this is his last chance. If  
he can't figure that out, he doesn't need to hear it from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, the No. 6 overall pick in the 1996 NFL draft, has had  
a turbulent career with various run-ins with the law since his days 
at Nebraska, including 23 days of jail time during his 19 months 
with the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Bicknell described Phillips as ``everything you want in a  
football player and a teammate. He's in great shape -- 208 pounds 
and zero percent of fat'' with only a niggling hamstring injury 
slowing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who feels he has been treated unfairly by the media,  
has declined interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a great kid here and you can see he's been burned by  
what's happened,'' Bicknell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also trying to resurrect his career will be Heisman Trophy  
winner Andre Ware. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are a lot of people like me who would like to  
see those guys do well, because it's probably their last chance,'' 
league president Oliver Luck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware has a profitable computer business in Houston, which he  
terms his ``B plan.'' Now it's back to work on the ``A plan'': 
making it as an NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does seem a long way away, but this is where it begins,''  
said Ware, who starts for the Berlin Thunder this weekend in a 
league designed to groom young talent and give guys like Ware and 
Phillips another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware says he's never been in the right place at the right time  
since winning the Heisman at Houston in 1989 and calls his four 
years as a backup with the Detroit Lions a ``continual setback with 
three different offenses in four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to right himself in the Canadian Football League, ``but  
it was a similar thing with three teams in three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Ware stepped away from football and worked as an  
active partner in a computer consulting business in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer I was away from it (football) last year the more I  
missed it,'' he said. ``The juice started to flow about midseason 
and I knew I wanted to see about getting back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Raiders signed Ware as a free agent and expect him  
to compete with Rich Gannon, Wade Wilson and Pat Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to starting here this weekend,'' Ware  
said. ``And I like my chances of being No. 1 when the season kicks 
off for the Raiders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Frankfurt Galaxy play the Thunder in an  
all-German clash in Frankfurt, while the Amsterdam Admirals travel 
to Barcelona. On Sunday, the defending champion Scottish Claymores 
are home for the Duesseldorf Rhein Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams after the 10-game regular season will meet in  
the World Bowl in Duesseldorf on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The major change this season is the closure of the one-time  
``flagship'' franchise, the London/England Monarchs, which has been 
replaced by a third German team -- the Thunder, coached by Wes 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	As a developmental league, NFL Europe has been a rousing  
success, with 139 NFL Europe veterans playing last season in the 
NFL. About 150 players have been allocated this season from the 
NFL, up 97 from last year.

<HEADLINE> DNC Announces 2000 Convention Dates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Convention, making its  
first appearance in Los Angeles in 40 years, will be held Aug. 
14-17, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Aug. 17, 2000, a new Democratic candidate will answer his  
party's call to lead America into the next frontier,'' party 
Chairman Joe Andrew said Friday in announcing the convention dates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee announced last month that Los  
Angeles had been chosen as the convention city. The last Democratic 
convention held there was in 1960, when John F. Kennedy was 
nominated as president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Party will hold its 2000 convention in  
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also announced that Carlottia Scott, now chief of  
staff for Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., and a former aide in Jesse 
Jackson's presidential efforts, will be the DNC's chief of 
politics. Jeff Forbes, the White House's top scheduler, will be 
chief of strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott and Forbes will split the workload of former political  
director Jill Alper, who is leaving the DNC for the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Friday, Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign  
announced that Donna Brazile will be its political director and 
deputy campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile now is chief of staff and press secretary for Eleanor  
Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate to Congress. She 
was national field director for Rep. Dick Gephardt's 1988 
presidential campaign and has been a consultant to the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee.

<HEADLINE> Rain Keeps Tribe's Gooden Off Mound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dwight Gooden is trying to stay patient.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm dying to get out there. I just want to pitch,'' Gooden  
said Friday night after the Cleveland Indians were rained out for 
the second straight night, with rain forcing postponement of the 
game against the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden keeps getting pushed back. Charles Nagy, originally  
scheduled to start Thursday night against Kansas City, is now down 
to pitch Saturday against Brad Radke in the opener of a day-night 
doubleheader. Jaret Wright is to start the night game for Cleveland 
against Eric Milton. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians manager Mike Hargrove said he understands Gooden's  
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably won't pitch until the 21st or 22nd,'' Hargrove  
said. ``If we don't push him back, it gets everybody else off their 
turn. That's the territory of being a fifth starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden said he understands the situation and is trying to stay  
sharp, mentally and physically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to face some hitters in a game situation,'' Gooden  
said. ``Mentally, you have to keep a positive attitude. Physically, 
I have special program because of my shoulder so I can't do too 
much, but I have to do some work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden lasted just two-thirds of an inning in his only start of  
the season, April 10 at Minnesota. He allowed five runs on five 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``My last outing in spring training wasn't too good, and I  
didn't do too well in Minnesota,'' Gooden said. ``I need to get 
back out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has won seven straight following a season-opening loss  
at Anaheim. Hargrove didn't think the rainouts will affect the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will do anything to the momentum,'' he said.  
``If you are going real bad a rainout isn't all that bad to have 
even though at some point you know you have to make the game up. 
The way I look at it is whenever you can, it is better to just 
play.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Co. Sorts Through Clutter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?  
</P>
<P>
	Asking that question through a leading Internet search engine  
turns up a mind-numbing 57.8 million choices, ranging from Web 
sites on rocker Chuck Berry to 19th century American history to 
golf pro Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, research Web companies seeking the next Internet gold mine  
have begun delivering a revolutionary response -- the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask Jeeves!'' (www.ask.com) may be among the first search  
engines to respond to simple-language questions instead of 
keywords. 
</P>
<P>
	By analyzing sentence construction, the site sorts a database of  
research and discards the ones that don't match up, said Kathy 
Loewenstern, an exhibitor who advertised her wares at the Spring 
Internet World '99 convention, which ended Friday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	It answers the perennial woodchuck question by finding a site  
describing the furry creature's metabolism. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is designed for simple answers such as ``Who was the  
13th president?'' or ``How deep is the ocean?'' But as Ms. 
Loewenstern invited passers-by to ``Ask it anything!'' she often 
invited sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Which came first, the chicken or the egg?'' typed  
conventioneer Harold Shapiro, a local technician for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeeves'' couldn't come up with a simple answer, directing the  
searcher to sites including ones with audio of a chicken or 
instructions on how to poach an egg. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shapiro said he was impressed with the site, which has  
received on average 2.4 million visitors a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most searches don't even come close to what you're looking  
for,'' he said. ``It's nice to have some artificial intelligence 
there to narrow things down a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet has exploded to more than 320 million Web pages and  
even the best search engines can cover no more than a third of 
them. Providing an answer to the frustration could prove lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's easily accessible ... they'll make big bucks,'' said  
Hongjun Li, a Dallas-based technology analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sites like this are slowly improving, mainly through better  
indexing,'' Li said. ``They're trying to provide meaningful content 
in an easy way. And we haven't seen much of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other search engines, Goto.com and AltaVista.com, offer  
another route: inviting Web sites to purchase the top spots in 
their list of search results. Under that design, a florist wishing 
to top competitors on the search results for the word ``flower'' 
would pay more to move to the head of the list. 
</P>
<P>
	But Li said such practices could exclude other relevant Web  
sites that refused to pay, keeping information from users.

<HEADLINE> Problems Found in Police Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some police departments have used the Clinton  
administration's COPS grants to replace local funds rather than to 
hire new officers, according to an initial report Thursday by the 
Justice Department inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial report covered 149 audits completed through last  
September. Inspector General Michael Bromwich conceded the sample 
``may well not be representative of the overall universe'' for 
police agencies that received federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 11,300 police agencies have received grants from the  
program designed to put 100,000 more local police on the street by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich said 103 of the locations audited were referred to the  
inspector general by COPS program officials who suspected problems 
in those locations. Of the 46 sites chosen by his staff, Bromwich 
said, ``Our selections were not entirely random. Some ... were ... 
targeted at suspected problem grantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said, ``I think it's important that  
we pursue any allegation of ineffective or inappropriate use of 
monies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most fundamental flaws were found among 60 grant recipients.  
Indications showed they used ``federal funds to supplant local 
funding instead of using grant funds to supplement local funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When grantees use grant funds to replace local funds rather  
than to hire new officers, additional officers are not added to the 
nation's streets,'' the report said. ``Instead, federal funds are 
used to pay for existing officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said this group of departments included 27 budgeting  
for decreases in local positions after receiving COPS grants; seven 
using COPS funds to pay for local officers already on board; 22 not 
promptly filling vacancies; and 35 not meeting requirement to 
provide matching funds. Some of the 60 agencies were found with 
more than one of these flaws. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 83 police agencies either did not develop a good faith plan  
to retain the federally funded officers after the three-year 
federal funding ends or said they would not retain the officers at 
that time. The report said this could make the COPS program ``a 
short-lived phenomenon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 52 of 67 police agencies that got special grants to  
redeploy existing officers either could not demonstrate that they 
did so or that they could track whether the officers were 
redeployed into community policing as the program envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 33 police agencies either had weaknesses in their community  
policing program or could not adequately distinguish COPS 
activities from what they were doing before the grant. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said, ``This report is  
not based on a representative sample of cities. It was based in 
large part on cities that the COPS office believed to have problems 
in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already begun implementing the corrective measures  
proposed and we feel the program continues to be just one more 
reason why crime continues to fall across the country,'' Marlin 
added.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Cowboys Lett Fails Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Star defensive tackle Leon Lett faces a possible  
lifetime suspension from the NFL after failing a drug test for the 
third time, according to published reports on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But an unidentified Cowboys official and a team player told The  
New York Times that NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is reviewing an 
appeal filed by Lett. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-year veteran, who was suspended for parts of the  
1995-1997 seasons because of failed drug tests, might be 
challenging validity of the test collection and processing 
arrangements, which he also did before imposition of his second 
ban, according to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Lett faces a ban of at least one year under  
the NFL's drug policies. It was unclear which drug was detected by 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought Leon was straightening out his life,'' the Cowboys  
official who declined to be identified told The Times, adding that 
his emotions concerning Lett ranged from ``sadness to anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrible news,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lett's Dallas area telephone number is unpublished and he could  
not be reached early Friday by The Associated Press for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, coach Chan Gailey and Lett's agents  
told The Dallas Morning News they were either unaware of or could 
not comment about the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard anything about it, and I would have heard  
about it unless it was moving so quickly,'' agent Jim Steiner told 
the newspaper Thursday. ``I'm going to have to get a copy of the 
report and go to work on this tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, who has been in the NFL substance abuse program since  
1995, was suspended by the league for four games during the 1995 
season, then missed the last three games of the 1996 season and the 
first 13 games of 1997 because of failed drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Claiborne, Lett's other agent, said he spoke to the  
defensive lineman Monday and would be shocked if the Pro Bowler 
failed another drug test under the NFL program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire program is based on confidentiality,'' Cowboys  
owner Jerry Jones told The News. ``We're not in a position to make 
any comment nor would we want to. No one from The New York Times 
has called and asked me or anyone in the organization questions 
about this.''

<HEADLINE> Bogus Internet Report Nets Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A technology company employee was arrested  
Thursday on charges he fabricated an Internet news report that 
drove up the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax involving telecommunications manufacturer  
PairGain Technologies is believed to be the first stock 
manipulation scheme using a fraudulent Internet site, U.S. Attorney 
Alejandro N. Mayorkas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dale Hoke, 25, a low-level PairGain engineer, was arrested  
at his Raleigh, N.C., home after an FBI trace of Internet addresses 
led to him, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed and upset that the trail seemed to lead to  
one of our employees,'' said Charles McBrayer, PairGain's senior 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke was arraigned on securities fraud charges and released on  
$50,000 bail. The crime is punishable by up to 10 years in federal 
prison and a $1 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke is an engineer at PairGain's Raleigh facility.  
</P>
<P>
	Sam Currin, Hoke's attorney, said he will be discussing the case  
with the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles to set a time for 
Hoke to travel to California and enter a plea, The News &AMP; Observer 
of Raleigh reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Hoke did not return phone calls and no one  
answered the door at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The hoax included a phony story about a corporate takeover made  
up to look like it was posted on a Bloomberg News Service Web site. 
It caused a 31 percent increase in the stock value of PairGain, a 
Tustin, Calif., maker of telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock dropped after the report was debunked later  
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Hoke also allegedly posted a bogus e-mail  
message about PairGain under the subject line ``Buyout News'' on a 
financial news message board operated by Yahoo Inc. The message 
contained a link to the bogus Bloomberg site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke has a history of online securities trading and had owned  
stock in the company as recently as January, according to a federal 
affidavit filed Thursday. But the complaint does not allege Hoke 
was holding PairGain stock during the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain executives were not involved in the scheme and are  
cooperating with investigators, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher 
Painter said.

<HEADLINE> Plane Passengers Cause Disturbance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Passengers demanding to know why an  
Eastwind Airlines flight had again been delayed were so irate that 
police at Piedmont Triad International Airport called in sheriff's 
deputies for backup. 
</P>
<P>
	About 120 passengers on a long-delayed flight from Boston to  
Orlando, Fla., started screaming and chanting ``we want answers'' 
after they got off the plane following a scheduled stop in 
Greensboro on Thursday, onlookers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People got off the plane and started yelling at the  
stewardesses,'' said Bill Gagne, a traveler waiting for another 
delayed flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Although deputies were called, there were no arrests.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane had originally been scheduled to leave Boston about 6  
a.m. Thursday, but it was delayed until the afternoon. One of the 
company's five planes was down for repairs, delaying all of the 
company's flights, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6:30 p.m., it finally arrived in Greensboro for a change of  
crew and short safety check, said Matt Johnson, an Eastwind station 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But crew members scheduled to fly on to Orlando had by then  
finished their shifts and needed to be replaced. As a result, the 
flight didn't leave for Orlando until about 8 p.m., Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the stewardess getting off didn't know where they were  
going,'' said Heidi VanAmburgh. ``All day long, nobody explained 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind, a discount airline based in Greensboro, has been  
plagued in recent weeks by flight delays, cancellations and 
reroutings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the airline called airport security after  
passengers destined for Trenton, N.J., refused to get off a plane 
for fear they would be stranded in Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration has stepped up safety  
inspections of Eastwind in light of the recent problems. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen in Atlanta said the FAA often  
increases inspections on airlines when they are experiencing 
unusual circumstances, such as financial trouble or labor problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not uncommon for us to increase surveillance when we  
believe it's necessary,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Rally; Dow Up 23.03 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rallied in late trading today  
as investors began to hunt for bargains among the industrial shares 
they had sold earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 23.03 at 10,485.75 after reaching four straight closing highs 
this week. The Dow rose 51 points Thursday to close at 10,462.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The S&AMP;P 500 was down 3.17  
at 1,319.69. The Nasdaq composite was down 12.17 at 2,509.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks surged higher most of the week, as investors  
shed technology and consumer stocks and picked up cheaper 
industrial names. The Dow industrials had climbed 288 points over 
the last four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stemming the Dow's loss today was a sharp gain in Eastman Kodak,  
which shot up 7 to 73 9/16 after the photography company reported 
better-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow components that came under intense selling pressure today  
included American Express, which fell 4 5/16 to 129 3/8, and IBM, 
which was off 4 1/2 at 173 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which have dropped sharply this week, faced  
another day of weakness. Leading the decline was Sun Microsystems, 
which topped analysts' earnings expectations but which was cautious 
about its future growth. Sun was down 4 3/8 at 56 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market needs to take a rest. We've had a big move this  
week in a short period of time,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The name of the game in this market 
is still volatility and vulnerability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the volatility today was the expiration of June  
stock-index options and future positions, known as ``double 
witching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues widened their lead on decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, leading by a 2 to 1 margin. Volume was heavy at 
688.66 million shares but down from Thursday's very heavy pace.

<HEADLINE> Factors That Pushed Up Gas Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans grousing about paying more at the pump  
may blame the whims of their local gas station owner, or the recent 
megamergers in the oil industry. But experts say the rise in gas 
prices was fueled by different factors: 

</P>
<P>
                        	 *Production cuts    	
</P>
<P>
	Last month, after a glut of crude oil supply had pushed prices  
to 12-year lows, OPEC voted to cut crude oil production by 2.1 
million barrels and maintain the reductions for a year. If the 
decision sticks, it would decrease the supply of oil on world 
markets by about 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier agreements have fallen apart amid political wrangling  
and allegations of cheating, but the current agreement appears to 
be holding. The price of a barrel of crude is now $16.75 on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, up from $10.72 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever the price of crude oil changes, it affects the price  
to dealer immediately,'' said Roy Littlefield, executive director 
of the Service Station Dealers of America. Gas station operators 
may absorb small increases to stay competitive, but must eventually 
increase the price, he said. 

</P>
<P>
                       	 *Refinery shutdowns    	
</P>
<P>
	California is paying a steeper price than the rest of the nation  
because of woes at several oil refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 23, an explosion at a Tosco Corp. refinery in Martinez,  
Calif., killed four people and caused production to halt. A month 
later, a fire at a Chevron plant in Richmond, Calif., prompted 
steep production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three other California refineries have operated at less  
than 100 percent capacity this spring, cutting out 250,000 to 
300,000 gallons a day from the state's normal daily supply of 2 
million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental laws in California that require gas to be  
specially formulated make it tough to respond quickly to changes in 
supply, analysts said. 

</P>
<P>
                          	 *Heavy demand    	
</P>
<P>
	Prices inevitably fall during the winter, when fewer Americans  
drive long distances. They often rise in the summer. The peak 
driving season runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day, but travel for 
the Easter and Passover holidays provided an early surge in demand 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Finds Time for Fund-Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- President Clinton was returning to the  
fund-raising circuit today even as he tried to maintain public 
focus on the U.S. military's engagement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Between a fund-raising luncheon in Dearborn, Mich., and a dinner  
in suburban Boston, Clinton planned to meet with support personnel 
at military bases and with Detroit-area residents involved in 
humanitarian relief efforts for the Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton canceled a fund-raising swing through western states at  
the outset of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes 
into their fourth week administration officials were determined to 
show they were also tending to normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Democrats hoped to raise more than $1 million  
from the two events. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that any president does, whether it's a  
Democrat or a Republican,'' said White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart, ``is, as a leader of the party, participate in party 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As thousands of men, women and children continue to stream  
across Kosovo's borders into Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro, 
concern continues to grow about the plight of refugees trapped 
within the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said on Thursday that there was no easy way to aid the  
internal refugees because the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic stood ready to shoot down relief planes or seize 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	But National Security Adviser Sandy Berger suggested efforts  
were under way to provide relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is working very hard on a number of avenues to get relief  
supplies to these people,'' he said. ``I don't think it would serve 
any purpose to describe them here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and two officials he tasked with coordinating the U.S.  
response to the humanitarian crisis -- USAID chief Brian Atwood and 
James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
-- were briefing community leaders involved in the relief effort 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the United States has supplied nearly $150 million in  
humanitarian relief to aid the hundreds of thousands of Kosovar 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Air National Guard personnel at Selfridge  
Field, Clinton was flying to Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, 
Mass., for another meeting with base personnel before dinner at the 
home of former Democratic National Committee finance chief Alan 
Solomont. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers at Hanscom play a key role in the development of  
avionics equipment that guides the B1 bomber and other tactical 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton told a meeting of the nation's newspaper  
editors that a post World War II-style reconstruction plan will be 
needed in the Balkans once the current conflict there is over. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned that the region ``will never be safe with a  
belligerent tyranny in their midst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the annual convention of the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors, Clinton vowed anew that NATO will prevail and 
reverse Milosevic's forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Support of Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Confronted by a protest against the  
bombing in Yugoslavia, President Clinton said Friday that Americans 
would feel even greater apprehension about the bombing campaign in 
Kosovo if ``we couldn't lift a finger'' to counter Serb atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 Serbian-American demonstrators, blowing whistles and  
chanting, stood in the rain with signs demanding a halt to the 
bombing. ``Serbia today, who next,'' one sign read as Clinton's 
motorcade rolled by. ``America wake up, stop bombing,'' said 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Fairlane Club, at a $500,000 Democratic fund-raising  
event, Clinton asked the audience to remember the ``few thousand 
people killed and a million-plus refugees'' driven from Kosovo by 
the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how many apprehensions you have ... how would you  
feel'' if asked to explain ``why we couldn't lift a finger to do 
anything about it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Americans to stand united.  
</P>
<P>
	``Because in the end, the political leadership of the country  
cannot go where the people will not travel,'' he said. ``That's 
what a democracy is. So it matters what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke in the Detroit area before flying to Boston  
for another political fund-raising event, that one expected to 
produce $800,000. The $1.3 million raised during the day will go 
toward helping Democrats regain control of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit area has about 40,000 Albanian-Americans along with  
a large community of Serbian-Americans. Both turned out for 
Clinton's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred or so demonstrators supporting NATO's airstrikes gave  
Clinton a friendly greeting in the community of Roseville as he 
arrived to address residents involved in humanitarian relief 
efforts for the Kosovo refugees. A banner bore the legend of the 
``Kosovo Liberation Army'' and said, ``Thank you Mr. Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president met privately with Albanian-Americans who told of  
relatives forced from their homes in Kosovo. Some of them asked 
Clinton to let refugees come to Michigan for temporary housing, 
officials said. Clinton made no commitment and said the United 
States would explore options. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has agreed to accept 20,000 refugees but that  
plan is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also met with military reservists heading to France to  
support the NATO operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking note of the Dearborn demonstration against the bombing,  
Clinton said, ``That was good because that was the American way. 
That is not Mr. Milosevic's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Roseville Recreation Center, Clinton said, ``I know many  
people here have very strong feelings about the conflict in Kosovo. 
... Many of you have loved ones in Kosovo -- relatives, friends 
kicked out of their homes under pain of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he urged that Americans ``not develop some negative feeling  
or bias against Serbian-Americans or even the Serbian people 
themselves, because most of them don't even know what has been done 
in their name in Kosovo because the state-run media has covered it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Serbian-Americans ``overwhelmingly ... want a democratic  
Serbia that is a part of Europe, not apart from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quarrel'' is with a Serbian leadership that ``believes it  
is all right to kill people and to uproot them and to destroy their 
family records and to erase any record of their presence in a land 
simply because of their ethnic heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit marked a return to the campaign trail. He  
canceled a fund-raising swing through Western states at the outset 
of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes into their 
fourth week, administration officials said Clinton was returning to 
normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	The president cast the day's fund raising as a key part of  
participatory democracy. ``I'm here because I care about my 
country's future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving later in the day at Hancom Air Force Base in  
Massachusetts, Clinton was received warmly by a crowd of about 
1,000 people, including military personnel, in an airport hangar, 
which was draped with state and service flags. He said he hoped 
they understood the NATO mission, which is aimed at stopping ethnic 
cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is doing its best to guarantee that for  
ourselves, and for our friends, and for friends of freedom all 
around the world,'' he told them. ``And you make it possible.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Bank Bailout Scrutinized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The new optimism over Brazil's  
rebounding economy has been suddenly muted by a deepening scandal 
involving charges of corruption and insider trading at the Central 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve, is  
the target of a Senate inquiry into its unorthodox defense of 
commercial banks during the January devaluation of Brazil's 
currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central Bank is always more on the side of bankers than of  
the people,'' Sen. Pedro Simon said. The new Central Bank 
president, Arminio Fraga, said the bank broke no rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank came under fire this week after Veja, Brazil's  
biggest weekly news magazine, ran a story on banker Salvatore 
Cacciola. His bank, Banco Marka, was the only financial institution 
to go under during the devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Veja quoted Cacciola as saying he and three other bankers paid  
$125,000 a month to a highly placed source in the Central Bank for 
insider information. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Marka was caught short when the real suddenly plunged on  
Jan. 13. The bank had sold dollars on the futures market, betting 
the real would remain steady, and was unable to cover its debts 
when the currency was devalued. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Veja, that's when the Central Bank stepped in. In a  
surprising move, it sold Marka 30 million reals, then worth about 
$20 million, at below-market prices. Another bank, Banco 
FonteCindam, also benefited. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day, Cacciola transferred $13 million overseas. In  
published interviews, he said the money was to pay debts on the 
Chicago futures market. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode raised howls of protests from Marka's Brazilian  
investors and questions about whether the entire operation was 
ethical or even legal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, police searched for documents at the homes of  
Cacciola and former Central Bank President Francisco Lopes, who 
authorized the bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are studying the possibility of legally repatriating this  
money,'' Justice Minister Renan Calheiros said. He added that 
federal police expect Cacciola, now in Italy, to return to testify 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga, the current Central Bank president, told senators that  
the aid for Marka was to avert panic. He said the funds were just 
enough to allow the bank to sink without a splash. 
</P>
<P>
	But senators questioned the lax rules that allowed the bailout  
in the first place. Some also asked how Marka, a small bank, could 
hold dollar contracts worth more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``What scares me is knowing that, if these operations were  
legal, they could happen again,'' said Sen. Eduardo Siqueira 
Campos.

<HEADLINE> Couple Arrested for Shut-In Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A couple kept their four children shut in at  
home for years, rarely allowing them outside and never sending them 
to school, authorities said. Three of them can speak only in a 
guttural, primitive-sounding form of English. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's department investigators took them from their parents'  
custody after the oldest child, a 17-year-old boy, mailed a note to 
an aunt in what appeared to be a plea for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents, Edward and Lucinda Sizemore, were arrested  
Wednesday. They pleaded innocent Thursday in Vandalia Municipal 
Court to four counts each of nonsupport of a dependent. They were 
ordered held on $10,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Another aunt, Della Lewis, has been caring for the children  
since they were removed from the home Jan. 29. The others are a 
4-year-old boy, an 8-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got these kids, all I did was cry,'' said Lewis,  
a sister of Ms. Sizemore. ``These children didn't know how to take 
a shower when they first got here. They never saw the light of 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children and Ms. Lewis said they were banned from leaving  
their suburban Harrison Township home for years. Neighbors said 
they saw the children outside only a few times. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving the note from the 17-year-old, the aunt  
contacted her sister, Ms. Lewis, who went to the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewis, who had not seen her sister Ms. Sizemore in 10 years,  
said she saw the children peering through curtains but no one would 
answer the door. At that point, Ms. Lewis contacted the sheriff's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way the detectives could communicate with the  
kids,'' Sgt. Charles Turner of the sheriff's office. ``They had 
their own language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest has had no formal schooling since elementary school,  
but speaks and can write in English. The rest of the children 
communicate with one another in a guttural English, but could 
understand what the detectives were saying, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said the Sizemores moved into the rental house four or  
five years ago. They almost never saw Ms. Sizemore or the three 
youngest children outdoors, although they would sometimes see the 
husband and the eldest boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Mary Murphy said she saw two of the three small  
children in the back yard of their home only once. When the 
children saw her, she said, they scampered back into the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor said the children were outside briefly on  
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	The family came under investigation in 1996 but avoided action  
by returning temporarily to their native Kentucky, authorities 
said. The family later returned to the Dayton home.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Drug, Alcohol Use Said Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Illicit use of drugs and alcohol has reached  
crisis proportions in the nation's capital and must be dealt with 
quickly, Mayor Anthony Williams said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act now,'' Williams said. ``Left on autopilot ...,  
this is not a pretty picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drug and alcohol abuse costs the District of Columbia about $1.2  
billion a year and accounts for most of the district's crime 
problems, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a new report by Drug Strategies, a nonprofit research  
institute headquartered in the district, that said the district's 
annual per capita spending on the problem amounts to $42.50 on drug 
prevention and treatment and $1,257 on criminal justice. The report 
recommends the city spend a greater proportion of its drug-related 
funding on prevention and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he was willing to consider it but gave no  
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, addicted prisoners are regularly  
released from the district's jails and halfway houses without 
getting necessary treatment. ``We know we're not getting ahead of 
the problem,'' Assistant Police Chief Terrence Gainer said. ``Just 
locking people up is simply not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report found adult cocaine and heroin use rates in the  
district were twice the national average in 1993, the latest 
figures available. 
</P>
<P>
	Current studies cited by the report show heavy drinking is 50  
percent more prevalent among adults in the capital than among their 
peers nationwide, and alcohol-related deaths in the district are 
double the national rate.

	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Brazil may return to international  
financial markets sooner than expected with a bond issue of up to 
$5 billion, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Brazil's recovery from last year's financial crisis  
continues, ``it could happen that what we have planned for the 
second half of the year could happen in the first half,'' Cardoso 
told a press conference, referring to the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso, who was winding up a two-day visit to Germany to meet  
government and business leaders, said his country is in contact 
with U.S. finance authorities about a possible bond issue.

<HEADLINE> Braves Trade Wohlers to Cincinnati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Unable to find the strike zone in Atlanta, Mark  
Wohlers wanted a fresh start with a new team. He got his wish 
Friday when the Braves traded their former closer and at least $4.4 
million to the Cincinnati Reds for reliever John Hudek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of getting comfortable again,'' Wohlers  
said. ``I think a fresh start is something that will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers saved 97 games from 1995-97 and was on the mound for one  
of the most memorable moments in Atlanta history, getting the final 
three outs of the '95 World Series to give the Braves their only 
championship during a run of seven straight playoff appearances 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 29-year-old right-hander, who throws nearly 100 mph, had  
a baffling lapse in control last season and wound up in the minor 
leagues. He reclaimed a spot on the team in spring training, but 
walked six in his first two appearances and was assigned outright 
to Triple-A Richmond last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers refused the assignment, leaving Atlanta with a week to  
either trade him or release him. After talking with five teams, 
general manager John Schuerholz worked out a deal with the Reds 
several hours ahead of the 2 p.m. EDT deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta will pay Cincinnati the difference between Wohlers' $5.2  
million salary this season and Hudek's $800,000, according to 
Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden. The Braves will give the 
Reds an additional $800,000 if Cincinnati doesn't exercise Wohlers' 
$5.5 million option for 2000 and opts to pay an $800,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deal will cut Atlanta's luxury tax payment next January  
by about $1.13 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``While circumstances surrounding Mark Wohlers placed us in a  
challenging and difficult circumstance, we feel this resolution is 
win-win,'' Schuerholz said. ``We acquire a proven major league 
relief pitcher and Wohlers gets a chance to restart his career with 
the Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers set a franchise record with 39 saves in 1996 and had 33  
the following season. In 1998, he pulled a muscle in his side, 
apparently tried to come back to soon and discovered he couldn't 
throw a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to Triple-A Richmond, but had no success there  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	After working out over the winter with special instructor Guy  
Hansen, Wohlers showed progress in spring training. But he walked 
four of the first seven batters he faced in the season opener, then 
had two walks and an error while facing three batters in his next 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves designated Wohlers for assignment the following day,  
hoping he would accept another minor-league assignment. Wohlers 
refused, deciding he would be better off with a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough,'' said Wohlers, who started with the Braves  
organization in 1988. ``It's been a lot of sleepless nights, 
tossing and turning, wondering what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``If not being able to throw a strike is the  
worst thing that happens to me, that's not so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers went back to Richmond twice last season, posting an ERA  
of 20.43 with 36 walks in 12 1-3 innings. He saw no reason to 
return to the minor leagues again with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both times I went to Richmond last year, it got worse,'' he  
said. ``It just wasn't working. I didn't want to make the same 
mistakes a third time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wohlers won't be back in the major leagues just yet. After  
an initial stint on the 15-day disabled list, the Reds will assign 
him to Triple-A Indianapolis for a rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said there is no timetable for Wohlers to join the Reds,  
who will make available a battery of medical and psychiatric 
specialists in an effort to get the reliever back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're completely satisfied that physically he's fine,'' Bowden  
said. ``It's mental, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers will work with Reds pitching coach Don Gullett, who  
helped revive the careers of Pete Schourek and Pete Harnisch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have a dominant closer,'' Bowden said. ``We may have  
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek, scheduled to join the Braves in Colorado for their game  
Friday night, worked in a career-high 58 games last season, 
beginning with the New York Mets before being traded the Reds in 
July. Overall, he was 5-6 with a 3.09 ERA and 68 strikeouts in 64 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old has appeared in two games this year, going 0-1  
with a 27.00 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second deal between the Reds and Braves since the end  
of last season. In November, Atlanta traded pitcher Denny Neagle, 
outfielder Michael Tucker and a minor leaguer to Cincinnati for 
second baseman Bret Boone and pitcher Mike Remlinger.

<HEADLINE> 4,500 Protest NYC Police Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of people walked across the Brooklyn  
Bridge in the largest gathering yet against alleged police abuse 
targeting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was arrested in Thursday's protest, which began outside  
the Brooklyn federal courthouse and ended four hours later in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimated about 4,500 people attended. Marchers included  
former New York City mayor David Dinkins and entertainers Harry 
Belafonte, Ossie Davis and Dick Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of protesters exceeded those of the previous  
demonstrations in the wake of the February shooting of West African 
immigrant Amadou Diallo, and the alleged 1997 station house torture 
of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, who was unarmed, was hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired by  
four white officers as they searched for a rape suspect in the 
Bronx. The officers have been charged with second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other white officers are accused of beating Louima in a  
Brooklyn police station. Jury selection in the Louima incident 
continued at the Brooklyn courthouse where Thursday's protest 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the event, called for  
greater federal scrutiny of New York police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like we needed the federal government to intervene in the  
South to protect all citizens, we need the federal government to 
intervene in policing in New York,'' Sharpton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iris Baez, the mother of Anthony Baez, who was choked to death  
during a 1994 altercation with police in the Bronx, said police 
officers have forgotten they are public servants. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more hiding behind the blue wall because the blue wall is  
cracking and it's coming down,'' she shouted.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Cost At Least $1.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House paid its top two impeachment  
investigators up to $20,000 a month during the investigation of 
President Clinton, far exceeding the pay scale of lawmakers and 
lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, expense records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay of chief Republican investigator David Schippers and his  
Democratic counterpart, Abbe Lowell, were part of an impeachment 
price tag that exceeded $1.2 million in the five-month 
congressional proceeding that ended with Clinton's acquittal in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The two investigators also were given special consultant status  
that allowed them to bypass congressional restrictions on outside 
income and avoid a ban on private legal work. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Judiciary Committee records, the panel paid for a  
portion of its investigation with $1.2 million from a special fund, 
which covered compensation for investigators, equipment, travel, 
communications, printing and other expenses solely related to 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual cost to taxpayers was much higher, but can't be  
readily calculated because much of the staff work -- in the House, 
Senate and White House -- was performed by permanent, salaried 
employees who would be paid regardless of their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers, whose private practice is in Chicago, was paid at the  
rate of $20,000 a month during the height of the investigation, 
according to House Judiciary Committee records. Lowell, a 
Washington lawyer, was paid at a monthly rate of $18,000, according 
to expense records reviewed by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted to annual salary, both men were being paid at a rate of  
more than $200,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, staff lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
earn between $66,563 and $118,400 annually. The independent 
counsel's deputies must also sever ties with their private law 
firms -- a prohibition that does not apply to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and senators earn $136,700 a year.  
</P>
<P>
	The Judiciary Committee granted the requests of Schippers and  
Lowell -- as well as several investigators under them -- to work as 
consultants rather than full-time congressional employees. The 
special status allowed them to avoid House rules that prohibit 
lawmakers and senior employees from performing ``professional 
services involving a fiduciary relationship, including law, real 
state or insurance sales, or medicine.'' These officials also are 
limited to $20,505 in non-congressional earned income. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers said he and his firm were losing money -- ``$40,000 in  
the hole'' at one point -- because he was paying his own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My business was going to hell in a handbasket,'' he said in an  
interview. ``I was begging for (consultant status) because I was 
really getting into financial difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was offered a straight salary of about $130,000 a  
year to handle the inquiry but declined because ``I would have had 
to take my name off the door'' of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell was out of town this week and not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment inquiry began Sept. 9 when Starr delivered a  
report to the House. In December, the House impeached Clinton on 
two articles alleging perjury and obstruction of justice, and on 
Feb. 12 the Senate acquitted the president on both charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers and Lowell led the House Judiciary Committee  
investigation of Clinton's alleged offenses, and Schippers then 
assisted the 13 House GOP lawmakers named to prosecute the 
president at the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	While Democrats have attacked the entire inquiry as an  
unnecessary expense, committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said 
that both Schippers and Lowell were worth the money because of 
``their work and sacrifices'' in a town where top private lawyers 
frequently earn upwards of $400 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the overall cost, Hyde said: ``I think that vindicating  
the Constitution is always worth it. I don't think there were any 
extravagances at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment-related expenses ranged from communications  
equipment to numerous trips by investigators. Most of the travel 
destinations were unspecified in the expense records. 
</P>
<P>
	A Xerox copier cost $14,440, a laser printer was $2,863, a  
shredder cost $2,399 and a television was $4,354.

<HEADLINE> FCC Tries Opening Phone Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators took a second stab at  
prying open the $110 billion local phone market to competition 
Friday after a piece of its market-opening rules was scuttled by 
the Supreme Court in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, as expected, made  
recommendations about steps that major local phone companies, such 
as the Baby Bells and GTE, might take to open their local networks 
to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the FCC suggested that these companies continue to  
lease certain parts of their networks to rivals that would use them 
to offer competing local phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	One piece consists of the wires that run from local phone  
company offices to homes and businesses. It's the most crucial 
network element because of the big expense to duplicate them. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pieces include computer systems that rivals would use to  
sign up, bill and service customers; operator services; directory 
assistance; and certain services such as caller ID, call forwarding 
and call waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the same pieces major phone companies have been  
required to lease to rivals for the last few years. The Bells and 
GTE have pledged to continue doing so until the FCC resolves the 
matter after the high court cast uncertainty over the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Supreme Court supported virtually all the FCC's  
efforts to open the local phone market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But it vacated a FCC rule that forced local phone companies to  
give their rivals blanket access to any piece of the local network 
they want. The court said the FCC didn't adequately consider 
whether rivals could obtain these pieces elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will seek public and industry comments on whether any  
additional network elements should be made available to 
competitors, including equipment for offering high-speed Internet 
and other data services. The commission will also seek comments on 
the standards for making these elements available on a nationwide 
basis and whether and when these elements should not be made 
available to rivals.

<HEADLINE> Is Rodman a Hollywood Has-Been? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is Dennis Rodman a Hollywood has-been?  
</P>
<P>
	Since he came to town 23 basketball games ago, he's rallied  
crowds to a frenzy, split with Carmen Electra, dyed his hair twice, 
got a side job as a burger pitchman and put sports writers on 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at practice Thursday, he said he lost his shoes and socks.  
Coach Kurt Rambis sent him home, and the Los Angeles Lakers later 
cut him from the team. How will the rebounder rebound? 
</P>
<P>
	He already has one offer in Los Angeles -- a liaison to rap  
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Hills-based Death Row Records, the label for such  
rappers as the late Tupac Shakur, has offered him a job in their 
artist relations department, spokeswoman Trece Tiburcio said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to have Dennis be a part of our company,'' she  
told The AP. ``We have had contact with his agency. Our artists 
seem to relate to Dennis. It would be a perfect match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if that falls through?  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe wrestling,'' laughed Willie Blair as he swept a sidewalk  
Friday at a downtown YMCA. ``I mean, I love Rodman, but he just 
seemed like he was bored. Maybe he won too many championships. He 
has just done it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling, though, may not want him.  
</P>
<P>
	The Worm has already battled foes in the ring such as Karl  
Malone and Hulk Hogan. But last year, he sued World Championship 
Wrestling, saying he was owed millions of dollars from his matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrie Spillane, a Los Angeles talent agent who specializes in  
turning shame into fame, said disgrace seems to benefit Rodman. The 
Lakers or no, the eccentric Rodman has built up enough capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hardly out of a spotlight. He'll get another job,'' said  
Spillane, who has represented clients such as Joey Buttafuoco, 
Tanya Harding and John Wayne Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television movies would pick Rodman up in an instant,'' she  
said. ``He could have a job with them this afternoon. The problem 
is, will he show up?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One place he won't show is in advertisements for the Carl's Jr.  
fast-food chain. It had twice benched the player's commercial for 
their Super Star hamburger, citing his bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants began re-broadcasting the 2-year-old commercials  
only two weeks ago, saying Rodman's ``local player'' status in Los 
Angeles had once again made him marketable. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, officials from the chain's parent company,  
Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants Inc., said no more commercials would 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he is no longer a Laker, we don't have the desire to  
use the commercial again,'' spokeswoman Suzi Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has so far not speculated on his plans. But he has said  
the Lakers made him a scapegoat for the team's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his supporters agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Wanda Vazquez, a Lakers fan visiting from Boston, said anybody  
who wants to work with Rodman should tolerate his quirks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People like him. They like his hair, they like watching him,''  
she said in the lobby of the Bonaventure Hotel. ``He brought life 
to the team and he fits in well, if you let him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone will miss Rodman, it will likely be headline writers  
who marked his firing with phrases like ``Late Worm Gets Hook,'' 
``Lakers De-Wormed'' and ``Lakers, Rodman divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around Chicago, where he won three championship rings with the  
Bulls, the headline in the Daily Southtown of suburban Tinley Park 
read ``Lakers to Rodman: No shoes, no socks, no practice -- and no 
more patience.''

<HEADLINE> Auto Workers Occupy Ontario Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRATFORD, Ontario (AP) -- Workers occupying an auto-parts plant  
vowed to stand their ground after the owners tried and failed 
Thursday to get an injunction to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 employees of Canadian Fabricated Products Ltd. took over  
the plant in the early hours Thursday in a dramatic effort to win 
back more than 50 jobs they say are going to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers, mostly women, barred themselves in the plant and  
asked security guards to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're staying until we have our jobs back,'' said Susan  
Danner, president of Canadian Auto Workers Local 1325, who was 
among those occupying the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't stand by and watch our work go to Mexico. All our  
members are outside cheering us on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 workers couldn't get in when they showed up for work  
in the morning and the afternoon shift was canceled. Police have 
said they will stand by as long as there is no violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Johnson Controls said management was taken aback  
by the workers' actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not moving the plant to Mexico,'' said Dave Roznowski.  
``Some small portions of the business were going to be done at a 
plant in Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Canadian Fabricated was bought by Milwaukee-based Johnson  
Controls Corp. in 1994, the work force at the Stratford plant has 
declined from a high of about 1,200 down to 500, said Danner. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant manufactures interior trim for cars made at Chrysler  
Canada's plant in Bramalea, west of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the workers -- mainly women aged 40 to 45 who have worked  
at the plant for nearly 20 years -- earn an average wage of $18 an 
hour for cutting and sewing. 
</P>
<P>
	The union says the company has violated a three-year contract  
signed in January. Workers believed the agreement, which encourages 
early retirement, affords greater job security for young workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, however, the company notified 57 workers that they  
would be laid off permanently on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say the layoffs were a result of contract  
negotiations, natural attrition through retirement and volume 
reduction since fewer vehicles are being produced in Bramalea. 
</P>
<P>
	Danner said that after the 57 workers were laid off, employees  
were told that because 50 more were expected to retire, the 
Stratford plant would soon lack enough staff to continue performing 
all its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the occupation Thursday, company officials sought  
an injunction against the protesters but it was dismissed on a 
technicality. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the plant Thursday afternoon, workers appeared  
supportive of the occupation even though they were losing wages. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is long overdue,'' said Mark Trethouen. ``This company  
has decimated the work force here. It's either do or die for us.''

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Union Fined $45M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilots union will appeal a  
$45.5 million fine it received for not halting an illegal sickout 
that led to the cancellation of more than 6,700 flights earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Thursday fined the Allied Pilots Association  
-- which only has assets of $38 million -- for ignoring his order to 
tell pilots to return to their cockpits during a February job 
action. The money will go to the air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	American said it lost revenue of about $50 million during the  
10-day sickout which stranded hundreds of thousands of travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly disagree with the court's decision to transfer any  
of APA's funds to management, much less the huge fine announced 
today,'' said Rich LaVoy, president of the union on Thursday. ``As 
for our immediate next steps, APA will pursue all of its legal 
options to protect the union and its memberships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall had previously held the union  
and its top two officials -- LaVoy and union vice president Brian 
Mayhew -- in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy and Mayhew had placed $15,000 with the court as damages  
were assessed, along with the union's $10 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine how the fine  
will be divided among the three parties. He also ordered the union 
to place a second $10 million with the court. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines said it took no ``particular pleasure'' in the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're victims of this as are we,'' said airline spokeswoman  
Andrea Rader. ``We went to court to get the sickout to stop. We 
want to close this chapter and get on with labor peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rader said the airline had no comment on how American's  
parent company, AMR Corp., will use the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Although labor relations have been strained for some time  
between the pilots and management, resentment grew over the past 
few months over the way American was integrating its purchase of 
Reno Air, a small low-cost carrier purchased in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The union contends that the company has ignored the contract,  
paying pilots less than mandated by the regulations, so the sickout 
was a legal maneuver. About 2,500 pilots called in to take 
themselves off the flying list. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall expressed sympathy for the three-fourths of the American  
pilots who didn't call in sick, saying that imposing the fine makes 
``me sick to my stomach, because I know what's going to happen is 
some very fine men and women pilots are going to be hurt badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the union, however, for its tactics.  
</P>
<P>
	``The flying public in this instance had zero notice and that's  
why it wreaked such havoc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one union member said the ruling was justified. ``I  
think the judge was right,'' said Capt. Carmen Villani, who flies 
out of Washington D.C. ``I personally was very embarrassed over 
what I experienced in the courtroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union has said the abnormally high number of sick calls was  
a rational response to the stress the labor dispute created for 
individual pilots. The union noted that safety regulations require 
pilots to stay home if they consider themselves under too much 
stress to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all of the legal proceedings, American and the union  
have yet to resolve the assimilation issue involving the purchase 
of Reno Air. The two sides met last week with a federal mediator in 
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were going to go forward, this is not the way to resolve  
problems,'' said LaVoy after the hearing. ``This doesn't do 
anything to help the process.''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Sign QB Fiedler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Quarterback Jay Fiedler, a four-year  
NFL veteran who spent last season with the Minnesota Vikings, was 
signed Friday by the Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	Length and terms of the contract were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler joins quarterbacks Mark Brunell, Jonathan Quinn and Will  
Furrer on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler, 27, spent the 1994 and 1995 seasons with the  
Philadelphia Eagles after being signed as an undrafted free agent 
out of Dartmouth. He was inactive as the team's third quarterback 
for all 16 games both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the 1996 training camp with the Cincinnati Bengals. In  
1997, he played for the Amsterdam Admirals of the NFL Europe League 
and was out of football in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler spent the 1998 training camp with the Vikings. He was  
cut, then re-signed last Sept. 15, when Brad Johnson was injured. 
He saw his first NFL action, playing in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	In those games, he was 3-of-7 for 41 yards and had one  
interception. The Vikings withdrew a qualifying offer to Fiedler on 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Winning Over Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee won  
crucial new support Friday from 11 lawmakers, boosting prospects 
that his government will survive an attempt by the opposition to 
bring it down. 
</P>
<P>
	With a small swing party promising to abstain from Saturday's  
no-confidence vote in parliament, Vajpayee appeared able to eke out 
the majority needed to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister began scrambling for new supporters in  
parliament after a key ally withdrew from his fragile coalition 
earlier this week and vowed to topple his government in a personal 
dispute with Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Indian National Lok Dal, with four lawmakers,  
said it would back Vajpayee, as did the six deputies of a Tamil 
party known as the DMK and an independent lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bahujan Samaj Party, which both the government and the  
opposition had been aggressively wooing, gave him another boost by 
announcing its abstention. 
</P>
<P>
	The abstention would lower the bar he needs to reach to win a  
simple majority of voting members in the 543-seat legislature. If 
it comes short, the 13-month-old government would fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's aides were also trying to bring on board the three  
lawmakers of the Tamil Maanila Congress, which has so far not said 
how it will vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The main opposition Congress Party said Friday it will form a  
government if Vajpayee loses the vote. Its leader Sonia Gandhi, 
wife of slain Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has emerged as the 
candidate who would become prime minister if it comes to power. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bitter confidence debate continued in parliament for the  
second day, lawmakers shouted and got into shoving matches over the 
question of whether the Italian-born Gandhi would be suitable as 
India's leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Gandhi has held no elected office of power and became leader of  
the party on the enormous popularity of the Gandhi dynasty, which 
has given India three of its prime ministers in the last 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayaram Jayalalitha, head of the party that quit the government,  
met with Gandhi on Thursday and reportedly agreed to a new 
Congress-led government, with Gandhi as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opposition has its own difficulties in garnering enough  
support for an alternative coalition among the many small and 
fractious parties in India's parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	If no party can assemble a new coalition, India will go to the  
polls, four years ahead of schedule. Since 1991, India has held 
three general elections, and all three times no single party had a 
clear majority.

<HEADLINE> Rental Co. Advises Against Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Rental Service Corp.'s directors on  
Friday recommended that stockholders reject an unsolicited $553 
million offer for the company from United Rentals Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the offer from the largest equipment rental  
company in North America is inadequate and not in the best 
interests of Rental Service or its stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Greenwich, Conn.-based United responded by saying  
the company was proceeding with its offer to buy all of Rental 
Service's outstanding shock for $22.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would pursue the removal of Rental Service's  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rental Service's actions today confirm our view that the  
current Rental Service board is not acting in the best interests of 
Rental Service stockholders,'' said Bradley Jacobs, United chairman 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	If United Rentals' offer succeeds, the combined company would  
have annual revenue of about $3 billion, 700 branches and a rental 
fleet of more than 400,000 pieces of construction, industrial and 
landscaping equipment and tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottsdale-based Rental Service also said that it will file a  
counterclaim for violations of the federal securities laws against 
United Rentals and Jacobs in U.S. District Court in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The counterclaim alleges United Rentals misstated and concealed  
the fact that its offer is subject to a financing condition, and 
that there is ``no assurance'' that it will obtain financing. 
</P>
<P>
	United's offer, good through April 30, is conditioned on getting  
a majority of the shares and the termination of the pending merger 
between Rental Service and NationsRent of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rental Service in January announced a planned merger with  
NationsRent in which each NationsRent share would be exchanged for 
0.355 shares of Rental Service. Investors spurned the deal, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	United filed papers April 5 in the Delaware Chancery Court  
seeking an injunction to stop the merger. The papers said the 
lawsuit was a ``challenge to a proposed merger based on an alleged 
breach of fiduciary duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United Rentals operates in 470 locations in the United States  
and Canada, most of them in major metropolitan areas. Rental 
Service operates in about 245 locations, mostly in medium- and 
smaller-sized markets, making it the third-largest rental company 
in North America.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Cost At Least $1.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House paid its top two impeachment  
investigators up to $20,000 a month during the investigation of 
President Clinton, far exceeding the pay scale of lawmakers and 
lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, expense records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay of chief Republican investigator David Schippers and his  
Democratic counterpart, Abbe Lowell, were part of an impeachment 
price tag that exceeded $1.2 million in the five-month 
congressional proceeding that ended with Clinton's acquittal in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The two investigators also were given special consultant status  
that allowed them to bypass congressional restrictions on outside 
income and avoid a ban on private legal work. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Judiciary Committee records, the panel paid for a  
portion of its investigation with $1.2 million from a special fund, 
which covered compensation for investigators, equipment, travel, 
communications, printing and other expenses solely related to 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual cost to taxpayers was much higher, but can't be  
readily calculated because much of the staff work -- in the House, 
Senate and White House -- was performed by permanent, salaried 
employees who would be paid regardless of their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers, whose private practice is in Chicago, was paid at the  
rate of $20,000 a month during the height of the investigation, 
according to House Judiciary Committee records. Lowell, a 
Washington lawyer, was paid at a monthly rate of $18,000, according 
to expense records reviewed by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted to annual salary, both men were being paid at a rate of  
more than $200,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, staff lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
earn between $66,563 and $118,400 annually. The independent 
counsel's deputies must also sever ties with their private law 
firms -- a prohibition that does not apply to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and senators earn $136,700 a year.  
</P>
<P>
	The Judiciary Committee granted the requests of Schippers and  
Lowell -- as well as several investigators under them -- to work as 
consultants rather than full-time congressional employees. The 
special status allowed them to avoid House rules that prohibit 
lawmakers and senior employees from performing ``professional 
services involving a fiduciary relationship, including law, real 
state or insurance sales, or medicine.'' These officials also are 
limited to $20,505 in non-congressional earned income. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers said he and his firm were losing money -- ``$40,000 in  
the hole'' at one point -- because he was paying his own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My business was going to hell in a handbasket,'' he said in an  
interview. ``I was begging for (consultant status) because I was 
really getting into financial difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was offered a straight salary of about $130,000 a  
year to handle the inquiry but declined because ``I would have had 
to take my name off the door'' of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell was out of town this week and not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment inquiry began Sept. 9 when Starr delivered a  
report to the House. In December, the House impeached Clinton on 
two articles alleging perjury and obstruction of justice, and on 
Feb. 12 the Senate acquitted the president on both charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers and Lowell led the House Judiciary Committee  
investigation of Clinton's alleged offenses, and Schippers then 
assisted the 13 House GOP lawmakers named to prosecute the 
president at the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	While Democrats have attacked the entire inquiry as an  
unnecessary expense, committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said 
that both Schippers and Lowell were worth the money because of 
``their work and sacrifices'' in a town where top private lawyers 
frequently earn upwards of $400 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the overall cost, Hyde said: ``I think that vindicating  
the Constitution is always worth it. I don't think there were any 
extravagances at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment-related expenses ranged from communications  
equipment to numerous trips by investigators. Most of the travel 
destinations were unspecified in the expense records. 
</P>
<P>
	A Xerox copier cost $14,440, a laser printer was $2,863, a  
shredder cost $2,399 and a television was $4,354.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield: Punch Stats Deceiving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield says Lennox Lewis landing a  
lot more punches than he did was deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
	A punch tally of the fight for the undisputed heavyweight title  
bout March 13 that ended in a controversial draw credited Lewis 
with landing 364 of 613 punches to 130 of 385 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	A rematch is expected Nov. 6 or 13 at site to be determined.  
</P>
<P>
	``In pro boxing, it's not how many punches you throw, it's  
effective punches, punches that hurt,'' Holyfield said at a hearing 
before the New York State Senate Committee on Investigations, 
chaired by State Sen. Roy Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield called many of the punches Lewis landed ``taps.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said in a taped interview with Goodman that the punch  
statistics were proof of his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the most aggressive fighter,'' Holyfield said. ``Once  
the fight got to the eighth round you could see I was doing all the 
work. All the judges started giving me all the rounds. I was trying 
to make a fight and here's a guy who don't want to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Eugenia Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., who scored it  
115-113 for Holyfield, gave Holyfield four of the last five rounds. 
Stanley Christodoulou (116-113 Lewis) of South Africa called the 
last five rounds 3-1-1 for Holyfield. Larry O'Connell (115-115) of 
England also thought Holyfield won four of the last five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, the scoring was very bad,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was highly criticized for scoring the fifth round for  
Holyfield, when it was that round in which Lewis seemed to have him 
in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is clueless in knowing what her job is and what she should  
be scoring,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the scoring of O'Connell, Lewis, of Britain, said: ``I  
was quite amazed. It definitely showed me he wasn't watching my 
jab. My jab was doing the most damage. I think he overcompensated 
not to show favoritism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Goodman said his committee had turned over to a  
Manhattan grand jury evidence of potential criminality in the 
judging of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams admitted before the committee March 18 that she had  
recently filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned whether judges with financial problems ``could not  
be subject to temptation. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman previously said testimony indicated O'Connell was behind  
in his mortgage payments. However, on Friday he said that report 
was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. O'Connell called us from England yesterday and assured us  
this was not the case,'' Goodman said. ``I want this on the 
record.''

<HEADLINE> Altavista Give Advertisers Top Slot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a first among the major Internet search  
engines, AltaVista.com will begin offering advertisers the 
opportunity to have their Web sites listed at the top of search 
results, causing concern that a valuable tool to sift through the 
Web could be compromised by commercial pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The paid links will appear when an AltaVista user searches for  
information using any of about 500 initial keywords -- including 
``computer.'' The bracketed notices will be marked as paid for by 
advertisers, although it's unclear how prominent the disclosure 
will be. The program is expected to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The onus is on us to ensure the paid placements are  
relevant,'' said Rod Schrock, president and CEO of AltaVista.com. 
``But I believe we're making our search results page more 
relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Search engines are some of the most popular sites on the Web,  
and they are often the starting point for researching purchases 
such as a house, a car or a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, profit margins online are slim to nonexistent, and  
companies looking to justify soaring stock prices are inventing new 
revenue streams that some might say compromises objective 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivals such as Excite or Lycos use software to prowl the Web and  
gather keywords based on what appears in the Web pages. When a user 
searches for ``Maria Callas'' the opera singer, for example, the 
software returns the Web pages that it computes to most closely 
match a user's request, in the order of most closely matched. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista, by contrast, now might display merchants selling  
compact discs of Callas at the top of the list -- useful if a user 
wants to buy a CD, but not so useful for student writing a report. 
</P>
<P>
	Payment for search placement is not unheard of. Lesser-known  
GoTo.com, based in Pasadena, Calif., also offers a similar option, 
though AltaVista is the first major service to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of a search engine is to find information on a  
chaotic web,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert, a 
consumer advocacy group in Washington, D.C. ``If the top slots are 
for sale as opposed to what the information really is, people will 
go elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com felt that sting in February, when it admitted it had  
sold positive book recommendations with prominent placement to 
publishers. The company offered refunds and began marking paid 
recommendations as such when customers complained. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista is no doubt feeling similar pressure to deliver, as  
parent company Compaq Computer Corp. moves forward with plans to 
spin off the search engine in an initial public offering sometime 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new revenue ``will be not insignificant,'' said Schrock.  
``If executed well, it could be a good contributor of revenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DoubleClick Inc., which sells advertising for AltaVista,  
promoted the program in a recent e-mail message to potential 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When users perform keyword searches on AltaVista, what is the  
first listing they see?'' the message said. ``Now it can be your 
company's listing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For this to work, the search engine must ensure it matches paid  
keywords and links with relevant merchants, said Marissa Gluck, an 
analyst at Jupiter Communications, a research firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't be selling the word 'football' to Ford just  
because Ford is trying to target a certain demographic,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And consumers should be clearly informed that the listing is  
paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is done wisely, it could benefit the consumer,'' she  
said. ``But you have to let the consumer know that that is real 
estate that has been sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even that won't be enough for some.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of a greater theme of how commercialism destroys the  
integrity of everything it touches,'' said Ruskin. ``That's today's 
example. There will be another one tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall for Fourth Day / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term Treasury bond prices fell Friday,  
extending a retreat to a fourth straight day, as investors feared a 
boom in new housing might stir up inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/16  
point, or $6.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.57 percent from 5.52 percent 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have been selling Treasurys in recent days to make room  
for a growing supply of corporate issues offering higher yields. On 
Thursday, Conoco sold $4 billion in new bonds. Next week, another 
oil company Atlantic Richfield, is expected to sell $1 billion of 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds slid again Friday as the government said new homes were  
being built at a faster rate than expected. The Commerce Department 
reported that new homes and apartments were begun at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1.77 million units in March, slower than in 
February but still beyond economists' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in new home construction could mean the economy is  
heating up, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates to slow the growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds also fell as the dollar dropped against the yen for the  
fifth time in six sessions. A weaker dollar dampens overseas 
interest in U.S. securities because it cuts their returns when the 
proceeds are converted into home currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 3/32 point and 1/8 point. Intermediate maturities were 
down 7/32 point to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.32 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Thursday to 4.21 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.53 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 
percentage point to 4.37 percent. One-year yields were 4.68 percent 
as the discount rose 0.04 percentage point to 4.46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from Thursday's 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 11/32 from 124 17/32. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.23 percent from 5.21 percent 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Woman Won't Face Juvenile Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A judge has ruled that a 41-year-old woman  
who admitted she killed her mother when she was 14 cannot be tried 
as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Michael Degnan said Thursday that he would dismiss murder  
charges against Susan Watson once a hearing is held to determine if 
she has rehabilitated since the 1971 shooting. Attorneys on both 
sides said the hearing was a formality. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no purpose in prosecuting Miss Watson and  
clearly no need to rehabilitate,'' Degnan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was considered one of the first in the nation to raise  
the question of whether an adult could face trial in the juvenile 
system years after a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who lives in Schenectady, N.Y., burst into tears and  
hugged her husband, Michael Amos, after Degnan's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	She also hugged her brothers, David and George Johnson, who  
persuaded Newark police last year to reopen the case of their slain 
mother, Maylon Johnson. George Johnson did not return his sister's 
embrace and called Degnan's proceeding a ``charade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She should have been punished,'' George Johnson said. ``I  
suffered for 27 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Watson confessed that she took a gun from a drawer  
and shot her mother once in the chest in their Newark home. She 
told police that her mother had abused her and didn't believe her 
charges that other family members were sexually abusing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who said they would consider an appeal, had sought  
to try Watson as a juvenile on the theory that the passage of time 
should not exclude her from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere fact that she was undetected should not benefit  
her,'' prosecutor Keith Harvest told Degnan. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson's attorney, Walter Florczak, argued she already had  
fulfilled the purpose of the juvenile crime laws of 1971 -- 
rehabilitation. He said Watson has not broken the law since the 
killing, has a job, a family and a history of public service. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be an age at which the court no longer has the  
power to rehabilitate a juvenile,'' Florczak said. ``There's simply 
nothing the court can do for this individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The laws governing Watson's case have changed since 1971. Today,  
a juvenile convicted of murder could face 20 years in jail, while a 
juvenile convicted in 1971 could be held only until age 21. 
Prosecutors had not said what penalty Watson would have faced. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson told police in 1971 that she found her mother's body in  
bed, and said she saw the car of her mother's boyfriend speeding 
away. He was never charged, and the case remained unsolved until 
last fall.

<HEADLINE> Waste Regulator Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A former state regulator accused of  
extorting money from the owner of a radioactive waste dump has 
pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry F. Anderson, 62, who was Utah's director of radiation  
control from 1983 to 1993, entered the pleas Thursday in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of illegally obtaining $600,000 in cash, gold  
coins and real estate from Khosrow Semnani, owner of Envirocare of 
Utah, which operates a low-level radioactive waste landfill 65 
miles west of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Semnani claims he paid Anderson out of fear of economic and  
regulatory reprisals against Envirocare. Anderson has said the 
money was for legitimate consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
	Semnani, who agreed to testify against Anderson, pleaded guilty  
in July to aiding and abetting the filing of a false tax return and 
was fined $100,000.

<HEADLINE> Congress OKs Tax Break for Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has overwhelmingly approved tax  
relief for American military men and women involved in the war in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 424-0 and the Senate 95-0 on Thursday to send  
the measure to President Clinton, who has signaled support. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clinton's executive order this week, the bill exempts  
military hazardous duty pay from income taxes, gives personnel in 
the combat zone a 180-day extension to file their 1998 tax return 
and exempts them from the 3 percent excise tax on long-distance 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation goes slightly further than Clinton's order by  
extending the tax relief to support personnel whose duty is 
performed outside the United States and away from their permanent

<HEADLINE> Utah Chief Urges Tougher Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The city's police chief on Friday issued a  
call for a stricter state law to keep guns from those with severe 
mental illnesses in the wake of the city's second fatal shooting 
rampage this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happening too much all over the country, and innocent  
people are dying,'' chief Ruben Ortega said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega's comments came a day after Sergei Babarin, 71, raked the  
first floor of the Mormon Family History Library with .22-caliber 
handgun fire, killing two people and wounding four others before 
police shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The library shooting came just more than three months after  
24-year-old Di-Kieu Duy allegedly walked into a downtown office 
building with a grocery sack of bullets and opened fire. One person 
died and another suffered minor gunshot wounds in the Jan. 14 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives said Babarin and Duy had been diagnosed with paranoid  
schizophrenia, but had not been taking their medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega said both shootings illustrate why Utah should close what  
he calls a loophole in a state law. The law prohibits the sale of 
guns to those who have been declared mentally incompetent -- a high 
legal threshold that includes few of the state's 100,000 mentally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Babarin and Duy had brushes with the law, neither had  
been declared mentally incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega said psychiatrists should to be required to report to  
state authorities the names of people they diagnose with certain 
mental illnesses. Gun dealers would then be forbidden from selling 
guns to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega says police took a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun away  
from Babarin after he was arrested and charged with assault and 
carrying a concealed weapon in a 1995 fight at a downtown 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the same kind of gun Babarin used Thursday, although  
Ortega said investigators had not yet determined how it was 
acquired. He said investigators still do not know why Babarin chose 
the Mormon library for the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin's son, Alex, said he doesn't believe a stiffer gun law  
would have deterred his father from committing an act of violence. 
``He could just take a car and run people down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Babarin said the shooting could have been prevented.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he fought to get his father committed for nearly a year.  
And just two days before the shooting, his father accused him of 
spying and being out to get him -- the same charges he leveled 
against his wife, his neighbors, even people passing in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was not really present for the last six years,''  
Babarin said. ``He almost wasn't my father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his father's illness went untreated because he feared  
doctors and refused to take the medication prescribed to him, 
calling it poison.

<HEADLINE> Media Defends Featherweight Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Manuel Medina of Mexico successfully defended  
his International Boxing Federation featherweight championship 
Friday, taking a nine-round technical split decision over No. 1 
contender Victor Polo of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	An accidental head butt by Polo in the ninth round opened a deep  
gash under Medina's right eyebrow and forced the bout to be halted 
at the end of the round. A decision was rendered based on the 
judges' scoring through nine rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Medina was ahead 87-83 and 86-84 on two judges' cards while Polo  
led 86-84 on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	With the win, Medina is considered the favorite to meet popular  
World Boxing Organization featherweight champion Prince Naseem 
Hamed of Great Britain in a unification bout. But the cut, which 
required Medina to be hospitalized, may delay the proposed bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``My experience did it for me,'' said Medina, who weighed in at  
the 126 pound limit. ``I came on strong and won it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Medina, with a record of 56-10 and 25 knockouts,  
started slow and had to win the last six rounds on one judge's card 
and the final five on another judge's card to secure the split 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Polo, 28, a left hander, now has a record of 22-2-2 with 20  
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I walked out a champion,'' said Polo, who also weighed  
in at 126. ``I was very disappointed in the way the judges had 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Korean Air Loses Delta Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Korean Air, blistered in a safety report by  
two of its pilots, lost its flight partnership with Delta Air Lines 
on Friday, a day after the foreign carrier had another fatal plane 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, Delta had said it stood by its ``code-share''  
arrangement, despite the dissemination of an internal Korean Air 
report raising safety concerns at the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Under code-sharing, passengers traveling to Asia on a Delta  
ticket might make some legs of their trip on planes operated by 
Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta would not code-share with any carrier it did not believe  
to be safe,'' Delta spokesman Clay McConnell said Wednesday. He 
reaffirmed the statement after the crash Thursday of a Korean Air 
cargo jet in Shanghai, China. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Delta announced suspension of its partnership and  
said it would not book passengers on flights operated by Korean Air 
pending review of the airline's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta will begin immediately to contact Delta customers booked  
on KAL-operated flights to assist them in making alternative travel 
arrangements,'' the Atlanta-based carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's internal safety review stemmed from the carrier's  
troublesome track record: More than 700 people killed in 20 years, 
among them 228 who died when a Korean Air 747 flew into a hill on 
Guam in August 1997 and 269 killed when a Soviet MiG fighter shot 
down KAL Flight 007 after the 747 strayed into the Soviet Union's 
airspace in September 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, United Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, has  
had 140 passenger deaths in the same two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Korean Air picked 19 of its pilots to participate in  
an internal safety review. A report written by two of them 
highlighted a number of incidents: 
</P>
<P>
	--During an airport approach, a copilot responded to air traffic  
instructions intended for another plane and veered off course. The 
captain responded by hitting him on the back of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
	--While planning an airline flight, a crew did not discuss the  
expected weather or the amount of fuel necessary. Such decisions, 
they said, should be made by the captain alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the report: In-flight newspaper reading by flight crews.  
Alternate landing sites not approved for the size of plane flown. 
Arguments between a pilot and a dispatcher about how much fuel to 
load for an ocean crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report surfaced recently on the Internet. While the airline  
confirmed its authenticity, Korean Air officials said the findings 
were exaggerated and out of line with observations made by the 
other 17 pilots in the safety review. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found some issues, but nowhere near the degree of these  
two pilots,'' said airline spokeswoman Penny Pfaelzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hardy, a captain and Korean Air's deputy director of flight  
operations, said: ``What they ended up reporting in that document, 
they ended up pumping out, a lot of that is like barroom talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy said Korean Air has had problems, but the Guam crash  
marked a turning point for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident prompted senior management to begin a $114 million  
safety overhaul, including a top-to-bottom review of Korean Air's 
flight operations. The carrier also recruited more experienced 
pilots from Western carriers and hired safety consultants from 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's being done here is to take this airline and this flight  
operations department and make it state-of-the-art,'' Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's problems may stem in part from its rapid growth.  
Thirty years ago, it was an eight-plane local carrier. Using former 
pilots from South Korea's air force, it has exploded into the 
world's 13th-largest passenger airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, the two pilots, whom Korean Air refused to  
name, said some problems are rooted in a culture in which pilots 
defer to their seniors, even when they make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently, in some Korean cockpits, there is a volatile  
cocktail of complacency, arrogance, apathy and a lack of 
self-discipline,'' the pilots wrote. ``These attitudes must be 
removed from the flight deck at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees safety of  
U.S. skies, said Korean officials are responsible for the safety of 
the airline. The agency could ground an individual plane for safety 
problems, but under international aviation treaties, South Korea's 
government has responsibility for maintaining the carrier's safety 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Thursday's crash, which occurred shortly after  
takeoff, is under investigation, but an airline executive said it 
may have been the result of a terrorist act. It killed the 
three-member crew and at least five people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other signs of lingering problems at Korean Air.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a company jet skidded off a runway while landing in  
Pohang, South Korea and split in two. Nineteen passengers were 
injured. In September, another plane overshot a runway, and a month 
before that, a Korean Air Boeing 747 skidded off a runway in Seoul 
and tore off its landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	After the runway accidents and several other minor incidents  
last year, South Korean officials ordered the carrier to cut back 
domestic flights by 15 percent for six months. The restriction is 
to end April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy, the flight operations director, said the airline is  
improving, which was evident during an incident at Chicago's O'Hare 
airport this month. An Air China jet mistakenly turned onto a 
runway where a Korean Air Boeing 747 was taking off, but the 
captain of the jumbo jet avoided a crash by making a sharp turn out 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain displayed excellent situational awareness, made a  
great set of decisions,'' Hardy said. ``But the airline remains 
under a high level of scrutiny.''

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Panel Begins Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Early in the first day of unprecedented  
hearings into the ills confronting young black males in urban 
America, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission got an idea of the 
enormity of the task before it. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour into the two-day hearings Thursday, the  
government panel heard testimony on education, the criminal justice 
system, health care and employment. In each case, young black men 
are on the short end of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry, said the figures  
and problems compel swift action by the government and society at 
large to avert a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't avoid the subject because it's difficult,'' Berry  
said. ``My hope is that if a government agency thinks this is 
important and worth confronting, other sectors of the community 
will get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stereotyped by the media, ignored by the politicians, young,  
poor black males face almost insurmountable obstacles to fulfilling 
the American dream,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Few figures in the avalanche of gloomy statistics presented to  
the board were new. 
</P>
<P>
	Young black men disproportionately are represented among the  
nation's incarcerated, violent crime victims, unemployed and 
underemployed, and those most likely to drop out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the solutions offered by the dozen panelists stressed  
early intervention with youth and exposure to positive role models. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Monroe, assistant police chief in the nation's capital,  
discussed a recent trip he organized for young black men to go to a 
television studio. Monroe said the youngsters began to mimic the 
different jobs they saw performed by professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They now see several job possibilities for themselves they  
never knew existed before,'' Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
	While a first for the federal civil rights commission, panels  
focusing on problems of young black males are not new. The National 
Urban League held similar groups since the 1970s and more than a 
dozen states have studied the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But Berry said that too often, once a study is completed, it is  
placed on a shelf and the issues are not addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Her commission will produce a report to be distributed to the 50  
local civil rights commissions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see the solutions implemented and we will be  
distributing report cards around the country to local 
commissions,'' Berry said. ``We want people to follow through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An independent, bipartisan fact-finding agency, the commission  
is hearing from more than 25 experts in the fields of education, 
criminal justice, labor and health care.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Previews New Assessment Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Natalie Young, an accountant 19 years  
removed from high school, felt a few test-day jitters again, but 
mostly curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	Like hundreds of others in eight cities around Kentucky on  
Friday, she spent the morning getting a sample of what the state's 
schoolchildren will be experiencing next week -- a new series of 
skills tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did require a lot of thought. I feel a little dumb,'' said  
Mrs. Young, the mother of a fifth-grader. ``I'm really encouraged 
by the level of critical thinking that's required ... rather than 
regurgitating facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Take the Test Day'' drew parents, employers, policy makers and  
the simply interested to sites across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, lawmakers scrapped the 7-year-old testing system and  
ordered the new tests that children will take for the first time 
this month. The tests -- for grades 4, 7 and 11 -- will become the 
yardstick for measuring schools' achievement against the state's 
academic goals. Every two years, the school ratings generate 
rewards and sanctions for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Budny, manager of a plant in Lexington that manufactures  
metal washers and fasteners, said his company, Crest Products, has 
an interest in Kentucky upgrading its entire education system, 
elementary through secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need employees who are trainable and have a mastery of  
the basics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toivo Puro, a retired Army engineer living in Richmond, said he  
was favorably impressed by math questions that tested abilities 
needed in the work place. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky was among states praised last month for making gains in  
the reading test scores of its fourth-grade students. But the state 
may have helped its scores by not including large numbers of 
children with disabilities in the latest test sample in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials are investigating whether Kentucky and other  
states participating in a voluntary national test showed 
significant increases from 1994 simply because they excluded more 
special education students. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials say there's no evidence of wrongdoing by the  
states, which were following new federal rules to exclude the 
students.

<HEADLINE>  Lakers Waive Dennis Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's seven-week career with the  
Los Angeles Lakers has come to an abrupt end -- no big surprise 
considering his recent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman reacted to being released Thursday night by calling  
himself a scapegoat for the team's problems, and said the Lakers 
were ``cowards not to take the fall for some of the things that 
have happened this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers issued a statement saying they were finished with  
Rodman in the wake of another in a long list of incidents involving 
the eccentric forward earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate to win their first NBA title since 1988, the Lakers  
figured Rodman, a member of five championship teams,including the 
last three with the Chicago Bulls, was just what they needed to put 
them over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final game, they bottomed out, losing 113-86 at Portland  
on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't the last straw. That apparently occurred when  
Rodman, according to coach Kurt Rambis, showed up late for the 
team's practice at Los Angeles Southwest College on Thursday 
morning, and was slow getting ready because he couldn't find his 
socks and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis later told reporters he told Rodman to go home, and said  
the team was through with its special treatment of the NBA's 
leading rebounder in each of the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time we feel it's in the best interests of the Lakers  
to end the relationship,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West said in 
the statement issued Thursday night. ``This obviously didn't work 
out like we had hoped, but we would like to thank Dennis for the 
contributions he did make to the team and wish him the best of luck 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 next month, signed with the Lakers on Feb.  
23 and played his first game three days later. He averaged 2.1 
points, 11.2 rebounds and 28.6 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won their first 11 games with Rodman in uniform, but  
were 6-6 since that time with him playing. They are 8-9 without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman told Fox Sports News late Thursday night that the Lakers  
``have to have a fall guy, and I'm basically the fall guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people will criticize my attitude and my dedication  
to the game of basketball, but, you know, it doesn't surprise me,'' 
he said. ``I didn't really miss practices. Today, I didn't miss 
practice. Today, he (Rambis) asked me, `Do you need treatment?' I 
was there 10 minutes early before practice, and he told me to take 
the day off and all of a sudden I'm like, great, you know? 
</P>
<P>
	``... I wanted to come here and win and play here. It didn't  
turn out that way. I don't know what I'm going to do right know. 
It's one of those deals. If they want to make me the fall guy, I 
will be the fall guy. I don't expect anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman did say he wanted to apologize to fans in Los Angeles,  
adding, ``I hope that they don't look at me as a bad individual. I 
hope I'm still loved by people here in the state of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman also said he would consider playing for another team this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on if somebody wants to take a chance on having a  
guy like me on a team that can win a championship, I will go and 
play with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After reportedly refusing to return to a game in the fourth  
quarter on March 12 because his right elbow was sore, Rodman was 
late to practice the following day, and when he did show up, he 
said he needed time off to deal with personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed four games before returning eight days later for a  
nationally televised game in Orlando. While he was gone, he was 
spotted gambling in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's paid leave of absence perhaps stemmed from problems  
with his wife, actress Carmen Electra, although he denied that upon 
his return. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rodman and Electra announced jointly April 6 they had  
filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rambis, Rodman also refused to return to games in  
the fourth quarter on March 26 and last Friday, saying his muscles 
had tightened up. He was late for practice the following day both 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman didn't play in the second half in Portland on Tuesday  
night, claiming he had an injured elbow. He had four rebounds in 13 
minutes before being taken out with 2:31 left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers didn't practice Wednesday, setting the stage for  
Thursday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to know the truth? I was shocked when they put him on  
their team,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said after his team beat the 
Los Angeles Clippers 103-89 Thursday night for its ninth straight 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, who beat the Lakers in the Western Conference finals  
last spring, will attempt to extend the winning streak against the 
Lakers on Saturday night in a nationally televised game at the 
Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I heard, Jerry West didn't have much to do with it  
(bringing Rodman in),'' Sloan said. ``I understand someone else 
wanted him, so they got him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan was referring to Lakers owner Jerry Buss.  
</P>
<P>
	Clippers guard Sherman Douglas said the Lakers knew what they  
were getting when they signed Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did you expect? Did he do anything differently than he  
did before? No,'' Douglas said. ``He used to miss practice, he used 
to irritate people, still does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the Lakers weren't ready for that. That's why they got  
rid of him, plain and simple.''

<HEADLINE> Parliament Can't Make No. 99 Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Even the Parliament of Canada couldn't compel  
Wayne Gretzky to keep playing hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Member Nelson Riis sought unanimous consent Friday for a motion  
in the House of Commons asking Gretzky to delay his retirement from 
the NHL. The announcement came later in the day in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a rather unique moment in Canada's history,'' Riis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a follow-up to the initiative taken by the prime minister  
of Canada, calling up the greatest hockey player ever and 
encouraging him to stay on, I'd like to seek unanimous consent to 
put the following motion: 
</P>
<P>
	``That, in the opinion of this House, Wayne Gretzky should not  
retire but should play one more season in the National Hockey 
League. However, in the event that he decides to retire, that 
consideration should be given to appointing Wayne Gretzky as 
Canada's ambassador for hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberal House leader Don Boudria responded that while most of  
the 301 MPs would agree with the sentiment, ``we cannot agree to 
have a motion of the House incite someone to making career changes 
or career choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said Thursday that Prime Minister Jean Chretien had  
phoned him earlier in the day and encouraged the 38-year-old to 
continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a young man,'' Chretien repeated Friday during a photo  
opportunity with visiting Chinese premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	Member Cliff Breitkreuz, wearing a white jersey bearing  
Gretzky's No. 99 on the front under his blazer, also paid tribute 
to ``The Great One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Single-handedly, Wayne Gretzky brought finesse back to  
hockey,'' Breitkreuz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And with it he brought untold delight and sheer wonder to  
millions of fans in North America and throughout the world. Wow, 
what a Canadian.''

<HEADLINE> Deane Named Lamar Hoop Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) -- Mike Deane, fired a month ago by  
Marquette, was introduced as head basketball coach at Lamar on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deane, 47, was fired after the Golden Eagles lost in the first  
round of the Conference USA tournament. He compiled a 100-55 record 
in five seasons at Marquette, but the team was 14-15 last season 
and athletic director Bill Cords said the team's competitiveness 
``gradually eroded'' during Deane's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Deane's appointment at Lamar came after the other three  
finalists all withdrew from consideration. The university had 
interviewed former Mississippi State coach Richard Williams, Iowa 
State assistant Terry Carroll and Birmingham-Southern head coach 
Duane Reboul. 
</P>
<P>
	Deane has a career coaching record of 290-157, including stints  
at Siena and Oswego State. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lamar, Deane will succeed Grey Giovanine, who guided the  
Cardinals to their first consecutive winning seasons in more than a 
decade. Lamar was 17-11 last season and tied for fifth place in the 
Southland Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Giovanine, 39, resigned last month, saying he wanted to pursue  
other career opportunities. He compiled an 80-85 record in six 
seasons.

<HEADLINE> Eclectic Jury Named for Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The jury for the 52nd Cannes Film Festival features  
an eclectic lineup of directors, actors, a singer and a playwright, 
with Hollywood duly represented by Holly Hunter and Jeff Goldblum. 
</P>
<P>
	The list is heavy on directors: Andre Techine of France, George  
Miller of Australia, Maurizio Nichetti of Italy and Doris Dorrie of 
Germany will join jury president David Cronenberg, the Canadian 
director of ``Crash'' whose appointment was announced earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on this year's list is Yasmina Reza, the French author of  
the hit play ``Art,'' which won a coveted Tony award last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, a 1993 Oscar winner for ``The Piano,'' will be there, as  
will Goldblum, who's carved a niche playing eccentric scientists in 
big-budget films and most recently lent his voice to DreamWorks' 
``The Prince of Egypt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrated opera singer Barbara Hendricks will provide some  
musical star power. Rounding out the list is French actress 
Dominque Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival runs this year from May 12-23.

<HEADLINE> Browns Remain Secretive About Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- What the Browns will do with their top pick is  
still top secret. 
</P>
<P>
	With just hours remaining before Cleveland had to announce to  
the world what they decided to do with the No. 1 overall selection 
in Saturday's NFL draft, the Browns were staying quiet and 
exploring all options. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them -- call it Option No. 4 -- could be a last-minute,  
blockbuster trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some new developments with at least one other team  
wanting to trade up and take the pick,'' Browns president Carmen 
Policy said Friday evening. ``We have four alternatives and all of 
them are still alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy denied rumors running wild through New York hotel lobbies  
and on the air waves in Cleveland that the Browns have already 
decided to make Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch their first 
selection. Policy said Couch, Oregon quarterback Akili Smith and 
Texas running back Ricky Williams are all still in the mix and that 
negotiations with the players' agents were continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been in constant contact with the Browns,'' Williams'  
agent, Leland Hardy, said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns seemed to be enjoying their first moment in the NFL  
draft spotlight in three years. They may have already decided what 
to do, and were just waiting until the final moment to show their 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a possibility we might make a decision tonight,''  
Policy said as workers scurried around the team's headquarters in 
Berea in preparation for the two-day draft. ``Late tonight or early 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Couch had already agreed to a contract and would be  
taken first, Policy said, ``No, that's not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Picking Couch seems to be the Browns' first option as long as  
they can strike a deal with his agent, Tom Condon of 
Cleveland-based IMG. The 21-year-old Couch, who is skipping his 
senior year at Kentucky, has been considered the frontrunner for 
months. He solidified his place as the team's likely quarterback of 
the future with a good workout orchestrated by Browns coach Chris 
Palmer and attended by Policy and Browns owner Al Lerner last 
weekend in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's second option would be to take Smith, who has a  
stronger arm than Couch and appeared to be Palmer's favorite after 
a stellar private workout last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said from New York that he spoke  
with Browns' officials several times Friday and was assured his 
client was still being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	One advantage for Smith could be Steinberg's experience with  
Policy at the bargaining table. Steinberg represented several San 
Francisco 49ers, including quarterback Steve Young, whose contract 
he negotiated when Policy was 49ers president. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, too, was impressed by the Browns' ability to keep  
everyone guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Cleveland Browns had been given the atomic nuclear  
secret, we would still have it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Browns choose their third option and take Williams, it  
would mean they couldn't get either quarterback to agree to a 
contract. And it could signal they plan to grab another quarterback 
in later rounds or attempt to sign free agent Warren Moon, who 
reports say has been in contact with Palmer in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	And if all else fails, the Browns could choose a fourth option --  
trade the pick, something that until recently seemed highly 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone is talking to us about making a trade of pick to move  
into the first selection slot,'' Policy said. ``It's a long shot 
but it's still a horse in the race.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Premier Backs Market Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov stressed today  
that the government will continue implementing economic reforms but 
that it wants to bring back greater state control over the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government isn't going to backtrack on the course of  
reform, but it's necessary to re-think some approaches and correct 
some steps that have been taken,'' Primakov said at a Cabinet 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov said the government will follow orders from President  
Boris Yeltsin to create incentives for ailing industries and make 
state regulation of the economy more effective. He did not specify 
how the government would do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov has repeatedly said that the government intends to take  
a greater hand in managing the economy. The prime minister has 
argued that earlier reform efforts resulted in a free-for-all that 
contributed to the country's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov said that the government's plans have won approval from  
World Bank President James Wolfensohn, who promised Russia $2.3 
billion in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn, who held talks with government officials in Moscow  
on Thursday, said the loan would be released over two years, and 
would begin after the government reaches agreement with the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF and the World Bank orchestrated a $2.6 billion bailout  
package to Russia last year, but disbursements were frozen in 
August after the country's financial markets collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia desperately needs the money to avoid a looming default on  
its foreign debt. The country has suffered one of the worst 
depressions ever experienced by an industrial nation, and its 
economy has contracted throughout this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of IMF experts is in Moscow preparing a report for the  
fund's board, which is expected to make a final decision on new 
loans shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said today that the  
government's austerity course has reduced the rate of inflation and 
reversed a decline in industrial output.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Military Seen As Real Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's military forced an Islamic  
government from power, paraded tanks through a town that favored a 
religious party and has told soldiers not to eat cookies baked by a 
company believed to favor political Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	Turks vote Sunday for a new parliament, but any government will  
rule in the shadow of the military, which regards itself as the 
guardian of the nation's secular principles. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say the election campaign has been relatively low  
key in part because Turks believe the politicians have little 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people think nothing will change after the elections  
because the army is the main power in Turkey,'' said Oral Calislar, 
a columnist with the Cumhuriyet newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The military's influence in Turkish society is enormous.  
</P>
<P>
	Generals are briefed by political leaders the last Friday of  
every month, and the officers' recommendations almost always are 
accepted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	With little input from elected officials, the military has  
fought a war in the southeast against Kurdish guerrillas since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has staged three coups since 1960, and it pressured  
Turkey's first Islamic-led government from power in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The military's opinions are expected to be taken into account  
Sunday when the nation votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Public euphoria over the mid-February capture of Kurdish  
guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkish commandos has helped 
boost the popularity of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, a staunch 
secularist favored by the military and one of the few major Turkish 
politicians untainted by corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islamic Virtue Party is expected to lose some of its  
support, in part due to the military's unyielding campaign to 
discredit the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said they expect the military to vigilantly  
monitor the party's actions if it emerges from the elections in a 
position of power. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Turks, however, don't mind the military's role overseeing  
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show that military officers are among the most trusted  
members of society and that politicians are generally regarded as 
corrupt and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the failure of the politicians, the people believe  
in the military,'' Calislar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulent Aliriza, an analyst at the Washington-based Center for  
Strategic and International Studies, said ``if the people did not 
want the army to intervene ... there would have been a reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deep respect for the military stems from the founding of the  
Turkish republic, when officers led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk forged 
the new state after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Generals have said that it is their eternal role to guard that  
state. 
</P>
<P>
	To this day, graduating cadets pledge that their ``swords will  
be ready and sharp against those who try to undermine secularism, 
democracy and independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a vow the generals take seriously.  
</P>
<P>
	In their drive to undermine the power and support of pro-Islamic  
politicians, the army in 1997 paraded tanks down the streets of a 
town dominated by supporters of the Islamic party then in power. 
</P>
<P>
	It has purged hundreds of officers from its ranks for violating  
secular principles, and has also ordered soldiers to boycott any 
goods from businesses thought to support the Islamic movement, even 
cookies and biscuits.

<HEADLINE> Cessna's CEO To Take Lesser Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Cessna Aircraft Co. chairman Russ Meyer  
says he plans to take a reduced role at the world's leading 
manufacturer of light and medium business jets, but will remain in 
product development and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer, 66, said this week he will step down as chief executive  
officer by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer has been at Cessna for 25 years and has been CEO for 24  
years. There had been speculation in the aviation industry for the 
past two years about when he would retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Chairman Gary Hay will assume the duties of chief executive  
by year-end, Meyer said. Charlie Johnson will continue as president 
and chief operating officer.

<HEADLINE> Michigan State AD Will Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State athletic director  
Merritt Norvell said Thursday he will step down this spring to join 
a firm specializing in searches for executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvell didn't specifiy when he would step down, saying only  
that joining DHR International Inc. ``is an opportunity that I feel 
is best for my family and me.'' He would become president of the 
Chicago-based firm's education-services division. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvell, athletic director since 1995, has 15 months left on his  
contract, which the university plans to honor, assistant AD John 
Lewandowski said. Norvell would step down by June and will serve 
out the remainder of his contract as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Underwood, a senior associate AD, will be the interim  
athletic director while a permanent replacement is sought. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson said a permanent successor to Norvell could be in  
place by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will immediately undertake a search for a director who  
ideally will serve for 10 years or more,'' university president 
Peter McPherson said. ``He (Underwood) has said that since we will 
be expecting a long-term commitment, he will not be a candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making Norvell the Spartans' first black athletic director  
and only the second in Big Ten history, McPherson said in 1995 he 
``needed a person who could lead, who could plan strategically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus,'' McPherson added later, ``I thought it was a plus to  
have been a Division I athlete, to know that level of competition. 
I'm very pleased with the job he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norvell came to Michigan State with degrees from Wisconsin in  
criminology, psychiatric social work and education -- and what 
colleagues noted was his commitment to gender-equity issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvell began a marketing firm, The Norvell Group, after  
graduating in 1963. He joined IBM in 1977, where he worked until 
retiring in 1994 to concentrate on private marketing ventures.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Ripken Makes Double Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's Cal Ripken's glove that resembles iron  
these days, not the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken made a double error in the second inning of the Baltimore  
Orioles' game against the New York Yankees on Thursday night, 
leading to five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't feel that bad,'' Ripken said after  
Baltimore's 9-7 win. ``I wish I could claim a physical problem but 
there's not one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, a two-time Gold Glove who had just eight errors last  
season and holds or shares 12 fielding records, has five of his 
team's seven errors this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed a week of spring training last month following the  
death of his father, Cal Ripken Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge mentally right now,'' Ripken said. ``Maybe  
I'm pushing it a little too much right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the regular season, Ripken missed two starts because  
of a bad back. But he said it's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some respects, I feel a little rusty,'' he said. ``The good  
news is physically I feel very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has been taking extra hitting and fielding and intends to  
take more. He had two throwing errors in Sunday's 9-5 loss to 
Toronto, including one on a rundown that turned the game around. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Ironman, who broke Lou Gehrig's record for  
consecutive games played, also misplayed Chili Davis' first-inning 
grounder in Baltimore's 14-7 loss to New York on Wednesday night, 
leading to the third run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of getting it all together,'' he said.  
``I'm going to try to work at it. It's all I can offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Baltimore ahead 4-0 and the bases loaded with two outs in  
the second, Luis Sojo hit a grounder to third that Ripken bobbled, 
then threw past first as two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch hit a two-run double off the glove of left  
fielder B.J. Surhoff on the next pitch, and Derek Jeter's double 
gave New York a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles manager Ray Miller was unconcerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cal's all right,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield: Punch Stats Deceiving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield says Lennox Lewis landing a  
lot more punches than he did was deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
	A punch tally of the fight for the undisputed heavyweight title  
bout March 13 that ended in a controversial draw credited Lewis 
with landing 364 of 613 punches to 130 of 385 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	A rematch is expected Nov. 6 or 13 at site to be determined.  
</P>
<P>
	``In pro boxing, it's not how many punches you throw, it's  
effective punches, punches that hurt,'' Holyfield said at a hearing 
before the New York State Senate Committee on Investigations, 
chaired by State Sen. Roy Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield called many of the punches Lewis landed ``taps.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said in a taped interview with Goodman that the punch  
statistics were proof of his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the most aggressive fighter,'' Holyfield said. ``Once  
the fight got to the eighth round you could see I was doing all the 
work. All the judges started giving me all the rounds. I was trying 
to make a fight and here's a guy who don't want to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Eugenia Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., who scored it  
115-113 for Holyfield, gave Holyfield four of the last five rounds. 
Stanley Christodoulou (116-113 Lewis) of South Africa called the 
last five rounds 3-1-1 for Holyfield. Larry O'Connell (115-115) of 
England also thought Holyfield won four of the last five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, the scoring was very bad,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was highly criticized for scoring the fifth round for  
Holyfield, when it was that round in which Lewis seemed to have him 
in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is clueless in knowing what her job is and what she should  
be scoring,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the scoring of O'Connell, Lewis, of Britain, said: ``I  
was quite amazed. It definitely showed me he wasn't watching my 
jab. My jab was doing the most damage. I think he overcompensated 
not to show favoritism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Goodman said his committee had turned over to a  
Manhattan grand jury evidence of potential criminality in the 
judging of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams admitted before the committee March 18 that she had  
recently filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned whether judges with financial problems ``could not  
be subject to temptation. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman previously said testimony indicated O'Connell was behind  
in his mortgage payments. However, on Friday he said that report 
was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. O'Connell called us from England yesterday and assured us  
this was not the case,'' Goodman said. ``I want this on the 
record.''

<HEADLINE> Teammates Expect Elway Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- On the eve of the NFL draft, the Denver Broncos  
still don't know the intentions of their 38-year-old, Hall of 
Fame-bound quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, neither does he.  
</P>
<P>
	But some of his teammates are preparing for the unthinkable:  
life without John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Of four players interviewed during off-season workouts on  
Thursday, two said they believe Elway will retire this year. 
Another said he was surprised Elway came back for the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one, running back Terrell Davis, said he thought Elway  
would return for a 17th season this fall to try for an 
unprecedented third straight Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is he's done it all and I think he'll retire,''  
defensive tackle Trevor Pryce said. ``For my own selfish reasons, I 
don't want him to. But he can't live for everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in the league, what, 16 years? He's 38 years old.  
He's done everything he can do. He has two Super Bowl rings, was 
the Super Bowl MVP and has all those records. He could have gone 
into the Hall of Fame five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say he should come back for a third straight title.  
Then why not a fourth one? It never stops. If he wants to retire in 
peace, he has to do it eventually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Howard Griffith agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what he's going to do, but my guess is he'll  
probably retire,'' Griffith said. ``The selfish side of us wants 
him back on the football team. But at this point in his career and 
his life, he's achieved a lot of things. He's got to do what's best 
for John Elway and his family, as opposed to what his team and his 
organization want him to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rod Smith said he has given up anticipating  
Elway's moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut told me last year he wasn't coming back,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith also said those who note that Elway has not participated  
in the first two weeks of the voluntary conditioning program at 
Broncos headquarters are reading too much into his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been doing this so long, he doesn't need to get his body  
going this soon,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was the lone optimist.  
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is that he'll be back,'' Davis said. ``But  
there's nothing that I've seen or heard to support that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think right now everybody is hoping for the best but  
preparing for the worst. As a team, we have to be prepared for 
either decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Elway said the major question in his mind was whether  
he was physically up to the challenge. He said he wavers daily 
about whether to play another year and has no timetable for making 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan has declined all interviews in the  
weeks leading up to the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the NFL meetings in Phoenix last month, Shanahan said,  
``At the end of the season, I was 99 percent sure John was going to 
retire. Right now, I don't know. I think it could go either way.''

<P>
	Shanahan said the competitor in Elway and his opportunity for a  
third straight title make the decision difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan has expressed confidence going into the 1999 season  
with Bubby Brister as his starting quarterback and second-year 
player Brian Griese as the backup. With Elway missing all or part 
of six games because of assorted injuries last season, Brister 
filled in admirably, compiling a 4-0 record in games he started.

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield: Punch Stats Deceiving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield says Lennox Lewis landing a  
lot more punches than he did was deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
	A punch tally of the fight for the undisputed heavyweight title  
bout March 13 that ended in a controversial draw credited Lewis 
with landing 364 of 613 punches to 130 of 385 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	A rematch is expected Nov. 6 or 13 at site to be determined.  
</P>
<P>
	``In pro boxing, it's not how many punches you throw, it's  
effective punches, punches that hurt,'' Holyfield said at a hearing 
before the New York State Senate Committee on Investigations, 
chaired by State Sen. Roy Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield called many of the punches Lewis landed ``taps.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said in a taped interview with Goodman that the punch  
statistics were proof of his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the most aggressive fighter,'' Holyfield said. ``Once  
the fight got to the eighth round you could see I was doing all the 
work. All the judges started giving me all the rounds. I was trying 
to make a fight and here's a guy who don't want to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Eugenia Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., who scored it  
115-113 for Holyfield, gave Holyfield four of the last five rounds. 
Stanley Christodoulou (116-113 Lewis) of South Africa called the 
last five rounds 3-1-1 for Holyfield. Larry O'Connell (115-115) of 
England also thought Holyfield won four of the last five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, the scoring was very bad,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was highly criticized for scoring the fifth round for  
Holyfield, when it was that round in which Lewis seemed to have him 
in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is clueless in knowing what her job is and what she should  
be scoring,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the scoring of O'Connell, Lewis, of Britain, said: ``I  
was quite amazed. It definitely showed me he wasn't watching my 
jab. My jab was doing the most damage. I think he overcompensated 
not to show favoritism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Goodman said his committee had turned over to a  
Manhattan grand jury evidence of potential criminality in the 
judging of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams admitted before the committee March 18 that she had  
recently filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned whether judges with financial problems ``could not  
be subject to temptation. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman previously said testimony indicated O'Connell was behind  
in his mortgage payments. However, on Friday he said that report 
was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. O'Connell called us from England yesterday and assured us  
this was not the case,'' Goodman said. ``I want this on the 
record.''

<HEADLINE>  Bust Clouds Strawberry's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- By most accounts, Darryl Strawberry was well  
on his way back to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder had completed chemotherapy  
treatment for colon cancer and was expected join Triple-A Columbus 
as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	He was involved in charitable activities and spoke this week  
about how his illness changed his perspective on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's made me more aware of my purpose of living and who I'm  
living for,'' the eight-time outfielder said on ABC's ``20/20'' 
during an interview aired Monday -- two nights before his arrest by 
Tampa police on drug and prostitution charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I'm not living for me, Darryl Strawberry, to play  
baseball and be a hero at that anymore. You know, I'm living for, 
you know, the grace that God has given to me and allowed me to -- to 
be able to walk, walk on the baseball field again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take the 37-year-old slugger long to figure out the  
consequences of his latest brush with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he was apologetic about the charges of possession of  
cocaine and soliciting a prostitute that cloud his future in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked several times, if there was anything that we could do  
to change this situation, because this was going to ruin his 
career,'' an investigative report read. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unfortunate thing for Mr. Strawberry, but there's no  
question in our mind what had transpired,'' police spokesman Joe 
Durkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the powder cocaine found wrapped in a $20 bill  
inside the outfielder's wallet did not belong to him. And while he 
acknowledged discussing sex with a female undercover officer 
Wednesday night, he insisted he was joking around. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimated the street value of the cocaine at $20.  
</P>
<P>
	``The $20 bill was folded up to keep it in place,'' Durkin said,  
adding the .3 grams -- about 100th of an ounce -- was enough for 
about ``one hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest was the latest jolt in Strawberry's troubled personal  
and professional life, which has been beset by cocaine and alcohol 
abuse, income tax evasion, domestic strife, failure to make child 
support payments and -- last fall -- a diagnosis of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who lives in Tampa, was in  
Cleveland to attend a funeral and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonn Trost, the Yankees' general counsel, declined comment,  
saying the team would allow the legal process to run its course 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig called the arrest ``a painful  
episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, a lot of people are looking into it. We've been in  
contact with the players' association and the Yankees, and we have 
to let the justice system work here,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was in seclusion, breaking from his daily routine of  
working out at the Yankees' minor-league complex, where he has been 
preparing for a comeback from his cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not here, and he's not going to be here for a while,''  
Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president of player development 
said. ``I don't know what's going to happen down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who waived his right to have an attorney present  
during questioning, told police the cocaine might have been left in 
the vehicle by a driver or passengers from the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The outfielder said his wife's uncle, Rodney Simon, used the  
vehicle Tuesday night and it was possible Simon or others in the 
car might have left the folded $20 bill in the glove box where 
Strawberry found it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was joking around with the undercover officer  
about sex and drove off with no intention of meeting her at a 
nearby motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the good stuff?,'' the police report quoted  
Strawberry as asking the undercover officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the good stuff,'' the officer responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``Where can I get some good stuff to party with.''  
</P>
<P>
	Officer: ``I don't have any, but you can get it from anyone  
walking down the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``Do you want to party?''  
</P>
<P>
	Officer: ``Yes, I want to party. What do you want?''  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``I want it all.''  
</P>
<P>
	The baseball player, carrying $1,159.10 in cash, then arranged  
to have sex for $50, the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators interviewed Simon by telephone at Strawberry's  
urging. They were told Simon was using Strawberry's vehicle the 
previous night and that he had been accompanied by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon ``denied that he used or even saw cocaine last  
night,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who hit .247 with 24 homers and 57 RBIs for the  
Yankees last season, is not a stranger to substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered a center for alcohol rehabilitation in 1990 and spent  
four weeks undergoing treatent for a subtance abuse problem in 
1994. The following year, major league baseball suspended him for 
60 days after he tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's had financial woes, too.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal court ordered him in 1995 to repay $350,000 in back  
taxes and sentenced him to six months of home confinement, except 
for games. He was once also accused of failing to make timely 
payments to an ex-wife.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Twice-Daily HIV Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved another treatment  
choice for patients with the AIDS virus Friday, a protease 
inhibitor called amprenavir. 
</P>
<P>
	Amprenavir, sold under the brand name Agenerase, is taken in  
combination with other AIDS medications. It comes in capsule form 
for adults -- eight capsules twice a day -- and a liquid formulation 
for children 4 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	It can be taken with or without food, but should never be taken  
with a high-fat meal because the fat content can decrease 
absorption of the drug, the Food and Drug Administration said in 
approving amprenavir. 
</P>
<P>
	Protease inhibitors are a class of AIDS medicines that, when  
taken with other types of AIDS drugs, can significantly improve 
patients' health. Amprenavir is the fifth protease inhibitor on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In six-month studies, amprenavir lowered levels of HIV, the AIDS  
virus, in patients' blood and increased their levels of vital 
immune cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and rash.  
The FDA warned that in about 1 percent of patients, amprenavir also 
can cause severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in which painful blisters line the mouth, 
genital region and eyes. As with similar AIDS drugs, doctors also 
must be careful to avoid dangerous interactions when prescribing 
amprenavir with other medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovered by Vertex Pharmaceuticals but manufactured by Glaxo  
Wellcome Inc., the wholesale price will be $6,132 a year.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Triples Loss Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second largest automaker,  
expects to report a loss of 35 billion yen, or $296 million, for 
the fiscal year that ended March 31 because of a sharp drop in 
domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss of that magnitude would be more than three times Nissan's  
previous estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled carmaker also plans to omit a dividend payment for  
the first time since the public listing of its shares in 1951. It 
had previously planned to pay a dividend of 5 yen, or 4 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deterioration in domestic sales was worse than expected,  
forcing us to suspend our dividend payments,'' said Nissan 
President Yoshikazu Hanawa, adding that annual production capacity 
would be slashed 25 percent to 1.5 million vehicles by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan projected that sales for the parent company would total  
3.32 trillion yen, or $28.1 billion, for the fiscal year that ended 
on March 31, down from an earlier forecast of 3.40 trillion yen. 
</P>
<P>
	It expects unit sales of 874,000 vehicles, compared to 974,000  
in the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault SA of France, which bought a 36.8 percent stake in  
Nissan last month, said in Paris on Friday that the Japanese 
automaker's downward earnings revision was ``in the range of 
estimates'' it had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault agreed to pay $5.4 billion for its stake.  
</P>
<P>
	Nissan chief Hanawa said he hoped to use the cash infusion from  
Renault to help pay off its massive debt load. Hanawa also said he 
does not plan to resign this year, citing his responsibility to 
oversee the alliance with Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Nissan reversed an initial forecast that it would  
break even, instead predicting a parent company net loss of 10 
billion yen for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal 1997, the company posted a net profit of 16.6 billion  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	At the group level, which includes the parent and subsidiaries,  
Nissan left its fiscal-1998 forecast unchanged at a net loss of 30 
billion yen, or $254 million, on sales of 6.4 trillion yen, or 
$54.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said its North American and European operations are each  
expected to post a net profit of 5 billion yen, or $42 million, in 
fiscal 1998. But its Mexican operations will probably report a 10 
billion yen, or $85 million, loss as a result of a weakening in the 
peso.

<HEADLINE> Reuters' Employees Authorize Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. employees of the financial news service  
Reuters have authorized a strike, saying they're frustrated after 
18 months of contract negotiations without a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Reuters' 600 journalists, technicians and support staff  
will continue to work as bargaining continues, the vote late 
Thursday increases the pressure on managers to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've tried to dismantle our contract,'' Barry Lipton,  
president of the Newspaper Guild of New York, said Friday. ``We 
haven't set a strike deadline yet, but if things don't go well, the 
next step is to set a strike deadline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union and management are divided over several issues,  
including job security, wages, and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Reuters' U.S. workers walked off the job was in  
the early 1980s, and the company called Thursday's authorization 
vote ``counterproductive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope very much that the negotiations will result in an  
agreement that is satisfactory to all and that the Guild does not 
pull the trigger on the strike vote authorization,'' Glen D. Russo, 
director of employee and labor relations for Reuters America Inc., 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``However,'' he added, ``no one should doubt the company's  
determination to get the contract it needs to further legitimate 
business goals, or its determination to continue operations in the 
unfortunate event of a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters America Inc., which is based in New York, is a  
subsidiary of Britain's Reuters Group Plc, which supplies global 
financial markets and news organizations with a wide range of 
real-time data, news, video and photos.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Not On Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Jack Kevorkian told his lawyer he has abandoned  
plans to go on a hunger strike and is being treated well at his new 
home -- a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in good spirits,'' lawyer Mayer Morganroth said Thursday,  
two days after Kevorkian was sentenced to 10 to 25 years behind 
bars for second-degree murder in an injection death last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the medical facilities are excellent, they gave him a  
checkup and he had a little high blood pressure, but that's about 
it,'' Morganroth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was sentenced, Kevorkian had told a newspaper he would  
begin a hunger strike immediately upon entering prison. But 
Morganroth said Kevorkian, 70, told him he was eating and would 
continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's going to starve, I don't have anyone for an appeal,''  
Morganroth said in today's Oakland Press of Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `Jack, if you're not here, how can we pursue the  
very cause we wanted to pursue through the Supreme Court? I have to 
have you. It's all meaningless without you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The same day Kevorkian went to prison, state prison officials  
said they had reversed their policy on force-feeding. Under the 
policy, Kevorkian would have been allowed to starve himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian injected Thomas Youk, 52, with a lethal cocktail of  
chemicals last Sept. 17 at Youk's request. The man suffering from 
Lou Gehrig's disease was confined to a wheelchair, had a feeding 
tube installed in his stomach and was afraid of choking to death on 
his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who says he has helped 130 people kill themselves  
since 1990, sent a videotape of the death to ``60 Minutes,'' hoping 
to force the issue of assisted suicide into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape and the CBS News show's interview with Kevorkian were  
the prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian said Youk's death was his first euthanasia, and the  
trial was his first on a murder charge. Previous trials on assisted 
suicide charges ended in three acquittals and a mistrial.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar softened against the Japanese yen,  
which garnered strength Friday from a weakening euro. The dollar 
was flat against the European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0702, down  
from $1.0703 late Thursday. During the trading day, the euro 
reached $1.0627, the lowest point since its launch at the beginning 
of the year. The dollar was worth 117.85 Japanese yen, down from 
118.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the dollar initially rose against the yen in early  
Asian trading, it lost ground as the euro fell, driven by the 
worsening events in Yugoslavia. Thousands of refugees moved into 
Albania and Macedonia and another 100,000 were pushing for the 
borders as Yugoslav forces ousted ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, NATO blasted oil refineries, military barracks and  
airports in Kosovo, Montenegro and the Yugoslav capital in what it 
called one of the most successful efforts of its month-long air 
campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency representing 11 European countries became  
increasingly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was strictly a euro-yen play,'' said Lee Kassler, a foreign  
exchange vice president at Israel Discount Bank, where the yen rose 
against the euro, giving it strength against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Kassler said the euro also fell because of the continued  
strength of the U.S. economy and the continued weakness of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who feel the euro is still poised for a  
further downside movement,'' Kassler said, especially since it 
could take months before any positive effects will be evident from 
the European Central Bank's interest rate cut on April 8. The 
central bank cut rates to stimulate lending and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4961 Swiss francs, down from 1.4978,  
and 1.4795 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4883. The British pound 
was quoted at $1.6142, up from $1.6100. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar's value remained 
unchanged from Thursday at 1.8275 German marks, 6.1275 French 
francs and 1,808.32 Italian lire.

<HEADLINE> Hideo Nomo Still Draws a Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Nomomania may have subsided, but only a  
little. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 30 reporters and photographers, including a dozen from  
his native Japan, gathered Thursday night to hear Hideo Nomo talk 
about his hopes of getting back to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo is pitching for the Chicago Cubs' Triple-A team in Des  
Moines, the Iowa Cubs. He won his first start at Salt Lake City 
last Sunday and is scheduled to pitch again Friday night in the 
team's home opener against Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far it's been a real comfortable environment,'' Nomo said  
through an interpreter. ``The coaches, managers and players have 
all been great. It makes my job a lot easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo became a national sensation in Japan when he reached the  
major leagues with the Los Angeles Dodgers and was the National 
League's rookie of the year in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of reporters from Japan chronicled his every move and the  
games he pitched were televised back in his homeland. Thursday, on 
a cold, rainy night, he continued to draw attention, though not to 
the extent to which he had become accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's settled down a bit,'' Nomo said. ``It's not like it was  
back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was traded last June to the New York Mets, who released him  
after he went 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four appearances this spring. 
The Cubs snapped him up and will evaluate him after three minor 
league starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought this was his last chance to return to the  
major leagues Nomo replied, ``That I don't know. It's hard to 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first start, Nomo gave up three earned runs and six hits  
in five innings. After a rocky start, he retired nine of his last 
10 batters, striking out three. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he can continue where he left off in that game remains  
to be seen, Nomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say right now is physically I'm well prepared for  
the game,'' he said. ``If I make good pitches and they hit them, 
there's nothing I can do about it. All I can say is I will be 
prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's scheduled appearance has been a money-maker for the Iowa  
Cubs, who have sold more than 9,000 tickets for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the weather might not cooperate. As much as 2 inches of snow  
is forecast for Friday and light snow and temperatures in the low 
30s are predicted for Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo said lousy weather won't bother him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've pitched in cold weather before in the major leagues so  
I'm not worried about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo would not speculate on his chances of getting to Chicago or  
whether he would need more than three starts to prove himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my decision whether I get back to the major  
leagues,'' he said. ``All I can really do is go out there and do 
the best I can to the best of my ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was confident he could make it back, Nomo replied,  
``That question in itself is kind of strange. If I didn't think I 
could do it, why would I be here?''

<HEADLINE> Valhol Needs Cash To Get Into Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- With his victory in the Arkansas Derby in  
question, Valhol is No. 40 in earnings among horses eligible for 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is an overflow field for the May 1 race, the top 20  
earners of graded money get spots in the starting gate. Valhol's 
questionable status underlines the importance of a quick decision 
on whether his victory will stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol finished first in the $500,000 Arkansas Derby on Saturday  
at Oaklawn Park and his $300,000 check would make him No. 12 on the 
money list. Oaklawn has called for an investigation into whether 
jockey Billy Patin used an electric buzzer to make the horse run 
faster. The state put a hold on the purse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Churchill Downs list includes an asterisk with the notation:  
``Winner's share of Arkansas Derby purse withheld pending 
investigative action by Oaklawn Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs' policy does not recognize earnings from graded  
stakes races until officially awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn president Charles J. Cella said Thursday the track has  
evidence that Patin ``may have been in possession of an electrical 
device during the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Racing Commission ordered the track to suspend  
distribution of the purse and arranged for an investigation. 
Oaklawn's evidence was turned over to the Thoroughbred Racing 
Protective Bureau, the investigative branch of the thoroughbred 
racing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Freeland, lawyer for the Racing Commission, said that the  
TRPB will let the stewards know whether there is enough evidence to 
continue. If there is sufficient evidence, the stewards will notify 
Patin, trainer Dallas Keen and owner James D. Jackson ``that 
there's a problem here and we want to have a hearing,'' Freeland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would encourage the stewards to make such a hearing  
open. Typically such hearings are not, because the alleged 
infractions are generally minor. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a hearing, Freeland said, the stewards will present  
their material and the other side will have an opportunity to 
present witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The stewards will then say, ``There is nothing here or we find  
there is a violation of the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the jockey, owner and trainer are not satisfied with the  
stewards' ruling, they can appeal to the Racing Commission, which 
could take additional testimony if it desired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission is real liberal because they want to make sure  
everybody gets their day in court,'' Freeland said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said everyone involved is aware that something ``needs to be  
done as quickly as possible.'' One problem, he said, is that one of 
the three stewards is unavailable until the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Any commission ruling could be appealed to circuit court.  
</P>
<P>
	It's also possible that Valhol's owner, trainer or jockey could  
file for a temporary restraining order so that the Arkansas Derby 
earnings could be counted and the colt could run in Louisville May 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs officials said Friday that it is track policy to  
withhold comment on matters that are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin has denied using the device, called a ``machine'' or  
``buzzer,'' and said he intends to win the Kentucky Derby aboard 
Valhol. ``If they saw something, it wasn't from me,'' Patin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost certainly, the evidence will include an enhancement of an  
ESPN video of the race. Moments after the horse crosses the finish 
line and gallops into the first turn, it appears something falls 
from the area of the colt's left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol was second in a maiden race and fourth in the Louisiana  
Derby in his only two races prior to the Arkansas Derby. As a 30-1 
shot in the field of seven, he paid $62.80 after the 4 1/2-length 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol galloped over the Churchill Downs track for the first  
time Friday and exercise rider Jose Cuevas was in the saddle. Patin 
was at Keen's barn, but did not speak with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy told me he didn't do it -- no way, no how,'' said Keen,  
41, the leading trainer at Lone Star Park near Dallas since it 
opened in 1997. ``It's like a bad nightmare, but it's real. It's 
sure not the kind of press you want and it's not good for racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had the highest respect for the Arkansas Derby and  
the horses in the race. ``He beat a legitimate field of horses,'' 
Keen said. ``it would be a terrible shame if he didn't get to run 
in the Kentucky Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cella said Oaklawn officials became aware of possible  
irregularities shortly after the Arkansas Derby became official. 
``By Monday night and Tuesday, Oaklawn management uncovered 
additional evidence regarding the race,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be inappropriate to comment further.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today as the  
deteriorating Kosovo situation led to the weakening of the euro. 
Tokyo share prices rebounded in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.22 yen at late afternoon, down 0.58 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 118.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 124.50 points,  
or 0.74 percent, closing the week at 16,851.58 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed down 37.60 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar initially moved higher on  
massive buying by Japanese trust banks and life insurers, but the 
greenback met selling by foreign funds during lunchtime in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's relative weakness derived mainly from  
heavy selling of the euro against the yen by Japanese exporters and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has been under selling pressure recently because of the  
growing conflict in Yugoslavia, fears of worsening relations 
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia and signs 
of sluggish economic growth, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Kosovo situation appears to be escalating, Japanese  
investors were also trying to hedge their euro-denominated assets, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 117.43 yen and 119.20 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.20 yen, down  
from 128.27 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market rose on continued active buying from foreign  
and individual investors who have grown more optimistic about the 
economic outlook for Japan and other Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrel Whitten, strategist at ABN-Amro, said that overseas  
investors began to see ``a noticeable momentum toward economic 
recovery in the Asia region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was expectation that public and  
pension funds were allocating new funds to the stock market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was active, with about 778 million shares changing hands  
on the exchange's first section, up from Thursday's turnover of 634 
million shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 670 to 522, with 
127 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainers in Tokyo included Honda Motor Co. Its share price  
advanced after the Nihon Keizai business daily reported today that 
the automaker will build a new plant in the United States or Canada 
by 2001. Honda's stocks finished at $44.83 per share, up $1.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Yuzuru Matsuno denied the report, saying his  
company had made no decision to build another North American plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda has two factories in North America -- one in the United  
States and one in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 5.10 points, or 0.38 percent, to 
1,343.03. The TOPIX closed down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.605 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.575 percent, 
pushing its price down to 101.70 yen from 101.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> Amex Reportedly Rife With Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The American Stock Exchange is plagued by  
price-fixing, illegal trading and other problems that earlier 
embroiled larger stock markets, Business Week magazine reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations are reminiscent of circumstances that led to an  
investigation of illegal trading at the New York Stock Exchange and 
the past investigation of price-fixing at the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Amex options specialists and traders try to keep the spread  
between the price they will buy a security and the price they will 
sell as wide as possible, Business Week said. It estimated 
consumers lose $150 million a year because they can't always get 
the best price on a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week also reported that Amex routinely doles out light  
punishment when it uncovers wrongdoing on the floor, and deals with 
even serious wrongdoing ``in the family way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, based on a six-month investigation, appears in the  
April 26 issue of Business Week, which reaches newsstands on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for both the Amex and the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, which regulates the industry, said they had not seen 
the story and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sources at the Amex maintain that illegal trading by floor  
brokers and other trading improprieties are commonplace, similar to 
the indictments of NYSE floor brokers last year,'' according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	At the NYSE, federal authorities filed criminal and civil  
charges against brokerage firms and floor brokers last year 
claiming they used their positions to illegally profit from 
personal trades. Since that probe was launched, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission has broadened the investigation to review how 
the NYSE has handled the regulation of its floor brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	This January, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined 28  
Wall Street firms more than $26 million and suspended 51 traders 
for reputed abuses on Nasdaq, ending an investigation that began in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amex merged with the Nasdaq exchange last year to compete  
more effectively with the NYSE. The combined Amex-Nasdaq promised 
lower costs for consumers and more investments in technology.

<HEADLINE> Sonics' Critics Quieted by OT Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- They're too old and too tired, some  
critics claim. They're a one-man team, with no offensive weapon 
other than Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, in a wild overtime victory over the  
Sacramento Kings that featured buzzer-beating 3-pointers at the end 
of regulation and overtime, the Seattle SuperSonics proved many of 
those critics wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Payton struggling through a 4-of-18 shooting night and  
scoring eight points, 14 below his season average, the Sonics 
rallied from a nine-point deficit late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory improved the Sonics' playoff chances and came one  
night after a home loss to Phoenix. It came on the middle night of 
back-to-back-to-back games for Seattle, which had a home game 
against New Jersey on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our biggest win,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.  
``I told them before the game how resilient they've been. Even when 
they've been buried in games, we've somehow always got it back to 
somehow win like tonight, somehow we have found a way. It was 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Predrag Stojakovic hit a 3-pointer for the Kings with one-tenth  
of a second left in regulation to tie the game at 91-91. 
Stojakovic's shot bounced high off the rim and fell through long 
after the buzzer had sounded. 
</P>
<P>
	With 6.1 seconds left in overtime and the Sonics trailing by two  
points, Payton dribbled toward the baseline and passed to Hersey 
Hawkins, who had been ice cold from the field all night and missed 
all three of his 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had five small guys on the floor, so you never know who's  
going to be open,'' Westphal said. ``Hawk could hardly walk, he 
said he couldn't go back in the game. But then I said, `Hawk, can 
you go stand in the corner and shoot it if they throw it to you?' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the limp-out-there-and-have-everybody-disregard-you  
play, I guess, but it was a beautiful thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins, who was just 4-of-14 from the field before that, hit a  
3-pointer as the clock expired in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only jump shot I made all night. I was shooting  
poorly, but if you've got the open shot you've got to take it,'' 
Hawkins said. ``When I ran into the game, Paul said to me, `Go into 
the corner, knock a 3 down and let's get out of here,' and that's 
exactly what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kings coach Rick Adelman said he wasn't sure who was supposed to  
be guarding Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we made a mistake,'' he said. ``With a two-point  
shot, the worst it can do is put you into overtime again, and the 
3-pointer beats you, so obviously we didn't want to give that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detlef Schrempf had 19 points and 13 rebounds for the Sonics.  
Hawkins and John Crotty, who came off the bench to rally the Sonics 
in the second half, had 15 points each. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory tied the season series between the teams, who played  
three overtime contests in four games this season. Had the Kings 
won, they would have claimed the series and could have used that as 
a tiebreaker for determining playoff position if the teams finish 
with identical records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings also lost at home in overtime on Tuesday, to the Utah  
Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to say, that is two tough losses in a row,''  
said Chris Webber, who had 26 points and tied his career high with 
21 rebounds for the Kings. ``We really needed this win. It hurts, 
it hurts, these things come back to haunt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corliss Williamson had 17 points and Vernon Maxwell had 16 for  
Sacramento. Jason Williams had a career-high 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss, the Kings remain a good possibility to make  
the playoffs for just the second time in the last 13 seasons 
because they have an advantageous schedule the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento has eight of its 11 remaining games at home, and  
plays Denver and the Los Angeles Clippers twice more. The Kings' 
only remaining road games are at the Clippers, Golden State and 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rate every loss a tough loss,'' Williams said. ``But we  
still control our own destiny. We just have to do what we are 
capable of doing and everything else will take care of itself.''

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean  
dictator under house arrest in London, was quoted Friday as saying 
he is aware he may someday return home ``in a wooden box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chilean Sen. Hernan Larrain visited Pinochet in Britain and told  
a Santiago radio station the general was aware he faces a long 
legal battle over alleged atrocities stemming from his 17-year 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me he is prepared for all the necessary legal battles,  
but he knows that if he loses them, he might not return to Chile 
with his full mental and physical capacities,'' Larrain told Radio 
Cooperativa. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative senator spoke by telephone from London after  
visiting the general: ``He told me, without any dramatism,: `I know 
I may go back in a wooden box.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish warrant  
alleging thousands of abuses committed during his regime. His hopes 
of early release were dashed Wednesday after Britain upheld the 
start of procedures for his extradition to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people died or disappeared  
at the hands of Pinochet's secret police.

	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- The Uruguayan ambassador to Egypt has  
received death threats believed to be from Islamic groups upset 
over the arrest of a suspected Egyptian terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguayan Interior Minister Guillermo Stirling said late  
Thursday that the ambassador to Egypt received an anonymous call 
warning that an extradition request for Egyptian citizen El Said 
Hazzan Al Mokhis should not be approved. A Uruguayan federal judge

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan share prices soared for the  
second day Friday, reflecting easing political tensions after 
congressional leaders agreed to give President Hugo Chavez power to 
rule by decree on key economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary figures, the Caracas Stock Exchange's  
main index was up 8.1 percent from Thursday, when the market soared 
8.99 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, leaders of the main congressional factions told a  
presidential commission that they would approve a so-called 
``enabling law'' next week, designed to allow Chavez to reduce a 
burgeoning budget deficit of $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress had passed a similar law on March 27, but Chavez vetoed  
it, saying it didn't go far enough. Then, in comments that alarmed 
his opponents, Chavez said he would rule by decree if he didn't get 
his version of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's agreement appears to give Chavez most of what he  
wanted. He will be able to increase taxes, renegotiate the foreign 
debt and seek new credits abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, has stirred  
controversy in recent days by calling for the dissolution of 
Congress and the Supreme Court and vowing to extend his term in 
office from five to 10 years.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A military court on Friday sentenced 19  
members of a kidnapping gang to lengthy prison sentences for the 
murder of a prominent German-born gold miner and kidnapping of his 
son last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The court sentenced six Peruvian men to life in prison and 13 to  
sentences ranging from 30 to 35 years for ``aggravated terrorism.'' 
Four of those sentenced were policemen and three belonged to the 
air force. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Hochschild, the majority owner of Peru's third-largest gold  
mine Sipan, was riddled with machine gun fire in his car by men 
dressed as policemen in a wealthy Lima neighborhood 11 months ago 
after he apparently resisted a kidnapping attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	His son Eduardo, 30, who was also in the car, was kidnapped and  
released six days later after the family paid an undisclosed 
ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack set off a clamor for a crackdown on a wave of violent  
crime that had terrified Peru's wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the government of President Alberto Fujimori passed  
a law allowing some violent criminals to be tried by military 
courts used to try leftist guerrillas under the charge of 
``aggravated terrorism.'' 
</P>

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A former army liaison has been cleared for  
a second time of dozens of charges of murder, kidnapping and rape 
during the country's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Blanca Maria Chocochic Ramos announced the ruling in favor  
of Candido Noriega Estrada late Thursday night after a seven-hour 
hearing in Santa Cruz, north of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the court gave Noriega ``the benefit of the doubt''  
because prosecutors failed to fully prove his involvement and 
witnesses' testimony was inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
	Noriega, 61, was a civilian who served the Guatemalan army  
during the 1980s counterinsurgency campaign. He had been charged 
with taking part in 35 murders, 44 kidnappings, 14 rapes, 10 
robberies, seven counts of arson, 23 illegal arrests and six 
assaults.

<HEADLINE> General Mills Hikes Cereal Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios,  
Wheaties and Lucky Charms, is raising cereal prices an average 2.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase announced Friday will vary among the brands of the  
nation's second-largest cereal maker but probably will mean grocers 
will boost the retail price of Big G cereals by a nickel to a dime 
a box, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg Co., the largest cereal maker with 32 percent of the  
market based on pounds sold, raised its prices by an average of 2.7 
percent in December. Kellogg makes Rice Krispies and Frosted 
Flakes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether General Mills' move would  
lead to price increases by other cereal makers. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills, with 26 percent of the market, last increased  
prices in July 1997 -- a 2.6 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greg Zimprich, a General Mills spokesman, said that as a  
result of price fluctuations over the past six years, Big G prices 
before the latest increase were about the same as in 1993. During 
that period, the average price for food consumed at home increased 
about 3 percent annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Mills price increase came to light Thursday when an  
analyst at the BT Alex. Brown securities firm raised his rating on 
the company's stock, citing the price increase. General Mills 
confirmed the increase Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, General Mills  
stock rose 93 3/4 cents to close at $79.18 3/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimprich said General Mills has been able to increase sales and  
its share of the cereal market by developing variations of its 
popular brands despite competition from lower-priced generic 
cereals. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, General Mills announced in December that it would  
add calcium to four varieties of Cheerios to withstand competition 
from supermarket labels. 
</P>
<P>
	John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New  
York, said the price increase comes at a time when major brands are 
getting less competition from generic products. 
</P>
<P>
	Generics, which peaked at a 29 percent share of the cereal  
market in May 1998, now account for 17 percent to 18 percent, 
McMillin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're feeling a bit more comfortable with the  
inroads of generics,'' said McMillin. He said he believed General 
Mills ``will use this nickel or so a box to do a little bit more 
marketing and, hopefully, to fund some new product additions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Richard Joy of S&AMP;P Equity Group said the increase will  
help foot the bill for launching three new General Mills' brands -- 
an organic cereal called Sunrise, Honey Nut Chex and Nesquick, a 
chocolate cereal now sold only outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things don't come cheaply,'' Joy said. ``They're looking  
for some additional dollars to do that with.''

<HEADLINE> Weapons Lab Computers Back in Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Computers at the country's three  
national weapons labs were placed back on line Friday after workers 
underwent two weeks of security training. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson had ordered the shutdown April  
2 for computers involved in secure work at Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in northern New Mexico, Sandia National Laboratories in 
Albuquerque and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Security checks have escalated since reports surfaced last year  
that the Chinese government may have obtained weapons secrets from 
Los Alamos in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese-American scientist Wen Ho Lee, who was fired from the  
lab March 8, became the target of an FBI investigation in 1996. Lee 
has not been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	During the computer shutdown, labs were ordered to bolster  
security training for the employees who use them. 
</P>
<P>
	New procedures should make classified data harder to transfer to  
unauthorized areas, and make regular transfers more difficult to 
perform, DOE officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab employees ``need to understand they can't just turn on their  
computers,'' said Bruce Matthews, who heads Los Alamos' security 
response team. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos and Sandia began putting classified computers back in  
operation Friday in a process that should be finished by the middle 
of next week, spokesmen for both labs said.

<HEADLINE> Ferrari Has Record Profit in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARANELLO, Italy (AP) -- Italian luxury-car maker Ferrari more  
than doubled its pre-tax profit in 1998, boosted by record sales in 
some European countries and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said today it earned 90 billion lire ($50 million)  
before taxes in 1998, more than twice as much as in 1997. The 
results included newly-acquired Maserati. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari, which is owned by Italy's auto giant Fiat and also runs  
a renowned Formula One team, said its consolidated revenue totaled 
1.19 trillion lire ($660 million), up from 1.04 trillion lire in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, boosted by the success of the F355 model, rose for the  
fifth consecutive year to 3,637 vehicles in 1998, up from 3,581 the 
previous year. The F355 costs between 230 to 390 million lire 
($128,000 to $217,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was Ferrari's largest export market, with 818  
cars, while record sales were reported in Germany, England, Spain 
and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari Chairman Luca di Montezemolo said the success of the  
brand-new Maserati 3200 GT and Ferrari 360 Modena should have a 
positive impact on the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Mir Crew Space Walks, Experiments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Two crew members of Russia's Mir space station  
went on a space walk today to set up experiments and test tools 
designed to patch holes in the aging ship, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian cosmonaut Viktor Afanasyev and French astronaut  
Jean-Pierre Heignere were expected to spend five hours outside the 
ship during the space walk, said Vera Medvedkova, a Russian Space 
Agency spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The third crew member, Sergei Avdeyev, a Russian, was monitoring  
his crew mates from inside the Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	The patching equipment was originally designed to seal leaks in  
Mir's Spektr module, which was severely damaged when a runaway 
cargo ship slammed into it in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Spektr has never been repaired, and the tools never tested,  
because crew members at the time could not find all the module's 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Afanasyev and Heignere also planned to set up a Russian device  
to test radiation levels around the Mir, and attach various organic 
substances in special casings to the outside of the ship to see 
what happens to living matter in space, Medvedkova said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also expected to retrieve a French-made ``meteorite  
trap'' that was installed earlier this year to catch microscopic 
debris when Mir passed through a meteor shower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final part of the space walk, Heignere was to release a  
small satellite made by Russian and French schoolchildren that has 
been programmed to play a recording of their voices. If all goes 
according to plan, the recording will be heard on the Mir and at 
Mission Control, outside Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir's current three-man crew is possibly its last. If  
outside investors cannot be found to foot the 13-year-old station's 
dlrs 250 million yearly costs, the cash-strapped government may 
have to discard it in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been pressuring the government to dedicate  
itself to the International Space Station, a 16-nation project that 
has been delayed by Russia's inability to build key components on 
time.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Europe Telecom Merger Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom has reportedly entered merger  
talks with Telecom Italia, a move that could create a European 
telecommunications giant while at the same time saving the Italian 
company from a hostile takeover by Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions between the two companies' chief executives have  
entered advanced stages, the London-based Financial Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the aim of such a deal, if completed, would  
be to create a powerful European-wide operator that could compete 
globally with U.S. telecommunications giants such as AT&AMP;T and MCI 
WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Telecom Italia said today the company has been  
talking with Deutsche Telekom for some time about a possible 
alliance, as it has with other foreign counterparts like British 
Telecom and Spain's Telefonica. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rome-based spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, refused to confirm whether talks with the German company 
had reached the point of actual merger discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telecom, dismissed the  
newspaper report as ``speculation'' and refused to comment on it. 
Ehnert also refused to confirm whether Deutsche Telecom has talked 
in the past with Telecom Italia about a closer working 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't say anything more,'' he said Friday from his office  
in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia's share price rose to $10.39 in midmorning  
trading today on the Milan stock exchange, up eight cents from 
Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Frankfurt stock exchange, Deutsche Telekom shares were  
trading at $41.68, an increase of 85 cents from the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Any possible deal would likely be reached quickly, the Financial  
Times said, due to Telecom Italia's urgent need to stave off 
Olivetti's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti unveiled its $58 billion proposed bid in February, and  
later sweetened it to $65.2 billion. Telecom Italia, a former 
state-owned company, tried last Saturday to encourage its 
shareholders to approve a stock conversion plan that would have 
made a takeover far too expensive for Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	But the meeting of shareholders fell short of a quorum, making  
the situation even more urgent for Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	No one from Telecom Italia or the German-based Deutsche Telekom  
could be reached for comment late in the evening European time 
Thursday. Deutsche Telekom was quoted as telling the Financial 
Times that it ``would not take part in any speculation'' on the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Any possible deal would have to be approved by the Italian and  
German governments and the European Commission's antitrust 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal may include the German government selling its  
74 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom over a defined period and the 
German company abandoning its alliance with France Telecom, the 
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones a Hit on Witness Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jenny Jones is a hit on the witness stand, if  
not on her talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' testimony this week in the trial of a wrongful death  
lawsuit filed by the family of a man killed three days after he 
taped an episode of her talk show drew big ratings for struggling 
Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jones began her three days on the stand Monday afternoon,  
an estimated 334,000 viewers were tuned into live coverage on Court 
TV, a 350 percent increase over the cable network's normal daytime 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's ratings peak Monday was matched on Jones' final day  
of testimony Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the Louise Woodward case two years ago has Court TV  
drawn as many people to watch a live trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our viewers, this has all the elements of a terrific trial  
-- it's got sex, it's got murder and it's got a big star,'' said Art 
Bell, Court TV's executive vice president of strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers enjoyed the chance to turn the tables on a talk show  
host, listening to her forced to answer questions instead of ask 
them, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit argues that ``The Jenny Jones Show'' humiliated  
Jonathan Schmitz when it revealed his friend, Scott Amedure, had 
sexual fantasies about him. Three days after the show was taped, 
Schmitz shot Amedure to death. The show never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones could use such ratings magic for her own show. Like most  
talk shows, it's suffering: ratings this year are 20 percent lower 
than last year. ``The Jenny Jones Show'' is ranked eighth among the 
13 syndicated talk shows, said Marc Berman, a television analyst 
for Seltel, an advertising firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing is great for Court TV, though. The network is trying  
to turn itself around following a disastrous few years and needs as 
many viewers as it can get. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great week for us because it allows sampling of our  
new look,'' Bell said. ``We look a lot sharper than we did even six 
months ago.''

<HEADLINE>  Japanese Stocks Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today as the  
deteriorating Kosovo situation led to the weakening of the euro. 
Tokyo share prices rebounded in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.22 yen at late afternoon, down 0.58 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 118.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 124.50 points,  
or 0.74 percent, closing the week at 16,851.58 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed down 37.60 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar initially moved higher on  
massive buying by Japanese trust banks and life insurers, but the 
greenback met selling by foreign funds during lunchtime in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's relative weakness derived mainly from  
heavy selling of the euro against the yen by Japanese exporters and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has been under selling pressure recently because of the  
growing conflict in Yugoslavia, fears of worsening relations 
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia and signs 
of sluggish economic growth, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Kosovo situation appears to be escalating, Japanese  
investors were also trying to hedge their euro-denominated assets, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 117.43 yen and 119.20 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.20 yen, down  
from 128.27 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market rose on continued active buying from foreign  
and individual investors who have grown more optimistic about the 
economic outlook for Japan and other Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrel Whitten, strategist at ABN-Amro, said that overseas  
investors began to see ``a noticeable momentum toward economic 
recovery in the Asia region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was expectation that public and  
pension funds were allocating new funds to the stock market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was active, with about 778 million shares changing hands  
on the exchange's first section, up from Thursday's turnover of 634 
million shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 670 to 522, with 
127 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainers in Tokyo included Honda Motor Co. Its share price  
advanced after the Nihon Keizai business daily reported today that 
the automaker will build a new plant in the United States or Canada 
by 2001. Honda's stocks finished at $44.83 per share, up $1.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Yuzuru Matsuno denied the report, saying his  
company had made no decision to build another North American plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda has two factories in North America -- one in the United  
States and one in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 5.10 points, or 0.38 percent, to 
1,343.03. The TOPIX closed down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.605 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.575 percent, 
pushing its price down to 101.70 yen from 101.97 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Japanese Stocks Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today as the  
deteriorating Kosovo situation led to the weakening of the euro. 
Tokyo share prices rebounded in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.22 yen at late afternoon, down 0.58 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 118.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 124.50 points,  
or 0.74 percent, closing the week at 16,851.58 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed down 37.60 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar initially moved higher on  
massive buying by Japanese trust banks and life insurers, but the 
greenback met selling by foreign funds during lunchtime in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's relative weakness derived mainly from  
heavy selling of the euro against the yen by Japanese exporters and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has been under selling pressure recently because of the  
growing conflict in Yugoslavia, fears of worsening relations 
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia and signs 
of sluggish economic growth, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Kosovo situation appears to be escalating, Japanese  
investors were also trying to hedge their euro-denominated assets, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 117.43 yen and 119.20 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.20 yen, down  
from 128.27 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market rose on continued active buying from foreign  
and individual investors who have grown more optimistic about the 
economic outlook for Japan and other Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrel Whitten, strategist at ABN-Amro, said that overseas  
investors began to see ``a noticeable momentum toward economic 
recovery in the Asia region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was expectation that public and  
pension funds were allocating new funds to the stock market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was active, with about 778 million shares changing hands  
on the exchange's first section, up from Thursday's turnover of 634 
million shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 670 to 522, with 
127 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainers in Tokyo included Honda Motor Co. Its share price  
advanced after the Nihon Keizai business daily reported today that 
the automaker will build a new plant in the United States or Canada 
by 2001. Honda's stocks finished at $44.83 per share, up $1.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Yuzuru Matsuno denied the report, saying his  
company had made no decision to build another North American plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda has two factories in North America -- one in the United  
States and one in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 5.10 points, or 0.38 percent, to 
1,343.03. The TOPIX closed down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.605 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.575 percent, 
pushing its price down to 101.70 yen from 101.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Foreman Discusses Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONWAY, Ark. (AP) -- The jury foreman in the Susan McDougal trial  
says he was put off by the ``arrogance'' of Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors and felt the testimony of Starr's deputy was evasive. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Thomas also said in an interview that as jurors in the  
monthlong trial deliberated over Mrs. McDougal's defense that she 
was mistreated by prosecutors, there was ``yelling and screaming 
and one lady even looked like she was coming to tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors acquitted President Clinton's former Whitewater  
business partner on the charge of obstruction of justice and 
deadlocked on two counts of criminal contempt for her refusal to 
testify before two grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal evoked some sympathy by crying and enduring five  
days of questions on the witness stand, Thomas said. But emotions 
toward Mrs. McDougal or Starr's office played no role in deciding 
the charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said they want to interview the jurors before  
deciding whether to seek a retrial on the two criminal contempt 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said testimony from other witnesses -- especially Julie  
Hiatt Steele, who like Mrs. McDougal was charged with obstructing 
Starr's probe -- convinced some jurors that Mrs. McDougal's fears 
about testifying to a grand jury were justified. Mrs. McDougal said 
she thought she'd be charged with perjury unless she falsely 
implicated the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fear by itself, I don't think is innocent, but after listening  
to some testimony from other witnesses, that once again kind of 
backed up what she was fearing,'' said Thomas, a supervisor at a 
chair and table manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much did I think Kenneth Starr was trying to get  
Mrs. McDougal to lie, it's just that some witnesses backed up Mrs. 
McDougal's story'' that Starr's office ``was trying to get her to 
say something that was not true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the performances in court, the foreman said  
representatives of Independent Counsel Starr displayed ``a certain 
amount of arrogance,'' saying prosecutors ``showed more anger or 
displeasure from things that went on than the defense did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said prosecutor Hickman Ewing's testimony struck him as  
``evasive'' because his answers ``were like a paragraph long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of hard to pick out where the answer to the  
question really lied,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing testified that he drafted and circulated inside the office  
a proposed indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton and that he told 
colleagues he would have graded her at ``about an `F''' for her 
July 1996 Whitewater testimony because she said ```I don't recall' 
about 50 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas also said prosecutor Ray Jahn's testimony about  
``developing a witness'' gave the impression Starr's office used 
heavy-handed tactics to lead people into saying things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought you developed an antidote or vaccine, or something  
like that,'' Thomas said. ``I didn't know that you had to develop a 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But juror Angela Smith, who wanted to convict on all counts,  
said she saw no evidence Starr's team acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't see a lot that would indicate to me that he was  
trying to get her to lie,'' Smith said earlier this week. ``Every 
piece of paper they showed said they were seeking truthful 
testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A juror who wanted to acquit on all counts, Becky Boeckmann,  
said Friday she doubted Mrs. McDougal knows anything of value. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the prosecutors, Ms. Boeckmann said, ``I don't know if harass  
is a good word. I think they wanted information from her, but I 
don't think she had the information to give to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the obstruction charge on which Mrs. McDougal was  
acquitted initially was 11-1, but changed to 12-0 after a 
half-hour, the foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	On one of the criminal contempt charges, jurors first voted 8-4  
to acquit Mrs. McDougal for refusing to testify in 1996. A later 
vote was 7-5 to acquit, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second count, for refusing to testify in 1998, jurors  
voted 6-5 to acquit, with one person uncertain, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge told the jury that contempt had to be committed  
``willfully,'' which was defined as ``voluntarily and 
intentionally, and not by accident, mistake or other innocent 
reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and others focused on ``innocent reason,'' deciding that  
Mrs. McDougal's fear of testifying was genuine, strong and 
supported by others who had encountered Starr's investigators.

<HEADLINE> Couple Arrested for Shut-In Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A couple allegedly shuttered their four  
children from the world by forbidding them from going outside the 
family home. Three of the children can only speak broken English 
and used their own language to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward and Lucinda Sizemore each pleaded innocent on Thursday to  
four counts of non-support of a dependent, a misdemeanor. They were 
ordered held on $10,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said they had seen the couple's four children -- ages  
4, 8, 11 and 17 -- only a few times since the Sizemores moved to 
suburban Harrison Township from Kentucky about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't allowed to go outside,'' said Della Lewis, an  
aunt now caring for the children. ``Their mom told them if they 
went outside and people saw them not being in school, she'd get in 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis went to the Sizemore's bright blue, one-story home in late  
January after Sizemore's eldest child mailed a note to another aunt 
in an apparent plea for help. Lewis lived nearby but said she 
hadn't seen the family in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities removed the children Jan. 29. and the parents were  
arrested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The children do not seem to have been physically abused, Lewis  
said. The eldest child can easily converse with others, but the 
youngest three communicate with themselves through their own 
primitive language, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gibberish,'' she said. ``They can understand each other,  
and they can understand what you're saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the children told her their father worked two jobs  
but their mother often locked herself away in her room. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me they would sit around and play cards, draw,''  
Lewis said. ``They're pretty good at drawing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer appointed to Sizemore said Friday he is beginning to  
learn about the children's treatment. ``The goal is to treat 
everyone fairly and not prejudge,'' Frank Malocu said. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Lucinda Sizemore did not return a telephone  
message. The Sizemores declined a request for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Murphy, a neighbor, said she tried repeatedly to introduce  
herself to the Sizemores but the door was never answered. She 
recalled seeing the three younger children only a few times, once 
in their yard last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kind of snuck outside through the back door,'' Murphy  
said. ``They saw me there and made a beeline back into the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said the 17-year-old child ``acted and talked liked  
everything was just normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Child welfare authorities began investigating the Sizemores in  
1996. But the probe was cut short when the parents told authorities 
the family was moving back to Kentucky, said Ann Stevens, a 
spokeswoman from the Montgomery County Children's Services Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said the children were apparently all born at home and  
lacked birth certificates. She said the family did not emphasize 
education and apparently was unwilling to seek help.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at 10,493.89, Another High / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors continued to unload technology stocks  
in favor of blue-chip industrial companies Friday, sending the Dow 
Jones industrial average to its fifth straight closing high. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn in technology stocks, which have been pummeled  
throughout the week, left broader market indicators lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 31.17 to 10,493.89, having set closing records  
every day this week. The last time the blue-chip index pulled off 
that feat was March 16 through 20 of last year. The record is 12 
consecutive closing highs from Jan. 5 through 20 of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	For the five days, the Dow rose 320.05, giving it a 661-point  
gain over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow advanced Friday despite a brutal drop in IBM, which  
tumbled along with other technology stocks and lopped more than 30 
points off the Dow's gain. IBM shed 7 3/8 to 170 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for IBM, the Dow would be higher,'' said Arthur  
Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. ``It seems like tech 
is poison, and everything economically sensitive is golden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast to IBM, household appliance maker Whirlpool, which  
has long been in the shadow of the more glamorous technology 
sector, advanced 5 3/8 to 59 13/16 on Friday after the company soundly 
beat analysts' first-quarter earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were inclined to take this week's gains in the Dow  
more seriously because unlike in previous weeks, when the Dow 
components would often rise but leave the rest of the market 
behind, advancers had a strong 2-to-1 lead over decliners on the 
New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated volume was very heavy on the Big Board, at 1.2  
billion shares and just over 1 billion in Nasdaq trading, setting 
an all-time high for the week for Nasdaq action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted in  
technology issues, fell 37.73 to 2,484.04. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 fell 3.86 to 1,319.00 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was helped higher by Kodak, up 6 7/16 at 73, after the  
photographic equipment maker reported stronger-than-expected 
earnings. It was also pulled higher by two big industrial firms, 
Caterpillar, up 2 at 63 13/16; and General Motors, up 1 3/8 at 87 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks climbed as oil futures topped $17 a barrel. Dow  
component Chevron rose 3 1/16 at 98 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks fell once more on earnings concerns. Leading  
the decline was Sun Microsystems, which fell 5 1/2 to 54 15/16 in 
leading Nasdaq volume. The creator of the popular Java programming 
language reported earnings that topped analysts' expectations but 
issued a warning about its future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com was one bright spot on the technology horizon. The  
online bookseller's shares soared 22 3/4 to 190 after Donaldson Lufkin 
&AMP; Jenrette analyst Jamie Kiggen raised his investment rating and 
price target on the stock. Kiggen said Amazon is likely to be ``one 
of two or three consumer auction sites that wind up dominating the 
enormous consumer auction catagory'' on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But other Internet stocks were sharply lower. America Online  
shed 1 5/8 to 142 1/4 in leading volume on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the volatility Friday was the expiration of June  
stock-index options and future positions, known as ``double 
witching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While big-company shares slid under formidable selling pressure,  
the shares of smaller-company stocks did better. The NYSE composite 
index rose 2.01 to 624.90, and the American Stock Exchange 
composite index rose 7.48 to 745.41. The Russell 2000 index of 
smaller companies rose 3.84 to 421.58. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei index in Tokyo rose 0.74  
percent. European bourses were weaker, with the DAX in Frankfurt 
sliding 0.50 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London losing 0.45 percent, 
and the CAC in Paris easing 0.23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Aussie C. W Optus Wants AAPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus Ltd.,  
Australia's No. 2 telecommunications company, said Friday it will 
make a $952 million ($1.5 billion Australian dollars) takeover bid 
for the industry's third-largest provider, AAPT Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer of $3.17 a share, which matches AAPT's closing share  
price Friday, is conditional on C&AMP;W Optus securing at least 90 
percent of its target AAPT's shares and various regulatory 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	C&AMP;W Optus said it bought a 10.6 percent stake in AAPT earlier  
Friday, largely explaining the heavy trade of nearly 48 million 
shares in that stock. 
</P>
<P>
	C&AMP;W Optus, which is 53 percent owned by Britain's Cable &AMP;  
Wireless PLC, expects to send out formal takeover offer documents 
in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Anderson, C&AMP;W Optus' chief executive, said the two  
businesses are ``highly complementary,'' and should be able to 
offer highly competitive prices locally and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson told reporters in a telephone conference call that  
acquiring AAPT would help C&AMP;W Optus widen the delivery of services 
to rural Australia and small businesses, an area of concern to the 
Australian Competition &AMP; Consumer Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission Chairman Allan Fels said the ACCC will be  
investigating the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	AAPT Chief Financial Officer Tony Rogge said the company will  
need to consider its options in light of the bid, but declined to 
indicate whether he thought the offer was favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	The AAPT board is meeting Monday to consider the offer.

<HEADLINE> IRS Moves To Fire Whistleblower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jennifer Long was a star witness, the first  
IRS agent to tell Congress about abuse of taxpayers without hiding 
her identity, and now steps are being taken to fire her despite 
years of strong performance ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax agency's commissioner is promising an investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Long, a revenue agent in Houston for 16 years, said she believes  
the action is retaliation for her fall 1997 testimony before the 
Senate Finance Committee. She acknowledges, however, that she went 
public then in part because of grievances against her Internal 
Revenue Service managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are enraged,'' Long said in a telephone interview Friday.  
``They feel like I've betrayed the code of silence by testifying 
before Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long said she was abruptly summoned away from an audit Thursday  
-- coincidentally, the same day Americans rushed to file their tax 
returns -- to a meeting with her superiors. She was handed a 13-page 
memo describing her alleged poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very upsetting. It was done in a very threatening  
way,'' she said. ``It's clear that the conclusion has already been 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours after word began circulating Friday in Washington  
about the action, Long said she was again summoned by her superiors 
and given a terse one-page notice stating that the earlier memo was 
``withdrawn until further notice.'' But Long said her bosses told 
her verbally that it would likely be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just trying to fool somebody,'' she said of the second  
memo. ``This way they'll have the opportunity to tell everybody 
they rescinded it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti assured  
senators at a hearing that ``we will take action'' if retaliation 
against whistleblowers is substantiated. Some lawmakers expressed 
skepticism that reforms intended to make the IRS less heavy-handed 
will take hold with field managers who resist change. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said Friday he was ``extremely disturbed that we may  
have taken an action that could be retaliatory'' and sent Deputy 
Commissioner Bob Wenzel to Houston to review the case. In addition, 
the Treasury Department's tax inspector general will investigate, 
Rossotti said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not tolerate retaliation against employees who come  
forward to testify before the Senate Finance Committee or who come 
forward to report allegations of wrongdoing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said he was  
outraged by the action against Long and will focus on the Houston 
district office in future hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear example of how some in the IRS's old  
management culture are using their power to destroy people, like 
Jennifer, who are trying to make the IRS a better place,'' Roth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, a  
Republican who represents part of Houston, called the action 
``completely and inexcusably wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matter comes to light just as Rossotti is winning wide  
praise for his efforts to make the IRS less secretive, more 
responsive to taxpayers and more efficient. Rep. Rob Portman, 
R-Ohio, who co-chaired an IRS reform commission, said situations 
such as Long's raise questions about the long-term viability of the 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about changing the culture of a 100,000-employee  
bureaucracy that has been locked into an enforcement mentality,'' 
said Portman. ``This concerns me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo to Long from IRS Houston district manager Karie L.  
Gulley says Long's performance was judged ``unacceptable'' in June 
1998, only a few months after she told Congress openly about how 
agents are held to numeric enforcement quotas that often result in 
violation of taxpayer rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Other IRS agents had testified behind a dark cloak and with  
their voices electronically modified. ``She was the turning 
point,'' said Roth aide Bill Nixon. ``She was the critical 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1993 through 1997, Long consistently got ``fully  
successful'' performance ratings, according to personnel records 
she provided. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo, however, says Long's work ``remains unacceptable'' and  
gives her 68 days to improve or face dismissal. It lists numerous 
specific examples of how she allegedly failed to prioritize her 
audits, didn't use her time wisely, made incomplete work plans and 
sometimes did not gather sufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will have the opportunity to demonstrate that you can  
perform at least the minimally successful level,'' Gulley's memo 
states. ``I will be monitoring your performance closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to Long, that means she will surely fail. ``They're just  
going to ride me and make sure I don't have time to do things,'' 
she said. ``I will not be given a chance to improve.''

<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- TV retailer Home Shopping Network  
Inc. has agreed to pay the government $1.1 million to settle 
charges it made unsubstantiated claims while peddling acne cures, 
diet pills and other health and beauty products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday asked a federal judge  
in Jacksonville to approve the settlement and order the cable 
network to obey a previous government directive to back 
health-related product claims with ``competent and reliable 
scientific evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agreeing to the penalty is not an admission of guilt. But the  
St. Petersburg-based network said it has increased efforts to 
ensure compliance with the order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to do better,'' said David Ender, a company  
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC scrutinized several of the network's ads aired between  
1996 and 1998, including one that claimed a skin-care product would 
``clear anyone's acne and razor bumps on men's skin.'' 
Investigators said the network could not substantiate the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the FTC went after the network over advertising claims  
for a line of sprays touted to help consumers stop smoking and 
recover from hangovers, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said an exuberant celebrity host was to blame, and  
settled the case by agreeing not to make more unsubstantiated 
claims.

<HEADLINE> Nomo's Outing Set Back by Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hideo Nomo will have to wait at least a  
day to make his first appearance in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was scheduled to pitch in the Iowa Cubs' home opener  
against Las Vegas on Friday night, but the game was snowed out. 
Nearly two inches of snow fell on Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo will pitch on Saturday night instead.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday's game will be made up Sunday as part of a doubleheader.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs have said they will evaluate Nomo after three  
starts and decide whether to call him up or release him. Nomo, 30, 
the 1995 National League Rookie of the Year, was signed by the Cubs 
this spring after being released by the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo won his first start with the Iowa Cubs, giving up three  
earned runs and six hits in five innings in a 10-5 victory over 
Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Twice-Daily HIV Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved another treatment  
choice for patients with the AIDS virus Friday, a protease 
inhibitor called amprenavir. 
</P>
<P>
	Amprenavir, sold under the brand name Agenerase, is taken in  
combination with other AIDS medications. It comes in capsule form 
for adults -- eight capsules twice a day -- and a liquid formulation 
for children 4 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	It can be taken with or without food, but should never be taken  
with a high-fat meal because the fat content can decrease 
absorption of the drug, the Food and Drug Administration said in 
approving amprenavir. 
</P>
<P>
	Protease inhibitors are a class of AIDS medicines that, when  
taken with other types of AIDS drugs, can significantly improve 
patients' health. Amprenavir is the fifth protease inhibitor on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In six-month studies, amprenavir lowered levels of HIV, the AIDS  
virus, in patients' blood and increased their levels of vital 
immune cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and rash.  
The FDA warned that in about 1 percent of patients, amprenavir also 
can cause severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in which painful blisters line the mouth, 
genital region and eyes. As with similar AIDS drugs, doctors also 
must be careful to avoid dangerous interactions when prescribing 
amprenavir with other medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovered by Vertex Pharmaceuticals but manufactured by Glaxo  
Wellcome Inc., the wholesale price will be $6,132 a year.

<HEADLINE> Teen-Age Cuban Player Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Beverly Hills sports agent said Friday he  
has helped a 17-year-old baseball player defect from Cuba in an 
attempt to snag a lucrative contract for the young star. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Pena, a catcher with the Cuban Junior League, defected  
Thursday while visiting Venezuela for a tournament, agent Gus 
Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in contact with his parents, and they fully support  
this,'' Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez, who has previous Cuban defectors as clients,  
described Pena as ``the top prospect in Cuban baseball outside 
their national team.'' He would not say where Pena was taken or 
reveal specifics about the defection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to protect other (Cuban) players,'' he said. ``You  
never know if they would like to do the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez said the player is seeking asylum in an undisclosed  
country because he would have been subject to the June amateur 
draft if he became a U.S. resident. Amateur players are considered 
free agents if they do not reside in the United States or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's amateur sports establishment has seen a wave of  
defections by athletes hoping to compete as professionals abroad. 
Cuban officials condemned the defections as a strategy by Cuba's 
enemies to undermine its communist system. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional sports are banned in Cuba. Top athletes are given  
favored treatment, but salaries run about $10 a month and living 
standards pale beside those of millionaire athletes abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's national team is scheduled to play the Orioles in  
Baltimore next month.

<HEADLINE> Gun-Control Challenge Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court rejected on Friday a  
police organization's challenge to a gun-control law that forbids 
anyone convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor, including 
police officers, to own a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous ruling by three judges of the U.S. Court of  
Appeals for the District of Columbia affirms a District Court 
summary rejection of the suit by the Fraternal Order of Police. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue were amendments to the 1968 Gun Control Act. In 1996,  
the prohibition against gun ownership or possession by convicted 
felons was extended to anyone ever convicted of a misdemeanor for 
domestic violence. The old felony-conviction prohibition had 
exempted police officers from the ban, but the new misdemeanor 
provision did not. As a result, some police officers who had 
committed domestic violence misdemeanors were fired after being 
stripped of their guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for Judges A. Raymond Randolph and Douglas H. Ginsburg,  
Judge Stephen F. Williams wrote that there is no fundamental right 
to possess a gun in a community service job and that the FOP had 
presented no evidence that officers who lost their jobs because of 
the law were denied due process. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, the same three judges had reinstated the FOP  
lawsuit on grounds that the amendments irrationally imposed a 
heavier penalty on police officers who committed domestic abuse 
misdemeanors than on those who committed felonies. This time 
Williams acknowledged the Justice Department's argument that 
Congress did not need to end the exemption for police officers who 
committed felonies because most police departments won't hire 
felons. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for victims of domestic violence have praised the  
amendment. Some law enforcement groups have argued that it is 
unfair and unconstitutional.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Waive Dennis Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's seven-week career with the  
Los Angeles Lakers has come to an abrupt end -- no big surprise 
considering his recent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman reacted to being released Thursday night by calling  
himself a scapegoat for the team's problems, and said the Lakers 
were ``cowards not to take the fall for some of the things that 
have happened this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers issued a statement saying they were finished with  
Rodman in the wake of another in a long list of incidents involving 
the eccentric forward earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate to win their first NBA title since 1988, the Lakers  
figured Rodman, a member of five championship teams,including the 
last three with the Chicago Bulls, was just what they needed to put 
them over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final game, they bottomed out, losing 113-86 at Portland  
on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't the last straw. That apparently occurred when  
Rodman, according to coach Kurt Rambis, showed up late for the 
team's practice at Los Angeles Southwest College on Thursday 
morning, and was slow getting ready because he couldn't find his 
socks and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis later told reporters he told Rodman to go home, and said  
the team was through with its special treatment of the NBA's 
leading rebounder in each of the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time we feel it's in the best interests of the Lakers  
to end the relationship,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West said in 
the statement issued Thursday night. ``This obviously didn't work 
out like we had hoped, but we would like to thank Dennis for the 
contributions he did make to the team and wish him the best of luck 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 next month, signed with the Lakers on Feb.  
23 and played his first game three days later. He averaged 2.1 
points, 11.2 rebounds and 28.6 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won their first 11 games with Rodman in uniform, but  
were 6-6 since that time with him playing. They are 8-9 without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman told Fox Sports News late Thursday night that the Lakers  
``have to have a fall guy, and I'm basically the fall guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people will criticize my attitude and my dedication  
to the game of basketball, but, you know, it doesn't surprise me,'' 
he said. ``I didn't really miss practices. Today, I didn't miss 
practice. Today, he (Rambis) asked me, `Do you need treatment?' I 
was there 10 minutes early before practice, and he told me to take 
the day off and all of a sudden I'm like, great, you know? 
</P>
<P>
	``... I wanted to come here and win and play here. It didn't  
turn out that way. I don't know what I'm going to do right know. 
It's one of those deals. If they want to make me the fall guy, I 
will be the fall guy. I don't expect anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman did say he wanted to apologize to fans in Los Angeles,  
adding, ``I hope that they don't look at me as a bad individual. I 
hope I'm still loved by people here in the state of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman also said he would consider playing for another team this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on if somebody wants to take a chance on having a  
guy like me on a team that can win a championship, I will go and 
play with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After reportedly refusing to return to a game in the fourth  
quarter on March 12 because his right elbow was sore, Rodman was 
late to practice the following day, and when he did show up, he 
said he needed time off to deal with personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed four games before returning eight days later for a  
nationally televised game in Orlando. While he was gone, he was 
spotted gambling in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's paid leave of absence perhaps stemmed from problems  
with his wife, actress Carmen Electra, although he denied that upon 
his return. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rodman and Electra announced jointly April 6 they had  
filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rambis, Rodman also refused to return to games in  
the fourth quarter on March 26 and last Friday, saying his muscles 
had tightened up. He was late for practice the following day both 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman didn't play in the second half in Portland on Tuesday  
night, claiming he had an injured elbow. He had four rebounds in 13 
minutes before being taken out with 2:31 left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers didn't practice Wednesday, setting the stage for  
Thursday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to know the truth? I was shocked when they put him on  
their team,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said after his team beat the 
Los Angeles Clippers 103-89 Thursday night for its ninth straight 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, who beat the Lakers in the Western Conference finals  
last spring, will attempt to extend the winning streak against the 
Lakers on Saturday night in a nationally televised game at the 
Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I heard, Jerry West didn't have much to do with it  
(bringing Rodman in),'' Sloan said. ``I understand someone else 
wanted him, so they got him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan was referring to Lakers owner Jerry Buss.  
</P>
<P>
	Clippers guard Sherman Douglas said the Lakers knew what they  
were getting when they signed Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did you expect? Did he do anything differently than he  
did before? No,'' Douglas said. ``He used to miss practice, he used 
to irritate people, still does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the Lakers weren't ready for that. That's why they got  
rid of him, plain and simple.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Shanghai Vie for Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- American children often beg their parents to  
bring them to Disneyland and developers hope that more Asian 
children will soon do the same -- as both Hong Kong and Shanghai vie 
to become the next Asian city with a Disney theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong is in talks with Walt Disney Co. about building a park  
here. In Shanghai, which hopes someday to unseat Hong Kong as 
China's financial center, the mayor is publicly clamoring for a 
Disney park. 
</P>
<P>
	The race to get Disney underscores a long-standing rivalry  
between the two cities. Although it remains unclear whether Disney 
is taking a serious look at Shanghai, Mayor Xu Kuangdi has some 
powerful allies in Beijing, which can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Chinese leaders from Premier Zhu Rongji down are pushing  
Disney to locate in Shanghai and build a smaller park in Hong Kong, 
according to a source familiar with Disney's China operations. The 
source spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Zhu called on Disney chairman Michael Eisner during his  
recent tour of the United States, it's unclear whether they talked 
about Shanghai or Hong Kong or both. 
</P>
<P>
	For China, engaging Disney marks a dramatic change from just  
three years ago, when officials threatened to rein in its business 
over a film about the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner clearly has his eyes on China, where he has predicted  
millions of people will ``love Mickey no less than Big Mac.'' But 
not all things Disney may succeed here. ``Mulan,'' an 
uncontroversial animated tale of a legendary Chinese heroine, was 
recently released in China but reportedly drew far fewer fans than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts warn that it will take more than just fans for any  
Disney park to succeed among the Chinese. The fans also have to be 
able to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about trying to attract fairly poor people to  
an expensive place,'' said Andy Xie, an economist with Morgan 
Stanley in Hong Kong. Xie estimates a mainland Chinese family of 
three would have to spend about $700 -- half a respectable yearly 
salary -- for a quick visit to a Hong Kong Disneyland. Incomes in 
Hong Kong, a prosperous former British colony, are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shanghai boosters say a park there could lure 9 million  
visitors a year, and Hong Kong talks about 5 million, Disney will 
focus on the right mix of financing, available land and government 
approval, said Christopher Dixon, New York-based entertainment 
analyst for PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that if they build a theme park, people  
will come,'' Dixon said. The trick is to make money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Disney won't say whether it's talking with Shanghai,  
the same stance the company took for months as rumors swirled about 
a park in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman John Dreyer wouldn't rule out a Shanghai  
Disneyland. ``There's no reason why we can't have a park in 
Shanghai as well as Hong Kong,'' Dreyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials refuse to discuss Shanghai's intentions,  
though they hope to have their own Disney deal in hand by June, a 
prospect that has become the talk of the town as Hong Kong 
struggles through recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the choice of Hong Kong and Shanghai, many analysts  
say Hong Kong's better infrastructure, communications and skilled 
workers make it a better choice. 
</P>
<P>
	While the popularity of Disney might seem a good bet in Hong  
Kong, where people line up and get into fights over special edition 
Winnie the Poohs and Snoopy figurines, local critics worry Disney 
might drive too hard a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, says he'll kill  
any deal that's bad for Hong Kong, though specifics on talks have 
been closely guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Property analysts predict Hong Kong will either have to give  
away the land -- a site on outlying Lantau Island near the new 
airport is under discussion -- or sell it cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
	Luring other Asians could be tricky. Japanese already have a  
Disneyland in Tokyo, and southeast Asians are suffering through 
serious economic crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Chinese theme parks have had a rough ride. Most are  
expensive and located far outside urban areas, making them hard to 
get to in a society with few cars. Profits have been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	One Chinese theme park executive, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said the market was ``not good,'' though he acknowledged 
that Disney might be able to offer something new.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Triples Loss Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second largest automaker,  
expects to report a loss of 35 billion yen, or $296 million, for 
the fiscal year that ended March 31 because of a sharp drop in 
domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss of that magnitude would be more than three times Nissan's  
previous estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled carmaker also plans to omit a dividend payment for  
the first time since the public listing of its shares in 1951. It 
had previously planned to pay a dividend of 5 yen, or 4 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deterioration in domestic sales was worse than expected,  
forcing us to suspend our dividend payments,'' said Nissan 
President Yoshikazu Hanawa, adding that annual production capacity 
would be slashed 25 percent to 1.5 million vehicles by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan projected that sales for the parent company would total  
3.32 trillion yen, or $28.1 billion, for the fiscal year that ended 
on March 31, down from an earlier forecast of 3.40 trillion yen. 
</P>
<P>
	It expects unit sales of 874,000 vehicles, compared to 974,000  
in the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault SA of France, which bought a 36.8 percent stake in  
Nissan last month, said in Paris on Friday that the Japanese 
automaker's downward earnings revision was ``in the range of 
estimates'' it had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault agreed to pay $5.4 billion for its stake.  
</P>
<P>
	Nissan chief Hanawa said he hoped to use the cash infusion from  
Renault to help pay off its massive debt load. Hanawa also said he 
does not plan to resign this year, citing his responsibility to 
oversee the alliance with Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Nissan reversed an initial forecast that it would  
break even, instead predicting a parent company net loss of 10 
billion yen for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal 1997, the company posted a net profit of 16.6 billion  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	At the group level, which includes the parent and subsidiaries,  
Nissan left its fiscal-1998 forecast unchanged at a net loss of 30 
billion yen, or $254 million, on sales of 6.4 trillion yen, or 
$54.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said its North American and European operations are each  
expected to post a net profit of 5 billion yen, or $42 million, in 
fiscal 1998. But its Mexican operations will probably report a 10 
billion yen, or $85 million, loss as a result of a weakening in the 
peso.

<HEADLINE> King Kong Poster Goes For $244,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The granddaughter of movie director Cecil B.  
DeMille paid $244,500 on Friday for a rare 1933 movie poster of 
King Kong, Sotheby's auction house said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecilia Presley plans to donate the poster to the Academy of  
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I see these rare, vintage posters and artworks come up,  
rather than losing them I wanted to keep them in Hollywood,'' Ms. 
Presley said. ``It's just natural that the academy and I have come 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Presley owns one of the largest personal collections of  
movie memorabilia in the world, and said the King Kong posters are 
among her favorites. The price she paid at Sotheby's Friday was the 
second highest ever paid at auction for a movie poster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy,'' a 1932 movie poster, holds the record. It sold  
for $453,500 at a Sotheby's auction in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Kong poster, which shows the magnificent movie ape  
perched atop a New York skyscraper holding Fay Wray in one palm and 
crunching an airplane in another, sold well above its expected 
auction price of $100,000 to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	An anonymous buyer purchased the 1934 ``Three Little Pigskins''  
poster from The Three Stooges' first year at Columbia Studios for 
$96,000, Sotheby's spokesman Matthew Weigman said. The poster, 
which had a pre-sale estimate of $50,000 to $70,000, shows the 
Stooges holding a then unknown actress, whom the world later came 
to know as Lucille Ball. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1929 Babe Ruth poster titled ``Play Ball'' -- the only known  
surviving copy -- was sold to another anonymous buyer for $96,000, 
Weigman said. 
</P>
<P>
	All prices include a 15 percent buyer's premium on sales up to  
$50,000 and 10 percent for anything above that.

<HEADLINE> Florida Fires Destroy Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- All that was left today of Marilyn  
Nieves' neighborhood was a few charred refrigerators and water 
heaters. And all that was left of her bedroom were a few 
still-smoldering embers and one item -- a charred angel figurine 
from her goddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``See, look at that. There's nothing,'' said Nieves, 34, using a  
plumbing pipe to stir around the ashes. ``I don't know whether it's 
just a, something from God, I don't know. .. I don't understand how 
it occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 60 homes in this sun-baked eastern Florida community  
were damaged by the fire Thursday. Police Lt. Steve Claus said at 
least 48 were destroyed. About 500 people were forced to seek 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas of the rain-starved state, about 280 people were  
forced out of their homes by fires that burned some 6,000 acres in 
central and southwestern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths or serious injuries were reported. Authorities were  
still worried about hot spots today -- the fire had been considered 
out late Wednesday, but flared as it was fanned by winds gusting to 
30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials say that without any significant rain, conditions  
are ripe for a repeat of last summer's blazes that scorched 500,000 
acres and forced 100,000 residents from their homes. Drought-like 
conditions have already prompted an emergency declaration from the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Port St. Lucie, with a population of nearly 80,000, is home to  
many retirees and the New York Mets spring training camp. It is 105 
miles southeast of Orlando on Florida's Treasure Coast, a stretch 
of the state's Atlantic coast where sunken ships with gold have 
been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it was contained, the fire here charred 2,400 acres as it  
moved toward an area with about 200 homes, state emergency 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 homes lost power and authorities kept watch for  
looters. Some people, who were forced from their homes, were 
escorted back into their neighborhoods early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki Roenbeck was one of many residents gathered at a roadblock  
just before midnight hoping to get back to their homes. She had 
just arrived from work, where she had watched news reports of 
burning homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get to my house,'' Ms. Roenbeck, 36, pleaded  
with a deputy, her voice shaking. ``My husband called me at 4 
o'clock and that's the last I've heard from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dee Braley, 29, was sitting on her car smoking a cigarette,  
waiting for permission to go to her home just a street away. Hours 
earlier, she had refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came by one time and told me I had to evacuate and I just  
stayed,'' she said. ``And then they came back and said, `Ma'am, 
you'll have to go now or we'll have to physically remove you.' I 
didn't feel like arguing with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She gathered a bag with insurance papers and clothes before  
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even sure if they're matched,'' Ms. Braley said.  
``When I walked outside it was hard to breathe. It was like a black 
fog. It burned your eyes and you could feel it in your chest.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Frets About Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
expressed concern today that Americans are losing faith in the 
benefits of free trade. He said efforts to pursue protectionism 
will end up being ``unwise and surely self-defeating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion of international trade has been one of the most  
impressive developments of the last half-century and one that has 
greatly benefited the United States, Greenspan said in remarks at a 
conference in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is overwhelmingly persuasive that the massive  
increase in world competition -- a consequence of broadening trade 
flows -- has fostered markedly higher standards of living for almost 
all countries who have participated,'' Greenspan said in the 
speech, copies of which were made available in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this increased competition from a global marketplace has  
forced companies to develop better goods and services at lower 
costs, thus improving living standards. But in this process, 
companies in industries that fail to remain competitive often 
increase political pressure to erect protectionist barriers.

<HEADLINE> Chretien Thanks The Great No. 99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Text of Prime Minister Jean Chretien's remarks  
about Wayne Gretzky's retirement: 
</P>
<P>
	I had an opportunity to speak to him yesterday (Thursday). And  
though I did my best to dissuade him, it was clear that he was at 
peace with the decision he was about to make. After years of doing 
everything that was asked of him and more -- on the ice and off -- no 
one can begrudge him the desire to have some time for himself and 
his fine young family. 
</P>
<P>
	This is truly a bittersweet moment. One of the greatest players  
ever to play our national game has decided to hang up his skates. 
No longer will our arenas be energized by his presence and 
electrified by his performance. No longer will we be able to thrill 
in anticipation of his next wondrous play. 
</P>
<P>
	But we can take heart from the endless, magical memories he has  
given us. Most of all, we can feel reassured that his example of 
decency and sportsmanship will continue to inspire generations of 
young hockey players -- and all young Canadians -- for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Aline joins me in wishing Wayne, Janet and the whole Gretzky  
family all the happiness in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	And on behalf of all Canadians, I say: Thanks for the memories.

<HEADLINE> Russians Back Yugoslavia Link-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's hard-line parliament voted overwhelmingly  
today in favor of a resolution that supports Yugoslavia's bid to 
join a Slavic union that includes Russia and Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russian leaders have cautioned that it would take  
months to work out the details of Yugoslavia's accession to the 
union. And Moscow has stressed that it has no plans to send either 
weapons or troops to Yugoslavia to help counter NATO's daily 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move reflected the widespread Russian sympathy for  
Yugoslavia and its fierce opposition to the NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's lower house voted 293-54 in support of the  
nonbinding resolution. Eager to receive military support from 
Russia, Yugoslavia's parliament took similar action last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Russian hard-liners want Moscow to provide weapons to  
Yugoslavia in violation of an international arms embargo, but 
President Boris Yeltsin repeatedly has said Russia will not become 
involved militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The union would involve wide-ranging political and economic ties  
and could include such measures as a single currency and a unified 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The union ``is a political initiative put forward to end the  
war,'' Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of 
parliament, said in the Siberian city Novosibirsk. If the three 
states are united, they ``cannot be brushed aside by the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and Belarus negotiated for months before signing the  
union treaty two years ago, and it has produced few practical 
results. Both countries are too poor at present to provide any real 
assistance to the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's liberal Yabloko faction voted against the resolution,  
saying it ``opens the possibility for military confrontation 
between the leading nuclear powers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to NATO's bombing, Yabloko said ``the worst thing  
Russia can do today is to respond to insanity with insanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had hoped Russia could pressure its Yugoslav  
ally to accept a political solution. But Russia apparently lacks 
sufficient power or influence with either side to achieve a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Moscow has made a cease-fire a condition of any  
negotiations. NATO has said it won't stop airstrikes until Yugoslav 
forces pull out of Kosovo and meet other demands.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Ponder Fine Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilot union plans to appeal a  
massive $45 million judgment imposed by a court as punishment for a 
sickout that crippled the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judgment stands, it would wipe out the Allied Pilots  
Association, which has $38 million in a reserve fund. While the 
ruling is on appeal at the 5th Circuit Court in New Orleans, the 
union will have to keep $20 million on deposit with the federal 
court in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Joe Kendall said he would stay his  
order for 15 days to allow the union the chance to file an appeal. 
Union officials said late Thursday that they would file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	As the union prepares to makes its appeal, one thing not on the  
table is another sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The restraining order initially ignored by the union is in  
effect until May 10 and the union intends to obey, said APA 
President Rich LaVoy. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy assured the 9,500 pilots at American that the union will  
be able to continue on with its daily business even with a fine of 
this magnitude. No layoffs are expected at the union's Fort Worth 
headquarters and bankruptcy has not yet been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a long way from that. Understand that would require the  
exhaustion of the appeals' process and I think it's way 
premature,'' said APA spokesman Gregg Overman. ``The fact is we can 
function quite effectively off of our dues revenue which is wholly 
separate from the reserve fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve fund was started in the 1960s with excess dues  
payments. Over the decades, it has been utilized infrequently if 
union expenses exceeded income. It doesn't pay for day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cash reserve. It has grown substantially over the past  
several years in part due to more aggressive management and the 
strong performance of the equities market,'' said Overman. 
</P>
<P>
	The union will have to consider now whether it will increase the  
1 percent of salary dues that each pilot's pays each year to give 
itself some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like that is certainly possible, but contract  
negotiations don't begin again for a couple of years,'' said 
Overman. 
</P>
<P>
	The last dues increase was a temporary one, to 1.5 percent,  
during bargaining in 1997. That contract resulted in a disagreement 
with management and a minutes-long strike halted by President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Jenkins, executive director of the Aviation Institute at  
George Washington University, said the damages award, which will go 
directly to AMR Corp., parent company of American Airlines, is 
second only to a $64 million fine against the United Mine Workers 
of American in the mid-1980s. That fine was overturned by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins, who has written three books on airline bankruptcies,  
said he believes the damage award will severely hamper the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if the fine is ultimately held up, the union will have  
to declare bankruptcy to have any viability at all. Even so, they'd 
have virtually no assets left,'' he said. ``This has to be probably 
for a union one of the most embarrassing things that has ever 
happened. Quite frankly they looked silly in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	APA had argued this week that the airline had suffered far less  
than the $50 million the company estimated during the two-day 
contempt period. Kendall didn't accept the union's arguments and 
fined the pilots for ignoring his order to return to their cockpits 
during the February sickout which resulted in the cancellation of 
nearly 6,700 flights and hundreds of thousands of stranded 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pay for what you break ... whether you can afford to pay  
it or not,'' Kendall told the union on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall ordered APA, which already had deposited $10 million  
with the court, to deposit another $10 million by Monday afternoon. 
He also told lawyers to brief him on whether the union, LaVoy and 
union vice president Brian Mayhew should each be liable for the sum 
jointly. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for AMR said there is no comment on how the  
company plans to use the money.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox recalled Creighton Gubanich  
from Pawtucket of the International League on Friday and activated 
designated hitter Reggie Jefferson from the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room, first baseman Brian Daubach was optioned to  
Pawtucket. Boston had been a played short after catcher Scott 
Hatteberg was placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday night 
because of an inflamed right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston also moved left-hander Brian Barkley from the 15-day DL  
to the 60-day DL. training game because of back problems. He then 
played six games on an injury rehabilitation assignment, three with 
Single-A Sarasota and three with Triple-A Pawtucket. He was hitless 
in 10 at-bats for Pawtucket.

<HEADLINE> Georgia O'Keeffe Exhibit To Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For some artists beauty is in the landscape.  
Others specialize in portraits. Georgia O'Keeffe, America's 
best-known female painter, found her inspiration in ``things,'' -- 
the sensuous fold of a flower, the stark, dry bones of an animal, a 
black door. 
</P>
<P>
	An exhibit opening Saturday uses 69 paintings to try to explain  
the why and how of her work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillips Collection, the first U.S. museum to buy an  
O'Keeffe, more than 70 years ago, calls its show ``The Poetry of 
Things.'' Later the paintings, and some of the things themselves -- 
photos, vases, animal bones -- will visit the Georgia O'Keeffe 
Museum in Santa Fe, N.M., and two other museums in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Painting still life is an old tradition and O'Keeffe won her  
first prize at 21 with a more or less traditional picture of a dead 
rabbit and a copper pot. 
</P>
<P>
	But she moved a long way from that in the rest of her 98 years.  
</P>
<P>
	For a while, she did abstract pictures -- lines, colors and forms  
with mysterious titles like ``Special XVII.'' O'Keeffe could be 
impatient with critics of that work. 
</P>
<P>
	A thing is just a thing, she explained, and has no artistic  
value until an artist expresses it in form, line and -- of prime 
importance to her -- color. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is less real than realism,'' she wrote. ``Details are  
confusing. It is only by selection, by elimination, by emphasis 
that we get at the real meaning of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She moved to painting flowers -- hugely magnified flowers,  
``yard-wide lilies'' said one critic. Mexican artist Miguel 
Covarrubias caricatured her as ``Our Lady of the Lily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the early 1920s, Sigmund Freud was riding a wave of  
popularity and many people saw sexual images in the depths of 
OKeeffe's flowers. She was impatient with that, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if it is children and love in paint?'' she asked one  
critic. ``There it is color, form, rhythm. What does it matter if 
its origin is emotional or aesthetic?'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Keeffe was married to photographer Alfred Stieglitz for 22  
years, until he died in 1946. They had no children. Biographers 
have traced several lovers for both of them, of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
	She made her first visit to New Mexico in 1929, became  
fascinated by the cattle bones in the arid landscape and soon 
afterward shipped a barrel of them back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year I was here,'' she explained later in a film  
made about her, ``because there were no flowers, so I started 
picking up bones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bones do not symbolize death to me. They are shapes that I  
enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Keeffe was 53 when she bought her first house in New Mexico --  
Ghost Ranch. Five years later, she bought another at Abiquiu and 
they became her permanent homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bought the place because it had the door in the patio,'' she  
said later of Abiquiu. ``I'm always trying to paint that door -- I 
never quite get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She kept trying for the next 14 years, producing about 30  
versions. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Keeffe gave up painting at 84 when her sight was almost gone.  
She later tried pottery and returned to painting with help from an 
assistant. Georgia Totto O'Keeffe died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	----------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Georgia O'Keeffe: The Poetry of Things,'' will be at the  
Philips Collection through July 19. Admission for adults is $12.50, 
plus $4.25 for telephone orders. It will be at the Georgia O'Keeffe 
Museum, Santa Fe, N.M, Aug. 7-Oct. 17; Dallas Museum of Art, 
Dallas, Nov. 7, 1999-Jan. 30, 2000; and the California Palace of 
the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, Feb. 19-May 14.

<HEADLINE> Army Candidate Elected in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Abdelaziz Bouteflika, seen as the choice  
of Algeria's powerful military to run the country, was declared the 
winner today of a presidential race in which all six other 
contenders pulled out to protest fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika, 63, a former foreign minister, was elected with 73.8  
percent of the vote, the Interior Ministry announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	For months he had been considered the likely winner of  
Thursday's election, and his victory became certain after all other 
candidates withdrew on the eve of voting. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bouteflika assured of victory, the only remaining questions  
had been whether he would accept the post as Algeria's first 
civilian president in more than three decades -- and whether critics 
would quietly submit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika had said he would not take the job without a massive  
turnout and a large majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Ministry set the participation rate at 60.3 percent  
-- below the 75 percent turnout in the 1995 presidential race, but 
still high for an election whose drawing card had been the broad 
choice of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	One of six candidates who withdrew from the election said in a  
newspaper interview published in France today that voter turnout 
was lower than officially reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to my sources, voter participation was very low in  
large cities, as well as in mountainous regions,'' Mouloud 
Hamrouche was quoted as saying in the French daily Le Figaro. ``The 
numbers given by officials are, in my opinion, incorrect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamrouche said he would not recognize Bouteflika's election as  
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The government insisted the voting had been free and fair.  
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Abdelmalek Sellal complained that since the  
North African nation gained independence in 1962 ``all we've heard 
is fraud, fraud, fraud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the vote ``normal, regular, and clearly transparent,''  
and said he regretted the withdrawal of the six candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The six candidates who pulled out remained officially in the  
running, with ballots bearing their pictures lined up beside 
Bouteflika's. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming in second was a former foreign and education minister,  
Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, who had broad support including that of the 
banned Islamic Salvation Front. He garnered 12.5 percent of the 
vote. In a surprise showing, an Islamic candidate, Abdallah 
Djaballah, scored nearly 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Liamine Zeroual, a retired general stepping down 18  
months before the end of his five-year term, had warned that the 
action of the six was ``very dangerous'' and ordered voting to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Thursday night, the six candidates who  
pulled out called for calm, and ``reserved the possibility of 
taking any initiative to bring about a true democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Front for Socialist Forces, the party of Hocine Ait Ahmed,  
one of the candidates who withdrew, called for protest marches 
today in the capital and around Algeria. The marches were not 
authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation has been working to surmount an Islamic insurgency  
triggered by a 1992 election debacle, when voting was aborted by 
the army as the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front party was on 
the verge of winning. The move triggered an Islamic uprising and a 
cycle of violence that has left about 75,000 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately-owned daily El Watan criticized Zeroual for  
allowing the election to take place. 
</P>
<P>
	For critics, Bouteflika, foreign minister in the 1970s under  
President Houari Boumediene, is a throwback to a despised system 
run by generals and a ruling caste drawn from the National 
Liberation Front, the party that controlled Algeria for nearly 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika's critics claim he will perpetuate that system,  
blamed for squandering the resources of this nation rich in oil and 
natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Sent Mlicki, Rojas to Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers made the anticipated  
trade of Dave Mlicki on Friday, sending the right-handed starter to 
the Detroit Tigers along with right-handed reliever Mel Rojas for 
three minor league pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers will receive right-handers Robinson Checo and Aposto  
Garcia and left-hander Richard Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers also announced that right-handed reliever Antonio  
Osuna has been activated from the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Osuna will be in uniform for the Dodgers in San Diego this  
weekend, as will Checo, who was 0-0 in two appearances for 
Detroit's Triple-A affiliate in Toledo this season. He didn't allow 
an earned run in five innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Mlicki was 0-1 with a 4.91 ERA in two relief appearances for the  
Dodgers this season. He was 8-7 with a 4.57 ERA and three complete 
games in 30 starts for the New York Mets and Dodgers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mlicki was 7-3 with a 4.05 ERA for the Dodgers in 20 starts  
after being acquired in a trade along with pitcher Greg McMichael 
for pitchers Hideo Nomo and Brad Clontz on June 4, but entered this 
season as the odd man out in the Los Angeles rotation, so a trade 
had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Rojas was 0-0 with a 12.60 ERA in five  
appearances this year. He was 5-2 with a 6.05 ERA in 50 appearances 
for the Mets last season. The Dodgers acquired Rojas from the Mets 
for infielder-outfielder Bobby Bonilla on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Osuna threw two scoreless innings in his third rehabilitation  
appearance for Single-A San Bernardino on Thursday night in 
Lancaster. He was placed on the disabled list March 29 because of 
right elbow soreness. He had a 7-1 record with a 3.06 ERA in 54 
relief appearances for Los Angeles last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia will report to the Dodgers' Double-A affiliate in San  
Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, 19, is expected to report to the Dodgers' Single-A  
affiliate in Vero Beach, Fla.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A panel of experts gave the media low marks  
for its coverage of religion, and suggested on Friday that news 
about religion is far more important than editors think. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of San Francisco's well-known  
Glide Memorial Church, was hardest on the press, giving the 
national media a D for its coverage and San Francisco's coverage a 
C. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams told a group at the American Society of Newspaper  
Editors' annual convention that recent reports he planned to retire 
``got more attention than major issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to make the paper,'' he added, ``we have to be a  
phenomenon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Warren, senior pastor of the Saddleback Valley Community  
Church in Lake Forest, was more charitable with his local papers, 
giving them a B to B-plus. And he cited some major national 
newspapers -- The Dallas Morning News and the Atlanta Constitution, 
among others -- as examples of newspapers ``doing serious coverage 
of religious issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a resurgence of interest in religion coverage  
and a proliferation of so-called ``faith and values'' sections,'' 
said Mark Silk, director of the Center for the Study of Religion in 
Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Silk said a problem with such special sections is that,  
especially in the case of smaller papers, it can put a strain on 
the staff and generally is printed earlier than the rest of the 
paper, so the stories are usually features, not hard news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coverage is based on a misunderstanding of what the public  
wants in religious coverage,'' Silk said. ``People want to see 
religious coverage. Most people, even very religious people, get 
their news from newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren suggested that newspapers need to realize there is an  
enormous market for religious news. ``More people go to church than 
go to sporting events,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He displayed a collection of magazine covers dealing with  
religious issues, and asked why the publications, including Time, 
Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report, put religious stories out 
front. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer? ``It sells magazines,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Derby Winner Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Oaklawn Park officials asked state  
racing authorities Thursday to investigate whether jockey Billy 
Patin used an electrical device to make his horse run faster when 
it won the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol had not won in two outings before last Saturday's  
$500,000 Arkansas Derby and was a 30-1 shot when the horses left 
the gate. He paid $62.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn President Charles J. Cella told a hastily called meeting  
of the state Racing Commission that he wanted the commission to 
investigate. He said an employee found a device on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the commission to order the track to suspend  
distribution of the purse to the owner of the winner and to Patin. 
He said the commission's racing stewards, who left Oaklawn shortly 
after the meet ended Saturday, should be brought back together so 
they can investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted unanimously to go along with both requests.  
When the motion to suspend the purse came up for a vote, Cella 
intervened to make certain the purse suspension applied to the 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella also said that, if the commission decides the rules of  
racing were violated, ``those involved should be dealt with in the 
appropriate and severe manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Valhol owner James D. Jackson of Rockdale, Texas, said he was  
``absolutely distraught'' about the situation. He told The 
Sentinel-Record in Hot Springs that legal action would be ``very 
shortly under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He denied use of an electrical device by the trainer or jockey.  
He also said the first he heard about the investigation was from 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, at a Grand Prairie, Texas, motel for the races at Lone  
Star Park, called the investigation a ``witch hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patin was scheduled to ride Dixie Gem in Thursday night's second  
race at Lone Star Park, but he was not available and replaced on 
the horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swear to God that I never did that,'' Patin, 36, told the  
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Patin rides primarily in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't take the win away from the horse,'' said Keen, the  
leading trainer at Lone Star Park since it opened in 1997. ``The 
horse won it legit, won it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've claimed horses before that I could tell somebody had  
raked them with a machine or something. They had marks on them. 
This horse doesn't have a mark on him anywhere like a horse that 
had been plugged in or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol won the Arkansas Derby by 4 1/2 lengths.  
</P>
<P>
	The first-place check for the race was to be $300,000.  
Withholding those earnings would put Valhol's status in question 
for the May 1 Kentucky Derby. If there are more than 20 3-year-olds 
entered at Louisville, preference goes to the top 20 in graded 
money earned. The Arkansas Derby is a Grade II race and the 
first-place check would easily qualify Valhol for a spot in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing Commission Chairman Cecil Alexander said he hoped the  
situation would be resolved before the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella said Oaklawn officials first became aware of possible  
irregularities in the running of the Arkansas Derby shortly after 
the race was declared official. 
</P>
<P>
	``We immediately informed the stewards and the local  
Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau -- the investigative branch of 
the thoroughbred racing industry,'' Cella said. ``By Monday night 
and Tuesday, Oaklawn management uncovered additional evidence 
regarding the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence also was turned over to the national office of the  
TRPB in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parties have concurred that the evidence is substantial  
enough to warrant further investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said an Oaklawn employee found an electronic device on  
the racetrack sometime after the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen it and I think, at this time, it's best for us  
to not comment,'' Alexander said. ``All the evidence will come out 
at a later time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed about the evidence, Alexander said the commission had  
been aware of Oaklawn's investigation for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to have hard cold facts to start an investigation,'' he  
said. ``If we did not feel there was an infraction, we would not be 
having this meeting today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Valhol stayed just off the right flank of  
pacesetter Saint's Honor and then moved to the lead in the far 
turn. He quickly opened his advantage to four lengths. Patin used 
his whip on Valhol twice at the eighth pole and twice more at the 
sixteenth pole.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Activate Leading Scorer Smith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve Smith, the leading scorer for the  
struggling Atlanta Hawks, was activated from the injured list 
Friday and started against the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, averaging 18.6 points, has spent two stints on the  
injured list this season with knee injuries. The latest came after 
he sprained his left knee April 1 in a collision with New Jersey 
forward Keith Van Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks went 4-4 while Smith was sidelined, but they had lost  
four of five prior to Friday's game. Atlanta has struggled 
offensively, ranking next-to-last in the NBA with an average of 
85.5 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, Smith missed six games with a sprained  
right knee.

</P>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Is the Great One gone? It sure looks that  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Gretzky, fighting back tears, told a jam-packed news  
conference Thursday night his decision to retire was all but final. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are obviously pointing in that direction,''  
Gretzky said after helping the New York Rangers earn a 2-2 tie with 
the playoff-bound Ottawa Senators. ``I'm really at peace in my mind 
about this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, wearing gray slacks and an open-neck white dress shirt,  
frequently had to stop for breath as he told reporters how hard it 
will be to finally skate out of hockey and into the history books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this for a long time,'' he said,  
knowledging the rumors that have picked up steam as the Rangers -- 
out of the playoffs -- head toward their final game Sunday against 
Pittsburgh in New York. ``But I didn't want to be disruptive to the 
team during the playoff drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not once during the 45-minute news conference did Gretzky ever  
use the ``R'' word. Still, everything he did pointed to Gretzky 
leaving the game at the end of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless a miracle happens between now and Saturday, I'll  
probably make it official,'' Gretzky said. ``It's not official 
right now. It's not 99 percent official. When I make the decision, 
it will be 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, someone's cell phone rang off to the side of the  
podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell 'em I still haven't decided,'' Gretzky said quickly,  
finally laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said he would meet again this morning with James Dolan,  
president and CEO of Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden 
and the Rangers, who will add his voice to those asking the player 
to stay for a 21st NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting the Rangers were expected to set a time for a  
news conference this afternoon. And Gretzky is expected to announce 
his decision then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once he gives us the `go' sign, we'll be ready,'' Jeff  
Schwartzenberg, a Ranges public relations assistant, said of 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	If Thursday night was Gretzky's final game in Canada, it was  
some farewell party. The 18,449 fans lucky enough to score a ticket 
to the Corel Center saw to that. 
</P>
<P>
	With 4:43 left in the third period and the scored tied 2-2, the  
fans began to chant ``One more year'' as the teams headed to their 
benches for a TV timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the place went crazy as the screen on the scoreboard  
hanging over center ice began replaying Gretzky highlights, listing 
all his championships and many of his offensive records -- all to 
the music of Carly Simon's ``Nobody Does it Better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camera in the stadium also picked up one banner that read:  
``Thanks, Mr. Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky raised his stick and waved at the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I was 16 years old and playing for $21 a  
week,'' Gretzky said. ``And the fans in Ottawa gave me ovations 
then, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, the arena spotlight picked up Gretzky as he  
skated from the New York net to the boards in front of the Rangers' 
bench. As he leaned there smiling, all the Ottawa players skated 
over and one by one shook his hand. The Rangers, in a semicircle, 
tapped their sticks on the ice in a salute to the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's wife, Janet, was crying in the stands as her husband  
was announced as the game's only star, and the building erupted in 
more cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa fans weren't finished with their lovefest. They  
remained on their feet, cheering and applauding until Gretzky came 
out for a curtain call. He circled the ice, waved, smiled and 
headed down the tunnel toward the dressing room again. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't nearly enough. The fans continued to cheer for 10 more  
minutes until Gretzky, this time without any pads under his 
sweater, came out for a second curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume started building during warmups before the game  
between Gretzky's Rangers and the Senators at the Corel Centre. 
Then, the crowd roared when his name was announced in the starting 
lineup moments before the Canadian national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who has been bothered by injuries this season, skated  
23 shifts. He played 23 minutes, 9 seconds, but took only two 
shots, none during the five-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the Wayne Gretzky of 1988,'' he said. ``I still think  
I can contribute. But it's an 82-game grind. Teams in this league 
play hard every night. I'm thinking about those 82 games next year, 
no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators took a 1-0 lead on Nelson Emerson's goal with 55  
seconds left in the first period, but even that didn't produce the 
buzz the Great One did every time he stepped on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a great roar of anticipation at 7:36 of the third  
period when Gretzky fed a beautiful lead pass to John MacLean 
streaking in on Ottawa goaltender Damian Rhodes. But the roar 
turned to a moan when MacLean missed the shot and a chance for 
Gretzky to add to his point total had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky will retire as the NHL's all-time leading scorer. In  
1,486 games, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 2,856 
points. He was named the league's most valuable player nine times 
and led the league in scoring 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Leetch and Adam Graves also scored for New York. Ottawa's  
Marian Hossa tied it with 6:48 left in the third.

Gretzky to add to his point total had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky will retire as the NHL's all-time leading scorer. In  
1,486 games, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 2,856 
points. He was named the league's most valuable player nine times 
and led the league in scoring 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Leetch and Adam Graves also scored for New York. Ottawa's  
Marian Hossa tied it with 6:48 left in the third.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Seek Reserve Call-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is preparing to ask that 33,000  
reserve forces be activated to serve in the Balkans and President 
Clinton is likely to approve the request, government officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The call-up request is likely to be presented to the president  
early next week. It will call for volunteers in maintenance and 
support personnel, mostly from the Air National Guard to handle 
duties such as refueling and aircraft servicing. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. official, who insisted on anonymity, said he did not know  
how long the activated personnel would serve. ``The request has not 
come to him (Clinton), but the Pentagon is making plans for it,'' 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said Clinton is likely to approve the call-up,  
which would be the biggest since more than 200,000 reservists were 
activated during the Persian Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reassures Serbian-Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. (AP) -- As the Kosovo conflict  
escalates, President Clinton is reaching out to Serbian-Americans, 
assuring them that the NATO airstrikes are aimed at weakening 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and not directed at the Serb 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quarrel is not with Serbs in Serbia, it is not with Serbs  
in Kosovo and it is not with Serbian-Americans,'' Clinton said 
Friday. ``It is with a leadership that believes it is all right to 
kill people and to uproot them and to destroy their family records 
and to erase any record of their presence in a land simply because 
of their ethnic heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also has asked Serbian-Americans who oppose the  
NATO airstrikes for help in aiding Albanian Kosovar refugees both 
inside and outside the war-torn province. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unannounced session Wednesday, he met at the White House  
with Serbian-Americans to explain administration policy and seek 
their help in the humanitarian relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president used the occasion to convey to them what we were  
trying to accomplish; that our quarrel was with Milosevic and what 
he was doing in his campaign of ethnic cleansing,'' said a White 
House official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences with the administration, the  
Serbian-Americans agreed to use their influence with the Greek 
Orthodox and Serbian Orthodox churches and the Greek government to 
support both Kosovar Albanians and Serbians displaced by the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Obrad Kesic, a Balkans analyst and businessman who led the  
delegation, said a Greek delegation in Belgrade was already urging 
Yugoslav officials to allow relief organizations and the Greek and 
Serbian Orthodox churches to ship supplies to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed that we would do everything we could,'' said Kesic,  
who said there are more than a million Americans of Serbian 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's discussion with the group occurred when he dropped by  
a meeting between National Security Council official Jim Steinberg 
and seven Serbian-American leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spent Friday raising $1.3 million at two events  
for congressional Democrats and meeting with military personnel at 
bases in Michigan and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan,  
Clinton met with 50 volunteer reservists with the 927th Air 
Refueling Wing who were preparing to fly to France to support the 
NATO campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He also spent 10 minutes with the family of Army Sgt.  
Christopher Stone, one of three soldiers being held by Serb forces. 
Clinton told Stone's stepmother, father and two sisters ``our 
prayers are with you and we will do our best to bring him home 
safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his visit to the Detroit area, Clinton flew to Hanscom Air  
Force Base to meet briefly with base personnel before attending a 
fund-raiser in nearby Weston, Mass. Attendees at the $800,000 
affair pooled $25,000 to send to the refugee relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The camps in Albania are teeming, tiny Macedonia with its own  
ethnic difficulties to deal with, trying to preserve its democracy 
is deeply strained,'' the president said, thanking the guests. ``We 
need all the help we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Hanscom, Clinton was received warmly by a crowd of about  
1,000 people in a hangar draped with state and service flags. He 
said he hoped they understood the NATO mission, which is aimed at 
stopping ethnic cleansing of the Kosovars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is doing its best to guarantee that for  
ourselves, and for our friends, and for friends of freedom all 
around the world,'' he told the troops. ``And you make it 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's trip marked a return to the campaign trail. He  
canceled a fund-raising swing through Western states at the outset 
of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes in their 
fourth week, administration officials said he was returning to 
normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an unusual moment for me to be here,'' Clinton  
acknowledged at one stop in Michigan, ``but a very important moment 
for Americans to re-examine what it means to be a good citizen on 
the edge of a new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cast the day's fund raising as a key part of participatory  
democracy. ``I'm here because I care about my country's future,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Hotels Worry Over Fuel Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hotel officials on Kauai, the lush Garden Isle  
of the Hawaiian chain, are worried that a grounded fishing vessel 
is sinking efforts to restore the tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a hit,'' grumbled Ron Romano, who doesn't have  
to look far for the wreckage of the Van Loi. It's right in front of 
the Kauai Coconut Beach Resort he manages. 
</P>
<P>
	He and others fear the 16,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled by  
the 95-foot ship will cause greater damage to the island's No. 1 
industry than to its environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Guests at several hotels are complaining about fumes and debris  
from Saturday's accident. Some were moved to rooms away from the 
ocean, but others left. The exodus continued Thursday. Romano 
estimated that he's lost at least five rooms daily from his 
312-room resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipwrecks don't have to be such a downer. Last month,  
sightseers flocked to Waldport, Ore., to see the rusty, oil-laden 
bow of the New Carissa after it nosed ashore. There were T-shirts 
for rubber-necking visitors, motels were full and it actually cost 
money to park. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been no such shipwreck popularity here, and local  
officials fear any negative publicity will stunt efforts to return 
tourism to levels enjoyed before Hurricane Iniki decimated the 
island in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Hawaii has been mired in an economic malaise since 1991  
and preliminary estimates said the state received 6.8 million 
visitors in 1998, a 1.6 percent drop from 1997. Tourism is an $11 
billion industry in Hawaii, generating about a quarter of the 
state's tax revenue and a third of its jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Coconut Beach and the nearby 200-room Islander on the  
Beach have written letters to guests detailing the situation and 
telling them not to go in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotels also tell guests that this isn't the Exxon Valdez.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they panic, we lose them all,'' Islander general manager  
Hakim Ouansafi said. ``The first `Oh, no' is for the environment 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second concern is trying to let the people who saved for  
five years to come over here know that it's an unusual accident 
that could happen anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kauai is about 100 miles northwest of Honolulu. The island -- the  
beautiful backdrop to such movies as ``South Pacific'' and 
``Jurassic Park'' -- had slightly more than 1 million visitors last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kauai Visitors Bureau hopes to attract 1.1 million this year  
with the addition of direct flights from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hopes are people will pick up the phone and call and say,  
`I was coming in two weeks. Is this affecting the entire island or 
is it just an isolated area?''' executive director Sue Kanoho said, 
adding that her answer will be ``isolated area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear is they won't call and they'll book their trip to  
Maui.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Van Loi grounded Saturday on its way to Midway Island to  
catch swordfish. The vessel broke up after relentless pounding by 
12-foot waves and strong winds that kept the Coast Guard from 
unloading the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the vessel was in four pieces, with all except the  
stern drifting toward shore. The accident occurred about 250 yards 
out in shallow water popular for snorkeling and diving. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard still is working with vessel owner Vincent  
Nguyen of Honolulu to remove the wreckage. Fuel-soaked Styrofoam, 
wood planks and life preservers have been found, but there have 
been no traces of diesel found in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	About four miles of beach have been closed since Sunday but the  
state was expected to reopen them by this weekend. Authorities 
believe most of the fuel has dissipated, though a state marine 
biologist said diesel can damage coral and marine invertebrates, 
including urchins and sea cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews also are trying to find near-invisible fishing lines that  
drifted from the grounded vessel. Those lines contain thousands of 
hooks that may attract endangered Hawaiian monk seals and sea 
turtles living near the reef. 
</P>
<P>
	There is an upside: the vessel held about 500 boxes of frozen  
squid bait and suspicions are that the seals and sharks have eaten 
it.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mayor Faces More Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- This city's former mayor was charged  
Friday with eight additional counts of sexual misconduct involving 
children, bringing to 22 the charges he faces in a scandal that led 
to his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest charges -- all misdemeanors -- accuse Gerald ``Ajax''  
Ackerman of seven counts of indecent exposure and one count of 
furnishing obscene materials to a minor, St. Clair County 
Prosecutor Mona Sayed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman already faced 14 charges, including 11 counts of sexual  
misconduct, two counts of production of child abusive material and 
one count of indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	The original charges involve Ackerman's alleged misconduct with  
four girls, ages 9, 11 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Capt. Brian Moeller said at least seven additional  
victims were identified. He wouldn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman was arrested April 6 after two parents came forward  
with allegations of misconduct. He resigned his mayoral post 
shortly after his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorcycle-riding Ackerman was elected mayor in November  
1997. A former drug addict and alcoholic who sported a ponytail and 
leather duds, he used the story of his struggle to help other 
addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened up Clear Choices, a counseling center for adults and  
children.

<HEADLINE> Senate Committee Writes About Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Today's issue of the journal Science  
carries an article on the Year 2000 computer glitch under the 
byline of Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want scientists to understand that they, along with the  
general population, need to be concerned about this,'' Bennett 
said. ``So I am delighted that a new outlet has decided it's 
significant to call attention to their readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett acknowledges the article was ghostwritten by the staff  
of the Senate Y2K Committee, which he chairs. The commentary is 
sort of a list of who's been good and bad in preparing for Jan. 1, 
2000, when many old computers with a two-digit dating system will 
wrongly conclude it is the 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dire effects are predicted in developing countries. ... The  
fears of stockpilers and survivalists in some countries are not 
totally unfounded: There exists the likelihood of regional economic 
and civil unrest in regions already experiencing political 
instability, runaway inflation and food and supply shortages,'' the 
article says. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the most part, Y2K ``is far from the end of the world,''  
although ``exploited by fear-mongers and profiteers, the problem 
has spawned a cottage industry preying on fears that `the end is 
nigh,' '' the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with the glitch will cost an estimated $1.5 trillion  
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The commentary said the healthcare industry ``is one of the  
worst prepared for Y2K and carries the greatest potential for 
harm'' if heart defibrillators, respirators and other critical 
devices fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Also lagging are the oil industry, education, agriculture, food  
processing, construction and, in general, small and medium 
businesses, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's telecommunications system ``is one of the most  
Y2K-vulnerable systems,'' the article said. While 95 percent of 
phone systems will be fixed in time, ``there is no industrywide 
effort to test data networks, cellular and satellite communications 
systems or the nation's 1,400 regional telecom carriers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Y2K preparations vary substantially, with Social  
Security well-prepared but the Pentagon and Medicare lagging 
behind, the article said. Meanwhile, ``many state and local 
governments are not prepared to deliver critical services such as 
benefit payments, responses to 911 calls and emergency services,'' 
it said.

<HEADLINE> Is Rodman a Hollywood Has-Been? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is Dennis Rodman a Hollywood has-been?  
</P>
<P>
	Since he came to town 23 basketball games ago, he's rallied  
crowds to a frenzy, split with Carmen Electra, dyed his hair twice, 
got a side job as a burger pitchman and put sports writers on 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at practice Thursday, he said he lost his shoes and socks.  
Coach Kurt Rambis sent him home, and the Los Angeles Lakers later 
cut him from the team. How will the rebounder rebound? 
</P>
<P>
	He already has one offer in Los Angeles -- a liaison to rap  
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Hills-based Death Row Records, the label for such  
rappers as the late Tupac Shakur, has offered him a job in their 
artist relations department, spokeswoman Trece Tiburcio said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to have Dennis be a part of our company,'' she  
told The AP. ``We have had contact with his agency. Our artists 
seem to relate to Dennis. It would be a perfect match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if that falls through?  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe wrestling,'' laughed Willie Blair as he swept a sidewalk  
Friday at a downtown YMCA. ``I mean, I love Rodman, but he just 
seemed like he was bored. Maybe he won too many championships. He 
has just done it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling, though, may not want him.  
</P>
<P>
	The Worm has already battled foes in the ring such as Karl  
Malone and Hulk Hogan. But last year, he sued World Championship 
Wrestling, saying he was owed millions of dollars from his matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrie Spillane, a Los Angeles talent agent who specializes in  
turning shame into fame, said disgrace seems to benefit Rodman. The 
Lakers or no, the eccentric Rodman has built up enough capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hardly out of a spotlight. He'll get another job,'' said  
Spillane, who has represented clients such as Joey Buttafuoco, 
Tanya Harding and John Wayne Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television movies would pick Rodman up in an instant,'' she  
said. ``He could have a job with them this afternoon. The problem 
is, will he show up?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One place he won't show is in advertisements for the Carl's Jr.  
fast-food chain. It had twice benched the player's commercial for 
their Super Star hamburger, citing his bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants began re-broadcasting the 2-year-old commercials  
only two weeks ago, saying Rodman's ``local player'' status in Los 
Angeles had once again made him marketable. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, officials from the chain's parent company,  
Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants Inc., said no more commercials would 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he is no longer a Laker, we don't have the desire to  
use the commercial again,'' spokeswoman Suzi Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has so far not speculated on his plans. But he has said  
the Lakers made him a scapegoat for the team's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his supporters agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Wanda Vazquez, a Lakers fan visiting from Boston, said anybody  
who wants to work with Rodman should tolerate his quirks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People like him. They like his hair, they like watching him,''  
she said in the lobby of the Bonaventure Hotel. ``He brought life 
to the team and he fits in well, if you let him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone will miss Rodman, it will likely be headline writers  
who marked his firing with phrases like ``Late Worm Gets Hook,'' 
``Lakers De-Wormed'' and ``Lakers, Rodman divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around Chicago, where he won three championship rings with the  
Bulls, the headline in the Daily Southtown of suburban Tinely Park 
read ``Lakers to Rodman: No shoes, no socks, no practice -- and no 
more patience.''

<HEADLINE> Reagan Kin Seeks Alzheimer's Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing her father's foresight, Maureen Reagan  
urged lawmakers Thursday to spend more money on research into the 
disease responsible for the former president's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Ronald Reagan had the foresight in September 1983 to  
issue a presidential proclamation that drew national attention to 
the Alzheimer's disease that now afflicts him. She also asked a 
House Appropriations subcommittee to fund the research he believed 
was so vital. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was moved to do this, in large part, because this  
relatively unknown disease had stricken 4 million people, yet most 
Americans had never heard of it,'' said Ms. Reagan, who testified 
on behalf of the Alzheimer's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The proclamation stated that the disease deserved special  
attention because of its devastating emotional, financial and 
social consequence, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a testament to his vision, he went on to state that,  
'research is the only hope for victims and families,'' Ms. Reagan 
added, urging the panel that funds health studies to spend an 
additional $100 million on Alzheimer's research next year.

<HEADLINE>  Algeria Presidential Race Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Protests broke out in the Algerian  
capital Friday after Abdelaziz Bouteflika was declared president in 
an election so besmirched by fraud charges that his competitors 
quit the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes erupted following the announcement that Bouteflika had  
won Thursday's election, when police charged a gathering in 
downtown Algiers by several hundred supporters of the six other 
presidential candidates who withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police with bullet-proof shields stood guard along the  
route as demonstrators marched and a water cannon was at the ready 
in a main square. Police arrested at least 10 people, and there 
were unconfirmed reports that several people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Bouteflika, considered a favorite of the army,  
took 73 percent of the vote and that turnout was 60.25 percent of 
eligible voters. His six opponents withdrew on the eve of 
elections, claiming massive fraud in early voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The election had been seen as a first step towards healing the  
wounds caused when the army aborted 1992 legislative elections to 
prevent a Muslim fundamentalist party from winning. Outrage at that 
move fueled an Islamic insurgency that has since left 75,000 dead 
and traumatized the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the vote resulted in bitter divisions.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Algerian people have expressed themselves and elected me  
democratically,'' Bouteflika said in a statement. ``I commit myself 
to being the president of all Algerians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, his former opponents said they considered Bouteflika  
``devoid of constitutional legitimacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, his strongest rival in the race, said both  
the official turnout and results were false. 
</P>
<P>
	``The democratic process has taken a severe hit,'' he said in a  
statement. ``The nation is living a new crisis of constitutional 
legitimacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahimi was backed by the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front,  
the party that had been poised to win the 1992 election until the 
military halted voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States expressed disappointment in the election.  
</P>
<P>
	``The elections in Algeria might have represented a clear step  
forward on the path to democracy and political reform,'' State 
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``We are clearly 
disappointed by the events of recent days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France, Algeria's former colonial ruler, said it was  
``concerned'' by the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahimi said he and his five colleagues pulled out after  
receiving information from security officers and civil servants 
that massive fraud was in progress in early voting at special 
stations for security forces and citizens living in Algeria's vast 
desert expanse. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahimi claimed that authorities' polls had showed he and  
Bouteflika would face each other in a second round. So ``they 
decided to put him (Bouteflika) through in the first round, since a 
second round would have turned into catastrophe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials kept the six candidates' names on the ballot.  
According to official figures, Ibrahimi came in second with 12.5 
percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities insisted the vote had been clean.  
</P>
<P>
	``The election was normal, regular and transparent ... despite  
all the doubts,'' Interior Minister Abdelmalek Sellal said, 
announcing the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika, 63, becomes the country's sixth president and first  
civilian leader since 1965, replacing President Liamine Zeroual, a 
retired general stepping down 18 months before the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 man under President Houari Boumediene in the 1970s,  
Bouteflika had broad support from the political elite that has 
dominated Algeria since its independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	That elite ranges from army generals to the National Liberation  
Front, which ruled for three decades until 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Their domination, despised by many, is blamed for Algeria's  
unremitting crises, for widespread corruption, soaring unemployment 
and a sense of despair among the young.

<HEADLINE> Teammates Expect Elway Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- On the eve of the NFL draft, the Denver Broncos  
still don't know the intentions of their 38-year-old, Hall of 
Fame-bound quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, neither does he.  
</P>
<P>
	But some of his teammates are preparing for the unthinkable:  
life without John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Of four players interviewed during off-season workouts on  
Thursday, two said they believe Elway will retire this year. 
Another said he was surprised Elway came back for the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one, running back Terrell Davis, said he thought Elway  
would return for a 17th season this fall to try for an 
unprecedented third straight Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is he's done it all and I think he'll retire,''  
defensive tackle Trevor Pryce said. ``For my own selfish reasons, I 
don't want him to. But he can't live for everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in the league, what, 16 years? He's 38 years old.  
He's done everything he can do. He has two Super Bowl rings, was 
the Super Bowl MVP and has all those records. He could have gone 
into the Hall of Fame five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say he should come back for a third straight title.  
Then why not a fourth one? It never stops. If he wants to retire in 
peace, he has to do it eventually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Howard Griffith agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what he's going to do, but my guess is he'll  
probably retire,'' Griffith said. ``The selfish side of us wants 
him back on the football team. But at this point in his career and 
his life, he's achieved a lot of things. He's got to do what's best 
for John Elway and his family, as opposed to what his team and his 
organization want him to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rod Smith said he has given up anticipating  
Elway's moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut told me last year he wasn't coming back,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith also said those who note that Elway has not participated  
in the first two weeks of the voluntary conditioning program at 
Broncos headquarters are reading too much into his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been doing this so long, he doesn't need to get his body  
going this soon,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was the lone optimist.  
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is that he'll be back,'' Davis said. ``But  
there's nothing that I've seen or heard to support that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think right now everybody is hoping for the best but  
preparing for the worst. As a team, we have to be prepared for 
either decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Elway said the major question in his mind was whether  
he was physically up to the challenge. He said he wavers daily 
about whether to play another year and has no timetable for making 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan has declined all interviews in the  
weeks leading up to the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the NFL meetings in Phoenix last month, Shanahan said,  
``At the end of the season, I was 99 percent sure John was going to 
retire. Right now, I don't know. I think it could go either way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said the competitor in Elway and his opportunity for a  
third straight title make the decision difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan has expressed confidence going into the 1999 season  
with Bubby Brister as his starting quarterback and second-year 
player Brian Griese as the backup. With Elway missing all or part 
of six games because of assorted injuries last season, Brister 
filled in admirably, compiling a 4-0 record in games he started.

<HEADLINE>  Algeria Presidential Race Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Protests broke out in the Algerian  
capital Friday after Abdelaziz Bouteflika was declared president in 
an election so besmirched by fraud charges that his competitors 
quit the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes erupted following the announcement that Bouteflika had  
won Thursday's election, when police charged a gathering in 
downtown Algiers by several hundred supporters of the six other 
presidential candidates who withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police with bullet-proof shields stood guard along the  
route as demonstrators marched and a water cannon was at the ready 
in a main square. Police arrested at least 10 people, and there 
were unconfirmed reports that several people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Bouteflika, considered a favorite of the army,  
took 73 percent of the vote and that turnout was 60.25 percent of 
eligible voters. His six opponents withdrew on the eve of 
elections, claiming massive fraud in early voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The election had been seen as a first step towards healing the  
wounds caused when the army aborted 1992 legislative elections to 
prevent a Muslim fundamentalist party from winning. Outrage at that 
move fueled an Islamic insurgency that has since left 75,000 dead 
and traumatized the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the vote resulted in bitter divisions.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Algerian people have expressed themselves and elected me  
democratically,'' Bouteflika said in a statement. ``I commit myself 
to being the president of all Algerians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, his former opponents said they considered Bouteflika  
``devoid of constitutional legitimacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, his strongest rival in the race, said both  
the official turnout and results were false. 
</P>
<P>
	``The democratic process has taken a severe hit,'' he said in a  
statement. ``The nation is living a new crisis of constitutional 
legitimacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahimi was backed by the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front,  
the party that had been poised to win the 1992 election until the 
military halted voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States expressed disappointment in the election.  
</P>
<P>
	``The elections in Algeria might have represented a clear step  
forward on the path to democracy and political reform,'' State 
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``We are clearly 
disappointed by the events of recent days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France, Algeria's former colonial ruler, said it was  
``concerned'' by the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahimi said he and his five colleagues pulled out after  
receiving information from security officers and civil servants 
that massive fraud was in progress in early voting at special 
stations for security forces and citizens living in Algeria's vast 
desert expanse. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahimi claimed that authorities' polls had showed he and  
Bouteflika would face each other in a second round. So ``they 
decided to put him (Bouteflika) through in the first round, since a 
second round would have turned into catastrophe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials kept the six candidates' names on the ballot.  
According to official figures, Ibrahimi came in second with 12.5 
percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities insisted the vote had been clean.  
</P>
<P>
	``The election was normal, regular and transparent ... despite  
all the doubts,'' Interior Minister Abdelmalek Sellal said, 
announcing the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika, 63, becomes the country's sixth president and first  
civilian leader since 1965, replacing President Liamine Zeroual, a 
retired general stepping down 18 months before the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 man under President Houari Boumediene in the 1970s,  
Bouteflika had broad support from the political elite that has 
dominated Algeria since its independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	That elite ranges from army generals to the National Liberation  
Front, which ruled for three decades until 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Their domination, despised by many, is blamed for Algeria's  
unremitting crises, for widespread corruption, soaring unemployment 
and a sense of despair among the young.

<HEADLINE> Public Enemy Releases Album Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Rap group Public Enemy has become  
the first major group to release a full studio album online. 
</P>
<P>
	Online record label Atomic Pop signed the group to an exclusive  
Internet distribution contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's A Poison Goin On'' will be available for download  
directly online, but the group's fans also will be able to order a 
$10 CD by mail beginning in early May. The album will be available 
in record stores on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Atomic Pop's blend of the record game and the tech game, makes  
it a launching pad for new powerful ideas that Public Enemy has in 
store for 2000,'' Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for San Diego-based Atomic Pop said the album  
would be available for download as an MP3 or similarly compressed 
audio file. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks yet another example of the recording industry's  
loosening control over content and distribution channels. The 
popular MP3 computer file compression format has given savvy music 
listeners the ability to store, trade and give away music over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Musicians are increasingly using MP3 to market their songs  
directly to consumers, bypassing agents, record companies and other 
traditional distributors by putting audio files on their own Web 
sites, a practice that recently got Chuck D in trouble with record 
label, Def-Jam, which owned the rights to his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck D has since been outspoken in his quest to wrest control  
away from the larger record labels and secure higher revenue 
percentages for artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Atomic Pop was founded by Al Teller, former head of MCA Music  
Entertainment Group and President of CBS Records. The company's Web 
site was launched seven weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Conducts Final Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. on Friday conducted its final flight  
test to prove its jetliners won't go haywire when the year 2000 
rolls around, this time with the president of the commercial 
aircraft division riding along in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing happened,'' said Alan Mulally, president of Boeing  
Commercial Airplane Group, after he walked down the steps from the 
brand-new 737-600 twinjet. ``Most of the systems on the airplane 
don't use a clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing was one of the first U.S. corporations to start tackling  
the Year 2000 computer problem, beginning work back in 1993. More 
than a year ago, it determined the date change would at worst cause 
only some minor problems with certain cockpit displays, and none 
that would directly affect in-flight safety. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Boeing's airline customers wanted more reassurance, so  
the company agreed to test fly one of each of its nine current 
production models, and change the date to the new century in 
mid-flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulally went along on the final test to publicize that the  
planes will be safe, especially to the flying public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very confident that things will be just fine,'' Mulally  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he wasn't sure where his schedule would take him on New  
Year's Eve, Mulally added, ``I think it would be a very good place 
to celebrate the turn of the century, in a Boeing airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 20,000 feet above Tatoosh Island just off the northwest tip  
of Washington state, Capt. George Adams Jr. set the airplane clock 
to a few minutes before midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	After counting down to the date change, he, first officer Joseph  
MacDonald and Mulally radioed back to Boeing's Flight Test Center 
here that nothing had occurred. The plane returned to Seattle after 
the hour-long flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers were originally programmed to recognize only the  
last two digits of a year. They are at risk of failing when 2000 
arrives, since the software could assume that ``00'' is less than, 
say, ``98'' or ``99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an increasingly digital society, the problem is pervasive and  
often hard to detect, especially in electronic devices with 
so-called ``embedded'' software that may have been programmed years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing began working on the problem in earnest six years ago  
when workers couldn't use some software to order landing gear for a 
767 to be built after the turn of the century, said Willie Aikens, 
Boeing's Year 2000 program manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program burped in '93,'' Aikens said. ``It wouldn't handle  
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Boeing has spent more than $35 million to make all  
its manufacturing and operating systems ``Y2K compliant,'' and to 
check out its aircraft. Aikens and other Boeing officials said the 
job is mostly done, with final work on the telephone system to be 
completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to be sure, Aikens said, Boeing is drawing up a series of  
contingency plans should problems arise Jan. 1. But he said he 
thinks the date change will be a non-event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Huffaker, a Boeing Customer Services engineer working on the  
Y2K problem, said the only aircraft problems found were in loading 
navigational databases into cockpit computers -- a task done on the 
ground, not in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, the cockpit display will simply say the data is  
out of date, but will otherwise function. In a small number of 
early model planes using a different navigation system, crews would 
be unable to complete preflight checks to make the jet ready to 
fly. Huffaker estimated last year that perhaps 20 aircraft in the 
world's fleet would be so affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing sent out service bulletins to its customers early last  
year, telling them how to fix the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing did not study any equipment or systems that airlines  
might have added themselves, such as in-flight entertainment 
systems, but has shared any information it learns about them with 
customers, Huffaker said.

<HEADLINE> Crichton Forms Computer Game Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Best-selling author Michael Crichton, who wrote  
the ``Jurassic Park'' movies and helped create the hit television 
show ``ER,'' announced today that he has started a computer-game 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company is Timeline Studios, co-founded by Crichton and  
Michael Backes, who worked as the graphics supervisor on ``Jurassic 
Park'' and as a screenwriter on another Crichton project ``Rising 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crichton says he wasn't happy with the limitations of the  
technology in 1982 when he made a computer game called Amazon. But 
he says today's more powerful personal computers and 3-D software 
tools finally make it possible to create movie-quality images, 
detail and movement in computer games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to do this if the backgrounds were fog and you  
couldn't do crowd scenes,'' Crichton told The New York Times. ``Why 
do a computer game if you have to apologize for what it looks 
like?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new technology called Openspace 3D by Virtus Corp. of Cary,  
N.C., enables games to display scenes with dozens or hundreds of 
characters, Crichton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Timeline will have close ties to Virtus, which was founded in  
1990 by David Alan Smith, who developed computer visualization 
technology used in many movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Timeline's first games will be released early next year on  
CD-ROM and DVD.

<HEADLINE> Braves Trade Wohlers to Cincinnati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves today traded reliever Mark  
Wohlers and about $5 million to the Cincinnati Reds for reliever 
John Hudek. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, the star reliever who has been unable to solve his  
control trouble, refused to accept an outright assignment to 
Triple-A Richmond last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta had a week to either trade the 29-year-old right-hander,  
who has played professionally only for the Braves' organization, or 
release him. After talking with five teams, general manager John 
Schuerholz worked out a deal with the Reds several hours ahead of 
the 2 p.m. deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all intents and purposes, this is the end of Mark's career  
with the Atlanta Braves,'' Schuerholz said. ``I'm saddened by that, 
but I'm also pleased that we were able to acquire a reliever the 
caliber of John Hudek. I think he will fit very well and strengthen 
us in the area of middle relief, which we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reds general manager Jim Bowden said in Cincinnati that the  
Braves have agreed to pay Wohlers' $5.2 million salary this season. 
They'll also pay his contract's $800,000 buyout for next year 
should the Reds choose not to exercise that option. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz would not confirm how much cash was involved in the  
trade. ``It's fair to assume that the amount of cash goes a long 
way toward covering the cost of Mark's contract,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the Reds agreed to pay Hudek's $800,000 salary for  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, on a conference call with Cincinnati media, said he  
looked forward to rejuvenating his career with the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of getting comfortable again,'' he said.  
``I think a fresh start is something that will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers was the Braves' star reliever in 1995 when he saved the  
final game of the only World Series the team has won in Atlanta. He 
set a franchise record with 39 saves the following year and had 33 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He saved 97 games for the Braves from 1995-97. But in 1998  
Wohlers pulled a muscle in his side, apparently tried to come back 
to soon and discovered he couldn't throw a strike. He was sent to 
Richmond, but had no success there either. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to make a comeback this spring, showing some progress  
until the season opened. He walked four of the first seven batters 
he faced in the season opener, and in his next outing he had two 
walks and an error while facing three batters. 
</P>
<P>
	``While circumstances surrounding Mark Wohlers placed us in a  
challenging and difficult circumstance, we feel this resolution is 
win-win,'' Schuerholz said. ``We acquire a proven major league 
relief pitcher and Wohlers gets a chance to restart his career with 
the Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said the trade could greatly strengthen Cincinnati's  
bullpen later this season if Wohlers is able to regain the form he 
used to help make the Braves a dominating ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're completely satisfied that physically he's fine. It's  
mental, period,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Hudank appeared in two games this year, going  
0-1 with a 27.00 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he was 5-6 and had career highs with 58 appearances,  
64 innings and 68 strikeouts while splitting his time between the 
New York Mets and Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Seek Reserve Call-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is preparing to ask President  
Clinton for authority to activate as many as 33,000 reserve forces 
in support of the Kosovo conflict, and the president is likely to 
approve the request, government officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said today that he couldn't  
provide the exact number of reservists who might be needed, but he 
added ``I think it'll be a significant number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he would likely present the request to Clinton early  
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve call-up will include up to 25,000 Air National Guard  
members in units that fly aerial refueling missions both from the 
United States and from Europe, according to U.S. defense officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Some civil-affairs specialists from the Army Reserve are likely  
to be included, too, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said there  
is evidence of ``mass killings and graves associated with those 
mass killings'' in an area west of Pristina, the Kosovo capital. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no information on the number killed.  
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also said that according to independent sources and  
refugee accounts, Serb forces have damaged or destroyed more than 
400 villages and towns inside Kosovo, 45 of them in the last 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the large scale refugee flow has resumed and that up  
to 50,000 Kosovar Albanians may be backed up at the border 
attempting to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio, who held  
a Pentagon news conference on the safety of U.S. military flight 
training in Italy, agreed it's too soon to consider using ground 
troops in Yugoslavia even if the NATO air campaign doesn't stop 
Serb assaults on Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started this action, the idea was it was possible with  
airstrikes to reach the political results we were aiming'' for, 
Scognamiglio said, adding ``we will see in the future'' if the air 
campaign works. ``At that moment, the Italian government must be in 
the position to take a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that in testifying before Congress on Thursday he  
heard strong arguments for and against using ground troops, but saw 
no consensus that would alter the Clinton administration's view 
that air power alone can win out against Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any minds were changed,'' Cohen said.  
</P>
<P>
	The need for reserve forces is linked to NATO's decision to  
expand the air war by adding 300 or more U.S. aircraft -- about 
one-third of which are likely to be refueling airplanes -- and two 
battalions of Army Apache helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move, officials said the Pentagon also is preparing  
to issue a ``stop loss'' order that would prevent active-duty 
troops from leaving the military during the Kosovo crisis. This is 
meant to limit the need for additional reservists. 
</P>
<P>
	A Defense Department official said that while authority to call  
up as many as 33,000 would be sought, a smaller number may actually 
be ordered to active duty. He said Cohen had not yet settled on a 
specific number. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by Clinton as expected, the call-up would be the  
biggest since more than 200,000 reservists were activated during 
the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military relies heavily on reservists, the citizen  
soldiers, for almost any large operation. Many of the Air Force 
refueling aircraft in the Balkans already are operated by members 
of the Air National Guard who volunteered for duty. Nine Air Guard 
refueling wings from nine states already are participating in the 
NATO missions, as are KC-135 refueling units from five Air Force 
Reserve wings in five states. 
</P>
<P>
	The call-up of additional forces would follow a major buildup of  
U.S. and other NATO aircraft in the effort to halt Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign against ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters today, officials were pressed for  
additional information on a confusing series of incidents Wednesday 
in which four Kosovo refugee convoys reportedly came under attack. 
NATO acknowledged that it was responsible for one attack north of 
the town of Djakovica, and it apologized for the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, under questioning by reporters, said  
he could add no new information. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea also said that NATO's bombing Thursday night was one of the  
most successful of the campaign, which began March 24. He said a 
wide array of military targets were struck throughout Yugoslavia, 
including surface-to-air missile sites, radars, an ammunition 
bunker and air fields.

	The spokesman also reported that Yugoslav naval vessels in port  
in Montenegro have been firing artillery at NATO aircraft. But he 
said NATO so far has not attacked any of the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks Thursday, Clinton said NATO had no alternative but to  
prevail in this war. Ceding Kosovo to Milosevic, the president 
said, would mean ``turning Kosovo into a lifeless wasteland'' and 
would mark a historic setback for democracy in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said the mistaken NATO attack Wednesday on a  
refugee convoy in Kosovo that killed dozens of civilians was a 
regrettable error that shows that modern warfare ``is not a 
business of perfection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is also inevitable in a conflict of this kind, with planes  
traveling at high speeds, doing the best to fulfill their 
mission,'' Clinton said. ``And if the requirement is that nothing 
like this can ever happen, then we're saying it's OK with us if Mr. 
Milosevic displaces over a million Kosovars, kills and rapes 
thousands upon thousands of them.''

<HEADLINE> Love That Red Wins at Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Love That Red redeemed himself from a  
disappointing effort in the San Pedro Stakes by scoring a decisive, 
six-length victory over Winninginexcess in Santa Anita Park's 
$100,000 Zany Tactics Stakes for 3-year-olds on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Garrett Gomez, the gelded son of Highland Park  
overtook 4-5 favorite Winninginexcess entering the stretch and 
steadily drew clear. Guillermo finished third, six lengths behind 
the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Love That Red, who carried 115 pounds, went six furlongs in 1:08  
1-5, taking 1 1-5 seconds off the stakes record set last year by 
Champ's Star. He paid $4.80, $2.40 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Winninginexcess, with David Flores aboard at 116 pounds, paid  
$2.40 and $2.20. Guilliermo, handled by Eddie Dalahoussaye under 
116 pounds, paid $2.20 to show.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam War Remains Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remains of six American servicemen killed  
during the Vietnam War have been identified and are being returned 
to their families, the Pentagon said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The six were identified as Air Force Capt. Dean A. Wadsworth, of  
Clarendon, Texas; Marine Staff Sgt. Harold E. Reid, of Salt Lake 
City; Navy Lt. David L. Hodges, of Chevy Chase, Md.; Air Force Lt. 
Col. Lewis M. Robinson, of Saginaw, Mich.; Air Force Capt. Douglas 
K. Martin, of Tyler, Texas; and Air Force Capt. Samuel L. James, of 
Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth's T-28B Trojan aircraft broke apart in the air after a  
bombing run about 50 miles southwest of Da Nang on Oct. 8, 1963, 
the Pentagon said. A Vietnamese who lives near the site turned over 
some remains in 1993, and a 1995 excavation of the crash site 
turned up additional remains and Wadsworth's identification tags. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid disappeared Sept. 13, 1967, after completing guard duty at  
an observation post near a river in Quang Nam Province, the 
Pentagon account said. Local informants told U.S. and Vietnamese 
investigators in 1993 about an American Marine the Viet Cong had 
shot near the river. The burial site was excavated in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges' A-4E Skyhawk was struck by an enemy surface-to-air  
missile near Hanoi on Oct. 7, 1967. Investigators used Vietnamese 
wartime documents and interviews with neighbors who live near the 
crash site to locate remains and aircraft wreckage in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's A-1E Skyraider crashed in Saravane Province in Laos  
after it was hit by enemy ground fire on June 4, 1967. The Laotian 
government turned over remains in 1988, and an excavation a decade 
later yielded additional remains and personal equipment, the 
Pentagon account said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and James disappeared during a bombing mission over  
Cambodia on April 18, 1973, the Pentagon account said. Another 
pilot in the area reported fires and explosions after he lost radio 
contact with the pair's F-4E Phantom. A 1998 excavation turned up 
remains and aircraft wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army's Central Identification Laboratory identified the  
remains. Since American fighting units completed their pullout from 
Vietnam in 1973, remains of 520 military personnel listed as 
missing in action have been identified and returned to their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 2,063 Americans remain unaccounted for from the war.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky's Departure Will Leave Void </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky's talent and overwhelming  
achievements thrilled his fans across North America. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when he finally decided to say goodbye Friday to the sport  
he liked so much, Gretzky elicited many emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say it ain't so,'' said Gordie Howe, who held many of the  
records that Gretzky shattered. ``He's a proud man. And when you're 
hurting, it makes you think (about retirement). So, it's best that 
I congratulate him. I would (have liked) to seen him wait until 
training camp (to make his decision). He's going to leave a big 
void.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky insisted that he was sure of his decision to retire now  
and helped convince those around him that it was the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he saw some declines in his talents,'' Rangers  
coach John Muckler said. ``Wayne's a very proud person and he 
wanted to go out on his own terms. Maybe he felt that if he didn't 
do it now, he wouldn't be able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muckler, credited by Gretzky for influencing his hockey life as  
much as anyone, still tried to change the 38-year-old star's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned one thing, I shouldn't go into sales,'' Muckler said  
of his failed attempt. ``I wasn't very convincing ... he was. It 
just makes sense. It's the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he played only for NHL teams in the United States  
following his trade from the Edmonton Oilers in 1988, Gretzky's 
standing in his native Canada never waned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a bittersweet moment,'' Canadian prime minister  
Jean Chretien said in a statement. ``One of the greatest players 
ever to play our national game has decided to hang up his skates. 
No longer will our arenas be energized by his presence and 
electrified by his performance. No longer will we be able to thrill 
in anticipation of his next wondrous play. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we can take heart from the endless, magical memories he  
has given us. Most of all, we can feel reassured that his example 
of decency and sportsmanship will continue to inspire generations 
of young hockey players -- and all young Canadians -- for years to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Lemieux, the six-time NHL scoring champion and prospective  
Pittsburgh Penguins owner, was so inspired by Gretzky that he asked 
for his trademark No. 99 as a junior hockey player long before he 
would make his own No. 66 famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's meant a lot to game, he's really changed the game and  
changed the approach of many young players,'' Lemieux said Friday, 
shortly before Gretzky announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 20 seasons from Edmonton to his shocking trade to Los  
Angeles, a brief stint in St. Louis and his final stop in New York, 
Gretzky had many teammates. But the time and success he shared with 
Mark Messier with the Oilers and then again for one season with the 
Rangers will always be remembered by hockey fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's been great players before us, there have been  
great players with us and there's going to be great players after 
us,'' Messier said. ``The game is always bigger than any 
individual. Always has been. Maybe with the exception of Wayne, who 
has really transcended the game when he first came into the 
National Hockey League and changed the way the game was looked at 
and the way it was played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in three years, Rangers general manager Neil  
Smith has the difficult task of replacing a star. First it was 
Messier, and now Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he knew it was special to see Gretzky wear No. 99 in  
a Rangers blue shirt and have him finish his career in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were lucky just to have him in our uniform,'' Smith said.  
``The whole three years he's been here, every day has been a 
pinch-me day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So in the span of just a few weeks, sports fans have had to deal  
with the departure of Michael Jordan and Gretzky, a fact not lost 
on current Penguins star Jaromir Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be another Jordan. There won't be another  
Gretzky.''

<HEADLINE> Colts' Polian Discusses Faulk Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Marshall Faulk's demand for a new contract  
and the threat of a holdout forced the Indianapolis Colts to trade 
the three-time Pro Bowl running back, club president Bill Polian 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was traded to St. Louis on Thursday for their second and  
fifth-round picks in this weekend's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said he became convinced in March ``that Marshall and his  
agent were quite serious about not coming in without a new 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Holdouts equal injuries and that's always been true,'' Polian  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk had two more years on the seven-year contract he signed as  
the No. 2 overall draft pick in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts will hold a mini-camp next week and Polian said the  
collective bargaining agreement would have resulted in a $5,000 per 
day fine if Faulk did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no point in levying those fines if they're going to be  
rescinded or forgiven ... as a result you have an atmosphere that 
isn't conducive to good feeling,'' Polian said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Polian said a holdout by Faulk ``would have been  
very damaging to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Polian declined to confirm that the Colts would draft  
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams to replace Faulk in the 
starting backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts have the fourth pick when the draft begins Saturday  
and all three will probably take quarterbacks, leaving Williams 
available to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're taking a risk, secondly I don't know where  
Ricky Williams enters into the equation,'' Polian said when asked 
if the Colts had taken the risk of being unable to replace Faulk by 
trading him before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said the Colts, who are trying to improve the league's  
29th-worst defense, do not have to use their first-round pick to 
select a running back. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said starting a rookie running back with second-year  
quarterback Peyton Manning would not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rookies can play running back faster than rookies can play  
most any other position,'' he said. ``Don't read anything into 
that. What they do at the college level by and large is relatively 
easier to translate to the NFL as opposed to other positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams comes to the NFL as college football's all-time rushing  
leader, a record he set by remaining at Texas for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said he believes the second pick in the draft, held by  
Philadelphia, will dictate what the Colts and the other teams 
holding one of the first 10 picks will do on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned, we'll find out,'' he said. ``I anticipate that the  
phone will be ringing and we'll evaluate. We evaluate every 
different scenario.''

<HEADLINE> Housing Slows but Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home builders, struggling with a shortage of  
workers and supplies in the face of red hot demand, cut back on 
activity for the second straight month in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Friday that new homes and  
apartments were begun at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.77 
million units last month. The 1.3 percent drop in activity followed 
a 1.6 percent decline in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Both months followed a 12-year high of 1.82 million starts set  
in January. Analysts said the slowdown was welcome relief for an 
industry that built more homes for all of 1998 than it had in 11 
years and was facing shortages of workers and building materials in 
some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the government said output at the nation's  
factories, mines and utilities edged up a tiny 0.1 percent with its 
limited strength coming at utility companies and manufacturers of 
high-tech products such as computers and communication equipment, 
which posted a 1.4 percent rise in March. Auto production was down 
0.5 percent last month following a 1.7 percent surge in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the housing and factory production reports  
depicted a U.S. economy that is benefiting from strong consumer 
demand. This has offset the jolts manufacturing has suffered from a 
steep plunge in overseas demand following the Asian currency 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing economists said they looked for demand to remain strong  
for most of this year, in part because of a belief that mortgage 
rates will rise only slightly from the 30-year lows hit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide survey by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company,  
showed 30-year mortgages dipped to 6.87 percent this week after 
having hit a 10-month high of 7.11 percent in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers,  
said he did not look for rates to rise more than a quarter-point 
from where they are currently because of his view that inflation 
will remain low this year and the Federal Reserve will not be 
forced to push interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic softness in Europe and Japan and interest rate cuts  
overseas will help take pressure off our rates,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of  
Home Builders, said the small decline in construction starts in 
February and March came as builders were struggling with worker 
shortages and difficulty in getting supplies of such materials as 
gypsum wall board. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of these shortages, Seiders said, the time it was taking  
to complete a home had risen by about 20 days from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is symptomatic of a market that is really in high gear,''  
Seiders said. ``Builders are telling us that extreme shortages of 
workers and materials are causing them to have to stretch out 
completion times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While such shortages would normally trigger worries at the  
Federal Reserve of an economy that is overheating, the overseas 
weakness and its depressing effects on American exporters in 
manufacturing and farming have kept the lid on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed report on factory output showed that U.S. industry  
operated at just 80.1 percent of capacity in March, the lowest 
operating rate in nearly seven years. The low capacity utilization 
rates mean that production bottlenecks have not formed even though 
the economy is now in the ninth year of economic expansion, the 
longest period of uninterrupted growth in peacetime history. 
</P>
<P>
	Permit applications for new home construction dropped 6 percent  
in March, the biggest decline in four years, after a 2.1 percent 
fall in February. But the declines were coming from exceptionally 
high levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in construction reflected a small 0.1 percent dip in  
single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 1.4 million 
units. Apartment construction was down 5.9 percent to an annual 
rate of 365,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness was led by a 28.9 percent plunge in activity in the  
Northeast, where builders started work on 150,000 units at an 
annual rate. Construction in the South was down 4.3 percent to an 
annual rate of 821,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing construction rose 12.7 percent in the Midwest to an  
annual rate of 400,000 units and was up 7.9 percent in the West to 
an annual rate of 395,000 units.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky To Announce Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky will retire after Sunday's game,  
league officials familiar with his decision said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Rangers said a ``major player announcement'' would  
be made at 4 p.m. EDT today. Attending the session besides Gretzky 
will be NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and the three top officials 
of the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no formal word on Gretzky's plans, but league  
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The 
Associated Press that the player known as ``The Great One'' was, 
indeed, ending his career at age 38 after 20 years in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne Gretzky will announce he's retiring,'' one official  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His last game will be Sunday, when the Rangers close their  
season against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The league planned to show 
a ceremony honoring Gretzky before the Rangers game live to some of 
its arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was to meet again before the news conference with James  
Dolan, president and CEO of Cablevision, which owns the Garden and 
the Rangers. Dolan wanted to add his voice to those asking the 
game's greatest player to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team was putting a farewell in motion. A club  
representative called the AP today, saying Gretzky requested 30 
copies of a Canadian Press picture distributed by the AP in which 
Gretzky is waving to fans after Thursday night's game against 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Parliament of Canada seemed powerless in this regard. A  
member sought unanimous consent today for a motion in the House of 
Commons asking Gretzky to delay his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say it ain't so,'' hockey great Gordie Howe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Howe hoped Gretzky would have delayed his retirement until just  
before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he reflects on that last shift he had in the All-Star  
Game,'' Howe said of the cheering fans. ``He showed what he could 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added former teammate Luc Robitaille: ``There's a time for  
everybody to stop. He's still the greatest player ever to play the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 2-2 tie with the Senators, Gretzky fought back  
tears and said his decision to retire was all but final. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are obviously pointing in that direction,'' he  
said. ``I'm really at peace in my mind about this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, wearing gray slacks and an open-neck white dress shirt,  
frequently had to stop for breath as he described how hard it will 
be to finally skate out of hockey and into the history books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this for a long time,'' said Gretzky, whose  
team is out of the playoffs and plays its final game Sunday against 
Pittsburgh in New York. ``But I didn't want to be disruptive to the 
team during the playoff drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not once during the 45-minute news conference did Gretzky ever  
use the ``R'' word. Still, everything he did pointed to him leaving 
the game at the end of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless a miracle happens between now and Saturday, I'll  
probably make it official,'' Gretzky said. ``It's not official 
right now. It's not 99 percent official. When I make the decision, 
it will be 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, someone's cell phone rang at the side of the podium.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tell 'em I still haven't decided,'' Gretzky said quickly,  
finally laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Thursday night was Gretzky's final game in Canada, it was  
some farewell party. The 18,449 fans lucky enough to score a ticket 
to the Corel Center saw to that. 
</P>
<P>
	With 4:43 left in the third period and the scored tied 2-2, the  
fans began to chant ``One more year'' as the teams headed to their 
benches for a TV timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the place went crazy as the screen on the scoreboard  
hanging over center ice began replaying Gretzky highlights, listing 
all his championships and many of his offensive records -- all to 
the music of Carly Simon's ``Nobody Does it Better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camera in the stadium also picked up one banner that read:  
``Thanks, Mr. Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky raised his stick and waved at the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I was 16 years old and playing for $21 a  
week,'' Gretzky said. ``And the fans in Ottawa gave me ovations 
then, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, the arena spotlight picked up Gretzky as he  
skated from the New York net to the boards in front of the Rangers' 
bench. As he leaned there smiling, all the Ottawa players skated 
over and one by one shook his hand. The Rangers, in a semicircle, 
tapped their sticks on the ice in a salute to the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's wife, Janet, was crying in the stands as her husband  
was announced as the game's only star, and the building erupted in 
more cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa fans weren't finished with their lovefest. They  
remained on their feet, cheering and applauding until Gretzky came 
out for a curtain call. He circled the ice, waved, smiled and 
headed down the tunnel toward the dressing room again. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't nearly enough. The fans continued to cheer for 10 more  
minutes until Gretzky, this time without any pads under his 
sweater, came out for a second curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume started building during warmups before the game  
between Gretzky's Rangers and the Senators at the Corel Centre. 
Then, the crowd roared when his name was announced in the starting 
lineup moments before the Canadian national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who has been bothered by injuries this season, skated  
23 shifts. He played 23 minutes, 9 seconds, but took only two 
shots, none during the five-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the Wayne Gretzky of 1988,'' he said. ``I still think  
I can contribute. But it's an 82-game grind. Teams in this league 
play hard every night. I'm thinking about those 82 games next year, 
no question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators took a 1-0 lead on Nelson Emerson's goal with 55  
seconds left in the first period, but even that didn't produce the 
buzz the Great One did every time he stepped on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a great roar of anticipation at 7:36 of the third  
period when Gretzky fed a beautiful lead pass to John MacLean 
streaking in on Ottawa goaltender Damian Rhodes. But the roar 
turned to a moan when MacLean missed the shot and a chance for 
Gretzky to add to his point total had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky will retire as the NHL's all-time leading scorer. In  
1,486 games, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 2,856 
points. He was named the league's most valuable player nine times 
and led the league in scoring 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville coach Barry Trotz said the NHL should retire his  
number leaguewide, as baseball did with Jackie Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should ever wear it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Family Hopes Capsule Remains Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- As an underwater salvage team  
prepares to set sail this weekend in search of Gus Grissom's 
38-year-old space capsule, three people are hoping it remains 
buried in the Atlantic: the astronaut's widow and two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Grissom said she finds it ``disgusting'' that the family  
wasn't consulted about the rescue attempt from the beginning. She 
doesn't oppose recovery of the Mercury capsule, but doesn't want it 
restored and displayed in Kansas as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they do not find it,'' Mrs. Grissom said in a  
telephone interview from her Houston home Friday, just two hours 
after expedition leader Curt Newport met with the press at his 
chartered ship. ``I'm keeping my fingers crossed that something 
happens that they don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport plans to leave Sunday from nearby Port Canaveral on a  
two-week expedition financed by the Discovery Channel, which is 
filming the voyage for a documentary to be broadcast this fall. The 
ship, named Needham Tide, is equipped with the latest in side-scan 
sonar as well as a remote-operated recovery vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport and his crew will survey a 24-square-mile area about 300  
miles offshore at a depth of 15,600 feet. After 14 years of 
analyzing NASA charts and photographs and interviewing witnesses, 
he believes that's where the titanium and aluminum capsule should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 is the only U.S. manned spacecraft lost after a  
successful mission. It sank to the bottom of the Atlantic after 
splashing down with Grissom on July 21, 1961. The explosive bolts 
that blow open the hatch detonated prematurely. Grissom was rescued 
by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though NASA exonerated Grissom and he went on to fly in  
Gemini, there was debate over whether the hatch malfunctioned or he 
accidentally knocked a switch, or even panicked and blew the hatch 
open. He died in the Apollo launch pad fire in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe the mystery could be solved if the hatch is found.  
Newport said he will search for the hatch only if he has enough 
time; it could be as far away from the capsule as a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	If Liberty Bell 7 is found and recovered, Mrs. Grissom said she  
would like it simply cleaned and left in its original condition, 
not made to look like ``a copper pot.'' And she'd prefer it be put 
on display in a place that doesn't have a spacecraft exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her sons -- a Federal Express pilot and an air traffic  
controller in their 40s -- share her opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans now call for the capsule, if found, to be restored at the  
Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kan. It would be 
sent on tour following its $250,000, six-month sprucing up, then 
put on display at the cosmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA and the Smithsonian Institution have agreed to the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grissom said she has personal reasons for wanting to keep  
her husband's capsule out of the Kansas Cosmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	She's still smarting over the cosmosphere's unsuccessful attempt  
several years ago to move her husband's Gemini 3 spacecraft from 
the couple's hometown of Mitchell, Ind., to Kansas. She said the 
cosmosphere's president, Max Ary, wanted her help, saying more 
people would see it in Kansas, but she refused. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, she doesn't like how the cosmosphere has restored  
other spacecraft. She fears her husband's Mercury capsule will be 
stripped of its original outer coating and covered with fake 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want people to see what it really looked like and it's  
not going to be that if it goes to Kansas,'' Mrs. Grissom said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the cosmosphere, Karen Siebert, said the goal  
is to preserve the spacecraft, not make it pristine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the allure of the spacecraft is it's been on the ocean  
floor for over 30 years,'' she said. ``We want to return it to its 
postflight condition, but retaining that part of the story.''

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky To Announce Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky will retire after Sunday's game,  
league officials familiar with his decision said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Rangers said a ``major player announcement'' would  
be made at 4 p.m. EDT today. Attending the session besides Gretzky 
will be NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and the three top officials 
of the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no formal word on Gretzky's plans, but league  
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The 
Associated Press that the player known as ``The Great One'' was, 
indeed, ending his career at age 38 after 20 years in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne Gretzky will announce he's retiring,'' one official  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His last game will be Sunday, when the Rangers close their  
season against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The league planned to show 
a ceremony honoring Gretzky before the Rangers game live to some of 
its arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was to meet again before the news conference with James  
Dolan, president and CEO of Cablevision, which owns the Garden and 
the Rangers. Dolan wanted to add his voice to those asking the 
game's greatest player to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team was putting a farewell in motion. A club  
representative called the AP today, saying Gretzky requested 30 
copies of a Canadian Press picture distributed by the AP in which 
Gretzky is waving to fans after Thursday night's game against 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Parliament of Canada seemed powerless in this regard. A  
member sought unanimous consent today for a motion in the House of 
Commons asking Gretzky to delay his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say it ain't so,'' hockey great Gordie Howe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Howe hoped Gretzky would have delayed his retirement until just  
before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he reflects on that last shift he had in the All-Star  
Game,'' Howe said of the cheering fans. ``He showed what he could 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added former teammate Luc Robitaille: ``There's a time for  
everybody to stop. He's still the greatest player ever to play the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 2-2 tie with the Senators, Gretzky fought back  
tears and said his decision to retire was all but final. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are obviously pointing in that direction,'' he  
said. ``I'm really at peace in my mind about this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, wearing gray slacks and an open-neck white dress shirt,  
frequently had to stop for breath as he described how hard it will 
be to finally skate out of hockey and into the history books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this for a long time,'' said Gretzky, whose

<HEADLINE> Washington Times Puts Sports First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No more leafing through the paper to get those  
Saturday scores for readers of The Washington Times. Starting 
Sunday, the sports section comes first. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ``letter from the editor'' in Friday's newspaper, Editor in  
Chief Wesley Pruden said the outside of Sunday editions will now be 
the new Sunday Sports Times. He said it will include expanded 
coverage of area pro teams and colleges as well as running, 
swimming and other parts of ``the exploding world of sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports editor Gary Hopkins said, ``We've always been known for  
politics, national issues, trends, things like that. We were 
looking for something unique. Sports is big. When you think about 
what happened Saturday, what are people going to the Sunday paper 
for?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire sports section will be the A section,'' he said,  
nearly double the size of the Times' normal Sunday sports sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside will be the regular Sunday paper, ``a convenient pull-out  
section with the usual front page of The Times,'' Pruden said.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Governor Endorses Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a tax-cutting  
conservative, today joined the parade of GOP chief executives who 
have endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the Republican 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore -- flanked at a news conference by two dozen Republican  
leaders from around the state -- said Bush has abolished parole, cut 
crime, reduced welfare rolls and improved Texas' educational system 
during his term as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush is everything that the American people expect  
from their president and I think more than that,'' Gilmore said. 
``With his record of inclusion and bringing people together, I 
think he'll appeal to people from all across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a remarkable show of early strength, Bush has lined up  
support of a majority of the nation's 31 GOP governors. Gilmore is 
the 15th Republican governor to publicly endorse Bush, though the 
Texan has secured private backing from several other chief 
executives, according to the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore has secured Bush endorsements from Virginia's lieutenant  
governor, John Hager, 53 of the state's 70 GOP state lawmakers and 
nine of the state's 11 congressional district chairmen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia governors have little influence in the nominating  
process. The state usually selects national convention delegates 
well after nomination battles have been settled in primaries 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gilmore is well-known nationally among conservatives  
for his pledge to cut car taxes and his solid anti-abortion record. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Gilmore and the Legislature are considering changing  
Virginia law to let the state's parties have February primaries. 
That would make Virginia one of the first big states to select 
presidential nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia has voted Republican in every presidential election  
since President Johnson carried the state for Democrats in 1964.

<HEADLINE> HIV-Infected Mom Fights for Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- An HIV-infected mother who wants to  
breast-feed her son went to court Friday with the unorthodox 
argument that her milk can't spread the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Tyson and her husband, David, are part of a national  
movement that rejects the prevailing science on AIDS. They don't 
believe HIV causes AIDS, and their refusal to give up 
breast-feeding led authorities to take legal custody of their 
4-month-old son, Felix, when he was just days old. The couple 
retains physical custody of the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mother was taking a risk -- she was playing Russian  
roulette with the virus,'' said Robert Nagler, the state lawyer who 
represents the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents were blessed with a robust, healthy child,'' he  
said, ``but they also chose to adopt a cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the Tysons said they couple should have the right  
to raise their child as they see fit, and they promised to call 
biochemists and doctors who espouse the belief that there is no 
evidence that HIV is passed through breast milk, and that there is 
no solid proof HIV causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``She made a choice that she feels is in Felix's best  
interest,'' said Hilary Billings, Kathleen Tyson's attorney. ``It's 
a measure of risks against each other and benefits against each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue would boil down to where a certain line needs to be  
drawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Billings convinced a Bangor, Maine, court that  
HIV-positive mother Valerie Emerson should retain custody of her 
three children and be able to pursue whatever medical treatment she 
deems fit. Emerson has decided not to allow drug therapy for her 
HIV-positive 4-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Rethinking AIDS'' movement is led by scientist David  
Rasnick of the University of California at Berkeley. He is expected 
to testify that there is no relationship between HIV and AIDS, and 
that the state has no right to enforce unfounded medical theory. 
</P>
<P>
	But sentiments on the other side are equally strong. A number of  
medical professionals and state social workers believe Felix's 
health would be endangered if he were to drink his mother's milk. 
They say there is no doubt HIV is the cause of AIDS, and that 
breast milk can spread the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bizarre that 18 years after the epidemic began that  
there's any question about the cause of HIV infection,'' said 
Leslie Mehlhaff, an infectious disease specialist who advised Tyson 
against breast feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was expected to last three days before Juvenile  
Court Judge Maurice Merten, who will decide permanent custody of 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Felix was born Dec. 7, a state social worker arrived  
at the hospital with three uniformed police officers after Tyson's 
doctor expressed concern about her breast-feeding the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jo Driscoll, social worker with Oregon's child welfare  
agency, said the couple became combative and told her they believed 
bottle feeding was the method that carried the real deadly risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were upset,'' she said. ``They believed they were making  
informed decisions about their son. They thought I was intruding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks after the state took legal custody of Felix, he  
tested negative for HIV. He has not been tested since. For the past 
four months, Felix has lived with his parents and sister even 
though the state has custody. 
</P>
<P>
	About once a week, a state caseworker makes a visit to the Tyson  
home to ensure the state's will is being carried out. The 
caseworker said the child shows no sign of behavior typical of 
breast-feeding and Tyson can be trusted to carry out the court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson found out she has HIV during prenatal screening. She was  
pregnant with triplets and her lawyer suggested in court Friday 
that the HIV test may have been inaccurate because of hormonal 
changes when she lost two fetuses. She has said she never used 
intravenous drugs, and she and her husband of 11 years have had a 
monogamous marriage.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Retirement Will `Cost' NHL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky's retirement costs the NHL its  
highest-profile player both on and off the ice as the sport 
struggles to broaden its audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey's all-time scoring leader said Friday his last game will  
be Sunday's season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was one of the few hockey players ever to land national  
endorsement deals for mainstream consumer products. He has pitched 
items ranging from Sharp videocameras to Campbell's soup and 
McDonald's burgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the few hockey players that everyone knew  
whether they were hockey fans or not,'' said Brandon Steiner, who 
heads his own sports marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine recently estimated that Gretzky earned $8  
million from endorsements last year on top of an NHL salary of $6.6 
million. That put him 14th on the Forbes list of highest-paid 
athletes in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Campbell's and McDonald's, Gretzky's endorsement  
earnings last year came from Primestar satellite TV, Hespeler 
sports equipment, Upper Deck trading cards, Zurich Insurance and 
Canadian Imperial Bank, Forbes said. He also had deals with the 
Hudson's Bay retail chain in Canada for a line of casual clothing 
and with Post cereals in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's commercial career could continue despite his  
retirement. But the NHL's loss of its biggest star comes at a bad 
time for the league, which needs to find a way to snap out of a 
television ratings slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for regular season games on Fox this season have held  
even with last season but are down 33 percent from three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has a very loyal and strong core audience, but  
unfortunately as a national property we weren't able to build the 
ratings or viewership or interest,'' said Fox spokesman Vince 
Wladika. Fox is in the last year of a five-year contract to 
broadcast NHL games. ABC takes over next season. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN has the cable TV rights to carry NHL games. The ratings are  
down 13 percent on the ESPN network and are off 16 percent on ESPN2 
this year. While the ratings are down, the number of homes viewing 
hockey on ESPN2 is steady with a year ago because the network is 
available in many more communities than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Steiner said Gretzky's retirement is ``going to be a setback for  
everyone involved in the marketing of the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Williams, who heads Burns Sports in Chicago, agreed the  
retirement would be ``very detrimental to hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the NBA, which lost Michael Jordan this season, Williams  
said ``you don't have several players waiting in the wings to step 
into a leadership role like Gretzky carried for many years'' in the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	He said hockey ranked fourth behind football, basketball and  
baseball in terms of the number of endorsement deals involving its 
players as recently as 1994. But he said since then, auto racing, 
men's and women's tennis, golf and figure skating have all edged 
ahead of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said hockey's superstar players have lacked ``the kind  
of charisma and personality'' that attracts advertisers' interest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steve Rosner, executive vice president of Integrated Sports  
International, said Gretzky's retirement creates an opportunity for 
other NHL players to ``to step up and carry the torch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the players mentioned by Rosner and others as possible  
endorsers were Brett Hull and Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars, 
Brian Leetch of the New York Rangers, Dominik Hasek of the Buffalo 
Sabres, Steve Yzerman of the Detroit Red Wings and Mark Messier of 
the Vancouver Canucks.

<HEADLINE> Rabbi Accused of School Jobs Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A prominent rabbi and a public school board  
conspired in a 20-year scheme that siphoned more than $6 million in 
taxpayer money to a private Jewish school and its affiliates, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Hertz Frankel pleaded guilty to conspiring with Public  
School District No. 14 to place about 80 Hasidic women in no-show 
jobs on the district payroll, investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea, made Apr. 9 in federal court in Brooklyn, earned  
Frankel three years probation and a restitution order of $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people benefited from this corrupt bargain,'' said Edward  
F. Stancik, the Board of Education's chief investigator. ``None of 
them were New York City public school students or their parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme involved giving the women -- some with as many as 10  
children -- family health insurance benefits while their paychecks 
were often handed over to Frankel. Many were on the district 
payroll as school security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that money was then given to the Beth Rachel school in  
Brooklyn, where Frankel is a principal. The school bills itself as 
the largest Jewish girls' school in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Frankel assured district administrators that they  
had the support of a critical bloc of Hasidic men on the 
nine-member community school board. 
</P>
<P>
	Stancik's office and federal prosecutors investigated the scheme  
for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former district superintendents implicated in the  
investigation died without being charged, Stancik said. Three 
lower-level district administrators pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
charges related to the scheme, which ran from the mid-1970s to 
1994.

<HEADLINE> Many Finding Mortgages Online / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Sky Tsan refinanced his home mortgage this  
past winter, he searched the Internet for the best rates, 
downloaded a loan application, filled it out on his personal 
computer and e-mailed it -- all in just a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	What a contrast from 10 years ago, when the 46-year-old engineer  
and his wife, Sue, first applied for a loan on their three-bedroom 
Freemont, Calif., ranch: 
</P>
<P>
	They spent days calling around and searching local newspapers  
for the best rates and terms, made an appointment with a banker 
just for an application, took the paperwork home, met again with 
the banker, then waited for the application to be retyped before 
signing it and setting the long approval procedure in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsan (pronounced Tan) figures he shortened the process in  
getting his new 6.625 percent 15-year loan by a few weeks this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quick and easy ... and went so smooth,'' he said. ``I  
wouldn't do it any other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First it was books and clothing, then stocks and automobiles --  
as more households become comfortable doing business on the 
Internet, some are now making their single-greatest financial 
commitment online as well. 
</P>
<P>
	And more and more, financial institutions, large and small, are  
scrambling to put mortgage application services online so they 
won't be left out of what some predict will be a market bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
	Forrester Research Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., estimates online  
mortgages will capture nearly 10 percent of the $1.3 trillion 
mortgage market by the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits of searching for a mortgage online are obvious:  
Besides the convenience of shopping 24 hours a day from the comfort 
of home, it saves time and energy. 
</P>
<P>
	But will it save money? Sometimes, but not always, industry  
experts warn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to get wrapped up in all the bells and whistles --  
like the fancy calculators. But there are still many deals in the 
local marketplace that will beat any deal you may get at the Net,'' 
said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a Butler, 
N.J., mortgage research firm, which also publishes data online 
(www.hsh.com). 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, it's sometimes difficult to tell much about an  
online lender. It may have a fancy Web site but turn out to be a 
one-person operation in the middle of nowhere. He suggests 
borrowers exercise some caution before divulging personal financial 
information, or at least try to learn something abut the lender and 
how their privacy will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should think of the Net as a tool, a very powerful tool,  
that will help you find out what's available (in mortgage 
information), but it's not an end all,'' Gumbinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter G. Miller, author of several home buying books and  
operator of a a consumer information Web site (www.ourbroker.com), 
agreed that one of the greatest advantages of the Internet is that 
it provides PC users with quick access to reams of data that would 
have taken days, or weeks, to amass off-line. But it's only one of 
many mediums, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radio didn't replace newspaper and television didn't replace  
radio. The Internet isn't going to replace other media,'' he said. 
``I think the myth of the Internet is that it's always better, and 
I don't think that's necessarily true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many lenders, however, maintain they do provide significant  
savings for online customers. In fact, they say, the wide 
availability of information over the Internet has helped keep rates 
and fees competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Countrywide Home Loans of Calabasas, Calif., the nation's  
largest independent mortgage lender (www.countrywide.com), says 
qualified online borrowers can get up to a 1 1/4 point discount in 
closing costs. (A point is 1 percent of the total loan value.) 
</P>
<P>
	Finet Holdings Corp., of Walnut Creek, Calif., (www.finet.com)  
which operates iQualify and Interloan, charges online customers on 
average half a point in commission fees vs. 1.25 percent off-line. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Rawitch, Finet president, says customers can do part of  
their transaction online -- perhaps prequalifying -- and the rest 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people want a complete online experience, some want their  
hand held, some like a little bit of both,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsan -- who has refinanced twice in a year, the last time with  
Finet -- says he's done it all three ways and prefers working mainly 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	But the way things are set up right now, he and other online  
customers still need to have some contact with humans -- a notary 
brings papers to sign and loan officers bring electronic scanners 
to transmit important documents from your home. And most closings 
are face to face, although some can be conducted via 
teleconferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting technology, and we've only just started,''  
said Harold Otto, who maintains the Web site for New York Mortgage 
Exchange, of Yonkers, N.Y., (http://sal.net/mortgage) which began 
accepting online applications over a year ago, and now conducts 35 
percent of its business electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wait 'til next year,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> State Lotteries Face Squeeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After decades of remarkable growth, lottery  
sales are slipping because of competition from video gambling and 
casinos. For all the publicity surrounding winners of the biggest 
jackpots, 15 states recorded lower sales last year than in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Lotteries have been around longer than the American flag. In  
fact, the Virginia Company of London launched raffles in 1612 to 
raise money for the English colony in Jamestown. But King James I 
banned them nine years later. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, lotteries have flourished in this country  
since the late 1960s; 37 states and the District of Columbia now 
have them. Just last week, a Massachusetts babysitter won $197 
million in the Big Game, the largest undivided pot ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But 17 of the lotteries reported decreased sales in 1997, and 10  
were down last year compared to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hailed as a pain-free alternative to taxes and derided as  
government-sponsored vice, lotteries are feeling the squeeze of 
market and political forces. Overall ticket sales grew by only 0.4 
percent last year, the smallest increase since states introduced 
lotteries three decades ago, according to LaFleur's Lottery World, 
which tracks such statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a national panel on gambling appears poised to call  
for restrictions on the types of innovation and promotion that 
states can use to pull their lotteries out of the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a difficult time,'' said Terri LaFleur, who publishes  
the magazine that carries her name. ``Sales are beginning to mature 
in a number of states, but many lotteries are not allowed to 
expand. As a result of other gambling opportunities out there -- 
casinos, video gaming machines at racetracks -- there is a lot of 
competition for gambling dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonexistent in the United States as recently as 1963, state  
lotteries had mushroomed into a $36 billion business by last year. 
The states and the nation's capital netted $12 billion last year 
and new lotteries are under consideration in Alabama, North 
Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are signs that public interest is waning as  
states try to squeeze more profit out of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, for instance, lottery sales dropped for four  
straight years before rebounding in 1998. In Texas, sales dropped 
from $3.76 billion in 1997 to $3.1 billion in 1998. Lottery 
officials blame a 1997 legislative change that cut the prize payout 
on scratch-off games to increase the state's profit. 
</P>
<P>
	David B. Gale, executive director of the North American  
Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, attributes slumping 
sales in part to ``jackpot fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, when he was marketing director for the Ohio Lottery,  
``everybody went crazy for a $1 million jackpot, including the 
media,'' he said. ``Today, it seems there is a threshold out there 
of about $20-25 million when the players become interested in the 
games and the media gets interested in covering it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lotteries have responded by joining forces to create multistate  
games like Powerball, which last year awarded a record $295.7 
million jackpot to a group of machinists from Ohio, and the Big 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
	State lotteries are trying to broaden their appeal in other  
ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota and West Virginia  
have entered the booming field of ``video lottery,'' which commonly 
takes the form of video poker or slot machines. And scratch-off 
games are getting new themes and creative prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	But further efforts to boost slumping sales could be hindered by  
the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which is to release 
a report in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members say they were struck by the findings of Duke  
University professors Charles Clotfelter and Philip Cook, authors 
of a 1989 book on lotteries called ``Selling Hope.'' Their study 
found that 5 percent of lottery players account for 51 percent of 
sales and spend an average of $3,500 a year on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission may discourage lotteries from offering  
``casino-type activities'' such as video poker and urge them to 
tone down advertising pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``My greatest concern about the lottery is that it preys on the  
desperation of the poor, maybe more than any other form of 
gambling,'' said commission member James Dobson, president of Focus 
on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
	States and their lotteries are taking steps to polish their  
image. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to complaints about overly aggressive marketing,  
Connecticut lawmakers agreed recently to remove more than 200 
lottery vending machines from supermarkets and other stores. 
</P>
<P>
	After being criticized for a series of ad campaigns, including  
one with the slogan ``Call in Sick Next Year,'' the Louisiana 
Lottery Corp. adopted what president Randy Davis calls ``hype-free 
advertising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the lotteries are thinking the same way -- getting  
away from the promise of wealth and riches,'' Davis said. ``The 
fact of the matter is, the odds against winning some of these large 
jackpots are rather long.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Shanghai Vie for Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- American children often beg their parents to  
bring them to Disneyland and developers hope that more Asian 
children will soon do the same -- as both Hong Kong and Shanghai vie 
to become the next Asian city with a Disney theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong is in talks with Walt Disney Co. about building a park  
here. In Shanghai, which hopes someday to unseat Hong Kong as 
China's financial center, the mayor is publicly clamoring for a 
Disney park. 
</P>
<P>
	The race to get Disney underscores a long-standing rivalry  
between the two cities. Although it remains unclear whether Disney 
is taking a serious look at Shanghai, Mayor Xu Kuangdi has some 
powerful allies in Beijing, which can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Chinese leaders from Premier Zhu Rongji down are pushing  
Disney to locate in Shanghai and build a smaller park in Hong Kong, 
according to a source familiar with Disney's China operations. The 
source spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Zhu called on Disney chairman Michael Eisner during his  
recent tour of the United States, it's unclear whether they talked 
about Shanghai or Hong Kong or both. 
</P>
<P>
	For China, engaging Disney marks a dramatic change from just  
three years ago, when officials threatened to rein in its business 
over a film about the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner clearly has his eyes on China, where he has predicted  
millions of people will ``love Mickey no less than Big Mac.'' But 
not all things Disney may succeed here. ``Mulan,'' an 
uncontroversial animated tale of a legendary Chinese heroine, was 
recently released in China but reportedly drew far fewer fans than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts warn that it will take more than just fans for any  
Disney park to succeed among the Chinese. The fans also have to be 
able to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about trying to attract fairly poor people to  
an expensive place,'' said Andy Xie, an economist with Morgan 
Stanley in Hong Kong. Xie estimates a mainland Chinese family of 
three would have to spend about $700 -- half a respectable yearly 
salary -- for a quick visit to a Hong Kong Disneyland. Incomes in 
Hong Kong, a prosperous former British colony, are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shanghai boosters say a park there could lure 9 million  
visitors a year, and Hong Kong talks about 5 million, Disney will 
focus on the right mix of financing, available land and government 
approval, said Christopher Dixon, New York-based entertainment 
analyst for PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that if they build a theme park, people  
will come,'' Dixon said. The trick is to make money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Disney won't say whether it's talking with Shanghai,  
the same stance the company took for months as rumors swirled about 
a park in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman John Dreyer wouldn't rule out a Shanghai  
Disneyland. ``There's no reason why we can't have a park in 
Shanghai as well as Hong Kong,'' Dreyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials refuse to discuss Shanghai's intentions,  
though they hope to have their own Disney deal in hand by June, a 
prospect that has become the talk of the town as Hong Kong 
struggles through recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the choice of Hong Kong and Shanghai, many analysts  
say Hong Kong's better infrastructure, communications and skilled 
workers make it a better choice. 
</P>
<P>
	While the popularity of Disney might seem a good bet in Hong  
Kong, where people line up and get into fights over special edition 
Winnie the Poohs and Snoopy figurines, local critics worry Disney 
might drive too hard a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, says he'll kill  
any deal that's bad for Hong Kong, though specifics on talks have 
been closely guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Property analysts predict Hong Kong will either have to give  
away the land -- a site on outlying Lantau Island near the new 
airport is under discussion -- or sell it cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
	Luring other Asians could be tricky. Japanese already have a  
Disneyland in Tokyo, and southeast Asians are suffering through 
serious economic crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Chinese theme parks have had a rough ride. Most are  
expensive and located far outside urban areas, making them hard to 
get to in a society with few cars. Profits have been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	One Chinese theme park executive, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said the market was ``not good,'' though he acknowledged 
that Disney might be able to offer something new.

<HEADLINE> FTC Member Questions Intel Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission will have a  
difficult time enforcing its proposed antitrust settlement with 
microchip giant Intel Corp., says the sole agency commissioner who 
opposed the government's original complaint against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Commissioner Orson Swindle, the dissenter in the 3-1 vote  
last summer, also expressed doubt on whether the government would 
have won its lawsuit had it not settled with the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given my reservations about the merits of the complaint, I  
would be more concerned about the order -- comprising a 
difficult-to-enforce mandate to 'sin no more,' with a major proviso 
and some significant exceptions -- if it seemed likely to impose 
real and significant restrictions on Intel,'' Swindle said in a 
written statement released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, the FTC accused Intel of holding a monopoly in  
the market for microprocessors, the ``brains'' of computers. The 
suit charged Intel illegally used its monopoly power to withhold 
key technical information about its future chips from three 
companies: Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp. and Compaq 
Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC claims Intel withheld the data to punish the companies  
for refusing to license key patents to Intel without charge. In the 
process, according to the government, Intel's actions hurt 
consumers by curbing innovation and barring other companies from 
potentially entering the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Intel reached a settlement with the government just as  
the case was to begin a lengthy hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency commissioners voted 3-0 to approve the settlement, which  
will become final after a 60-day public comment period now under 
way. Swindle did not vote because he was on medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Intel promised to share important  
technical details with other companies about its computer chips, 
but allowed for exceptions in rare circumstances. In return, Intel 
was not required to admit it has monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle said he expects the FTC will have a hard time enforcing  
the settlement because ``it is extremely doubtful that Intel is 
going to create any kind of record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that my pessimism is unwarranted but the key terms of  
the order seem destined to enmesh the commission in expensive, and 
perhaps intractable, enforcement proceedings if Intel is ever 
suspected of violating it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle also questioned why the FTC's filed its original  
complaint against Intel and ``for injecting a government agency 
into the dynamic workings of a fast-moving, high-technology 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also challenged whether Intel's hold on the microchip market  
``is as unassailable as the complaint suggests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel products run roughly 85 percent of the world's personal  
computers. The company had sales of $26.2 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Swindle pointed out that Intel now faces unprecedented  
competition in supplying chips for low-end personal computers, an 
area where a good portion of consumer demand has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Available information has not dispelled my questions about  
whether Intel has monopoly power -- as opposed to just an extremely 
large market share -- in general-purpose microprocessors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, the remaining FTC commissioners -- Sheila  
F. Anthony, Mozelle Thompson and Chairman Robert Pitofsky -- said 
they are confident that agency and Intel attorneys ``have done a 
commendable job of crafting a remedy that addresses serious 
potential competitive harm without significantly hindering Intel's 
legitimate business activity.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Internet Death Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- A man whose Internet romance with  
a French woman ended in her apparent suicide won't face charges in 
her death, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said Julie Yasa, 28, traveled to the United States  
in February to meet the 24-year-old man after a six-month e-mail 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	After a one-time sexual encounter, the man drove Ms. Yasa to a  
motel, then turned her away when she showed up at his apartment, 
police said. Her body was found March 3 near the man's apartment. 
She died after taking an excessive dose of a sleep aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely nothing we can charge him with in regard to  
her death,'' prosecutor Jim Halushka told the Detroit Free Press 
for a story Saturday. ``There's no good samaritan law in Michigan. 
It's not against the law to lack respect for human life. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief William Dwyer said he had hoped the man would be  
charged with something, perhaps assisted suicide.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at Another High: 10,493.89 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors continued to unload technology stocks  
in favor of blue-chip industrial companies today, sending the Dow 
Jones industrial average to its fifth consecutive closing high -- 
10,493.89, up 31.17 The last time the Dow pulled off the feat of a 
new closing high every day in the week was March 16 through 20 of 
last year. this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators finished lower.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose despite a brutal 7-point drop in IBM, which tumbled  
along with other technology stocks and lopped more than 30 points 
off the Dow's gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for IBM, the Dow would be higher,'' said Arthur  
Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. ``Anything related to 
that beautiful technology world is being taken out to the 
woodshed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers had a strong 2-to-1 lead over decliners on the New  
York Stock Exchange. Volume was heavy on the Big Board and at 
record-high levels in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was helped higher by Kodak, which reported  
stronger-than-expected earnings, and by industrial names 
Caterpillar and General Motors. Oil stocks climbed as oil futures 
topped $17 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	But technology stocks, which have dropped sharply all week, had  
another day of weakness. Leading the decline was Sun Microsystems, 
down more than 4 points after topping analysts' earnings 
expectations but issuing a warnings about its future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the volatility today was the expiration of June  
stock-index options and future positions, known as ``double 
witching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.85 to 1,319.00, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 39.34 to 2,482.43.

<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 2-to-1  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,061 up, 1,024 down 
and 473 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 998.29 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.08  
billion in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air Loses Delta Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Korean Air, blistered in a safety report by  
two of its pilots, lost its flight partnership with Delta Air Lines 
on Friday, a day after the foreign carrier had another fatal plane 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, Delta had said it stood by its ``code-share''  
arrangement, despite the dissemination of an internal Korean Air 
report raising safety concerns at the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Under code-sharing, passengers traveling to Asia on a Delta  
ticket might make some legs of their trip on planes operated by 
Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta would not code-share with any carrier it did not believe  
to be safe,'' Delta spokesman Clay McConnell said Wednesday. He 
reaffirmed the statement after the crash Thursday of a Korean Air 
cargo jet in Shanghai, China. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Delta announced suspension of its partnership and  
said it would not book passengers on flights operated by Korean Air 
pending review of the airline's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta will begin immediately to contact Delta customers booked  
on KAL-operated flights to assist them in making alternative travel 
arrangements,'' the Atlanta-based carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's internal safety review stemmed from the carrier's  
troublesome track record: More than 700 people killed in 20 years, 
among them 228 who died when a Korean Air 747 flew into a hill on 
Guam in August 1997 and 269 killed when a Soviet MiG fighter shot 
down KAL Flight 007 after the 747 strayed into the Soviet Union's 
airspace in September 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, United Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, has  
had 140 passenger deaths in the same two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Korean Air picked 19 of its pilots to participate in  
an internal safety review. A report written by two of them 
highlighted a number of incidents: 
</P>
<P>
	--During an airport approach, a copilot responded to air traffic  
instructions intended for another plane and veered off course. The 
captain responded by hitting him on the back of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
	--While planning an airline flight, a crew did not discuss the  
expected weather or the amount of fuel necessary. Such decisions, 
they said, should be made by the captain alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the report: In-flight newspaper reading by flight crews.  
Alternate landing sites not approved for the size of plane flown. 
Arguments between a pilot and a dispatcher about how much fuel to 
load for an ocean crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report surfaced recently on the Internet. While the airline  
confirmed its authenticity, Korean Air officials said the findings 
were exaggerated and out of line with observations made by the 
other 17 pilots in the safety review. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found some issues, but nowhere near the degree of these  
two pilots,'' said airline spokeswoman Penny Pfaelzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hardy, a captain and Korean Air's deputy director of flight  
operations, said: ``What they ended up reporting in that document, 
they ended up pumping out, a lot of that is like barroom talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy said Korean Air has had problems, but the Guam crash  
marked a turning point for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident prompted senior management to begin a $114 million  
safety overhaul, including a top-to-bottom review of Korean Air's 
flight operations. The carrier also recruited more experienced 
pilots from Western carriers and hired safety consultants from 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's being done here is to take this airline and this flight  
operations department and make it state-of-the-art,'' Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's problems may stem in part from its rapid growth.  
Thirty years ago, it was an eight-plane local carrier. Using former 
pilots from South Korea's air force, it has exploded into the 
world's 13th-largest passenger airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, the two pilots, whom Korean Air refused to  
name, said some problems are rooted in a culture in which pilots 
defer to their seniors, even when they make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently, in some Korean cockpits, there is a volatile  
cocktail of complacency, arrogance, apathy and a lack of 
self-discipline,'' the pilots wrote. ``These attitudes must be 
removed from the flight deck at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees safety of  
U.S. skies, said Korean officials are responsible for the safety of 
the airline. The agency could ground an individual plane for safety 
problems, but under international aviation treaties, South Korea's 
government has responsibility for maintaining the carrier's safety 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Thursday's crash, which occurred shortly after  
takeoff, is under investigation, but an airline executive said it 
may have been the result of a terrorist act. It killed the 
three-member crew and at least five people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other signs of lingering problems at Korean Air.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a company jet skidded off a runway while landing in  
Pohang, South Korea and split in two. Nineteen passengers were 
injured. In September, another plane overshot a runway, and a month 
before that, a Korean Air Boeing 747 skidded off a runway in Seoul 
and tore off its landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	After the runway accidents and several other minor incidents  
last year, South Korean officials ordered the carrier to cut back 
domestic flights by 15 percent for six months. The restriction is 
to end April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy, the flight operations director, said the airline is  
improving, which was evident during an incident at Chicago's O'Hare 
airport this month. An Air China jet mistakenly turned onto a 
runway where a Korean Air Boeing 747 was taking off, but the 
captain of the jumbo jet avoided a crash by making a sharp turn out 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain displayed excellent situational awareness, made a  
great set of decisions,'' Hardy said. ``But the airline remains 
under a high level of scrutiny.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grains and soybeans futures prices were mixed in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat traders were uncertain about possible damage from freezing

the freeze may not be as bad as first thought, said Dale Gustafson, 
grains analyst for Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices also were pressured by the rainy weather.  
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, wheat for May delivery was down 1 3/4 to $2.60 3/4  
a bushel; May corn rose 1/4 cents to $2.20 a bushel; May oats rose 2 3/4

<HEADLINE> Judge Halts Schott's Sale of Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott's tug-of-war for control of the  
Cincinnati Reds spilled into court on Friday as a judge temporarily 
blocked her preliminary agreement to sell to a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came one day after the team's limited partners sued  
in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court, claiming she had entered 
into a ``contrived'' agreement with cousin Steve Schott to prevent 
them from buying her out. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Ruehlman granted the partners' request for a  
temporary restraining order. Ruehlman will hear arguments on April 
29 and decide whether to extend the order. 
</P>
<P>
	James Burke, a lawyer for the partners, was pleased by the  
ruling but declined further comment. Schott did not return messages 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed with the court show that Schott is trying to  
retain a high profile with the club even after she sells her 
controlling shares. 
</P>
<P>
	She agreed to sell last November rather than face another  
suspension from major league baseball. Schott, who took over the 
team in the mid-1980s, can be forced out by the limited partners 
when the current ownership agreement expires at the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	She signed a preliminary purchase agreement on Feb. 11 with  
Larry Dolan, the brother of Cablevision Systems Corp.'s chairman, 
to sell all but one of her 6 1/2 shares for $65 million. She scrawled 
a dog's paw and ``02'' next to her signature, an indication that 
her St. Bernard also approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal included guarantees that she would maintain her office  
at Cinergy Field and have an office in the club's new ballpark, 
scheduled to open in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said she would have a private luxury suite in the new  
stadium and access to 16 lower-level seats. She also would have 
input on other team matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has final say over any deal and most  
likely would reject any provision that keeps Schott in a high 
profile. She has repeatedly been disciplined by the other owners 
for inflammatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners have the right to match any offer for  
Schott's shares within 30 days and sent Schott a letter saying they 
would match Dolan's offer on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Schott sent the partners a letter rejecting their  
matching offer, claiming Dolan's offer ``does not exist.'' She also 
said she would enter into another deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from Dolan dated April 1 said Schott was ``mistaken''  
and emphasized that he still intended to buy her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Monday, Schott informed the partners of her deal to sell  
her shares for $67 million to a group that includes cousin Steve 
Schott. He would receive an estimated $2.68 million payment for his 
role in arranging the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with her cousin gives Schott even more favorable  
treatment after she sells. In addition to an office and luxury 
suite at the ballpark, she would get 21 tickets and an opportunity 
to participate in the annual opening day parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever purchases her shares also would contribute $250,000  
toward naming rights to a team museum in the new stadium. It would 
be called the ``Schott Hall of Fame/Museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners want Ruehlman to rule that Steve Schott's  
offer is invalid and that the partners have properly matched 
Dolan's deal, clearing the way for them to buy controlling 
interest.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Had Great Impact on Lemieux </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- To understand the impact Wayne Gretzky had on  
a young Mario Lemieux, remember this: Lemieux's No. 66 was 
Gretzky's No. 99 turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, the six-time NHL scoring champion and prospective  
Pittsburgh Penguins owner, was only 15 and virtually unknown 
outside Quebec when Gretzky took an interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was the first NHL star to take Lemieux to dinner, to a  
nightclub, to treat him as an equal. Apparently, Gretzky was as 
good a talent scout as he was a scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	That first meeting with Gretzky created such an impression that  
Lemieux asked to wear No. 99 in junior hockey. Told that might not 
be wise -- to hockey fans, there was only one No. 99 -- Lemieux 
settled on No. 66. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's meant a lot to game, he's really changed the game and  
changed the approach of many young players,'' Lemieux said Friday, 
shortly before Gretzky announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, Gretzky's final game on Sunday will be against  
Lemieux's old team, the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``All young players wanted to be like him. He really changed the  
game in the early 1980s with the scoring titles and the records and 
the Stanley Cups and being a great team guy,'' Lemieux said of 
Gretzky, who won 10 NHL scoring titles and nine MVP awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who has not watched much hockey since retiring two  
years ago, tuned in Thursday to watch the New York Rangers' 2-2 tie 
at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched Wayne's last game in Canada as well as his very  
emotional press conference and I was overcome with emotion,'' 
Lemieux said. ``On one hand I am very happy for Wayne; he has 
accomplished so much in his career and he is able to leave the game 
on his own terms, which is very special. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, like all of his fans, I am sad to see  
hockey lose its greatest player and its greatest ambassador.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two did not always maintain their early friendship during a  
13-year NHL rivalry that prompted numerous debates over which truly 
deserved to be called the Great One. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux was discouraged in 1987 when Gretzky was chosen over him  
as the MVP of the Canada Cup, even though Lemieux had 11 goals in 
seven games against the USSR. And Lemieux was nearly in tears in 
1989 after Gretzky beat him out for the NHL MVP award that Lemieux 
felt he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, Gretzky felt Lemieux had too many lazy work habits  
early in his career and didn't fully use his enormous talents. 
Gretzky had to work hard to dominate and wasn't impressed when 
others didn't do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky also wasn't happy when Lemieux dumped agent Bob Perno,  
who, with Gus Badali, also represented Gretzky. Lemieux wasn't even 
among the 700 invited guests to Gretzky's wedding to Janet Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	And for players so similar in production, with 16 NHL scoring  
titles between them, they were strikingly dissimilar as people. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux was tall and physically dominating; Gretzky was smaller  
and more resourceful. Gretzky was popular with sponsors, corporate 
types and the media; Lemieux was private and preferred playing golf 
to filming commercials or giving interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were too much alike as scorers and as stars to ever  
become enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Lemieux's first year in the NHL in 1984, the two  
hosted a charity golf tournament with an admission fee of ... what 
else, $66.99. And Gretzky attended the game in which Lemieux broke 
Gretzky's single-season junior scoring record, nearly missing an 
Edmonton Oilers' curfew to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 1987 Canada Cup in which Gretzky, the biggest star in  
hockey, served mostly as Lemieux's playmaker, Gretzky said, ``We 
found out that we weren't just friends. We were icemates. We 
understood each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My fondest memory of Wayne is undoubtedly, the Canada Cup,''  
Lemieux said Friday. ``Practicing with and playing alongside Wayne 
for six weeks was the turning point in my career. He showed me how 
to win and for that, I am eternally grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Gretzky wonders if Lemieux, who quit at 31 rather than  
Gretzky's 38, might not have become the Greatest One if No. 66 
hadn't played lost a significant chunk of his career to back 
injuries and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wish Wayne the very best in his post-playing career  
and when things calm down, I look forward to seeing him on the golf 
course,'' Lemieux said.

<HEADLINE> Solar Turbines Cutting 600 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) --Solar Turbines, hard hit by the oil industry  
slump, is eliminating 600 jobs or about 10 percent of its work 
force around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego-based maker of gas turbines said the cuts will  
affect a combination of permanent full-time workers along with 
temporary and part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Solar Turbines, a subsidiary of heavy-equipment manufacturer  
Caterpillar Inc., said Wednesday it had issued layoff notices to 
100 employees in San Diego and another 50 at offices in other 
cities across the country this week while ``several hundred'' 
others have left voluntarily or through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with 5,900 employees, makes turbine engines for oil  
and gas production and for industrial power generation and 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs are part of a broader cost-cutting program at the  
firm. Caterpillar warned last month that earnings at Solar Turbines 
would fall 50 percent below analysts' expectations for the first 
quarter of 1999 because of reduced demand for its products, 
especially from the oil industry outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has operations in Latin America and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Russians Back Yugoslavia Link-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's hard-line parliament voted overwhelmingly  
today in favor of a resolution that supports Yugoslavia's bid to 
join a Slavic union that includes Russia and Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russian leaders have cautioned that it would take  
months to work out the details of Yugoslavia's accession to the 
union. And Moscow has stressed that it has no plans to send either 
weapons or troops to Yugoslavia to help counter NATO's daily 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move reflected the widespread Russian sympathy for  
Yugoslavia and its fierce opposition to the NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's lower house voted 293-54 in support of the  
nonbinding resolution. Eager to receive military support from 
Russia, Yugoslavia's parliament took similar action last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Russian hard-liners want Moscow to provide weapons to  
Yugoslavia in violation of an international arms embargo, but 
President Boris Yeltsin repeatedly has said Russia will not become 
involved militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The union would involve wide-ranging political and economic ties  
and could include such measures as a single currency and a unified 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The union ``is a political initiative put forward to end the  
war,'' Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of 
parliament, said in the Siberian city Novosibirsk. If the three 
states are united, they ``cannot be brushed aside by the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and Belarus negotiated for months before signing the  
union treaty two years ago, and it has produced few practical 
results. Both countries are too poor at present to provide any real 
assistance to the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's liberal Yabloko faction voted against the resolution,  
saying it ``opens the possibility for military confrontation 
between the leading nuclear powers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to NATO's bombing, Yabloko said ``the worst thing  
Russia can do today is to respond to insanity with insanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had hoped Russia could pressure its Yugoslav  
ally to accept a political solution. But Russia apparently lacks 
sufficient power or influence with either side to achieve a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Moscow has made a cease-fire a condition of any  
negotiations. NATO has said it won't stop airstrikes until Yugoslav 
forces pull out of Kosovo and meet other demands.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Commandos' Claim Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 200 South Vietnamese commandos who  
were captured and tortured while on secret intelligence missions 
for the United States have been denied veterans benefits by the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters determined that the  
commandos ``shall not be considered active duty for purposes of all 
laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs,'' wrote 
James D. Johnston, executive secretary of the Civilian Military 
Service Review Board, to the commandos' lawyer this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The board is charged with reviewing whether civilians or  
contract workers who provided service to the military can receive 
veterans benefits. It makes a recommendation to the Air Force 
secretary, who makes the final decision on behalf of the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If parachuting and engaging in combat operations in North  
Vietnam isn't active duty, I don't know what is,'' said the lawyer, 
John C. Mattes of Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattes is also pursuing veterans status for the men through  
federal court in Boston. Many of the commandos are in frail health 
due to years of imprisonment and want to be declared veterans so 
they can get government health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers are also opposing the commandos' claim in  
court. But part of their argument was that the commandos were 
already pursuing an administrative remedy. Now that that's been 
denied by the Pentagon, it's unclear if the government's position 
in the court case will change. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Vietnam War, the commandos infiltrated North Vietnam  
as part of covert intelligence missions. They were captured by the 
North Vietnamese, who had been tipped off to their mission, and 
declared dead by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress earmarked $20 million for the commandos,  
enough to pay each man or his survivors $40,000. That was $2,000 
for every year of captivity, on average. Those imprisoned for more 
than 20 years could receive up to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The commandos' case had been championed by several lawmakers,  
including Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a decorated Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	In making their decisions, the Pentagon and review board  
essentially accepted last year's determination by Army historians 
that the commandos -- although they were on U.S.-run and U.S.-funded 
missions -- were really contracted to the U.S.-allied government of 
the former South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The commandos were ``created and organized by the South  
Vietnamese authorities, but at the request of, and with the 
assistance of, first the Central Intelligence Agency, and then the 
Department of Defense,'' according to a March 22, 1999, memo 
outlining the board's reasons for denying the commandos' claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The commandos answered to South Vietnamese officers and were  
integrated into that country's military, which determined their 
pay, the memo said. The commandos also weren't subject to U.S. 
military discipline and were free to abandon their missions up 
until the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, there is no convincing evidence the commandos  
expected that their service ... would be considered active military 
service with the U.S. Armed Forces,'' the memo said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Strikes Appear Ineffective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZRZE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Burning villages. Well-fed Serb soldiers  
flashing victory signs. Inside Kosovo, there is no sign that the 
Serbs are scared and running from NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, there is evidence that Kosovo Albanians remain unwanted  
in the province. And that Serb police and Yugoslav army units are 
hunkering down for a long conflict, more than three weeks into a 
NATO air campaign meant to bomb Belgrade into accepting a political 
solution for the rebellious province. 
</P>
<P>
	Escorted by Serb army personnel on a 36-hour trip that ended  
Friday, reporters in Kosovo saw the carnage of what Yugoslav 
officials say was a NATO strike against a convoy of ethnic Albanian 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also saw parts of villages up in smoke, supporting  
refugee testimony of a continuing Serb push to drive Albanians out 
of their homes. Also evident were dug-in tanks, decoy cannon meant 
to draw NATO fire -- and high morale among army and police units who 
are supposed to be the targets of the NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The limitations of what NATO calls a limited air campaign were  
evident in the stretch of Kosovo toured. 
</P>
<P>
	Destroyed barracks and a warehouse attested to the devastating  
punch of NATO airstrikes in Gnjilane, 25 miles southeast of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	But there, and elsewhere, police and army personnel moved freely  
in civilian vehicles without fear of attack. Others relaxed in full 
view in roadside cafes or in sandbagged but loosely guarded 
fortifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can wait out this war without any problems,'' said a  
policeman dressed in a blue camouflage uniform, speaking in German 
at one of the few stops during the journey. ``We are patient -- for 
months, or years, we have time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such contacts with Serbs -- whether civilians or in uniform --  
were rare. Organized by the Yugoslav army, the trip, which entered 
and left Kosovo at Bujanovac, 25 miles southeast of Pristina, the 
provincial capital, had another purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	It was meant to back up official assertions that a NATO air  
attack targeted Kosovo Albanian refugees, killing 75 and wounding 
dozens of others, and requests for other glimpses within the 
province were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters brought by bus to the vicinity of Zrze, 30 miles  
southwest of Pristina, saw gruesome signs of several explosions -- 
charred bodies and body parts, a head lying in a field and 
destroyed tractors and vans sitting near huge craters. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO assertions that an armed convoy was targeted,  
ethnic Albanian civilians, speaking through official Serb 
translators, said only civilians were struck from the air. Several 
were in tears as they recounted losing family members in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the road, however, was evidence of a continued  
campaign against ethnic Albanians in the province, gathered from 
the top level of a two-tiered army bus and from hasty conversations 
with residents. 
</P>
<P>
	A stretch of road between Zrze and Prizren to the southeast was  
flanked on one side by hundreds of destroyed houses, clustered in 
several villages. Many of them were burned but otherwise undamaged, 
suggesting they were set ablaze and not shelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the destruction, untouched Serb homes displayed neat front  
lawns and plots of bright red and yellow tulips. 
</P>
<P>
	Dark gray smoke was sighted from villages nearly a dozen times  
on the roads from Bujanovac to Zrze and back, indicating new fires, 
despite the lack of any fighting. Of scores of buildings seen 
damaged and vandalized, many were stores with Albanian-language 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Prizren, the city southeast of Zrze, several ethnic Albanians  
introduced by officials as survivors of the convoy attack shrugged 
and refused to answer when asked what the burning houses meant. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Zrze, at the site of one of the attacks, Genc Huis, an  
ethnic Albanian refugee, nervously evaded the same question, saying 
only: ``Of course houses burn. This is a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs -- whether soldiers, police or civilians -- appeared relaxed  
on all stops of the journey. 
</P>
<P>
	At Bujanovac, dozens stared into the sky, apparently looking for  
NATO jets after hearing them above. There was no sign of fear, just 
curiosity. Several husky soldiers in green-brown camouflage 
uniforms grinned as the reporters' bus sped by, flashing victory 
signs or the three-fingered salute of Serb superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of military vehicles meant to be hidden from aerial view  
were sighted. Among them were trucks parked in garages, inside 
partially destroyed Albanian houses or camouflaged in parks and 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Several armored vehicles were dug in among the stunted brush  
covering the hills leading to the snowcapped peaks of Brezovica, 
Kosovo's highest mountain, south of Prizren. And on a field 
northwest of Urosevac, about half a dozen mock field cannons were 
set up, clearly meant to fool NATO aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	At a stop in the hilltop village of Strpsa -- not far from burned  
out houses, one of them still smoking, a Serb man chasing shots of 
raki, an anise-flavored brandy, with beer at a hilltop cafe smiled 
mockingly when asked if he knew of any attacks on Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are the barbarians, not us, with your bombing,'' he told a  
reporter. ``And we know nothing of burning houses.''

<HEADLINE> Groups Target Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Milton Reynolds knew the drill.  
</P>
<P>
	Accused of running a stop sign by white policemen, the black  
schoolteacher said he was ordered out of his car by an officer 
``staring me down through his shades like some kind of B-grade 
movie while stroking the barrel of a shotgun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket was later dropped, but Reynolds isn't letting go of  
what he calls the larger issue -- the harassment of minorities by 
police forces wedded to race-based ``profiles'' of likely bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was essentially what put me over the edge,'' he said. ``I  
said, `This is not going to happen to me anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds joined the American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday  
in announcing a new campaign in California aimed at exposing the 
``crime'' of DWB -- ``driving while black'' -- the routine stopping 
of minorities for no reason other than their skin color. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has bred mistrust across the country and led to  
several Justice Department investigations. On Thursday, Attorney 
General Janet Reno called on police departments to begin collecting 
data on the race of citizens who are stopped in order to assess the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that a good many of those police officers who are not  
trusted should be trusted, and somehow or another we have to bridge 
the gap between what is real and what is not and operate based on 
fact,'' Reno said at a National Press Club luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Police chiefs from some of the nation's largest departments said  
they will work to create a national traffic stop policy to ensure 
that minorities are not unfairly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February, when white officers fired a barrage of bullets  
and killed an African immigrant in New York City, the public's 
attention on police treatment of minorities has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
	Racial profiling may not convey the horror of overt brutality,  
but civil rights groups say it is no less insidious -- and far more 
common. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being targeted by police and treated like criminals is  
humiliating and demeaning,'' said Michelle Alexander, director of 
the ACLU's Racial Justice Project. ``Having your car searched, 
being frisked, being asked about who you are and what you're doing 
in a particular neighborhood -- all of these things remind us that 
we're second-class citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU's campaign in California includes billboards in the San  
Francisco Bay area that show three young black men with the 
caption, ``If I had a dollar for every time I've been pulled over 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billboards designed for Hispanics also are planned, along with  
radio spots throughout the state. Since it began a toll-free 
``driving while black or brown'' hot line last year, the ACLU said 
it has logged complaints from 1,000 Californians who have been 
stopped by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander said the stops contribute to the often adversarial  
relationship between police and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of California's largest police agencies -- San Jose and San  
Diego -- decided this year to track police stops to see whether 
enforcement is based on skin color or other characteristics, 
decisions applauded by Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU directors urged legislators to require California to  
compile annual statistics. And in Washington on Wednesday, 
lawmakers introduced a bill calling for similar statistics to be 
collected by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Police organizations in California and nationally have said such  
studies would burden law enforcers and lengthen traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said race-based traffic stops  
are a ``national insult to our minority community.'' The Justice 
Department is investigating the New Jersey State Police over just 
those sorts of allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar accusations have been made in Florida, Maryland,  
Connecticut and elsewhere along the Interstate 95 corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts have said that race can be among the factors used in  
determining whether a suspect should be questioned. But at a 
meeting of President Clinton's race panel last year, Reno said 
police action must not be based on racial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, who keeps a stained yellow traffic ticket in his  
wallet as a reminder of the traffic stop, said he believes 
stereotypes do motivate police conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Marr, an Asian teen-ager from Vallejo, said he's been  
pulled over several times by officers since he began driving three 
months ago. Once, officers told him his tail light was out and 
searched his car, even checking a piece of pizza wrapped in 
aluminum foil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do anything wrong,'' said Marr, whose tail light was  
working.

<HEADLINE> Military Flights Over Italy Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flight safety procedures at Aviano Air Base in  
Italy were sufficient at the time of a fatal Marine Corps accident 
last year, but some additional measures are needed to emphasize 
Italy's authority over U.S. military operations there, a joint 
U.S.-Italian review panel has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen and Italian Defense Minister  
Carlo Scognamiglio were scheduled to announce the results of the 
review at a Pentagon news conference today. U.S. defense officials 
revealed some of the results in advance of Cohen's news conference 
on condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema agreed at a  
White House meeting March 5 that a review was needed to minimize 
the chance of more accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 3, 1998, a Marine EA-6B Prowler jet flying from Aviano  
on a low-level training mission in the Italian Alps severed a ski 
gondola cable near Cavalese, sending the gondola plunging to the 
ground. Twenty people were killed. The plane was flying lower and 
faster than permitted under Italian safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
	American-Italian relations have been strained by the accident  
and its aftermath. Italy is one of the United States' most 
important allies. Thousands of U.S. troops are based in Italy. 
Aviano, in northern Italy, is currently the central staging base 
for U.S. and NATO planes involved in the war in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthlong joint review of flight safety procedures was  
headed by Adm. Joseph Prueher, a former commander of the U.S. Sixth 
Fleet based at Naples, and Italian Air Force Lt. Gen. Leonardo 
Tricarico. They visited the accident site and several military 
bases in Italy last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The review concluded that flight safety procedures at Aviano  
were adequate at the time of the accident, but they were not always 
implemented or understood by all concerned, the U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One flaw reported in the review was that U.S. command  
relationships in Italy were unclear, and this may explain why not 
all aviators were sufficiently familiar with all flight safety 
procedures, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The review recommends that a central U.S. authority -- presumably  
the commander at each base where U.S. forces operate in Italy -- be 
designated to monitor compliance with U.S. and Italian flight 
safety rules. The review also recommends other actions designed to 
reinforce Italy's authority over U.S. military operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a military jury at Camp Lejeune, N.C.,  
recommended that the navigator of the Marine jet involved in last 
year's gondola accident, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, be dismissed from 
the military for destroying a videotape of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were dismissed after the  
pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, was acquitted of manslaughter in March. 
Ashby still faces obstruction of justice charges.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Had Gift of Anticipation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the violent world of hockey, where elbows and  
fists fly at the drop of a puck, Wayne Gretzky looked misplaced -- a 
choir boy who somehow wound up on the ice. He was not exceptionally 
fast or tough or elegant. 
</P>
<P>
	What he was, though, was simply the best player to ever lace on  
skates. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up on the frozen ponds of Ontario, Gretzky learned to  
see hockey a little differently than other players, to go where the 
puck was going, not where it had been. That sounds so simple, but 
if it were that easy, everybody would do it. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the gift of anticipation, an ability to see the play  
develop before it actually did. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like somebody else, doesn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was Michael Jordan on skates, blessed with extraordinary  
skills never seen before, and the ability to apply them almost 
nonchalantly. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, it seems appropriate that three months after  
Jordan walked away from basketball without a fancy farewell tour, 
Gretzky leaves hockey the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Jordan, Gretzky had the gift of peripheral vision, able to  
see the whole rink. From his favorite spot behind the net, he 
understood the geography of the game and how plays fall in place. 
He played the game gracefully, with an economy of energy, every 
move orchestrated, together producing a symphony every night. 
</P>
<P>
	To say that Gretzky was the greatest scorer in hockey history  
does not begin to explain how important he was to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	To say that he challenged defenses to stop him -- and then  
frustrated them when they tried -- is only part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	To say that he was the cornerstone of his sport only explains  
his impact on the game in a small way. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky arrived in the pros in 1978, a callow 17-year-old kid  
who did magical things with the puck. He scored 46 goals that 
season in the last incarnation of the woeful WHA and a year later, 
he accompanied the Edmonton Oilers into the NHL. The league was 
never the same. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first NHL season, he scored 51 goals and 137 points,  
tying Marcel Dionne for the scoring championship. Because Dionne 
had two more goals, the league recognized him as the leader. No 
problem. Gretzky won the next seven scoring titles all by himself, 
then added three more later. He won nine MVP awards and led the 
Oilers to four Stanley Cups in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a league where 50 goals was once the standard, Gretzky scored  
92. In a league where no one scored 100 points until 1969, Gretzky 
scored 200 points four different times. 
</P>
<P>
	Traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, Gretzky became a hockey  
Pied Piper. He took the Kings to the Stanley Cup finals one year, 
and suddenly Hollywood discovered hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	If Southern California could have a franchise, so could Northern  
California and so the San Jose Sharks were born. Then Disney 
discovered hockey and now we have the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Soon 
hockey would come to Florida, Arizona and even North Carolina, 
largely because of the buzz that Gretzky created. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, kids all over America were wearing No. 99 hockey jerseys.  
He was a marketing bonanza for a league that had never had one 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave hockey a squeaky clean image, married to the actress  
Janet Jones, his kids on skates early, just the way he had been. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky moved to St. Louis for a brief pit stop and then came to  
New York for three final seasons, a showcase on Broadway for the 
game's greatest star. He became the classic New Yorker, a 
cosmopolitan citizen of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	And he brought his special passion for the game to the Rangers,  
helping them to the Stanley Cup semifinals in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was followed by two non-playoff finishes in a league  
where 16 of 27 teams make it to the postseason. Those 
disappointments weighed heavily on Gretzky's shoulders. Then there 
were some nagging injuries, the kind of aches amd pains that creep 
up on athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, at age 38, he decided he had reached the end, that it  
was time to move on. He leaves the game the same way he arrived, as 
his team's leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems appropriate.

<HEADLINE> Roba Seeks Boston Marathon Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ethiopia's Fatuma Roba ran through pain last year  
to win a second straight Boston Marathon. Now her leg has healed 
and she's thinking of a third straight victory -- and a course 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The hilly Hopkinton-to-Boston course is becoming familiar to  
Roba, who last year won in 2:23:21, the third fastest women's time 
in Boston Marathon history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that my training time has been effective and I will win  
the race,'' Roba said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ethiopian last year pulled away from Colleen De Reuck of  
South Africa at the 16-mile mark. Despite the leg injury, her 
victory appeared effortless to many of the 1 million spectators 
lining the course -- a misconception that makes Roba laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who are these people?'' Roba said, breaking into a smile. ``It  
is not easy. I know I have done my training and that's why I have 
won the races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roba runs about 18 miles a day on dirt roads near her home in  
the Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. For the Boston Marathon -- which she 
considers one of the most difficult courses -- Roba also does hill 
workouts to prepare for Heartbreak Hill between miles 19 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Tough head winds and unpredictable weather are also obstacles,  
and Roba said the cold may slow her time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she expected to break the record but was hindered by  
her injury during 26-plus mile run. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Uta Pippig of Germany (2:21:45 in 1994) and Joan Benoit  
Samuelson (2:22:43, in 1983) have run faster. The women's world 
mark of 2:20:47 was set last year by Kenya's Tegla Loroupe at 
Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba believes she has a chance to crack the course record in  
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about it,'' Roba said. ``Last year, I had the leg  
problem, but this year I feel in good shape physically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's field features defending champion Moses Tanui who  
finished in 2:07:34 last year. He is part of a nine-member Kenyan 
team that includes Joseph Chebet, who placed second last year in 
2:07:37, and John Kagwe, who won his second straight New York City 
Marathon last year in 2:08:12. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagwe ran a personal best and second-fastest course time of  
2:08:12 at New York in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Before her surprising victory at the 1996 Olympics in 2:26:05,  
Roba was a virtual unknown. She had won the Rome Marathon and 
Morocco's Marrakech Marathon to little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the first African woman to win the Boston  
Marathon in 1997, Roba immediately was wrapped in an Ethiopian flag 
in a display of patriotism not unique to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, she carried a small Ethiopian flag at all times,  
often breaking into a smile as she waved it to cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at me and recognize that I am black but they do  
not know where I am from,'' she said. ``This represents that I am 
an Ethiopian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many of her competitors who see her as their top  
challenger, Roba is not familiar with the other runners. She thinks 
Kenya's Catherine Ndereba, who is making her marathon debut, 
Italy's Franca Fiacconi and De Reuck have a chance at winning. 
Anuta Catuna of Romania, who placed third at Boston last year, is 
also expected to contend. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I am also included in that category,'' Roba said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiacconi won three marathons in 1998, including New York in  
2:25:17, and thinks she is the one who can beat Roba. Her strategy 
is an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to run faster,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Final 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Months of budget combat between President  
Clinton and lawmakers lie ahead now that Congress has completed a 
$1.74 trillion spending plan for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Divided along party lines, the Senate gave final approval to the  
measure on Thursday by a 54-44 vote, a day after the House passed 
it with just three Democratic votes. Only Sens. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's signature is not needed for the measure, which is an  
outline that clamps overall limits on the detailed tax and spending 
bills lawmakers will write in coming months. It is those bills, 
which the president must sign, in which Republicans will try to 
impose their priorities on the White House, or at least spell out 
their agenda to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The blueprint maps GOP plans for a new budgetary era in which  
annual federal surpluses seem to stretch to the horizon and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next decade, Republicans would set aside all $1.8  
trillion in expected Social Security surpluses to reduce the 
national debt. They would use most of the rest of the surplus -- at 
least $778 billion -- for tax cuts. Clinton and Democrats want 
smaller tax reductions and more spending for Medicare and other 
social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One party thinks government ought to get bigger and bigger,''  
said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., in a 
swipe at Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage marked only the second time Congress has completed the  
budget on time since the April 15 deadline was set in 1987, a win 
for Republicans eager to show they are efficiently doing the 
public's business. It also gave them the symbolic victory of 
approving a budget touting big tax cuts on the day many taxpayers 
were rushing to mail their returns to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats warned of veto fights and other problems ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	``I predict here and now we'll be playing Russian roulette along  
the way to see who pulls the trigger on a government shutdown'' 
because of a veto fight over spending, said Sen. Frank Lautenberg 
of New Jersey, ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg called the GOP budget ``shameful'' and ``a sham,''  
saying it would not shore up Social Security or Medicare for when 
the nation's 76 million baby boomers begin retiring next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue that by setting aside the entire Social  
Security surplus they are doing more for senior citizens because 
Clinton proposed to spend some of those surpluses on other domestic 
programs. GOP lawmakers hope this will let them neutralize 
Democrats' historic ability to cast themselves as the protectors of 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Clinton nor Republicans have proposed reducing benefits  
or boosting taxes for Social Security or Medicare, fearing angry 
voters. Many experts say such changes will be needed to truly 
prepare those programs for the baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say using surpluses to reduce the national debt  
should fuel economic growth by reducing interest rates. A stronger 
economy should help the government raise revenue in the future to 
pay retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a timetable established by the budget, Congress will  
consider must-pass spending bills at the same time tax-cutting 
legislation is ready. That could create a scenario for a possible 
trade-off late this summer with Republicans getting some tax cuts 
while Clinton and Democrats win some spending increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP budget promises that as they write the 13 annual  
spending bills for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, Republicans 
will honor spending limits enacted in the 1997 budget-balancing 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans, however, say those caps are so  
tight that there will never be enough votes in the House and 
Senate, which Republicans control by thin margins, to approve many 
of the spending bills. Even if they are passed, Clinton would 
surely veto them, Democrats say. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the difficulty Republicans face in obeying the  
spending limits, the budget does not leave room for the 
multibillion-dollar costs expected for the conflict with Yugoslavia 
and a congressional effort to provide pay raises and better 
pensions for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP budget highlights increases for defense, schools,  
farmers, veterans' health care and biomedical research. But final 
decisions will have to be made in future bills.

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Picks Political Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's 2000 campaign has  
appointed a campaign pro with local Washington connections as its 
political director. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Brazile, chief of staff and press secretary for Del.  
Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, was national 
field director for Rep. Dick Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign. 
She also works as a consultant to the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee, as she did in the 1996 and 1998 campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile is an at-large member of Democratic National Committee  
and an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore's political director and deputy campaign manager, she  
will be responsible for political outreach efforts, including 
lining up endorsements and delegates within the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been criticized within the party -- mostly by women's  
groups -- for lacking more women in his inner circle of advisers. 
Brazile will join Tina Flournoy, the campaign's finance chairwoman, 
as the second black woman in a senior role.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warned Against Annexation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Legal advisers have told the Israeli government  
that annexing parts of the West Bank would be rejected by most of 
the world and would be seen as a violation of international law, an 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has threatened to annex territory in the West Bank if  
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declares an 
independent state on May 4, the end of a five-year interim period 
of autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-page report by Foreign Ministry legal adviser Alan Baker  
examined legal consequences of the end the interim period, said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said in his report that the best solution is to extend the  
interim period by agreement, said the official, confirming a report 
in the Haaretz daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said Israeli annexation might trigger Palestinian  
violence. Annexation would not be recognized by most of the world 
and would probably be seen as a violation of international law, 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu, rejected Baker's advice, saying Israel's claim to the 
West Bank ``is better than anyone else's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Singer, a former Foreign Ministry legal adviser who helped  
formulate the autonomy agreements, backed Netanyahu's position. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer wrote in a recent article that while the autonomy period  
expires May 4, the two sides' commitment to negotiate the final 
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, rather than take unilateral 
actions, is open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
	A unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would be a  
flagrant violation of the autonomy accords and would entitle Israel 
to take countermeasures, such as annexation, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has signaled that he is ready to extend the interim  
period, but a final decision will be made April 27, when a senior 
PLO body, the Palestinian Central Council, meets in the Gaza Strip 
to discuss statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has been meeting with world leaders to win support for  
independence. The Palestinian leader has been told he should 
postpone a statehood declaration so as not to endanger the 
continuation of peace talks with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	It is widely believed that a unilateral declaration of  
Palestinian statehood would help Netanyahu win re-election May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians signed the interim agreement in  
Cairo on May 4, 1994. It set out a five-year process of a gradual 
handover of West Bank territory to Palestinian control. During this 
period, the two sides were also to complete a permanent peace 
agreement, but serious negotiations haven't even begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast  
war. Israel never annexed the territory, although it allowed about 
200,000 settlers to build homes there.

<HEADLINE> Is This the Last Straw for Straw? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry is approaching the major  
league record no one wants: Steve Howe's mark for second chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it seemed he had turned himself around, Strawberry  
finds his latest comeback with the New York Yankees teetering on 
the edge. His arrest on charges of cocaine possession and 
soliciting a female police officer may be the final straw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope his career isn't over. I hope they don't give up on  
him,'' said David Cone, his best friend on the team. ``But these 
sorts of situations conjure up the flip-side argument, too: How 
many chances do people get?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has been the toast of New York and the goat, too. His  
life is the stuff the tabloids live for: Every time he gets fans' 
adulation and sympathy, he seems to turn into his own worst enemy 
and become a magnet for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure he becomes a real example of how you can  
turn your life around and make something out of yourself,'' Yankees 
owner George Steinbrenner said shortly before signing him for the 
first time in July 1995. ``I think this young man has to realize 
he's been given a great chance here ... one some people say he 
didn't deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 12 years, Strawberry has been accused of breaking  
his first wife's nose, named in a paternity suit, arrested for 
assaulting his wife with a deadly weapon, arrested for striking a 
woman he lived with, ordered to pay $350,000 in back taxes, 
confined to home for six months by a federal judge, charged with 
failing to make child-support payments and sued by his ex-lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	He went through alcohol rehab in 1990 and substance-abuse rehab  
in 1994, then was suspended for 60 days in 1995 after testing 
positive for cocaine. He was released by the Dodgers and Giants, 
and struggled through a half-season in the Northern League, about 
as far from the majors as a professional can get. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, before Wednesday night's arrest near the team's training  
facility in Tampa, Fla., he had been a model citizen since joining 
the Yankees, the team he hoped to return to as he tried to regain 
strength and form following surgery for colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	When the illness and operation last October forced him to miss  
the postseason, his teammates repeatedly telephoned him so he would 
feel a part of the clubhouse celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	After the World Series sweep of the Padres, the clubhouse in San  
Diego was filled with chants of ``Straw Man! Straw Man!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We told him how much we loved him and missed him. It was a  
very emotional moment,'' catcher Joe Girardi said of phone calls to 
Strawberry that night from the trainer's room. ``It was hard 
without Darryl, not so much because of his baseball presence but 
just as a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just two months ago, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug  
Dependence hired Strawberry as a spokesman. While he didn't have as 
much ability as when he came up with the New York Mets in 1983, he 
had regained the luster of his years as a fearsome hitter, the 
eight-time All-Star and NL Rookie of the Year winner who led the 
Mets to the World Series championship in 1986 and another division 
title two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a star. I just want to be a player,'' he  
said last year, when he had his best season since 1991. ``I had my 
days of what they call stardom. That's not important to me. What's 
important to me is to enjoy my life and help ... other people who 
are having problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His turning point seemed to be his time in the Northern League  
in 1996, when he was making $2,000 a month, riding a bus with the 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``St. Paul was a very humbling experience for me,'' he said.  
``It allowed me to find out who I am as a person. It allowed me to 
have no pride. It showed me baseball was fun again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner was at Strawberry's bedside last fall. But he  
demands loyalty in return. That's why he lashed out in February 
after Strawberry missed an autograph session, remarks he later said 
were out of line. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what we have done, bent over backwards for Straw, we've  
tried to understand his problems and worked with him,'' 
Steinbrenner said. ``We pulled for him every bit of the way. It's 
the last guy I expected to have pulled that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner will decide Strawberry's future, and a guilty plea  
or conviction may cause him to decide whether to cut Strawberry 
loose. Then again, the Yankees are the team that Howe played for 
following his eighth suspension for drug and alcohol problems.

<HEADLINE> EU Antitrust Officials Raid Renault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European antitrust officials raided the  
offices of Renault SA last month as part of an investigation into 
the carmaker's sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids in France and Ireland were carried out March 24 and 25  
in connection with an alleged instruction Renault gave to its Irish 
distributors not to sell cars to residents of Britain, a European 
Union official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move appears to confirm push by the European Commission to  
clamp down on carmakers who try to restrict their dealers from 
selling across borders within the 15-nation EU. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the EU executive body said it had opened legal  
proceedings against DaimlerChrysler for preventing its exclusive 
dealer networks in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain from 
selling Mercedes passenger cars to nonresidents of those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission officials entered Renault offices and took documents  
relating to the alleged infringement of EU antitrust rules. If 
Renault is found guilty, the Commission has the power to impose a 
maximum fine of 10 percent of the French automaker's Renault's 
worldwide sales. However, the official stressed the investigation 
is at a very early stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of legal proceedings against DaimlerChrysler  
came after a two-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Car companies in Europe regularly price the same cars  
differently in different countries, prompting bargain-hunters to 
cross borders to buy their car. That is frowned upon by the 
automakers because it ends up costing them money. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, the EU fined Volkswagen $110 million for  
allegedly preventing German and Austrian customers from buying and 
reimporting VW cars from cheaper Italy. VW has appealed the fine.

<HEADLINE>  The Great One a Canadian Treasure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- It was only natural that Canada's prime minister  
should intervene in the Wayne Gretzky retirement saga. After all, 
Jean Chretien is arguably the nation's second most famous man. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was only natural that Chretien, like so many of his  
compatriots, should plead in vain for the Great One to play on. 
Beyond the borders of the world's most hockey crazed country, 
Gretzky ranks high among the greatest-ever superstars of sport; in 
Canada, he is much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians have been aware of Gretzky since he was a pint-size  
peewee player, scoring goals at unbelievable rates. Over three 
decades, they have marveled at his hockey exploits, admired his 
decorum, gushed over his love life, anguished over his trade to a 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as Gretzky concludes his 20-year NHL career, Canada is  
awash in end-of-an-era nostalgia and retrospection, as if this one 
player's departure from hockey is on a par with the ending of the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a country skeptical of success and wary of evanescent  
heroes, Wayne Gretzky became an icon, for what he accomplished with 
his athletic genius and, just as important, the dignity and class 
of his character,'' wrote Jeffrey Simpson, political columnist of 
the nationally circulated Globe and Mail newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky even became a topic of debate Friday in Parliament,  
where a motion urging him to play one more season was sidelined on 
technical grounds. Lawmaker Cliff Breitkreuz wore a No. 99 hockey 
jersey to the session, and said of Gretzky, ``Wow, what a 
Canadian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Innumerable Canadians know the Gretzky story by heart -- how at 2  
he started taking practice shots with a sponge ball at his 
grandmother in her easy chair; how his father, Walter, a telephone 
repairman, built a rink in their backyard in Brantford, Ontario, 
when Wayne was 3 so he could practice incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gretzky was 8, he scored 104 goals in 62 games. When he was  
10, and stood 4-foot-4, he scored 378 goals in 82 games. Parents of 
some of his teammates would scream ``Puck hog'' at him, even though 
he also led his teams in assists. 
</P>
<P>
	By 14 he had scored well over 1,000 goals and was a celebrity,  
interviewed on a national radio program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew he was good, all right, but to my eye at least, it  
hadn't gone to his head,'' recalled the interviewer, Peter Gzowski. 
``I remember asking him if he thought he'd ever make $100,000 a 
year playing hockey, and he just laughed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within 10 years of that interview, Gretzky was well on the way  
to becoming the greatest hockey player in history, dominating an 
often brutish sport with finesse and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The scope of his achievements are known to fans worldwide -- four  
Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, more than 60 NHL records, 
nine most valuable player awards, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canada, his success transformed him into a national treasure.  
Few Canadians in any field, including politics and entertainment, 
ever have been subject to such coast-to-coast adulation and 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's courtship of American starlet Janet Jones in the  
mid-1980s was covered breathlessly by Canadian media, which 
divulged minute details about her childhood in a St. Louis suburb, 
her career (including a lead role in ``Police Academy 5'') and 
previous flings (with Bruce Willis and tennis pro Vitas Gerulaitis, 
among others). During the romance, an edition of ``Playboy'' with 
Jones on the cover sold out in Edmonton within three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers weren't prurient, one magazine-shop manager said at  
the time -- ``They're just Gretzky fans who want to see what kind of 
woman he's marrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wedding, on June 16, 1988, was depicted as the closest  
Canada ever would get to royal nuptials. Thousands of people 
thronged the streets outside St. Joseph's Basilica in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	Said one of the onlookers, graphic designer Brenda  
Savella-Smith: ``In England they have the royal family. In the 
United States, it's Hollywood. But we have to make our own heroes 
in Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matrimonial euphoria was shattered two months later by the  
most shocking of news -- Oilers owner Peter Pocklington was trading 
Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like ripping the heart out of the city,'' said Edmonton  
Mayor Laurence Decore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky wept at a farewell news conference then, and Canadians  
engaged in overwrought postmortems as to whether Pocklington or 
Gretzky's new wife bore the bulk of the blame. Some fans likened 
Jones to Yoko Ono, whose marriage to John Lennon contributed to the 
Beatles' breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more than a hockey transaction,'' said prominent  
Canadian author Peter C. Newman. ``I'm upset about it and I don't 
even follow hockey. Canada can't afford to lose a hero. We don't 
have enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Gretzky himself retained his hold on the Canadian  
heart, through a decade of often-frustrating seasons in Los 
Angeles, St. Louis and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after his trade to the Kings, he made a point of saying he  
wouldn't change citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Canadian to the core, and I always will be,'' he promised.  
</P>
<P>
	He has kept the vow, and remains active in charity causes and  
the promotion of hockey in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, hockey in Canada needs his help. There is nationwide  
soul-searching about flaws in the youth-league system that seem to 
be reducing the number of creative offensive players like Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is persistent concern about the long-term future of  
small-market Canadian NHL teams, such as Edmonton and the Ottawa 
Senators, who say a high tax burden and a weak Canadian dollar make 
it difficult to compete with wealthier U.S.-based teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, Gretzky lent his support to a planned Canadian  
hockey summit this summer aimed at addressing these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has changed,'' he said. ``And if we're going to make  
sure that Canadian teams and Canadian players remain on the cutting 
edge of the game, we've got to change, too. We can't take our 
leadership for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Gretzky in retirement will play an active role in  
Canadian hockey, but he already has bestowed an invaluable gift to 
the national sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played hockey -- our game -- with an unmatched grace and a  
boyish enthusiasm that whispered to every Canadian kid on every 
frozen pond or rink that this was the way the game should be 
played,'' wrote the Globe and Mail's Simpson. ``Fast and clever and 
clean.''

	Dow Ends at Another High: 10,493.89  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors kept on unloading technology stocks in  
favor of blue-chip industrial companies today, sending the Dow 
Jones industrial average to its fifth consecutive closing high -- 
10,493.89, up 31.17. The last time the Dow pulled off the feat of a 
new closing high every day in the week was March 16 through 20 of 
last year. Broader market indicators finished lower. The Nasdaq 
composite index was down 39.34 at 2,482.43. The Dow rose despite a 
brutal 7-point drop in IBM, which tumbled along with other 
technology stocks and lopped more than 30 points off the Dow's 
gain. ``If it weren't for IBM, the Dow would be higher,'' said 
Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. ``Anything 
related to that beautiful technology world is being taken out to 
the woodshed.''

	Greenspan Frets About Protectionism  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
expressed concern today that Americans are losing faith in the 
benefits of free trade. He told a conference in Dallas that efforts 
to pursue protectionist policies would be ``unwise and surely 
self-defeating'' in the end. He called the expansion of 
international trade one of the most impressive developments of the 
last half-century and one that has greatly benefited the United 
States. Greenspan said increased competition from a global 
marketplace has forced companies to develop better goods and 
services at lower costs, thus improving living standards. But 
companies that fail to remain competitive, he said, often increase 
political pressure for protectionist barriers.

	Industrial Production Up Slightly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Output at the nation's factories, mines and  
utilities posted a slight overall increase in March as production 
at auto plants fell. Construction of new homes and apartments was 
down as well, falling for the second straight month. The Federal 
Reserve reported today that industrial output was up 0.1 percent in 
March with the strength coming from a big jump in energy production 
at utility plants. The advance compared to a a 0.3 percent advance 
in February and reflected declines in production of autos and 
appliances. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said construction of 
new homes and apartments fell 1.3 percent in March, its second fall 
since it hit a 12-year high in January.

	FCC Tries Opening Phone Market  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators took a second stab at  
prying open the $110 billion local phone market to competition 
today after a piece of its market-opening rules was scuttled by the 
Supreme Court in January. The Federal Communications Commission, as 
expected, made recommendations about steps that major local phone 
companies, such as the Baby Bells and GTE, might take to open their 
local networks to rivals. One would be that the companies continue 
to lease certain parts of their networks to rivals that would use 
them to offer competing local phone services.

	Caterpillar Earnings Off 52 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. reported today that its  
first-quarter earnings fell 52 percent as the result of a prolonged 
drop in sales to commodity-based industries such as oil, mining and 
agriculture. But the heavy equipment maker's results turned out to 
be well above the scaled-back expectations of Wall Street analysts, 
who had sharply lowered their forecasts after Caterpillar warned 
last month its earnings would be disappointing. And it said it was 
cautiously optimistic about its outlook for the rest of the year. 
Caterpillar said it earned $205 million, or 57 cents a share, 
compared with $430 million, or $1.15 a share, in the same. 
Caterpillar stock was up 2 at 63 13/16.

<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co.'s first-quarter  
earnings rose 10 percent on its first sales increase in two years 
and aggressive cost-cutting. The photography company said today 
that excluding one-time items, it earned $259 million, or 80 cents 
per share, up from $237 million, or 73 cents per share, in the same 
quarter a year ago. Kodak said its results were affected by a 
one-time charge of $68 million to cover the costs of cutting three 
small businesses. When one-time charges are included, Kodak's 
earnings totaled $191 million, or 59 cents a share, down 15 
percent. Kodak's results exceeded analysts expectations, and its 
stock was up 6 7/16 at 73 today.

	General Mills Hikes Cereal Prices

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- General Mills Inc., which makes Cheerios,  
Wheaties and Lucky Charms, today confirmed it is raising cereal 
prices an average 2.5 percent. The company said that while the 
average retail price of a box of its cereals is approximately the 
same as it was in 1993, the average consumer price for food 
consumed at home during the same period has increased about 3 
percent annually. The price increase was disclosed yesterday when 
an analyst at the BT Alex. Brown securities firm raised his rating

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Holt retired today as editor of the  
Journal of Commerce, the nation's oldest business newspaper, and 
his replacement announced several major changes including shifting 
the publication's format from broadsheet to tabloid. Assistant 
Managing Editor Peter Tirschwell, 37, will take over as editor from 
Holt, who served as the newspaper's editor the past four years.''We 
think the tabloid format is more appropriate to the specialized 
direction we're going in,'' Tirschwell said, noting that once the 
172-year-old newspaper was strictly a business newspaper while it 
is now a trade publication serving a different audience.

confirm or deny the 4,000 job reduction tally reported by Barron's

<HEADLINE>  The Great One a Canadian Treasure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- It was only natural that Canada's prime minister  
should intervene in the Wayne Gretzky retirement saga. After all, 
Jean Chretien is arguably the nation's second most famous man. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was only natural that Chretien, like so many of his  
compatriots, should plead in vain for the Great One to play on. 
Beyond the borders of the world's most hockey crazed country, 
Gretzky ranks high among the greatest-ever superstars of sport; in 
Canada, he is much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians have been aware of Gretzky since he was a pint-size  
peewee player, scoring goals at unbelievable rates. Over three 
decades, they have marveled at his hockey exploits, admired his

<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Marilyn Nieves held the charred  
figurine of an angel in her hands, the only thing left Friday of 
her home after a massive wildfire swept through this small coastal 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``See, look at that. There's nothing,'' she said, cupping the  
angel -- a gift from her god-daughter -- in her hands. ``I don't know 
whether it's just something from God. I don't know. I really don't 
know. I don't understand how it occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two-and-a-half months of drought has left parts of Florida a  
powder-keg. Officials had been aggressive about containing even the 
smallest fire, but it was such a blaze -- thought under control -- 
that took Port St. Lucie by storm on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,400-acre blaze, fueled by wind gusting to 30 mph,  
destroyed at least 48 homes and damaged a dozen others near this 
city on Florida's east coast, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of some of these forests, with the amount of  
undergrowth leaves and pine needles, they can burn underground for 
weeks and weeks,'' said Terry McElroy, spokesman for the state 
Agriculture Department. ``They are thought extinguished but 
re-ignite when the wind kicks up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida stepped up its prescribed burning after last year's  
devastating blazes to rid neighborhoods of brush. No such 
preventive measures were taken in the wooded St. Lucie neighborhood 
of $90,000 and $120,000 homes just west of the city that is the 
spring training home of the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``That particular area ... is kind of a poster example of danger  
of having structures so intermingled in the woods,'' McElroy said. 
``You have houses in the middle of the woods on top of one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bill approved by a state House committee Friday gives the  
Division of Forestry more power to burn off vegetation in 
controlled burns on people's land. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials have cautioned that without any significant rain,  
conditions are ripe for a repeat of last summer's blazes that 
scorched 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 residents from their 
homes. The 1998 fires damaged or destroyed 350 homes or businesses 
and caused $400 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Two helicopters and two 3,000-gallon tank planes assaulted the  
smoldering landscape from the air with water. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas of the rain-starved state, about 280 people were  
forced out of their homes by fires that burned some 6,600 acres in 
central and southwestern Florida.

	Authorities in St. Lucie County kept watch for looters and  
warned residents of unlicensed contractors who might prey on their 
desperate situation. A curfew was will be enforced from 9 p.m. to 6 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents complained about the lack of resources to battle the  
flames. The area does not have fire hydrants and when Florida Power 
&AMP; Light cut power Friday to 6,000 homes -- afraid of live wires 
burning -- it cut electricity to well pumps. Some residents were 
forced to bale water from their pools in a bucket brigade to drench 
flames as they neared homes.

	``There was just so much I could've done. No power, no water. If

	Robert Yakinchuk returned to his neighborhood Friday to find his  
yard charred and blackened on three sides. The fire stopped just 
short of his ranch-style house.

	``We lucked out,'' he said, pointing toward an area one block  
over, where two homes were destroyed. ``There's a lot worse people

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Calls Ailing Broadcaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANTFORD, Ontario (AP) -- On the day when the world was focused  
on Wayne Gretzky, The Great One was thinking about somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours before he appeared at a news conference to announce  
his retirement from the NHL on Friday, Gretzky called local sports 
broadcaster Arnold Anderson, the first person to conduct a radio 
interview with a then 10-year-old destined for hockey greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky called to wish Anderson well as he battles cancer and to  
inform him of his decision to retire before he made the official 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``That says something about the man -- on a day like today that  
he would call,'' said Arnold's wife, Jean. ``We were very moved. It 
was gracious for him to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Arnold said she and her husband watched Gretzky's news  
conference with great sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just an end of something that was decent and good,''  
she said of Gretzky's 21-year professional hockey career.

<HEADLINE> Sharon Stone Addresses Editors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sharon Stone, who is married to a newspaper  
editor, told a group of his peers Friday to take care when covering 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone also gently criticized newspapers for their treatment of  
stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You tell stories about me, some of them are hideous, some of  
them are fabulous, some are exaggerated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the American Society of Newspaper Editors' annual  
convention, Stone said she was looking forward to showing some of 
the spicier stories about her to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandchildren are going to love reading these stories and  
thinking that I really was this kind of racy, wild thing, instead 
of this withered-up old broad that they're looking at,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She advised against haste in trying to break a story before all  
the facts are available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't be the first paper to write the story, be the best paper  
to write the story,'' said Stone, who is married to San Francisco 
Examiner executive editor Phil Bronstein. 
</P>
<P>
	She also complained that when reporters interview her, it often  
appears they have their story already written and simply try to 
make her answers fit their premise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very rarely do I have the extraordinary pleasure of sitting  
down with someone who really has something to ask that isn't 
sensationalist, that is thoughtful and that provokes growth from 
both of us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said that celebrity-chasing reporters often endanger the  
people they are pursuing. She said that her mother was once knocked 
over by reporters and a friend was all but trampled. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of her dedication to the defeat of AIDS, she warned of  
a ``misconception that AIDS has been cured. There is not one person 
who has been cured,'' she said.

                            *Ellen Corby    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ellen Corby, who played the tart-tongued  
country grandmother on television's ``The Waltons'' and was an 
Oscar nominee for the 1948 film ``I Remember Mama,'' died 
Wednesday. She was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Corby, born Ellen Hansen, spent 12 years as a script assistant  
before turning to acting. After her debut in the 1946 film ``Dark 
Corner'' she worked steadily as a character actor, often playing a 
fussy spinster or busybody. 
</P>
<P>
	She appeared in more than 100 movies, including ``Shane''  
(1953), ``Sabrina'' (1954) and ``Vertigo'' (1958). Her performance 
as the lovelorn aunt in ``I Remember Mama,'' starring Irene Dunne, 
earned her the Academy Award bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Corby made guest appearances on many TV Westerns, including  
``The Virginian,'' ``The Rifleman'' and ``Wagon Train.'' She 
received a Golden Boot award from the Motion Picture &AMP; Television 
Fund in 1989 along with Robert Duvall, Johnny Cash and Robert 
Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	As Esther ``Grandma'' Walton on the popular CBS television show,  
Corby created her best-known role. Grandma Walton was part of a 
close-knit Virginia family in the drama from writer Earl Hamner 
Jr., who based it on memories of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	A stroke in 1977 forced Corby to curtail her work on the series.  
She was seen only occasionally and made her last appearance on 
``The Waltons'' series in 1979, although she was part of the 1997 
TV special ``A Waltons Easter.''

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Ends a Magnificent Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Everyone wanted just one more season. Everyone  
will get just one more game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Gretzky announced his retirement from hockey Friday after  
two magnificent decades, despite pleas from family and friends not 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Great One said his ``gut'' told him it was time.  
Left behind are scores of fans still asking for more and scores of 
records for generations to chase. 
</P>
<P>
	His last game, between his New York Rangers and the Pittsburgh  
Penguins in Madison Square Garden on Sunday, will close a 
personally frustrating season -- and it will end an era. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of weeks, a lot of people have been asking me  
why this is the time,'' a composed Gretzky said. ``It's a gut 
feeling, something I believe is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His head told him, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I started to feel fatigue -- mentally and physically -- that I  
never felt before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate the fact I have to retire,'' Gretzky said. ``I have  
played for 35 years, since I was 3. Now I'm handing in my skates -- 
I'm done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were plenty of sad faces among the Rangers  
executives accompanying him at the Madison Square Garden news 
conference, Gretzky did not want this to be ``a downer,'' -- and he 
kept his emotions in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotional time will be Sunday when I take my skates off.  
I've been encouraging people to smile and be upbeat,'' he said. 
``That will be the tough time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky sat with his wife, Janet, and two of their children -- Ty  
and Trevor. Gretzky said his daughter, Paulina, did not want to 
come ``because she thought she'd cry too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Video highlights of Gretzky's career were shown before he made  
it official, and he and his wife watched in rapt attention. Janet 
cast admiring glances at her husband every once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky spent part of the day talking with Charles Dolan, the  
head of Cablevision, which owns the Rangers, and he tried to talk 
him into staying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a nice conversation,'' Gretzky said. ``He extended a  
hand out to me to stay with the team. I told him I hadn't wavered 
at all. I'm very confident about that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one could change Gretzky's mind. Not his wife, not the prime  
minister of his native Canada, not even his idol, Gordie Howe, who 
advised Gretzky to wait at least a few more months. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to leave a big void,'' Howe said from his home in  
Florida. ``He's a proud man. And when you're hurting, it makes you 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's departure marks the second time in three months that  
one of the world's premier athletes -- and the best in his sport -- 
has chosen retirement. But unlike Michael Jordan, who left after 
winning his sixth NBA championship, Gretzky ends his career with a 
disappointing Rangers team that didn't even make the playoffs this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to go out like Michael Jordan did, but it's  
not a perfect world. ... It's not going to happen that way, not 
this year, but it is nice to be able to say people do want me to 
play more,'' Gretzky had said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday he said he thought Jordan left too early and that he  
missed watching him play. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and now Gretzky's departure certainly has made 1999 a  
year for losing sports heroes. Then there's the Yankee Clipper, Joe 
DiMaggio, who died last month at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Gretzky decided to leave sooner rather than later.  
</P>
<P>
	Classy and fair-haired with a charismatic smile, if Gretzky was  
a superstar in the United States, he was a virtual demigod in his 
home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians have been aware of Gretzky since he was a peewee, and  
can recite such minutiae as the 104 goals he scored in 62 games at 
age 8, or the 378 goals in 82 games when he was all of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	With his magnificent skills and a humble, gentlemanly manner,  
Gretzky was a perfect goodwill ambassador for hockey. He has been 
the NHL's biggest box-office draw for most of his 20 years in the 
league, and never has been shy about that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,486 games with teams in Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis  
and New York, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 2,856 
points -- that's 1,006 more than runner-up Howe scored in his Hall 
of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	He owns roughly 60 records, is a 10-time scoring champion and a  
nine-time MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Such achievements can't be predicted, not even for a teen-ager  
who breaks into the World Hockey Association and has no trouble 
keeping up with the rugged men of that league. By his second pro 
season, Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers were part of the NHL, which 
merged with the WHA in part to get their budding star into its 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-scoring Oilers featured such future Hall of Famers as  
Mark Messier, Paul Coffey, Jari Kurri and Grant Fuhr, but they 
always were Gretzky's team. And they replaced the hallowed Montreal 
Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs as Canada's team in winning four 
Stanley Cups in a five-year span from 1984-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the unthinkable: In his prime, Gretzky was traded to  
the Los Angeles Kings, mainly as a cost-conscious move by Oilers 
owner Peter Pocklington, who later would be vilified in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	But that 1988 deal brought a new challenge, and not  
surprisingly, Gretzky was up to it. Kings games became an ``in'' 
thing in LA. Hollywood's stars turned out to see Gretzky, and the 
Kings' newfound popularity eventually led to teams in hot-weather 
cities like Miami, Tampa, Fla., Anaheim and San Jose, Calif., 
Dallas, Phoenix and Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	After being traded to St. Louis in February 1996, Gretzky signed  
as a free agent with the Rangers that summer and remained the most 
recognizable and influential force in hockey. His third and final 
season in New York was one of the most discouraging for Gretzky, 
who missed 12 games due to a neck injury, while the Rangers missed 
the playoffs for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one important milestone  
for the NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the season 
gave him 1,072 as a professional, moving him past Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	He had played in 223 straight games since joining the Rangers.  
The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc. In 
1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Kings to the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky did not want a ``farewell tour'' next season with fans  
and teams showering him with accolades as he played his final games 
around the league. He did get a taste of it, though, as fans 
responded to Gretzky at various arenas as the season came to a 
close and the possibility he would retire loomed larger. 
</P>
<P>
	At what turned out to be Gretzky's final game in Canada, the  
18,449 fans in Ottawa on Thursday night chanted ``One more year!'' 
during the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, the arena spotlight picked up Gretzky as he  
skated from the New York net to the boards in front of the Rangers' 
bench. As he leaned there smiling, all the Ottawa players skated 
over and one by one shook his hand. The Rangers, in a semicircle, 
tapped their sticks on the ice in a salute to the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's wife was crying in the stands as her husband was  
announced as the game's only star, and the crowd roared again and 
didn't stop until he made two curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, just one final bow remains.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky, simply the best hockey player  
ever, announced his retirement today after two unforgettable 
decades on the ice, walking away from the game he loves despite 
pleas from friends and family not to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Great One will say goodbye in Sunday's season

by former player John Davidson as ``the greatest player who ever 
played.''

<P>
	Gretzky emphasized that today should be a celebration, not ``a

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mayor Faces More Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A mayor who resigned after he was  
accused of sexual misconduct with children has been hit with more 
criminal charges in connection with the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald ``Ajax'' Ackerman was charged Friday with seven counts of  
indecent exposure and one count of furnishing obscene materials to 
a minor, all misdemeanors, said St. Clair County Prosecutor Mona 
Sayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Port Huron mayor already faced 14 charges, including  
11 counts of sexual misconduct, two counts of production of child 
abusive material and one count of indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman was arrested April 6 after two parents came forward  
with allegations of misconduct. He resigned his mayoral post 
shortly after his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorcycle-riding Ackerman was elected mayor in November  
1997. A former drug addict and alcoholic who sported a ponytail and 
leather duds, he used the story of his struggle to help other 
addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened up Clear Choices, a counseling center for adults and  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The original charges involve Ackerman's alleged misconduct with  
four girls, ages 9, 11 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Capt. Brian Moeller said at least seven additional  
victims were identified. He wouldn't elaborate.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sergei Babarin had run-ins with neighbors

ago. But police don't know why the 71-year-old Russian immigrant 
chose the Mormon Family History Library for a deadly rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	A church security officer and a library patron were killed  
before Babarin was shot by police Thursday, dying later in an 
ambulance. Four other people were wounded as Babarin calmly and 
methodically roamed through the building, even stopping once to 
reload. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything. He just came in and started shooting  
people,'' said Margaret Kane, who huddled under a desk in the 
first-floor research area. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just looked intent on what he was doing. He came to do what  
he was doing,'' she said. ``He didn't call out, no names or 
anything. He just kept his hand held out pointing at people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Deedee Corradini said later that Babarin was  
schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin's wife told investigators he had not been taking his  
medication for schizophrenia and each day would walk a dozen or so 
blocks from their home to the State Capitol and to Temple Square, 
police Chief Ruben Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega said Babarin was arrested after a 1995 fight at a  
department store in downtown Salt Lake City. He had been carrying a 
.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol and was charged with assault and 
carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Mark Zelig said Babarin had a reputation for  
harassing people in his apartment building or who passed his 
window. Last May, a bicyclist told police that Babarin stuck an 
umbrella in the bicycle spokes as he rode by and accused him of 
being a spy. No charges were brought.

anyone he saw with a handgun.

<HEADLINE>  3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sergei Babarin had run-ins with neighbors

<HEADLINE> Kodak's Sales, Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co., rebounding on robust  
film sales and aggressive cost-cutting, reported its first revenue 
increase in two years and a 10 percent jump in first-quarter 
operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The photography company said Friday that excluding a one-time  
restructuring charge of $68 million, it earned $259 million, or 80 
cents per share, up from $237 million, or 73 cents per share, in 
the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of 76 cents  
a share, according to First Call Corp. Investors were pleased with 
Kodak's performance, and bid its stock up $6.44, or nearly 10 
percent, to $73 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	When one-time charges are included, Kodak's profit totaled $191  
million, or 59 cents a share, down 15 percent from $225 million, or 
69 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 6 percent to $3.1 billion from $2.91 billion,  
benefiting from a 28 percent surge in sales of rolls of film in the 
United States. Kodak's sales had fallen in eight previous quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S. consumer film market, Kodak said it won back another  
1 percentage point of market share lost to Japanese nemesis Fuji in 
1997 -- a price war that prompted the mass layoffs. Kodak corners 
about two-third of the U.S. market, but falling prices have pinched 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got very strong film sales, excellent consumer imaging  
revenues and, as a result, much better-than-expected revenues 
company-wide,'' exulted B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with 
Prudential Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's driving a significant improvement in optimism about the  
company's prospects,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak cut costs by $730 million in 1998 and trimmed an  
additional $80 million in the first quarter. It is slashing 19,900 
jobs through 1999 out of a worldwide payroll of 100,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The $68 million charge was taken in connection with Kodak's  
efforts to shed poor-performing businesses. The company said it 
will try to sell its Eastman Software unit. It also plans to shut 
its line of sticker print kiosk products and is ending a joint 
investment in an ink-jet technology unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses in the fast-growing field of digital photography, the  
recording of images on computer chips, narrowed to $45 million in 
the quarter from $55 million a year ago. Digital sales, however, 
jumped 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial imaging division was hobbled by lower sales in  
the copier division, which was recently sold to printing giant 
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak also announced it is buying back $2 billion of the  
company's outstanding stock.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Group Hopes To Keep Patriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Business leaders who want to keep the New England  
Patriots in Massachusetts met Friday with state officials to talk 
about retaining the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kirk, a former chairman of the Democratic National  
Committee, led a delegation that included NFL officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk said he felt ``optimistic'' after meetings with Gov. Paul  
Cellucci, House Speaker Thomas Finneran and Senate President Thomas 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just went into the huddle. We're going to call the plays  
and start all over again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk said Finneran, who blocked the Patriots' Massachusetts  
stadium plans last year, ``didn't appear to be an obstacle'' to new 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's perfectly open and willing to listen,'' Kirk  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots have a $374 million stadium deal in Hartford.  
</P>
<P>
	But the team is anxious to get going on the stadium project. And  
questions have been raised about whether the site will be ready 
because of contaminated soil and an energy company on the site that 
needs to be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that if New England's capital city rallies quickly  
to the cause, the NFL can encourage the Patriots to make 
Massachusetts their permanent home,'' Kirk and five other prominent 
figures said in an op-ed piece Friday in The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The article's other signers were former U.S. Attorney and now  
Bell Atlantic executive Wayne Budd; industrialist William F. 
Connell; advertising executive John J. Connors Jr.; Boston Edison 
Co. Chairman Thomas J. May, and Rev. J. Donald Monan, the 
chancellor of Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, theNFL will consider Patriots owner Robert Kraft's  
plan to move the team from its current home in Foxboro to Hartford 
although a final decision by the league is a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has  
mixed feelings about the Patriots' move to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging the generous Connecticut deal made sense for  
Kraft, Aiello said Tagliabue also was ``concerned about the Boston 
area and said we are much better off with continuity with our fans 
and with our teams centered in major metropolitan areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots' spokesman Don Lowery said the team declined comment  
because of its agreement with the state of Connecticut, ``which 
requires us to deal exclusively with them in this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finneran, expressing concerns that the state shouldn't pay too  
much to help the team, last year blocked the passage of a $72 
million bill that had the support of the team, the state Senate and 
Cellucci. 
</P>
<P>
	The next thing Massachusetts officials knew, Kraft was signing a  
deal with officials in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Pagani, spokesman for Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, said,  
``This business group is, of course, free to pursue this path, but 
the fact of the matter is the Patriots have a contract with 
Connecticut. Both the state and the Patriots are working towards 
having a stadium ready by 2002.''

<HEADLINE>  Lakers Waive Dennis Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's seven-week career with the  
Los Angeles Lakers has come to an abrupt end -- no big surprise 
considering his recent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman reacted to being released Thursday night by calling  
himself a scapegoat for the team's problems, and said the Lakers 
were ``cowards not to take the fall for some of the things that 
have happened this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers issued a statement saying they were finished with  
Rodman in the wake of another in a long list of incidents involving 
the eccentric forward earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate to win their first NBA title since 1988, the Lakers  
figured Rodman, a member of five championship teams,including the 
last three with the Chicago Bulls, was just what they needed to put 
them over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final game, they bottomed out, losing 113-86 at Portland  
on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't the last straw. That apparently occurred when  
Rodman, according to coach Kurt Rambis, showed up late for the 
team's practice at Los Angeles Southwest College on Thursday 
morning, and was slow getting ready because he couldn't find his 
socks and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis later told reporters he told Rodman to go home, and said  
the team was through with its special treatment of the NBA's 
leading rebounder in each of the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time we feel it's in the best interests of the Lakers  
to end the relationship,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West said in 
the statement issued Thursday night. ``This obviously didn't work 
out like we had hoped, but we would like to thank Dennis for the 
contributions he did make to the team and wish him the best of luck 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 next month, signed with the Lakers on Feb.  
23 and played his first game three days later. He averaged 2.1 
points, 11.2 rebounds and 28.6 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won their first 11 games with Rodman in uniform, but  
were 6-6 since that time with him playing. They are 8-9 without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman told Fox Sports News late Thursday night that the Lakers  
``have to have a fall guy, and I'm basically the fall guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people will criticize my attitude and my dedication  
to the game of basketball, but, you know, it doesn't surprise me,'' 
he said. ``I didn't really miss practices. Today, I didn't miss 
practice. Today, he (Rambis) asked me, `Do you need treatment?' I 
was there 10 minutes early before practice, and he told me to take 
the day off and all of a sudden I'm like, great, you know? 
</P>
<P>
	``... I wanted to come here and win and play here. It didn't  
turn out that way. I don't know what I'm going to do right know. 
It's one of those deals. If they want to make me the fall guy, I 
will be the fall guy. I don't expect anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman did say he wanted to apologize to fans in Los Angeles,  
adding, ``I hope that they don't look at me as a bad individual. I 
hope I'm still loved by people here in the state of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman also said he would consider playing for another team this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on if somebody wants to take a chance on having a  
guy like me on a team that can win a championship, I will go and 
play with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After reportedly refusing to return to a game in the fourth  
quarter on March 12 because his right elbow was sore, Rodman was 
late to practice the following day, and when he did show up, he 
said he needed time off to deal with personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed four games before returning eight days later for a  
nationally televised game in Orlando. While he was gone, he was 
spotted gambling in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's paid leave of absence perhaps stemmed from problems  
with his wife, actress Carmen Electra, although he denied that upon 
his return. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rodman and Electra announced jointly April 6 they had  
filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rambis, Rodman also refused to return to games in  
the fourth quarter on March 26 and last Friday, saying his muscles 
had tightened up. He was late for practice the following day both 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman didn't play in the second half in Portland on Tuesday  
night, claiming he had an injured elbow. He had four rebounds in 13 
minutes before being taken out with 2:31 left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers didn't practice Wednesday, setting the stage for  
Thursday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to know the truth? I was shocked when they put him on  
their team,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said after his team beat the 
Los Angeles Clippers 103-89 Thursday night for its ninth straight 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, who beat the Lakers in the Western Conference finals  
last spring, will attempt to extend the winning streak against the 
Lakers on Saturday night in a nationally televised game at the 
Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I heard, Jerry West didn't have much to do with it  
(bringing Rodman in),'' Sloan said. ``I understand someone else 
wanted him, so they got him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan was referring to Lakers owner Jerry Buss.  
</P>
<P>
	Clippers guard Sherman Douglas said the Lakers knew what they  
were getting when they signed Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did you expect? Did he do anything differently than he  
did before? No,'' Douglas said. ``He used to miss practice, he used 
to irritate people, still does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the Lakers weren't ready for that. That's why they got  
rid of him, plain and simple.''

(bringing Rodman in),'' Sloan said. ``I understand someone else 
wanted him, so they got him.''

<P>
	Sloan was referring to Lakers owner Jerry Buss.  
</P>
<P>
	Clippers guard Sherman Douglas said the Lakers knew what they  
were getting when they signed Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did you expect? Did he do anything differently than he  
did before? No,'' Douglas said. ``He used to miss practice, he used 
to irritate people, still does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the Lakers weren't ready for that. That's why they got  
rid of him, plain and simple.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Releases Kuwait Site Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gulf War veterans likely were not exposed to  
chemical warfare agents at an industrial site in Kuwait, although 
the possibility can't be ruled out, and troops weren't harmed by 
exposure to depleted uranium, the Pentagon concluded today. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports are the result of an investigation the Defense  
Department has been conducting to determine the cause of mysterious 
illnesses thousands of Gulf War veterans have reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Rostker, a defense official in charge of Gulf War  
Syndrome issues, said a review of circumstances surrounding the 
1991 U.S. troop presence near a cement factory outside Kuwait City 
suggests soldiers weren't exposed to any suspected chemical warfare 
agents inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon found no evidence during a review of tapes from  
special ``Fox'' military vehicles that can detect nuclear, 
biological and chemical agents and from soil analysis. Defense 
officials also noted there were no casualties, which would have 
surely occurred upon chemical exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Upon reviewing all available evidence, our investigators  
determined that the exposure of U.S. armed forces in the area must 
be assessed as unlikely,'' Rostker said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Rostker said the Pentagon couldn't rule out  
the possibility of chemical warfare agents being present since the 
evidence was not complete. One of two Fox vehicles tapes is missing 
and the soil samples may have been packaged incorrectly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon hasn't completed a final report of the cement  
factory findings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report that reviewed several Rand studies, the  
Pentagon found no evidence of harmful health effects directly 
linked to exposure of troops to depleted uranium in the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	No increased levels of cancer or other illnesses have been  
detected among Gulf War veterans compared to other populations, 
said the report, which notes the body is very effective at 
eliminating ingested and inhaled uranium. Exposure to uranium at 
high doses can cause kidney problems, but no increase in kidney 
disease has been observed among Gulf War veterans, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the VA Medical Center in Baltimore are following  
a group of Gulf War veterans with the greatest exposure to depleted 
uranium, including some with embedded fragments from shrapnel. 
Although the veterans have an array of health problems related to 
their combat injuries, the researchers said, ``To date no 
manifestations of kidney disease attributable to the chemical 
toxicity of depleted uranium have been found.'' No radiation 
illness was discovered either, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a related matter, a Pentagon policy review by Rand released  
today found that the Defense Department poorly administered a 
program to use experimental drugs on Gulf War troops in an effort 
to protect soldiers from biological and chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Gulf War veterans blame their illnesses on the drugs,  
including pyridostigmine bromide and botulinum toxoid, which they 
weren't told were experimental because the Food and Drug 
Administration authorized an exception to an informed-consent 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the Gulf War, troops received very little information  
regarding the use of investigational new drugs,'' Rostker said. 
``The required recordkeeping was poor and administration was 
inconsistent from unit to unit. This clearly is an area that 
required a closer look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several previous Pentagon and congressional studies also have  
concluded there's no evidence troops were harmed by chemical 
agents, although as many as 100,000 soldiers were exposed to low 
doses of nerve gas in the demolition of an Iraqi ammunition depot 
in March 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of the 700,000 U.S. soldiers who fought in the Gulf  
War have complained of chronic, unexplained maladies such as 
fatigue, joint pain and memory loss. But researchers have not been 
able to link the symptoms to any particular disease or warfare 
agent.

<HEADLINE> The Great One a Canadian Treasure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- It was only natural that Canada's prime minister  
should intervene in the Wayne Gretzky retirement saga. After all, 
Jean Chretien is arguably the nation's second most famous man. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was only natural that Chretien, like so many of his  
compatriots, should plead in vain for the Great One to play on. 
Beyond the borders of the world's most hockey crazed country, 
Gretzky ranks high among the greatest-ever superstars of sport; in 
Canada, he is much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians have been aware of Gretzky since he was a pint-size  
peewee player, scoring goals at unbelievable rates. Over three 
decades, they have marveled at his hockey exploits, admired his 
decorum, gushed over his love life, anguished over his trade to a 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as Gretzky concludes his 20-year NHL career, Canada is  
awash in end-of-an-era nostalgia and retrospection, as if this one 
player's departure from hockey is on a par with the ending of the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a country skeptical of success and wary of evanescent  
heroes, Wayne Gretzky became an icon, for what he accomplished with 
his athletic genius and, just as important, the dignity and class 
of his character,'' wrote Jeffrey Simpson, political columnist of 
the nationally circulated Globe and Mail newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky even became a topic of debate Friday in Parliament,  
where a motion urging him to play one more season was sidelined on 
technical grounds. Lawmaker Cliff Breitkreuz wore a No. 99 hockey 
jersey to the session, and said of Gretzky, ``Wow, what a 
Canadian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Innumerable Canadians know the Gretzky story by heart -- how at 2  
he started taking practice shots with a sponge ball at his 
grandmother in her easy chair; how his father, Walter, a telephone 
repairman, built a rink in their backyard in Brantford, Ontario, 
when Wayne was 3 so he could practice incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gretzky was 8, he scored 104 goals in 62 games. When he was  
10, and stood 4-foot-4, he scored 378 goals in 82 games. Parents of 
some of his teammates would scream ``Puck hog'' at him, even though 
he also led his teams in assists. 
</P>
<P>
	By 14 he had scored well over 1,000 goals and was a celebrity,  
interviewed on a national radio program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew he was good, all right, but to my eye at least, it  
hadn't gone to his head,'' recalled the interviewer, Peter Gzowski. 
``I remember asking him if he thought he'd ever make $100,000 a 
year playing hockey, and he just laughed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within 10 years of that interview, Gretzky was well on the way  
to becoming the greatest hockey player in history, dominating an 
often brutish sport with finesse and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The scope of his achievements are known to fans worldwide -- four  
Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, more than 60 NHL records, 
nine most valuable player awards, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canada, his success transformed him into a national treasure.  
Few Canadians in any field, including politics and entertainment, 
ever have been subject to such coast-to-coast adulation and 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's courtship of American starlet Janet Jones in the  
mid-1980s was covered breathlessly by Canadian media, which 
divulged minute details about her childhood in a St. Louis suburb, 
her career (including a lead role in ``Police Academy 5'') and 
previous flings (with Bruce Willis and tennis pro Vitas Gerulaitis, 
among others). During the romance, an edition of ``Playboy'' with 
Jones on the cover sold out in Edmonton within three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers weren't prurient, one magazine-shop manager said at  
the time -- ``They're just Gretzky fans who want to see what kind of 
woman he's marrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wedding, on June 16, 1988, was depicted as the closest  
Canada ever would get to royal nuptials. Thousands of people 
thronged the streets outside St. Joseph's Basilica in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	Said one of the onlookers, graphic designer Brenda  
Savella-Smith: ``In England they have the royal family. In the 
United States, it's Hollywood. But we have to make our own heroes 
in Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matrimonial euphoria was shattered two months later by the  
most shocking of news -- Oilers owner Peter Pocklington was trading 
Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like ripping the heart out of the city,'' said Edmonton  
Mayor Laurence Decore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky wept at a farewell news conference then, and Canadians  
engaged in overwrought postmortems as to whether Pocklington or 
Gretzky's new wife bore the bulk of the blame. Some fans likened 
Jones to Yoko Ono, whose marriage to John Lennon contributed to the 
Beatles' breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more than a hockey transaction,'' said prominent  
Canadian author Peter C. Newman. ``I'm upset about it and I don't 
even follow hockey. Canada can't afford to lose a hero. We don't 
have enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Gretzky himself retained his hold on the Canadian  
heart, through a decade of often-frustrating seasons in Los 
Angeles, St. Louis and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after his trade to the Kings, he made a point of saying he  
wouldn't change citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Canadian to the core, and I always will be,'' he promised.  
</P>
<P>
	He has kept the vow, and remains active in charity causes and  
the promotion of hockey in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, hockey in Canada needs his help. There is nationwide  
soul-searching about flaws in the youth-league system that seem to 
be reducing the number of creative offensive players like Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is persistent concern about the long-term future of  
small-market Canadian NHL teams, such as Edmonton and the Ottawa 
Senators, who say a high tax burden and a weak Canadian dollar make 
it difficult to compete with wealthier U.S.-based teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, Gretzky lent his support to a planned Canadian  
hockey summit this summer aimed at addressing these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has changed,'' he said. ``And if we're going to make  
sure that Canadian teams and Canadian players remain on the cutting 
edge of the game, we've got to change, too. We can't take our 
leadership for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Gretzky in retirement will play an active role in  
Canadian hockey, but he already has bestowed an invaluable gift to 
the national sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played hockey -- our game -- with an unmatched grace and a  
boyish enthusiasm that whispered to every Canadian kid on every 
frozen pond or rink that this was the way the game should be 
played,'' wrote the Globe and Mail's Simpson. ``Fast and clever and 
clean.''

<HEADLINE> Disneyland Unions Agree on Workweek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and their friends in  
France will only have to work 35 hours a week starting this June. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the seven unions representing workers at the Disneyland  
Paris theme park west of the capital agreed Thursday to reduce 
their weekly hours from 39 to 35, part of a government plan to cut 
the nation's high jobless rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries will remain the same, and workers are expected to  
benefit from a more flexible schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which concerns some 10,000 park employees, is  
scheduled to take effect June 6. Under the new agreement, some 
part-time workers will be offered full-time positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Park management said the shorter work week will create 600 new  
jobs by May 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, passed last May by the Socialist government of Prime  
Minister Lionel Jospin, calls for businesses with more than 20 
employees to institute the 35-hour workweek by Jan. 1, 2000. 
Smaller companies have two more years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland will benefit from tax cuts and other incentives  
offered to businesses that act before the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Some Bush Donors Also Gave To Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Nearly $1 of every $7 that Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush raised for his presidential bid came from donors who 
previously supported his father's campaigns for the White House, a 
computer analysis shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,350 donors to the Texas governor who also donated to  
President Bush's 1988 or 1992 campaigns were among the younger 
Bush's most generous donors, giving an average of $787 each, 
according to the analysis by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	That was much higher than the $325 average for all 23,339 donors  
who helped the younger Bush raise $7.6 million this year for a 
presidential bid, the analysis showed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Donors can give up to $1,000 each to a presidential candidate  
for a primary election. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Bush administration aides contributed to the younger  
Bush, among them former Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, former 
Commerce Secretary Barbara Franklin, former EPA administrator 
Russell Train, former press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, former 
trade representative Carla Hills, former White House counsel C. 
Boyden Gray and former campaign aide Mary Matalin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's father, who ran for president in 1980, 1988 and 1992, has  
a long-standing network of political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor, who raised his $7.6 million in just 28  
days without fund-raising events, said he has made no concerted 
effort to capitalize on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect some of his friends are interested in helping me,  
and some of his friends aren't interested in helping me,'' the 
younger Bush said. ``One of the reasons why I've been successful is 
because people know of my record here in Texas, and they believe I 
can do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former president agreed. ``I'm doing anything I can, but so  
far I haven't done very much,'' the elder Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll do whatever he wants, or stay the heck out of the way,  
which might be in some ways best because I had my chance doing what 
I could, but he has to chart his own course, you know,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bush attended a Phoenix, Ariz., fund-raiser in early  
April, but that isn't reflected in Bush's FEC report. It covered 
the three-month period ending March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor's fund-raising total far outpaced his rival  
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, vice president under Bush's father, finished in  
second place with just $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush has been a prodigious fund-raiser in his two  
Texas races. He has brought in $41.2 million since his first 
campaign for governor in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In Richmond, Va., Bush's campaign got a boost Friday as Virginia  
Gov. Jim Gilmore, a tax-cutting conservative, became the 15th out 
of 31 Republican governors to endorse their Texas colleague for the 
Republican nomination.

<HEADLINE> Lett Faces Suspension Over Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- For the fourth time in five years, the  
Dallas Cowboys must prepare to play without Pro Bowl defensive 
tackle Leon Lett -- and this time, it could be for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett is facing a punishment of at least a year after failing an  
NFL drug test for the third time, a league source who requested 
anonymity told The Associated Press on Friday. The violation also 
could carry a lifetime ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett has been enrolled in the NFL's substance-abuse program  
since 1995. He was suspended four games that season, then was 
suspended for the last three games of 1996 and the first 13 of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This past year was his first complete one 1994. Like that  
season, he made the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, who seldom speaks to the media, has not commented. The  
team said it could not comment, citing league confidentiality 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Jim Steiner, who refused to confirm or deny the reports,  
said the 30-year-old Lett has been hit hard by the news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a pleasant thing to have your name being bantered  
about,'' Steiner said. ``When you're involved in something like 
this and he's paid the price, you're embarrassed and you're 
embarrassed not only for yourself but for your teammates, the fans, 
the club, Jerry Jones -- the whole ball of wax. It's not easy to 
deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times cited an unidentified Cowboys official and a  
team player and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram cited an unidentified 
NFL source in reporting the failed drug test in Friday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is  
reviewing an appeal filed by Lett that could challenge the validity 
of the test collection and processing arrangements. Tagliabue 
denied an appeal the last time he suspended Lett. 
</P>
<P>
	Steiner, however, said: ``There is no appeal going on.''  
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Randall Godfrey said teammates are supportive of  
Lett, who has been tested an average of 10 times per month the past 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, who underwent elbow surgery two weeks ago, would not be  
eligible to apply for reinstatement until 60 days before the 
one-year anniversary of his suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Lett was a seventh-round draft pick from  
Emporia State in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 51 tackles, four sacks, 20 quarterback pressures and a  
team-high seven tackles for losses last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys, who also lost two defensive linemen in the  
expansion draft, will likely make the position a priority in the 
draft this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also known for two on-field gaffes.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 1993 Super Bowl, Lett set a record for returning a fumble  
64 yards -- but he needed 65 for a touchdown. Thinking he'd score 
easily, Lett was raising the ball in celebration when Buffalo's Don 
Beebe swatted it away at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	That November, on a snowy Thanksgiving Day game against the  
Miami Dolphins, Lett mistakenly tried picking up a missed field 
goal instead of letting it become a dead ball. He ended up knocking 
it to a Dolphin, setting up Miami's successful second chance kick 
for the victory.

<HEADLINE> New Airline Ready for Reservations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- National Airlines, a new carrier partly  
financed by casinos, says it will begin taking reservations Monday 
for service between its Las Vegas hub and four major cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier plans to begin service to Chicago Midway and Los  
Angeles on May 27, with service to New York and San Francisco 
beginning in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline had planned to begin operation earlier this year,  
but was delayed while getting various regulatory approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Conway, chairman of the airline, said the Federal  
Aviation Administration has told the Department of Transportation 
that it anticipates certifying National Airlines in time to begin 
operations on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, which will operate Boeing 757 aircraft, plans two  
daily flights to Chicago and six to Los Angeles. There will be two 
flights each round-trip to San Francisco and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline was started in part with $15 million each from  
Harrah's and the Rio hotel-casino in an effort to get more tourists 
to Las Vegas by air.

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired in Idaho High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOTUS, Idaho (AP) -- A high school sophomore fired two shotgun  
blasts in a school hallway today before he began babbling 
incoherently and was taken into custody. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Notus High School was evacuated and its 200 students dismissed  
shortly after the shootings about 8:20 a.m. in this tiny 
southwestern Idaho farming community. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Cooper, 16, was taken into custody after he dropped the  
.12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun he had brought from home on the 
bus, wrapped in a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
	Why Cooper fired the shots wasn't immediately clear, but Canyon  
County sheriff's officials said he had a history of mental illness 
and had been on medication. Sheriff George Nourse said rumors had 
circulated Thursday that the boy had threatened other students and 
had a list of those he wanted to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a lot of kids took him seriously,'' Nourse said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hollered at him, `Put the gun down, put the gun down.' He  
had a knife in his other hand. He was talking to me; he was 
babbling,'' Nourse said. ``He stared at me. He never took his eyes 
off me. He was babbling incoherently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper was taken into custody and brought to a hospital where he  
was being evaluated, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students scurried out of the school building after the first  
shot was fired in a foyer outside the principal's office. Before 
all the students could get outside, the second shot was fired, 
blasting a three-inch hole in a metal door leading to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that second gunshot had been a couple of feet higher, it  
would have hit some students,'' said student body president Howard 
Pennington, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 people live in Notus, which is about 30 miles west of  
Boise.

<HEADLINE> Americans Reconsider Driving Habits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pamela Williams and her husband have been  
planning a summer vacation drive from their home in Philadelphia to 
Virginia Beach and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	But after watching gas prices soar roughly 25 percent over the  
past six weeks, they've begun checking out train schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable that (the price) is going to go up. But I  
didn't think it would go up so fast and so much,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroleum industry leaders say prices are merely returning to  
normal after months of unprecedented lows, but the sharp rise has 
provoked some Americans to change their gas-guzzling ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest nationwide review of 10,000 gas stations by the  
authoritative Lundberg Survey showed the average price was nearly 
$1.23 a gallon. Three weeks ago, it was $1.09, and in late February 
a stunningly low 99.8 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	California, where heavy demand and extra environmental  
regulations make gas especially expensive, has experienced the 
sharpest rise. Premium prices are now flirting with the $2 mark, 
prompting state Attorney General Bill Lockyer to open an 
investigation into what he calls price gouging by oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jumps were fueled by a combination of events: OPEC cuts  
in crude oil production, fires at California refineries and heavy 
travel during the Easter holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Crawford of Los Angeles drives a Volkswagen, but a few  
months ago, she and her husband found themselves tempted by trendy 
sports-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband said, 'No way. These things are gas guzzlers. What  
are we going to do when gas prices go up?''' she said. ``And sure 
enough, they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she says they'll stick to the Volkswagen -- no bargain at  
the pump, but more efficient than an SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Mercado of Los Angeles drives a Ford Expedition SUV,  
but he said his family has curtailed the use of their second, 
smaller car. Now he, his wife and their three children pile into 
one car for trips to school and work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two cars, but now it's like we only have one. Even  
though it is an Expedition, it is cheaper than filling up another 
gas tank,'' said Mercado, a computer operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Some drivers say they won't change their behavior unless prices  
rise much higher. Steven Milaitis, an accountant who works in 
Manhattan, drives about 20 miles to work nearly every day from his 
home in northern New Jersey. He said he doesn't want to rely on 
buses or carpools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have four kids,'' he said. ``If I need to get home quickly  
for a game or a concert, I like having that freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modest increases in the price of gas rarely influence commuters  
to give up their daily drive, said Jean Stimolo, executive director 
of Rideworks Commuter Transportation Services, a New Haven, Conn. 
car pool coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes up a dollar a gallon, I think we'll see a change,''  
she said. ``But it's a good economy. Maybe people are less 
sensitive to gas prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry experts said drivers angered by the recent price  
increase may have been lulled by the months of ultra-low prices as 
an oversupply of oil forced refiners and dealers to cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, it looked like prices would just remain low  
forever,'' said Roy Littlefield, executive director of the Service 
Station Dealers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most travel industry professionals don't expect the price  
increases thus far to have a major effect on summer travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a family of four is spending $100 for a hotel and $100  
for meals, spending $20 to $30 on gas isn't a big factor,'' said 
Mitch Fuqua, a spokesman for AAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The current prices, several analysts said, are more realistic  
and more sustainable than the low levels reached earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, said Jonathan Cogan, information specialist at the  
federal Energy Information Administration, relief may be on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration estimated Wednesday that the average price of  
regular, self-service gasoline is $1.14 per gallon, compared to 
$1.03 per gallon this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's up just 2.2 cents per gallon from last week, the  
narrowest increase in several weeks. Production levels were up and 
demand was down as oil from Gulf states and the East Coast reached 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have eased,'' he said. ``Prices were so historically  
low anyway that they really had nowhere to go but up.''

<HEADLINE> Tens of Thousands Fleeing Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) ---- The residents of entire villages from  
previously spared areas of Kosovo straggled into Macedonia on 
Friday, the leading edge of an estimated 100,000 refugees who are 
being herded out of the country by Yugoslav troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving by the thousands in convoys of tractors and cars,  
refugees reported Serb forces had emptied and burned southeastern 
towns that had earlier escaped ruin. Serb forces also moved border 
control posts from three to six miles away from the Albanian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern suggested the Serbs were clearing strategic swaths  
along the Macedonian border to defend the province in the event of 
a ground attack by NATO troops. 
</P>
<P>
	All 3,000 residents of Perlebnic, an ethnic Albanian village in  
southern Kosovo, were escorted out of town by Serb forces Tuesday, 
villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hadn't gone five kilometers when we saw the village  
burning,'' said Ramadan Syleymani, who collapsed with his neighbors 
in the Brazda refugee camp, Macedonia's largest. Two more hamlets 
were on the road behind theirs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the Albanian villages we've been through, we didn't see a  
single living soul,'' he said. ``I think they're going to clear it 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it believed 100,000  
refugees were on the move toward Macedonia; 15,000 have arrived 
over the last two days. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb purge of western Kosovo was pressing ahead at a similar  
pace: Refugees were crossing the Morini border post into Albania at 
a rate of 1,000 an hour Friday. Conservative estimates topped 6,000 
by evening, with reports of refugee columns stretching back nine 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The crush threatened to overwhelm the meager resources of  
Macedonia and Albania, two of the poorest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania sent army trucks north to ferry refugees away from the  
crowded border camp at Kukes. At the crossing, refugees were handed 
cups of warm milk and beans to strengthen them after days on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the latest refugees arriving in Macedonia came from the  
region around Gnjilane (Guh-KNEE-la-nay), one of Kosovo's largest 
towns, with a prewar population of 70,000. Kosovo Albanians said 
Serbs had forced out 10 percent of the city's ethnic Albanians in 
the last week, ordering the rest to reopen shops, which had been 
shuttered for days while residents cowered at home. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR estimated 50,000 were on the road from Gnjilane and  
another 20,000 from nearby Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Doguna, 20 miles from Gnjilane, Serbs simply  
opened fire to clear the village, killing one man, villagers said. 
Turned back by Serb authorities at the border, the villagers said 
they spent days in the mountains before trying again, this time 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, which already has taken in 120,000 refugees, is  
reluctant to accept any more ethnic Albanians, fearing its own 
fragile ethnic balance could collapse into violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Nikola Kljusev said there was no room for any  
more refugees and demanded that foreign countries step up their 
refugee airlifts out of Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia previously closed its borders against earlier mass  
expulsions, but the UNHCR said officials have pledged to keep 
accepting newcomers. However, Friday's arrivals said they had 
waited at the border for up to two days before Macedonia let them 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia agreed Friday to allow aid workers to expand the main  
refugee center at Brazda. The tent city currently holds between 
20,000-25,000 refugees on an abandoned airstrip outside of the 
Macedonian capital of Skopje, the UNHCR said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's arrivals slept in the open, on the ground. Exhausted,  
men, women, old people and children collapsed on top of their 
belongings, sprawled in sleep under a burning sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to have made it,'' said Salih Ismaili, even as he  
showed what he said were welts from a beating by Macedonian police 
on the border. ``So far, so good.''

<HEADLINE> Report: AOL To Unveil Net Gadgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. is reportedly gearing up to  
release a number of devices that will allow people to easily get 
onto the Internet without using personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The online giant, with 17 million subscribers worldwide, plans  
to introduce some of the devices -- including a screen phone -- in 
the next several weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices would help AOL in its plan to increase its impact in  
a person's everyday life, by giving people the ability to obtain 
e-mail and access Web pages using devices such as a screen phone, 
the Journal said, citing people familiar with the company's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Screen phones, which have failed to catch on the United States  
but are popular in France, are like regular desktop phones but have 
a screen and a small keyboard. While consumers would still use the 
computer for lengthy trips onto the Internet, the screen phone 
could be used to quickly check e-mail or sports scores. It would 
also have the advantage of cutting down on the time it takes to get 
online, which can often be a lengthy process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal cited Alcatel SA as a likely partner in AOL's  
strategy. The French telecommunications company has said it plans 
to market its WebTouch screen phone in the United States but has 
not identified any partners.

<HEADLINE> Padres Activate Nevin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Phil Nevin, acquired late in spring training,  
was activated from the 15-day list by the San Diego Padres on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster, infielder Carlos Garcia was  
designated for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin was placed on the DL on April 3, retroactive to April 1,  
with a strained left hamstring. He was acquired from Anaheim on 
March 29 to give the Padres catching depth after Carlos Hernandez 
was lost for the season with a torn left Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin made three rehabilitation starts with Triple-A Las Vegas,  
hitting .200 with two homers and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego has 10 days to trade Garcia, send him outright to the  
minors or place him on unconditional release waivers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-'Waltons' Star Corby Dies at 87 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ellen Corby, who played the tart-tongued  
country grandmother on television's ``The Waltons'' and was an 
Oscar nominee for the 1948 film ``I Remember Mama,'' has died. She 
was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Corby died Wednesday at the Motion Picture &AMP; Television Hospital  
after an extended illness, hospital spokeswoman Liz Dagucon said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corby, who was born in Racine, Wis., as Ellen Hansen, spent 12  
years as a script assistant before turning to acting. After her 
debut in the 1946 film ``Dark Corner'' she worked steadily as a 
character actor, often playing a fussy spinster or busybody. 
</P>
<P>
	She appeared in more than 100 movies, including ``Shane''  
(1953), ``Sabrina'' (1954) and ``Vertigo'' (1958). Her performance 
as the lovelorn aunt in ``I Remember Mama,'' starring Irene Dunne, 
earned her the Academy Award bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Corby made guest appearances on many TV Westerns, including  
``The Virginian,'' ``The Rifleman'' and ``Wagon Train.'' She 
received a Golden Boot award from the Motion Picture &AMP; Television 
Fund in 1989 along with Robert Duvall, Johnny Cash and Robert 
Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	As Esther ``Grandma'' Walton on the popular CBS television show,  
Corby created her best-known role. Grandma Walton was part of a 
close-knit Virginia family in the drama from writer Earl Hamner 
Jr., who based it on memories of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	A stroke in 1977 forced Corby to curtail her work on the series.  
She was seen only occasionally and made her last appearance on 
``The Waltons'' series in 1979, although she was part of the 1997 
TV special ``A Waltons Easter.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Lead 2000 Fundraising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is off to a slow start raising  
funds for a possible GOP presidential bid, bringing in less than $1 
million in the first quarter of this year, far behind Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, who spent millions of his own money in  
the 1996 race, and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander also 
reported raising under $1 million in the first three months of 
1999, according to campaign financial disclosure reports filed 
Thursday with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider the first quarter spring training, which doesn't  
count toward the regular season,'' Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer 
said. Mrs. Dole has formed a presidential exploratory committee, 
but has yet to declare she's running for the 2000 Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore led everyone with $8.9 million. Another  
Democrat, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, raised $4.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who established a presidential exploratory campaign on  
March 2, had raised $7.6 million by the end of the month without 
holding a fund-raising event. He spent $854,000, leaving $6.75 
million in the bank, his report to the FEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander actually finished the first quarter in debt. He  
reported owing $212,405 and having just $86,916 in the bank as of 
March 31. He raised $748,773 during the first quarter of 1999 and 
spent $661,856. His chief fund-raiser, Ted Welch, said the campaign 
is just starting to take in money; 26 fund-raisers are scheduled 
between May 4 and June 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole raised $685,253 and spent $108,210. She had $578,042  
in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle raised more than any other GOP  
hopeful except Bush, taking in $2.1 million. But much of that money 
was raised through direct mail, which is expensive; he spent $1 
million on fund raising. Quayle had 35,251 contributors, more than 
the 23,339 people who gave to Bush. Overall, Quayle spent $1.6 
million on the campaign and had $500,443 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who shelled out $37.5 million from his own pocket in his  
run for the White House four years ago, gave his campaign $694,000 
of his own money in the first three months this year and raised 
just $18,538. He had spent $599,004 and had just $113,539 in the 
bank as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Juleanne Glover Weiss said Forbes didn't begin  
raising money for his campaign until this month, after the deadline 
for reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been on the phone a great deal,'' Weiss said. ``You won't  
see the seven-digit number until the next filing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expenditures Forbes reported was $254,000 for polling.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore took in contributions from more than 45,000 people. He  
spent $2 million, including $693,089 for fund raising, and had $6.9 
million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 6,000 people gave $1,000 each to Gore, including  
entertainer Barbra Streisand, Eastman Kodak Chief Executive Officer 
George Fisher, and Alex Ferrari, head of MTV Networks. Gore has 
more than 50 people raising $50,000 apiece for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased with the results of our first-quarter efforts,''  
Gore campaign manager Craig Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley remained financially competitive, finishing the quarter  
with $2.9 million in the bank. He received $1,000 apiece from 
former Chicago Bulls basketball star Michael Jordan and his wife, 
Juanita; and $1,000 apiece from former New York Knicks teammate 
Phil Jackson and his wife, June. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. John McCain of Arizona reported raising $1.8 million and  
transferred another $2 million from his Senate campaign fund. He 
spent $1 million and had $2.8 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	--Conservative activist Gary Bauer raised $1.4 million, but spent  
most of it, $881,518. His cash on hand, $489,367, is barely more 
than the debts the campaign owes, $425,563. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. John Kasich of Ohio is not disclosing how much his  
campaign has raised and spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal election law allows potential candidates to raise and  
spend money without disclosing any information as long as the funds 
are used solely to gauge support for a campaign. Kasich campaign 
officials have said the congressman has raised more than $1 
million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Appeals for Kosovo Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- Though many of them strongly oppose the  
U.S.-led NATO airstrikes, Serbian-Americans are being sought out by 
the Clinton administration for help in aiding Kosovar refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has met frequently with representatives of  
various groups with a stake in the region, including ethnic 
Albanians and relief organizations. And in an unannounced session 
on Wednesday he met at the White House with Serbian-Americans to 
explain administration policy and ask for assistance in the 
humanitarian relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the session to tell the group what the United  
States and its NATO allies are trying to accomplish and that the 
quarrel is only with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his 
campaign of ethnic cleansing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences with the administration, the  
Serbian-Americans agreed to use influence they may have with the 
Greek Orthodox and Serbian Orthodox churches and the Greek 
government to support both Kosovar Albanians and Serbians displaced 
by the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Serbian-Americans are still strongly opposed to the  
bombing. As Clinton's motorcade rolled toward a speaking engagement 
in Michigan Friday, about 200 of them stood in the rain with 
protest signs demanding an end to the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of the White House meeting shed light on suggestions by  
national security officials over the past two days that efforts 
were under way to reach the thousands of refugees trapped within 
Kosovo's borders -- a difficult task that would be even harder 
without Serbian help. 
</P>
<P>
	Obrad Kesic, a Balkans analyst and businessman who led the  
delegation at the White House, said that a Greek delegation in 
Belgrade was already urging Yugoslav officials to allow relief 
organizations and the Greek and Serbian Orthodox churches to enter 
Kosovo with food, blankets, tents and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed that we would do everything we could,'' Kesic said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's discussion with the group occurred when he dropped by  
a meeting between National Security Council official Jim Steinberg 
and seven Serbian-American leaders for 45 minutes for what was 
described as a ``frank exchange of views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House deputy chief of staff Steve Richetti took part in  
the session, as did Mary Beth Cahill of the Office of Public 
Liaison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kesic said he wished officials were listening months ago when he  
and other Serb-American leaders were arguing that NATO hostilities 
would prompt Milosevic to end democratic reforms and escalate his 
violence in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before going down this road we very clearly laid out what the  
consequences would be,'' said Kesic, who is closely allied with 
Milan Panic, who lost his bid for the presidency of Yugoslavia in 
1992. ``Basically, they weren't interested in hearing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian-Americans in the meeting are opposed to Milosevic.

<P>
	Serbian-Americans also are concerned that administration  
rhetoric is creating prejudice against them in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton addressed those concerns Thursday in a speech to the  
American Society of Newspaper Editors and again on Friday when 
speaking to relief groups in Michigan.

	``Our quarrel is not with Serbs in Serbia, it is not with Serbs

<HEADLINE> Ala. Bill OKs Interracial Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama has taken the first step toward  
repealing the nation's only remaining state constitutional ban on 
interracial marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The state House voted without dissent Thursday to repeal the  
ban, which is no longer enforced. If three-fifths of the Senate 
also approve, the legislation would go to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor, Rep. Alvin Holmes, said repealing the amendment to  
the 1901 constitution would boost the state's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to have it on the books doesn't make the state look  
good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's is the only state constitution that still prohibits  
interracial marriages. South Carolina removed its provision in 
February.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Crime Wave Triggers Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- No one is safe amid South  
Africa's crime wave -- not a school principal, not an ambassador, 
not even a top U.N. official. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's becoming a nightmare, truly a nightmare,'' Ambassador  
Gedeon Magete of Burundi said Friday, a day after his car was 
stolen at gunpoint from his residence in Pretoria and a week after 
someone pointed a pistol at him and grabbed his briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
	In just four days, a top photojournalist and a school principal  
joined the long list of those who have been murdered in recent 
months in South Africa, and a senior U.N. official from the United 
States was raped. 
</P>
<P>
	South African police, who have been attacked in their own  
stations, can't cope with the crime wave, which threatens to derail 
South Africa's hopes of attracting foreign investors who could help 
boost the country's economy and create more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime in South Africa is especially high because its brutal,  
former apartheid system created a callous attitude toward the value 
of human life, and because economic apartheid remains, with many 
nonwhites lacking the education and skills needed to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling African National Congress also inherited a police  
force more trained to repress the black majority than to fight 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Although murders dropped by 2 percent in 1998, South Africa  
still has the world's third-highest murder rate -- at 56.9 per 
100,000 people -- after Colombia and Swaziland, according to 
Interpol. A woman is three times more likely to be raped in South 
Africa than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, favored to become president after  
June 2 elections, has vowed to make crime-fighting a priority. But 
that is doing little good for victims now. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder of elementary school principal Gwendoline Jele in the  
mostly black township of Soweto provoked a storm of outrage and was 
front-page news Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jele, 56, was shot to death Thursday after confronting intruders  
in her school. They grabbed her car keys, stripped the dying woman 
of her jewelry and fled in her car. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors were being sent to the school to help traumatized  
staff and pupils. Jele's son Donald urged those who consider crime 
a solution to poverty to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of building us as a nation, it destroys us,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jele, a tough but compassionate principal who doled out soup to  
needy children, was killed the same day as top photojournalist John 
Rubython was buried. Rubython was stabbed to death Monday in his 
Cape Town home, allegedly by a 14-year-old intruder who was 
arrested days later. 
</P>
<P>
	A space in the Sowetan newspaper where a cartoon normally  
appears was blacked out on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no funny cartoon today, as the cartoonist was  
attending the memorial service of a fellow journalist, someone who 
braved death in the (anti-apartheid) struggle, and survived only to 
become one of the 20,000 South Africans senselessly murdered each 
year in the new South Africa,'' cartoonist Jonathan Zapiro wrote 
bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged callers to radio talk shows have urged the restoration  
of capital punishment, abolished after the ANC came to power. But 
Mbeki's office on Friday ruled that out, saying he ``respects and 
abides by the letter and spirit of the constitution affirming the 
right to life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magete, whose Mercedes Benz was stolen from him Thursday by two  
gunmen, said he was conferring with Burundian and South African 
officials about improving his security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm quite shaken, because this is the second time in a week  
that I've been robbed by people with guns,'' he said in a phone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	A few blocks from Magete's home, a visiting U.N. official was  
raped on Thursday during the burglary of a U.N. residence. Five men 
have been arrested in the burglary and police Friday were awaiting 
the results of DNA tests to determine which one raped the American 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the five are illegal aliens from neighboring Mozambique  
and the fifth is a South African, said police Inspector Heleen van 
Heerden. They were being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was raped twice by the same man, van Heerden said,  
dismissing initial press reports that she was gang-raped. The 
victim had been so distraught when first speaking to police that 
she was unable to say how many men had raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. official was on a business trip and was staying in a  
U.N. house in a wealthy Pretoria neighborhood when she was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonaventure Sodonon, the deputy representative of the U.N.  
Development Program in South Africa, said all U.N. workers in South 
Africa were shocked at the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some assurances that members of the international  
community can go about their work peacefully,'' Sodonon was quoted 
as saying in The Star, a Johannesburg newspaper.

<HEADLINE> DNC Announces 2000 Convention Dates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Convention, returning  
to Los Angeles next year for the first time since John F. Kennedy 
was nominated, will be held August 14-17, party officials announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Aug. 17, 2000, a new Democratic candidate will answer his  
party's call to lead America into the next frontier,'' DNC Chairman 
Joe Andrew said in announcing the dates of the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee announced last month that Los  
Angeles had been chosen to host the convention. The last Democratic 
convention held in that city was in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC also announced several changes in its staff. Andrew has  
shuffled his political shop to make room for two new staffers, one 
a former aide to Jesse Jackson, the other President Clinton's 
scheduler. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlottia Scott, chief of staff for Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.,  
and a former campaign aide for Jackson's presidential efforts, will 
be the DNC's chief of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Forbes, the White House's top scheduler, will be chief of  
strategy for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott and Forbes split the workload of former political director  
Jill Alper, who is leaving the DNC for the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In other changes at the DNC:  
</P>
<P>
	--Rod O'Connor, director of the DNC's vice presidential liaison  
office, will become its chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pat Ewing, former communications director for Vice President Al  
Gore, will be senior adviser to Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
	--Regena Thomas, base vote director at the DNC, will be the  
committee's national campaign director. She also is a former 
Jackson aide. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee already has announced that Rob Engel has moved  
over from the House Campaign Committee to be executive director at 
the DNC.

<HEADLINE> 1973 Murder Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- An inmate whose 1973 murder conviction  
was recently overturned because police wrongly suppressed evidence 
walked out of jail Friday after serving almost 26 years behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be home, and that's all I've got to say,'' said  
John Duval, 47, who was greeted by an exultant knot of family, 
friends and supporters outside the Monroe County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Betty Duval-Rutley, said she had already dropped by  
a supermarket to prepare him a special meal. At a bail hearing 
earlier, Duval was ordered freed on his own recognizance. 
Prosecutors are still deciding whether to re-try him. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Betty Tyson had her conviction dismissed in May for  
the same reason. Tyson, 50, had spent half her life in prison and 
became New York's longest-serving female inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Tyson, both former prostitutes, maintained they signed  
confessions only after being severely beaten by police, who had no 
physical evidence linking them to the killing of Timothy Haworth. 
</P>
<P>
	A Philadelphia businessman and consultant to Eastman Kodak Co.,  
Haworth was apparently soliciting a prostitute on the night he was 
strangled on May 25, 1973. In separate trials, Duval and Tyson were 
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's conviction was overturned April 5. A judge ruled that a  
one-page report of a police interview in which a teen-ager accuser 
initially claimed he never saw Duval and Tyson with Haworth was 
never turned over to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Duval twice told the state Parole Board that he  
killed Haworth. He says now he believed he would remain behind bars 
unless he admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go home, so I lied,'' he said in an affidavit.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Robert Mastrocola said prosecutors  
would decide, probably within a month, whether to pursue a new 
trial. A hearing was set for May 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is that he was certainly properly convicted of  
these crimes and guilty of these crimes,'' Mastrocola said. 
``That's still our position. But that doesn't necessarily mean 
we're ... going to re-try him. There's a lot of other things that 
go into this, more practical concerns.''

<HEADLINE> Congress OKs Tax Break for Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has overwhelmingly approved tax  
relief for American military men and women involved in the war in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 424-0 and the Senate 95-0 on Thursday to send  
the measure to President Clinton, who has signaled support. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clinton's executive order this week, the bill exempts  
military hazardous duty pay from income taxes, gives personnel in 
the combat zone a 180-day extension to file their 1998 tax return 
and exempts them from the 3 percent excise tax on long-distance 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation goes slightly further than Clinton's order by  
extending the tax relief to support personnel whose duty is 
performed outside the United States and away from their permanent 
posts.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher  
Friday amid mounting optimism about the economic outlook for Asian 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, the main index rose 8.6 percent as foreign investors  
bought heavily in banking and other blue chip stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, index surged 31.86  
points to close at 402.54. The index last closed above 400 points 
on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenetic foreign buying across the board also sent Indonesian  
shares soaring to an eight-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 32.053, or 7.2  
percent, to 479.532 -- a level unseen since August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong shares also surged, with the key index rising more  
than 4 percent on massive foreign buying of blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 528.07 points, or 4.4 percent, to close at 
12,490.30, the first time it rose above the 12,000-point barrier 
since October 1997. On Thursday, the index had gained 128.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers attributed Friday's rise to a continuation of the the  
market's recent strength, with the index gaining 13 percent over 
the past eight sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an influx of European funds. The large amount of funds  
have bought up Asian stocks,'' said John Lo, a trader at BNP Prime 
Peregrine Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also boosted by overnight gains on Wall  
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.06 points -- 
or 0.5 percent -- at 10,462.72, topping Wednesday's record of 
10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 124.50  
points, or 0.74 percent, closing the week at 16,851.58 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 37.60 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks rose on continued active buying from foreign and  
individual investors who have grown more optimistic about the 
economic outlook for Japan and other Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was expectation that public and  
pension funds were allocating new funds to the stock market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.22 yen at late  
afternoon, down 0.58 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below 
its late New York level of 118.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices surged, capping an already bullish week  
with frenzied buying. The Straits Times Index rose 3.7 percent, or 
63.79 points to 1,769.92. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished sharply higher, fueled  
by expectations of a cut in interest rates and on mounting optimism 
that an economic recovery is underway, stock watchers said. The 
benchmark Composite Index rose 3 percent, or 17.51 points, to to 
599.41. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with the key  
index rising to a new record following a surge in resources stocks. 
The All Ordinaries Index rose 5.3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 
3,099.8, breaking the previous all-time closing high of 3094.5 set 
Thursday.

Stock Price Index fell 31.35 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,466.82. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher as  
demand for local forestry stocks buoyed local market sentiment. The 
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 51.23 points or 2.4 percent, to 
2,205.78. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed sharply higher following a cut

<HEADLINE> Davenport To Miss Fed Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Croatia's loss of the home court advantage  
in this weekend's Federation Cup series against the United States 
was balanced out Friday when the world's No. 2 player, Lindsay 
Davenport, pulled out because of a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Iva Majoli, the top-seeded player on the Croatian team, will  
play second-seeded Chanda Rubin in the first match Saturday. The 
second match will pit top-ranked Monica Seles against second-seeded 
Silvija Talaja. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's two singles matches and one doubles match were also  
chosen Friday during a draw on the lawn outside the North Carolina 
governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed Cup match was moved from Zagreb, Croatia, because of  
NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia. The move allowed U.S. captain 
Billie Jean King to add Seles, who was born in Novi Sad, 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	International Tennis Federation officials also decided against  
playing the series in Hamburg, Germany, where Seles was stabbed 
during a match nearly six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had planned to host (the matches), but circumstances  
changed that,'' Gov. Jim Hunt said to the Croatian team before the 
drawing. ``We have thought about your country all of these past 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four Croatian women and their captain said they were excited  
to be playing in Raleigh, with or without Davenport, who decided 
Wednesday her wrist was not well enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big thing for Croatia,'' said Majoli, who has played  
in the last seven Fed Cups. ``We should just enjoy the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Majoli, who has been beaten Davenport four times in their  
eight meetings, said Davenport's injury ``is a disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her captain, Vjeran Friscic, however, seemed pleased with the  
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I prefer Chanda, but all the players are top and  
everyone knows how to play well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin leads their head-to-head series 3-2, winning in three sets  
in the Hopman Cup in 1997. Both players are coming off three-set 
losses in the Baush &AMP; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't played Chanda in so long. It's going to be a tough  
match,'' Majoli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport, who lost to Anna Kournikova in two sets in the Bausch  
&AMP; Lomb last weekend, was forced to drop out of the Lipton 
Championships earlier because of her sprained left wrist. She said 
she hopes to recuperate in time for the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (Davenport's injury) doesn't have much of an impact,'' King  
said. ``The U.S. is lucky to have great depth. ... We have Monica 
and Chanda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second match, nine-time Grand Slam winner Seles will face  
Talaja, who lost in the third round of the Estoril Open last week 
and took Venus Williams to three sets before losing in the first 
round of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (Seles) is playing the best tennis of her life,'' King  
said. ``If she maintains her physical fitness, there's no stopping 
her now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles' Bausch &AMP; Lomb title last weekend was her first since last  
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The players switch opponents Sunday. The series ends with a  
doubles match between Seles and Lisa Raymond and Majoli and Talaja 
to determine which teams advances to the second round.

<HEADLINE> FCC Tries Opening Phone Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators took a second stab at  
prying open the $110 billion local phone market to competition 
Friday after a piece of its market-opening rules was scuttled by 
the Supreme Court in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, as expected, made  
recommendations about steps that major local phone companies, such 
as the Baby Bells and GTE, might take to open their local networks 
to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the FCC suggested that these companies continue to  
lease certain parts of their networks to rivals that would use them 
to offer competing local phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	One piece consists of the wires that run from local phone  
company offices to homes and businesses. It's the most crucial 
network element because of the big expense to duplicate them. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pieces include computer systems that rivals would use to  
sign up, bill and service customers; operator services; directory 
assistance; and certain services such as caller ID, call forwarding 
and call waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the same pieces major phone companies have been  
required to lease to rivals for the last few years. The Bells and 
GTE have pledged to continue doing so until the FCC resolves the 
matter after the high court cast uncertainty over the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Supreme Court supported virtually all the FCC's  
efforts to open the local phone market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But it vacated a FCC rule that forced local phone companies to  
give their rivals blanket access to any piece of the local network 
they want. The court said the FCC didn't adequately consider 
whether rivals could obtain these pieces elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will seek public and industry comments on whether any  
additional network elements should be made available to 
competitors, including equipment for offering high-speed Internet 
and other data services. The commission will also seek comments on 
the standards for making these elements available on a nationwide 
basis and whether and when these elements should not be made 
available to rivals.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air Loses Delta Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Korean Air, blistered in a safety report by  
two of its pilots, lost its flight partnership with Delta Air Lines 
on Friday, a day after the foreign carrier had another fatal plane 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, Delta had said it stood by its ``code-share''  
arrangement, despite the dissemination of an internal Korean Air 
report raising safety concerns at the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Under code-sharing, passengers traveling to Asia on a Delta  
ticket might make some legs of their trip on planes operated by 
Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta would not code-share with any carrier it did not believe  
to be safe,'' Delta spokesman Clay McConnell said Wednesday. He 
reaffirmed the statement after the crash Thursday of a Korean Air 
cargo jet in Shanghai, China. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Delta announced suspension of its partnership and  
said it would not book passengers on flights operated by Korean Air 
pending review of the airline's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta will begin immediately to contact Delta customers booked  
on KAL-operated flights to assist them in making alternative travel 
arrangements,'' the Atlanta-based carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's internal safety review stemmed from the carrier's  
troublesome track record: More than 700 people killed in 20 years, 
among them 228 who died when a Korean Air 747 flew into a hill on 
Guam in August 1997 and 269 killed when a Soviet MiG fighter shot 
down KAL Flight 007 after the 747 strayed into the Soviet Union's 
airspace in September 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, United Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, has  
had 140 passenger deaths in the same two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Korean Air picked 19 of its pilots to participate in  
an internal safety review. A report written by two of them 
highlighted a number of incidents: 
</P>
<P>
	--During an airport approach, a copilot responded to air traffic  
instructions intended for another plane and veered off course. The 
captain responded by hitting him on the back of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
	--While planning an airline flight, a crew did not discuss the  
expected weather or the amount of fuel necessary. Such decisions, 
they said, should be made by the captain alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the report: In-flight newspaper reading by flight crews.  
Alternate landing sites not approved for the size of plane flown. 
Arguments between a pilot and a dispatcher about how much fuel to 
load for an ocean crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report surfaced recently on the Internet. While the airline  
confirmed its authenticity, Korean Air officials said the findings 
were exaggerated and out of line with observations made by the 
other 17 pilots in the safety review. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found some issues, but nowhere near the degree of these  
two pilots,'' said airline spokeswoman Penny Pfaelzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hardy, a captain and Korean Air's deputy director of flight  
operations, said: ``What they ended up reporting in that document, 
they ended up pumping out, a lot of that is like barroom talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy said Korean Air has had problems, but the Guam crash  
marked a turning point for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident prompted senior management to begin a $114 million  
safety overhaul, including a top-to-bottom review of Korean Air's 
flight operations. The carrier also recruited more experienced 
pilots from Western carriers and hired safety consultants from 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's being done here is to take this airline and this flight  
operations department and make it state-of-the-art,'' Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air's problems may stem in part from its rapid growth.  
Thirty years ago, it was an eight-plane local carrier. Using former 
pilots from South Korea's air force, it has exploded into the 
world's 13th-largest passenger airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, the two pilots, whom Korean Air refused to  
name, said some problems are rooted in a culture in which pilots 
defer to their seniors, even when they make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently, in some Korean cockpits, there is a volatile  
cocktail of complacency, arrogance, apathy and a lack of 
self-discipline,'' the pilots wrote. ``These attitudes must be 
removed from the flight deck at all costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees safety of  
U.S. skies, said Korean officials are responsible for the safety of 
the airline. The agency could ground an individual plane for safety 
problems, but under international aviation treaties, South Korea's 
government has responsibility for maintaining the carrier's safety 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Thursday's crash, which occurred shortly after  
takeoff, is under investigation, but an airline executive said it 
may have been the result of a terrorist act. It killed the 
three-member crew and at least five people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other signs of lingering problems at Korean Air.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a company jet skidded off a runway while landing in  
Pohang, South Korea and split in two. Nineteen passengers were 
injured. In September, another plane overshot a runway, and a month 
before that, a Korean Air Boeing 747 skidded off a runway in Seoul 
and tore off its landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	After the runway accidents and several other minor incidents  
last year, South Korean officials ordered the carrier to cut back 
domestic flights by 15 percent for six months. The restriction is 
to end April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy, the flight operations director, said the airline is  
improving, which was evident during an incident at Chicago's O'Hare 
airport this month. An Air China jet mistakenly turned onto a 
runway where a Korean Air Boeing 747 was taking off, but the 
captain of the jumbo jet avoided a crash by making a sharp turn out 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain displayed excellent situational awareness, made a  
great set of decisions,'' Hardy said. ``But the airline remains 
under a high level of scrutiny.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes NATO Bombing Helps KLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While conceding that bombing alone may not  
bring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to his knees, the 
Clinton administration says NATO's round-the-clock air campaign may 
give a resurgent Kosovo Liberation Army the upper hand in its civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
described that scenario Thursday as one course of events that would 
constitute victory for NATO in its 3-week-old attack on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to this point the KLA, which first emerged in 1996, has been  
on the run against a much larger and better armed and trained 
Yugoslav army. Shelton said there were fresh signs of a KLA 
comeback, and he spoke of NATO's sustained bombing campaign 
eventually creating a ``shift in the balance of power'' in the 
KLA's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But that is a prospect not entirely in line with the  
administration's aims for Kosovo, which do not include independence 
from Serbia. The KLA has no intention of settling for autonomy. It 
wants a separate Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters today, alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said  
Serb forces in Kosovo are being ``harassed'' by the KLA, which he 
likened to ``a Phoenix rising from the ashes.'' Shea said the Serb 
military is now caught in a ``vise'' between the Kosvoar rebels on 
one hand and NATO forces on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its allies have said from the start that  
Kosovo should have a measure of self-governance but remain a 
province within Serbia. President Clinton said Thursday in a speech 
in San Francisco that despite its ambitions, Kosovo ``lacks the 
resources and infrastructure to be viable on its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the long run, our goal for Kosovo should not be  
independence, but interdependence,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said NATO had no alternative but to prevail. Ceding  
Kosovo to Milosevic, the president said, would mean ``turning 
Kosovo into a lifeless wasteland'' and would mark a historic 
setback for democracy in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said the mistaken NATO attack Wednesday on a  
refugee convoy in Kosovo that killed dozens of civilians was a 
regrettable error that shows that modern warfare ``is not a 
business of perfection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is also inevitable in a conflict of this kind, with planes  
traveling at high speeds, doing the best to fulfill their 
mission,'' Clinton said. ``And if the requirement is that nothing 
like this can ever happen, then we're saying it's OK with us if Mr. 
Milosevic displaces over a million Kosovars, kills and rapes 
thousands upon thousands of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee,  
Shelton was asked what constituted victory for NATO, in light of 
the fact that Milosevic so far shows no signs of halting his 
assault on ethic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which 
is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that when we have degraded Milosevic's forces to the  
point that he either seeks a political settlement or until the 
balance of power shifts in the favor of the KLA in Kosovo is the 
way I would define it right now,'' Shelton replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the same hearing with Shelton, Defense Secretary  
William Cohen foresaw the possibility of a ``resurgent and 
radicalized'' KLA that already is enjoying an upsurge in recruiting 
among young Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton told the committee he had detected signs in recent days  
of increasing KLA operations against the Yugoslav army and special 
police forces that have been routing the rebels from their 
strongholds in southwestern Kosovo, forcing civilians from their 
villages and burning many of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of a weakening Milosevic was a theme raised by  
several administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, testifying before a House  
Appropriations subcommittee, said the NATO alliance was firmly 
united behind a goal of continuing the bombing until Milosevic is 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared to inflict such damage on his military that he  
either accepts the outcome we seek, or the balance of power in 
Kosovo will shift against him at a time when his actions, far from 
destroying his opposition, are galvanizing its strength and 
determination,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	In pinning its hopes on a stronger KLA, the administration is  
raising many ticklish questions. One is whether the United States -- 
together with NATO or acting alone -- should arm the Kosovar rebels. 
Cohen said the administration opposed that option because it would 
make the Balkans conflict worse in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we start to support arming the KLA ... you will then invite  
others to start rearming the Serbs and you will intensify the 
combat and the conflict there rather than demilitarizing it,'' 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that it is inevitable that the KLA would be  
getting arms ``from a variety of sources,'' and when that happens, 
Milosevic will ``see them start to come up'' and challenge his grip 
on Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired in Idaho High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOTUS, Idaho (AP) -- A high school sophomore fired two shotgun  
blasts in a school hallway today before he began babbling 
incoherently and was taken into custody. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Notus High School was evacuated and its 200 students dismissed  
shortly after the shootings about 8:20 a.m. in this tiny 
southwestern Idaho farming community. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Cooper, 16, was taken into custody after he dropped the  
.12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun he had brought from home on the 
bus, wrapped in a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
	Why Cooper fired the shots wasn't immediately clear, but Canyon  
County sheriff's officials said he had a history of mental illness 
and had been on medication. Sheriff George Nourse said rumors had 
circulated Thursday that the boy had threatened other students and 
had a list of those he wanted to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a lot of kids took him seriously,'' Nourse said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hollered at him, `Put the gun down, put the gun down.' He  
had a knife in his other hand. He was talking to me; he was 
babbling,'' Nourse said. ``He stared at me. He never took his eyes 
off me. He was babbling incoherently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper was taken into custody and brought to a hospital where he  
was being evaluated, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students scurried out of the school building after the first  
shot was fired in a foyer outside the principal's office. Before 
all the students could get outside, the second shot was fired, 
blasting a three-inch hole in a metal door leading to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that second gunshot had been a couple of feet higher, it  
would have hit some students,'' said student body president Howard 
Pennington, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 people live in Notus, which is about 30 miles west of  
Boise.

<HEADLINE> USDA Pricing Overhaul Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman's  
recommended changes to the federal milk pricing system would hurt 
producers and consumers alike, several lawmakers said as they 
introduced their own proposed overhaul of the Depression-era rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary's action defies common sense,'' Rep. John  
McHugh, R-N.Y., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C.: ``A reform plan for dairy  
pricing that puts farmers out of business and does not benefit 
consumers is a complete failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A department spokesman, Andy Solomon, responded: ``During the  
debate over the farm bill, Congress chose not to address this issue 
and left the massive task of reform to Secretary Glickman. Without 
hesitation, we've really worked aggressively to bring about that 
reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers defended their decision to move forward with a bill  
even though Glickman's proposal must win approval from dairy 
farmers before it could take effect Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that would be irresponsible of this Congress, to say  
we're going to see what farmers are going to do,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 members of Congress are supporting the bill. The  
National Milk Producers Federation, which represents dairy farmers, 
also supports the congressional proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are the nation's milk pricing regions, which are  
divided into what are called milk marketing orders. The orders set 
the price that processors pay dairy farmers, much like a minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm law ordered Glickman to consolidate the nation's  
current 31 orders. Glickman's proposal reduces those regions to 11 
but it also changes some of the formulas by which dairy farmers are 
paid -- the main point of contention for the bill's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents to the USDA plan say it would lower the minimum price  
received by dairy farmers, potentially costing them nearly $200 
million a year, according to the National Milk Producers 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they want to see Glickman use an option that was part  
of his draft proposal released last year and supported by many 
lawmakers. That version is closer to the price levels now in place, 
so it would not hurt producers, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can make it more market-oriented without forgetting that  
both consumers and farmers benefit from it,'' said Jerry Kozak, 
chief executive officer of the milk producers group. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Garrison, executive director of the South East Dairy  
Farmer Association, said many southeastern states already have a 
shortage of dairy farmers and more could leave the business if 
revenues were projected to drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ultimately could make milk higher for consumers because  
it costs more to bring milk in,'' Garrison said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Support of Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Confronted by a protest against the  
bombing in Yugoslavia, President Clinton said Friday that Americans 
would feel even greater apprehension about the bombing campaign in 
Kosovo if ``we couldn't lift a finger'' to counter Serb atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 Serbian-American demonstrators, blowing whistles and  
chanting, stood in the rain with signs demanding a halt to the 
bombing. ``Serbia today, who next,'' one sign read as Clinton's 
motorcade rolled by. ``America wake up, stop bombing,'' said 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Fairlane Club, at a $500,000 Democratic fund-raising  
event, Clinton asked the audience to remember the ``few thousand 
people killed and a million-plus refugees'' driven from Kosovo by 
the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how many apprehensions you have ... how would you  
feel'' if asked to explain ``why we couldn't lift a finger to do 
anything about it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Americans to stand united.  
</P>
<P>
	``Because in the end, the political leadership of the country  
cannot go where the people will not travel,'' he said. ``That's 
what a democracy is. So it matters what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke in the Detroit area before flying to Boston  
for another political fund-raising event, that one expected to 
produce $800,000. The $1.3 million raised during the day will go 
toward helping Democrats regain control of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit area has about 40,000 Albanian-Americans along with  
a large community of Serbian-Americans. Both turned out for 
Clinton's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred or so demonstrators supporting NATO's airstrikes gave  
Clinton a friendly greeting in the community of Roseville as he 
arrived to address residents involved in humanitarian relief 
efforts for the Kosovo refugees. A banner bore the legend of the 
``Kosovo Liberation Army'' and said, ``Thank you Mr. Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president met privately with Albanian-Americans who told of  
relatives forced from their homes in Kosovo. Some of them asked 
Clinton to let refugees come to Michigan for temporary housing, 
officials said. Clinton made no commitment and said the United 
States would explore options. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has agreed to accept 20,000 refugees but that  
plan is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also met with military reservists heading to France to  
support the NATO operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking note of the Dearborn demonstration against the bombing,  
Clinton said, ``That was good because that was the American way. 
That is not Mr. Milosevic's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Roseville Recreation Center, Clinton said, ``I know many  
people here have very strong feelings about the conflict in Kosovo. 
... Many of you have loved ones in Kosovo -- relatives, friends 
kicked out of their homes under pain of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he urged that Americans ``not develop some negative feeling  
or bias against Serbian-Americans or even the Serbian people 
themselves, because most of them don't even know what has been done 
in their name in Kosovo because the state-run media has covered it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Serbian-Americans ``overwhelmingly ... want a democratic  
Serbia that is a part of Europe, not apart from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quarrel'' is with a Serbian leadership that ``believes it  
is all right to kill people and to uproot them and to destroy their 
family records and to erase any record of their presence in a land 
simply because of their ethnic heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit marked a return to the campaign trail. He  
canceled a fund-raising swing through Western states at the outset 
of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes into their 
fourth week, administration officials said Clinton was returning to 
normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	The president cast the day's fund raising as a key part of  
participatory democracy. ``I'm here because I care about my 
country's future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Conducts Final Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. on Friday conducted its final flight  
test to prove its jetliners won't go haywire when the year 2000 
rolls around, this time with the president of the commercial 
aircraft division riding along in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing happened,'' said Alan Mulally, president of Boeing  
Commercial Airplane Group, after he walked down the steps from the 
brand-new 737-600 twinjet. ``Most of the systems on the airplane 
don't use a clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing was one of the first U.S. corporations to start tackling  
the Year 2000 computer problem, beginning work back in 1993. More 
than a year ago, it determined the date change would at worst cause 
only some minor problems with certain cockpit displays, and none 
that would directly affect in-flight safety. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Boeing's airline customers wanted more reassurance, so  
the company agreed to test fly one of each of its nine current 
production models, and change the date to the new century in 
mid-flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulally went along on the final test to publicize that the  
planes will be safe, especially to the flying public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very confident that things will be just fine,'' Mulally  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he wasn't sure where his schedule would take him on New  
Year's Eve, Mulally added, ``I think it would be a very good place 
to celebrate the turn of the century, in a Boeing airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 20,000 feet above Tatoosh Island just off the northwest tip  
of Washington state, Capt. George Adams Jr. set the airplane clock 
to a few minutes before midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	After counting down to the date change, he, first officer Joseph  
MacDonald and Mulally radioed back to Boeing's Flight Test Center 
here that nothing had occurred. The plane returned to Seattle after 
the hour-long flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers were originally programmed to recognize only the  
last two digits of a year. They are at risk of failing when 2000 
arrives, since the software could assume that ``00'' is less than, 
say, ``98'' or ``99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an increasingly digital society, the problem is pervasive and  
often hard to detect, especially in electronic devices with 
so-called ``embedded'' software that may have been programmed years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing began working on the problem in earnest six years ago  
when workers couldn't use some software to order landing gear for a 
767 to be built after the turn of the century, said Willie Aikens, 
Boeing's Year 2000 program manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program burped in '93,'' Aikens said. ``It wouldn't handle  
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Boeing has spent more than $35 million to make all  
its manufacturing and operating systems ``Y2K compliant,'' and to 
check out its aircraft. Aikens and other Boeing officials said the 
job is mostly done, with final work on the telephone system to be 
completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to be sure, Aikens said, Boeing is drawing up a series of  
contingency plans should problems arise Jan. 1. But he said he 
thinks the date change will be a non-event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Huffaker, a Boeing Customer Services engineer working on the  
Y2K problem, said the only aircraft problems found were in loading 
navigational databases into cockpit computers -- a task done on the 
ground, not in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, the cockpit display will simply say the data is  
out of date, but will otherwise function. In a small number of 
early model planes using a different navigation system, crews would 
be unable to complete preflight checks to make the jet ready to 
fly. Huffaker estimated last year that perhaps 20 aircraft in the 
world's fleet would be so affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing sent out service bulletins to its customers early last  
year, telling them how to fix the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing did not study any equipment or systems that airlines  
might have added themselves, such as in-flight entertainment 
systems, but has shared any information it learns about them with 
customers, Huffaker said.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Cowboys Lett Fails Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Star defensive tackle Leon Lett faces a possible  
lifetime suspension from the NFL after failing a drug test for the 
third time, according to published reports on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But an unidentified Cowboys official and a team player told The  
New York Times that NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is reviewing an 
appeal filed by Lett. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-year veteran, who was suspended for parts of the  
1995-1997 seasons because of failed drug tests, might be 
challenging validity of the test collection and processing 
arrangements, which he also did before imposition of his second 
ban, according to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Lett faces a ban of at least one year under  
the NFL's drug policies. It was unclear which drug was detected by 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought Leon was straightening out his life,'' the Cowboys  
official who declined to be identified told The Times, adding that 
his emotions concerning Lett ranged from ``sadness to anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrible news,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lett's Dallas area telephone number is unpublished and he could  
not be reached early Friday by The Associated Press for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, coach Chan Gailey and Lett's agents  
told The Dallas Morning News they were either unaware of or could 
not comment about the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard anything about it, and I would have heard  
about it unless it was moving so quickly,'' agent Jim Steiner told 
the newspaper Thursday. ``I'm going to have to get a copy of the 
report and go to work on this tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lett, who has been in the NFL substance abuse program since  
1995, was suspended by the league for four games during the 1995 
season, then missed the last three games of the 1996 season and the 
first 13 games of 1997 because of failed drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Claiborne, Lett's other agent, said he spoke to the  
defensive lineman Monday and would be shocked if the Pro Bowler 
failed another drug test under the NFL program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire program is based on confidentiality,'' Cowboys  
owner Jerry Jones told The News. ``We're not in a position to make 
any comment nor would we want to. No one from The New York Times 
has called and asked me or anyone in the organization questions 
about this.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: Europe Telecom Merger Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom has reportedly entered merger  
talks with Telecom Italia, a move that could create a European 
telecommunications giant while at the same time saving the Italian 
company from a hostile takeover by Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions between the two companies' chief executives have  
entered advanced stages, the London-based Financial Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the aim of such a deal, if completed, would  
be to create a powerful European-wide operator that could compete 
globally with U.S. telecommunications giants such as AT&AMP;T and MCI 
WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Telecom Italia said today the company has been  
talking with Deutsche Telekom for some time about a possible 
alliance, as it has with other foreign counterparts like British 
Telecom and Spain's Telefonica. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rome-based spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, refused to confirm whether talks with the German company 
had reached the point of actual merger discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telecom, dismissed the  
newspaper report as ``speculation'' and refused to comment on it. 
Ehnert also refused to confirm whether Deutsche Telecom has talked 
in the past with Telecom Italia about a closer working 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't say anything more,'' he said Friday from his office  
in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia's share price rose to $10.39 in midmorning  
trading today on the Milan stock exchange, up eight cents from 
Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Frankfurt stock exchange, Deutsche Telekom shares were  
trading at $41.68, an increase of 85 cents from the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Any possible deal would likely be reached quickly, the Financial  
Times said, due to Telecom Italia's urgent need to stave off 
Olivetti's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti unveiled its $58 billion proposed bid in February, and  
later sweetened it to $65.2 billion. Telecom Italia, a former 
state-owned company, tried last Saturday to encourage its 
shareholders to approve a stock conversion plan that would have 
made a takeover far too expensive for Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	But the meeting of shareholders fell short of a quorum, making  
the situation even more urgent for Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	No one from Telecom Italia or the German-based Deutsche Telekom  
could be reached for comment late in the evening European time 
Thursday. Deutsche Telekom was quoted as telling the Financial 
Times that it ``would not take part in any speculation'' on the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Any possible deal would have to be approved by the Italian and  
German governments and the European Commission's antitrust 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal may include the German government selling its  
74 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom over a defined period and the 
German company abandoning its alliance with France Telecom, the 
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE>  Dodgers Trade Mlicki to Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers made the anticipated  
trade of Dave Mlicki on Friday, sending the right-handed starter to 
the Detroit Tigers along with right-handed reliever Mel Rojas for 
three minor league pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, who are sending cash to Detroit as part of the  
deal, will receive right-handers Robinson Checo and Aposto Garcia 
and left-hander Richard Roberts. The trade cut their payroll, 
second in the majors at $79.18 million on opening day, to about 
$72.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It also lowered their luxury tax bill next January by about  
$1.84 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Los Angeles activated right-handed reliever Antonio  
Osuna from the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Osuna will be in uniform for the Dodgers in San Diego this  
weekend, as will Checo, who was 0-0 in two appearances for 
Detroit's Triple-A affiliate in Toledo this season. He didn't allow 
an earned run in five innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Mlicki was 0-1 with a 4.91 ERA in two relief appearances for the  
Dodgers this season. He was 8-7 with a 4.57 ERA and three complete 
games in 30 starts for the New York Mets and Dodgers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mlicki was 7-3 with a 4.05 ERA for the Dodgers in 20 starts  
after being acquired in a trade along with pitcher Greg McMichael 
for pitchers Hideo Nomo and Brad Clontz on June 4, but entered this 
season as the odd man out in the Los Angeles rotation, so a trade 
had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Rojas was 0-0 with a 12.60 ERA in five  
appearances this year. He was 5-2 with a 6.05 ERA in 50 appearances 
for the Mets last season. The Dodgers acquired Rojas from the Mets 
for infielder-outfielder Bobby Bonilla on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Osuna threw two scoreless innings in his third rehabilitation  
appearance for Single-A San Bernardino on Thursday night in 
Lancaster. He was placed on the disabled list March 29 because of 
right elbow soreness. He had a 7-1 record with a 3.06 ERA in 54 
relief appearances for Los Angeles last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia will report to the Dodgers' Double-A affiliate in San  
Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, 19, is expected to report to the Dodgers' Single-A  
affiliate in Vero Beach, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Cancels 26 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines canceled 26 West Coast flights  
Friday when an unusually high number of ticket agents and baggage 
handlers called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the sick calls, Alaska scrapped talks that were  
scheduled Friday with a ticket agents' union in Seattle, said 
airline spokesman Jack Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the incident as an illegal job action, and said a  
sickout would violate contracts with the Seattle-based airline. 
Evans said he had no idea how long it would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounded flights mostly served Portland, Ore., but Phoenix,  
the California cities of San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland, and 
the Nevada communities of Las Vegas and Reno also were affected, 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Operations in Seattle and Portland, Ore., were left shorthanded  
-- 125 in Seattle and 50 in Portland, Evans said. Management filled 
in at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Evans said the 
airline flew 30 ticket agents from Seattle and Alaska to help in 
Portland and six to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists  
Air Transport Workers District 143 in Minneapolis said the union 
does not condone a sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't aware this was going to happen -- if it's a  
grassroots action,'' said the union's Mary Beth Christensen. ``It 
would have an adverse effect on the negotiation process. We're 
trying to go through the process as it's supposed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said talks with baggage handlers began in December 1996 and  
are now under way in Washington, D.C. Talks with ticket agents 
began last November. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a federal judge in Dallas fined the Allied Pilots  
Association $45 million for ignoring a court order to end a sickout 
that led to the cancellation of more than 6,700 American Airlines 
flights in February.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Find Huge Bacterium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A single-celled microbe large enough to be  
seen with the naked eye has been found by researchers sampling 
ocean dredgings in the South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacterium -- as big as the period at the end of this sentence  
-- is the largest ever identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The microbe, discovered near Namibia, lives by absorbing sulfur  
and nitrates, and it swells as the chemicals are stored inside its 
cell walls, researchers report in a study published today in the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest of the bacteria is 0.75 millimeter, according to a  
report by Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology,  
who made the discovery, said the microbes form chain-like colonies 
that tend to glow from the absorbed nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look like a thin string of pearls,'' said the scientists,  
who named the new microbe Thiomargarita namibiensis, which means 
``Sulfur Pearl of Namibia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the largest Thiomargarita was a blue whale,'' Science said  
in a statement, ``then an ordinary bacterium would be a bit smaller 
than a newborn mouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this analogy, the largest previously known bacterium ``would  
be about as big as a lion,'' about 100 times smaller than 
Thiomargarita, Science reports. The previous record holder was 
Epulopiscum fishelsoni, a microbe found in the gut of surgeonfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Planck researchers said the bacteria live in an environment  
with high levels of hydrogen sulfide, conditions that are toxic to 
most other forms of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists said Thiomargarita is found in great  
concentrations in Namibian coastal sediments that contain high 
levels of toxic sulfide.

<HEADLINE> Flights Canceled Due to Sick Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A higher-than-average number of Alaska Airlines  
ticket agents and baggage handlers called in sick today, causing 
the cancellation of more than a dozen flights, airline officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said ticket counters in  
Seattle, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco were left shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based airline is in the process of working out a new  
contract with baggage handlers through mediation. Negotiations with 
ticket agents began this week. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	Mary Beth Christensen, a spokeswoman for the International  
Association of Machinists Air Transport Workers District 143 in

<P>
	``We ... do not condone job actions or sanction them. We weren't

	On Thursday, a federal judge fined American Airlines' pilots  
union for a sickout last February. About 2,500 of 9,400 pilots 
called in sick over 10 days, resulting in the cancellation of 
nearly 6,700 flights by the nation's second-largest carrier.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Merger Would Face Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA may finally have found a white  
knight to rescue it from a hostile takeover by its smaller Italian 
rival, Olivetti SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia has reportedly entered merger talks with Deutsche  
Telekom AG, in a deal that could be the biggest merger in history, 
beating the pending $73.7 billion linkup between Exxon Corp. and 
Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	To pull off their merger, Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia  
would first have to win the approval of the Italian and German 
governments and the European Commission's antitrust department. 
</P>
<P>
	But the regulatory thicket is so dense -- and the likely  
commercial benefits of a combination so limited -- that some 
analysts question whether it makes sense for them to bother trying 
to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal  
reported that serious discussions about the German-Italian merger 
were taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is plausible, but it would face much in the way of  
hindrances if it came to implementation,'' said Robert Grindle, an 
analyst at HSBC in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco seemed to substantiate  
the reports. Speaking in Dresden, Germany, he told reporters on 
Friday that Telecom Italia's chief executive Franco Bernabe had 
informed Italy's Treasury and Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 
the day before about the ``hypothesis'' of a merger between TI and 
Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia spokeswoman based in Rome said Friday that the  
company has been talking with Deutsche Telekom for some time about 
a possible alliance, but not a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, dismissed the  
reports as ``speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation grew more complicated Friday when separate talks  
were reported about a possible merger between Deutsche Telekom and 
British telecommunications firm Cable and Wireless PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-British merger discussions are in ``advanced  
stages,'' according to an advance copy of Saturday's issue of 
Germany's newspaper Die Welt. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom officials were not available Friday evening to  
comment about the reported talks with Cable and Wireless. Officials 
at London-based Cable and Wireless declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia has been actively seeking a way to repel  
Olivetti's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti proposed in February to buy Telecom Italia for $58  
billion and later sweetened its bid to $65.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, a former state-owned company, tried last  
Saturday to persuade its shareholders to approve a stock conversion 
plan that would have made a bid far too costly for Olivetti. But 
the meeting of shareholders fell short of a quorum, making the 
situation even more urgent for Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a merger with Deutsche Telekom would raise several  
regulatory issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom operate an Italian phone  
consortium called Wind, together with Italy's Enel SpA. An Enel 
spokeswoman said Friday that a merger between Deutsche Telekom and 
Telecom Italia would violate the trust between the German firm and 
its partners in Wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters further is the German government's 74  
percent share of Deutsche Telekom. The Italian government has 
frequently voiced concerns about foreign ownership of its 
telecommunications sector and Telecom Italia's ownership structure 
gives the government veto power over any mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you start adding all these issues up, it presents quite a  
few obstacles,'' said analyst Grindle. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also questioned the commercial logic of the planned  
linkup. The merger could lead to cost savings through economies of 
scale, but the German company would gain little in the way of 
desired international assets, except for Telecom Italia's holdings 
in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117  
billion, far bigger than Telecom Italia's $77 billion.

smallest fire, but it was such a blaze -- thought under control -- 
that took Port St. Lucie by storm on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 545-acre blaze, fueled by wind gusting to 30 mph, destroyed  
at least 43 homes and damaged 33 others near this city on Florida's 
east coast, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of some of these forests, with the amount of  
undergrowth leaves and pine needles, they can burn underground for 
weeks and weeks,'' said Terry McElroy, spokesman for the state 
Agriculture Department. ``They are thought extinguished but 
re-ignite when the wind kicks up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It began raining at dusk Friday and thunderstorms were expected  
Saturday for the Port St. Lucie area, where firefighters kept the 
upper hand on the smoldering blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we have it pretty well contained,'' said Lt. Ron  
Parrish of St. Lucie County Fire District. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida stepped up its prescribed burning after last year's  
devastating blazes to rid neighborhoods of brush. No such 
preventive measures were taken in the wooded St. Lucie neighborhood 
of $90,000 and $120,000 homes just west of the city that is the 
spring training home of the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``That particular area ... is kind of a poster example of danger  
of having structures so intermingled in the woods,'' McElroy said. 
``You have houses in the middle of the woods on top of one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bill approved by a state House committee Friday gives the  
Division of Forestry more power to burn off vegetation in 
controlled burns on people's land. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials have cautioned that without any significant rain,  
conditions are ripe for a repeat of last summer's blazes that 
scorched 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 residents from their 
homes. The 1998 fires damaged or destroyed 350 homes or businesses 
and caused $400 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Two helicopters and two 3,000-gallon tank planes assaulted the  
smoldering landscape from the air with water. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas of the rain-starved state, about 280 people were  
forced out of their homes by fires that burned some 6,600 acres in 
central and southwestern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in St. Lucie County kept watch for looters and  
warned residents of unlicensed contractors who might prey on their 
desperate situation. A curfew was will be enforced from 9 p.m. to 6 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents complained about the lack of resources to battle the  
flames. The area does not have fire hydrants and when Florida Power 
&AMP; Light cut power Friday to 6,000 homes -- afraid of live wires 
burning -- it cut electricity to well pumps. Some residents were 
forced to bale water from their pools in a bucket brigade to drench 
flames as they neared homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was just so much I could've done. No power, no water. If  
I had had water I could've taken care of it myself, '' said 
Clifford Newland, who lost his home, his pickup truck and his car.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Finds Time To Raise Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- President Clinton returned to the  
fund-raising circuit today even as he tried to maintain public 
focus on the U.S. military's engagement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Between a fund-raising luncheon in Dearborn, Mich., and a dinner  
in suburban Boston, Clinton was meeting with support personnel at 
military bases and with Detroit-area residents involved in 
humanitarian relief efforts for the Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	He canceled a fund-raising swing through Western states at the  
outset of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes into 
their fourth week, administration officials were determined to show 
they were also tending to normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Democrats hoped to raise more than $1 million  
from the two political events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an unusual moment for me to be here,'' Clinton  
acknowledged during the Majority 2000 event at Detroit's Fairlane 
Club, ``but a very important moment for Americans to re-examine 
what it means to be a good citizen on the edge of a new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president cast the day's fund-raising events as a key part  
of participatory democracy. ``I'm here because I care about my 
country's future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and officials involved with coordinating the U.S.  
response to the humanitarian crisis -- including Eric Schwartz, the 
National Security Council's director for multilateral affairs; 
Hattie Babbitt, who is deputy director of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development; and James Lee Witt, director of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency -- briefed community leaders on 
plans to build temporary shelters for refugees in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have directed our Defense Department to build a new refugee  
facility in Albania for up to 20,000 people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ticked off a list of individuals and organizations who have  
been moved to help the refugees. ``The heart of America has been 
engaged by this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was meeting with members of the local  
American-Albanian community, which Witt said had been particularly 
active in the relief effort. Other groups invited to hear the 
president at the Roseville Community Center were local chapters of 
the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	A toll-free hot line managed by FEMA has received 31,000  
telephone calls in two weeks from people who wanted to donate to 
relief efforts. A public service announcement by first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton began airing today to urge even more people to call. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the United States has supplied nearly $150 million in  
humanitarian relief to aid the hundreds of thousands of Kosovar 
Albanian refugees. The administration is holding discussions with 
Congress to secure more than $5 billion to pay for the Kosovo 
operation, and 10 percent to 15 percent of that package would be 
dedicated to humanitarian relief. 
</P>
<P>
	As thousands of men, women and children continue to stream  
across Kosovo's borders into Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro, 
concern is growing about the plight of refugees trapped within the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said on Thursday that there was no easy way to aid the  
internal refugees because the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic stood ready to shoot down relief planes or seize 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	But National Security Council officials indicated efforts were  
under way to provide relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The options for getting food to the displaced in Kosovo are  
not many, and ultimately we're prepared to support efforts of 
private volunteering organizations and appropriate international 
organizations to try to get food and medicine in,'' said Eric 
Schwartz, the NSC's director of multilateral affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said such an operation would require that Milosevic  
agreed to allow aid groups to enter the region, and added that 
``discussions are taking place on a number of different fronts'' to 
see if such approval could be secured. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Air National Guard personnel at Selfridge  
Field, Clinton was flying to Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, 
Mass., for another meeting with base personnel before dinner at the 
home of former Democratic National Committee finance chief Alan 
Solomont. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers at Hanscom play a key role in the development of  
avionics equipment that guides the B1 bomber and other tactical 
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Surf the Net on Your ... Phone? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Futuristic devices that offer brand new ways of  
surfing the Internet are hitting the market, promising a nifty 
alternative to the personal computer. But do enough consumers want 
to check out Web pages on their telephone? 
</P>
<P>
	Gadget makers will soon find out. The French telecommunications  
company Alcatel is talking with U.S. companies about introducing a 
``smart'' home phone this fall that would give Americans quick 
access to the Web and electronic mail without a PC. One potential 
partner reportedly is America Online, the largest Internet service 
with 17 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel's phone, called WebTouch, is about the size of a  
hardcover novel. It has a 7.5-inch touch-sensitive screen, a 
pull-out keyboard and up to 10 special buttons that can be 
programmed to jump the user to weather updates, stock quotes or 
order pizza from the corner restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, makers of mobile phones such as Qualcomm, Motorola  
and Nokia are soon coming out with nearly a dozen new Web 
``companions'' that add e-mail and Internet access to wireless 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch in upcoming marketing campaigns will be relatively  
simple: Why bother booting up your computer to surf the Internet 
when you can just reach for the phone? 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, less 1 percent of the 69 million cellular phone users  
in the nation have Web phones, according to the Yankee Group, a 
Boston-based research firm. But that is expected increase to about 
21 percent by 2003 as prices come down and technology improves. 
</P>
<P>
	But the devices face obstacles. Vendors must simplify Web  
information and graphics so they don't clutter relatively small 
screens. Some analysts say the gadgets could confuse consumers by 
combining Internet and phone functions. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the beauty of the home phone is its simplicity.  
</P>
<P>
	``The main drawback is this converged idea -- Let's glue a phone  
and a Web browser together,'' said Tom Rhinelander, an industry 
analyst with Forrester Research, a Boston-based high-tech 
consulting firm. ``How are you going to get people to understand 
how to use this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel is betting it can. The Wall Street Journal reported  
Friday the company is a probable partner with America Online in 
delivering a screen phone to U.S. consumers. AOL, by marketing to 
its millions of subscribers, could stoke a mass market by offering 
discounted subscriptions to early adaptors of the technology. A 
phone is just one of a slew of Net-surfing gadgets planned by AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alcatel spokesman, Gean Christophe Huertas, declined to  
comment on any AOL deal but confirmed the company is talking with 
``several U.S. partners to develop our screen phone in the United 
States.'' AOL spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg also would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel hopes it can duplicate the success of its Minitel screen  
phone, which is widely popular in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect the PC to go away. Potential smart phone customers  
are expected to still use a PC to for lengthier Web browsing, since 
computers boast larger screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not in competition with the PC,'' said Beatrice Mandine,  
an Alcatel spokeswoman. ``In our visions, it's a very different 
approach.''

<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP ) -- The Weather Channel has named the cable  
television industry's chief lobbyist as its new president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker Anstrom, who has served as the National Cable TV  
Association's president for five years, will take over at the 
Weather Channel Aug. 1, the company announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anstrom's appointment follows the surprise resignation three  
weeks ago of Michael J. Eckert, who helped found the Weather 
Channel and ran it for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Anstrom is a well-respected figure within the cable TV industry  
but has never run a channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is to take this value network and migrate it  
into the digital age,'' Anstrom said during a visit to Atlanta on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weather Channel, owned by Landmark Communications, provides  
weather information 24 hours a day to 72 million cable households. 
It faces increasing competition from other broadcasters and 
Internet sites.

<HEADLINE> GOP Renews Tax Relief Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The annual income tax filing deadline has come  
and gone, but Republicans in Congress say they won't abandon their 
promises to cut taxes this year despite many obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will succeed,'' vowed House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But once again, the GOP-led House failed in its annual April 15  
vote to push through a proposed constitutional amendment to require 
that most tax increases gain a two-thirds vote in Congress instead 
of a simple majority. The amendment itself required a two-thirds 
majority, and the 229-199 vote Thursday was short by 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the three hours of floor debate, along with an anti-tax  
rally featuring top GOP leaders, enabled Republicans to remind 
voters that tax relief tops their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day when people are particularly sensitized, and they  
need to know which party wants to cut their taxes,'' said Rep. 
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also chose Thursday to rush through legislation  
giving tax breaks to troops involved in the war in Yugoslavia. 
Sponsors said the measure extends the relief to more support 
personnel than a nearly identical executive order signed by 
President Clinton this week for soldiers in the combat zone. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pointed out that five of  
the GOP's top 10 priority bills deal with tax relief and 
Republicans in the House and Senate have adopted a budget blueprint 
promising an unspecified $778 billion tax cut using projected 
government surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's an overcharge to the American people, they ought  
to get a refund,'' Hastert said at the rally. ``We need to hold 
down the tax burden on the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans are having a tough time deciding which taxes  
to cut. They have already backed away from a proposed 10 percent 
across-the-board income tax cut and face a money crunch that is 
likely to allow for only modest relief in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed constitutional amendment to limit tax increases  
went down to defeat for the fifth straight year. All but a handful 
of Republicans voted for the measure, while most Democrats were 
against it and derided it as little more than an April 15 stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a gimmick,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,  
top Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
``This annual attempt to tinker with the Constitution will never 
provide a penny of tax relief to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents, noting that 14 states have similar laws,  
promised they would not give up and said it was worthwhile to have 
the debate each April 15, regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	There were numerous other tax-related hearings and events in the  
Capitol, including introduction of a bill to abolish the income tax 
entirely -- it was created in 1913 by the 16th Amendment -- and 
replace it with a 15 percent national sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	One other annual announcement came from the Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, which said May 11 will be this year's 
``Tax Freedom Day.'' The foundation calculates it would take until 
then -- a day later than last year -- for the average American to 
earn enough to pay his or her share of all federal, state and local 
individual and corporate taxes.

<HEADLINE> Reno Seeks To Restore Trust in Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As protests grow over police treatment of  
minorities, Attorney General Janet Reno called for action Thursday 
-- from the Justice Department to the street patrolman -- to restore 
the trust of minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as she announced a new Justice Department effort to gather  
data on incidents of police brutality, Reno said, ``No matter what 
the data show, the perception of too many Americans is that police 
officers cannot be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is national in scope and reaches people all across  
this country,'' she said. ``Especially in minority communities ... 
residents believe the police have used excessive force, that law 
enforcement is too aggressive, that law enforcement is biased, 
disrespectful, and unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno tried to strike an evenhanded note as she gave her longest  
speech yet on police misconduct at a National Press Club luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	She saluted ``the overwhelming majority'' of the nation's  
700,000 officers she said do excellent work, but urged a crackdown 
on bad apples. She advocated tougher responses to misconduct, but 
stopped short of endorsing civilian review boards favored by many 
civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	She described the fear and distrust engendered in motorists who  
are stopped without explanation and left to wonder if police 
targeted them just because they are black. But she also outlined 
the fear of policemen who follow suspects down dark alleys and have 
to make split-second decisions on whether to fire their guns. She 
noted that 688 officers have been killed on duty in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has grown lately. Police have shot and killed black  
civilians in New York, Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif. New Jersey, 
Maryland and Florida state troopers have been accused of stopping 
motorists based on a driver's race -- so-called racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999, we are seeing some of the same police brutality we  
saw in the Jim Crow days, but white America just doesn't get it,'' 
said Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, D-N.Y., a former prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leaders appealed to Reno earlier this month to make  
a dramatic statement, perhaps in New York City at the site where 
officers fired 41 shots at unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo, hitting 
him 19 times. That Feb. 4 shooting has spawned continuing public 
protests in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Reno has met privately with police chiefs and  
community leaders from 20 cities, with inner city youths and 
probationers and with police union leaders. Thursday, she announced 
a Washington conference within the next two months with these 
groups to try to develop standards for respectful police-citizen 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the Justice Department's annual survey of crime  
victims would ask for the first time this year whether citizens had 
an encounter with police in which force was used. She urged local 
departments to emulate a new San Diego program that requires 
officers using handheld computers to unobtrusively record the race 
of stopped citizens so it can be determined if racial profiles are 
being used unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that a good many of those police officers who are not  
trusted should be trusted, and somehow or another we have to bridge 
the gap between what is real and what is not and operate based on 
fact,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was studying a bill reintroduced Wednesday by Rep.  
John Conyers, D-Mich., that would require the Justice Department to 
collect data on traffic stops by local police. ``Stopping our 
citizens to be searched on account of their race is an unacceptable 
activity on the part of law enforcement,'' Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno supported last year's version of the bill, which passed the  
House but not the Senate. Aides said she wants to be sure Congress 
supplies money to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that in the quest for a colorblind society, some  
people want us to keep track of people by race,'' said Jim Pasco, 
executive director of the 277,000-member Fraternal Order of Police, 
which opposes any racial tabulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also said the Justice inspector general will evaluate her  
own department's use of force and the department's civil rights 
division is seeking more money for ``pattern and practice'' civil 
investigations of police departments. These can lead to agreements 
to alter police procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``All law enforcement agencies ... from the director, chief or  
sheriff on down must send a clear message that misconduct will not 
be tolerated, rude or unfair treatment will not be countenanced,'' 
Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rank and file officers must ... be intolerant of misconduct by  
fellow officers, and they must make it unacceptable to keep silent 
about other officers' misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police departments should recruit officers from communities that  
have complained about policemen and should provide citizens with a 
complaint procedure that eliminates their fear of speaking up but 
remains fair to accused officers, she added.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission will have a  
difficult time enforcing its proposed antitrust settlement with 
microchip giant Intel Corp., says the sole agency commissioner who 
opposed the government's original complaint against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Commissioner Orson Swindle, the dissenter in the 3-1 vote  
last summer, also expressed doubt on whether the government would 
have won its lawsuit had it not settled with the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given my reservations about the merits of the complaint, I  
would be more concerned about the order -- comprising a 
difficult-to-enforce mandate to 'sin no more,' with a major proviso 
and some significant exceptions -- if it seemed likely to impose 
real and significant restrictions on Intel,'' Swindle said in a 
written statement released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, the FTC accused Intel of holding a monopoly in  
the market for microprocessors, the ``brains'' of computers. The 
suit charged Intel illegally used its monopoly power to withhold 
key technical information about its future chips from three 
companies: Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp. and Compaq 
Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC claims Intel withheld the data to punish the companies  
for refusing to license key patents to Intel without charge. In the 
process, according to the government, Intel's actions hurt 
consumers by curbing innovation and barring other companies from 
potentially entering the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Intel reached a settlement with the government just as  
the case was to begin a lengthy hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency commissioners voted 3-0 to approve the settlement, which  
will become final after a 60-day public comment period now under 
way. Swindle did not vote because he was on medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Intel promised to share important  
technical details with other companies about its computer chips, 
but allowed for exceptions in rare circumstances. In return, Intel 
was not required to admit it has monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle said he expects the FTC will have a hard time enforcing  
the settlement because ``it is extremely doubtful that Intel is 
going to create any kind of record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that my pessimism is unwarranted but the key terms of  
the order seem destined to enmesh the commission in expensive, and 
perhaps intractable, enforcement proceedings if Intel is ever 
suspected of violating it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle also questioned why the FTC's filed its original  
complaint against Intel and ``for injecting a government agency 
into the dynamic workings of a fast-moving, high-technology 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also challenged whether Intel's hold on the microchip market  
``is as unassailable as the complaint suggests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel products run roughly 85 percent of the world's personal  
computers. The company had sales of $26.2 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Swindle pointed out that Intel now faces unprecedented  
competition in supplying chips for low-end personal computers, an 
area where a good portion of consumer demand has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Available information has not dispelled my questions about  
whether Intel has monopoly power -- as opposed to just an extremely 
large market share -- in general-purpose microprocessors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, the remaining FTC commissioners -- Sheila  
F. Anthony, Mozelle Thompson and Chairman Robert Pitofsky -- said 
they are confident that agency and Intel attorneys ``have done a 
commendable job of crafting a remedy that addresses serious 
potential competitive harm without significantly hindering Intel's 
legitimate business activity.''

<HEADLINE> Rabbi Accused of School-Jobs Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, Hertz Frankel has been known as a  
gentle, fatherly Brooklyn rabbi and principal of Beth Rachel, 
billed as the world's biggest Jewish girls' school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holocaust survivor was prominent internationally as a  
spokesman for the ultra-orthodox Satmar Hasidic Jews in 
Williamsburg, a neighborhood of bearded men in black hats and 
coats. 
</P>
<P>
	Few suspected what investigators charge -- that the 68-year-old  
rabbi siphoned about $6 million in public school money to finance 
the private school. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel pleaded guilty to conspiracy April 9 in Brooklyn federal  
court. The judge sentenced him to probation for three years and 
ordered the Beth Rachel school to pay $1 million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Stancik, the city's special schools investigator, said  
Frankel conspired with public school officials to trade political 
support on a community school board for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	From the mid-1970s until 1994, phony jobs were given to 80 women  
living in the district, Stancik said. The ``jobs'' ranged from 
security guards and remedial teachers to aides and came with family 
health insurance benefits for the women, some of whom had as many 
as 10 children. 
</P>
<P>
	The phony employees gave their paychecks to the rabbi, who then  
passed on the money to the 4,000-student Beth Rachel school and its 
parent organization, the United Talmudical Academy, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for the money, Stancik said the rabbi assured district  
administrators that they would get the support of a critical bloc 
of Hasidic men on the nine-member community school board. 
</P>
<P>
	The rabbi has denied holding any sway over the board, but  
Stancik said ``many people benefited from this corrupt bargain. 
None of them were New York City public school students or their 
parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the rabbi said he pleaded guilty to avoid  
further humiliating his community. He said he's ``the victim of a 
great injustice,'' explaining that school officials had told him to 
accept the money to help relieve an economic burden from New York 
taxpayers by educating the Jewish children privately. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arrangement took place, but he did not benefit one  
penny,'' said Frankel's attorney, Nathan Lewin. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former district superintendents also were implicated in the  
scheme, but died before any charges could be brought. Three 
lower-level administrators pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges.

<HEADLINE> Lab Says Technician Reused Needles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- At least 3,600 patients who had blood  
work performed at a lab are being warned to get tested for AIDS and 
hepatitis after a technician admitted sometimes reusing needles, 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties were  
preparing to mail out the warnings as early as this weekend to 
people who had been patients since June 1997 at the SmithKline 
Beecham Clinical Laboratory in Palo Alto, the San Francisco 
Chronicle reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel that the risk is quite low,'' said Dr. Jon  
Rosenberg, a state epidemiologist leading the investigation since 
SmithKline disclosed the problem 10 days ago. ``But we can't assure 
ourselves that there is no risk, so we think people need to have 
this information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said that the technician, who was not identified by  
the state or SmithKline, freely acknowledged reusing certain 
needles to draw blood from patients with difficult-to-pierce veins. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she washed the needles with water and a dilute solution  
of hydrogen peroxide, which might kill some but not all pathogens 
in infected blood. She told investigators she did this only 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the woman typically worked alone at the office,  
investigators say a co-worker saw her reuse a needle March 22. 
SmithKline officials interviewed her, fired her and notified the 
state Department of Health Services on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline spokeswoman Tobey Dichter said the lapse in standard  
safety precautions was shocking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first concern is for the health of the patients,'' she  
said. ``We are working to determine the risk, if any, and will do 
whatever is medically appropriate to support them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who had their blood drawn at the laboratory while the  
woman was employed there will be offered free tests at an 
independent lab, paid-for but not performed by SmithKline. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman worked mostly unsupervised in the tiny office since  
June 1997, drawing blood from as many as 15 patients a day. She 
also worked in as many as 10 other Bay Area labs since she was 
trained as a phlebotomist, a person who draws blood, in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are tracking down her previous employers to see  
whether notifications need to be expanded to patients of those labs 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the employee's own recollection, investigators believe  
that she reused needles during a limited period. The technician was 
described as cooperative with investigators, who do not believe she 
acted maliciously. 
</P>
<P>
	Reusing disposable needles is a gross violation of accepted  
safety procedures. It presents a small but not insignificant risk 
that viral diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis B and C can be 
transmitted if they were present in the blood of patients on whom 
the needles were previously used. 
</P>
<P>
	State and county officials had planned to disclose the problem  
at a news conference next week, after doctors and patients had 
received the notification, but state health officials confirmed it 
after an inquiry by the Chronicle on Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Report: AOL To Unveil Net Gadgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. is reportedly gearing up to  
release a number of devices that will allow people to easily get 
onto the Internet without using personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The online giant, with 17 million subscribers worldwide, plans  
to introduce some of the devices -- including a screen phone -- in 
the next several weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices would help AOL in its plan to increase its impact in  
a person's everyday life, by giving people the ability to obtain 
e-mail and access Web pages using devices such as a screen phone, 
the Journal said, citing people familiar with the company's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Screen phones, which have failed to catch on the United States  
but are popular in France, are like regular desktop phones but have 
a screen and a small keyboard. While consumers would still use the 
computer for lengthy trips onto the Internet, the screen phone 
could be used to quickly check e-mail or sports scores. It would 
also have the advantage of cutting down on the time it takes to get 
online, which can often be a lengthy process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal cited Alcatel SA as a likely partner in AOL's  
strategy. The French telecommunications company has said it plans 
to market its WebTouch screen phone in the United States but has 
not identified any partners.

<HEADLINE> Botched Launch Probe Delays NASA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force investigation into a  
botched satellite launch could mean another delay for NASA's $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has impounded an upper-stage motor intended for  
the telescope, to be launched in July aboard space shuttle 
Columbia. It's the same kind of motor that apparently malfunctioned 
April 9 and left the military's newest Defense Support Program 
satellite stranded in a useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile-warning satellite is spinning so fast in its  
lopsided orbit that Air Force controllers have yet to unfurl its 
electricity-generating solar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're continually trying to work with it,'' Staff Sgt. Steve  
Horton of Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado said Friday. 
``There's always a hope that they can recover it and rescue it and 
get it into its proper orbit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $250 million satellite needs to be in a circular  
22,300-mile-high orbit in order to perform its job for the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is working  
with the Air Force's accident investigation board, which convened 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force must deliver the impounded Boeing-built motor to  
NASA by the end of April if the space agency hopes to meet its July 
9 launch date for Chandra, said payload manager Scott Higginbotham. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope-delivery mission already is a year late because of  
bad circuit boards that had to be replaced in Chandra and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost to the point where it doesn't faze me because I'm  
getting used to it,'' Higginbotham said. ``It is a little bit 
frustrating because we've been planning and planning and planning 
to execute this flow for over a year now. We're ready to go do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however: ``This telescope is a multibillion-dollar  
investment. You can rest assured the program is not going to go 
launch it until all the open questions have been answered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, a Hubble-caliber observatory, should have rocketed into  
orbit last summer. Unlike Hubble, the X-ray telescope will be 
placed in an orbit too high to be reached by spacewalking 
astronauts so it will be irreparable once launched.

<HEADLINE> Problems at Bil Mar Before Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Federal inspectors uncovered unclean practices  
and faulty procedures at a meat processor in the months leading to 
a massive recall over a deadly listeria outbreak, the Detroit Free 
Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The concerns about Bil Mar Foods Inc., including inaccurate  
documents and meat tainted with fecal matter, are outlined in U.S. 
Department of Agriculture records the newspaper obtained Thursday 
under the federal Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zeeland plant, owned by Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., is  
under investigation by a federal grand jury and the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in Grand Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant on Dec. 22 recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and  
lunch meats sold under a variety of names -- the largest meat recall 
ever -- because of suspected contamination with a rare strain of the 
bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has been linked to 15 deaths and six miscarriages  
or stillbirths. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen told the Free Press that  
the Zeeland plant had an inspection history that was typical. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a dirty plant,'' said. ``We have a lot of  
confidence in this facility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that all problems found by inspectors were immediately  
corrected, noting that USDA officials in February called Bil Mar 
Foods a typical plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Company and government documents suggest that the USDA's on-site  
inspectors repeatedly cited the plant for failing to keep the plant 
clean and free of contamination on the hot dog processing lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was repeatedly cited for having spots of old, dried  
meat or other debris on surfaces that came into contact with food -- 
despite the fact that the plant's workers had declared the area 
clean and ready for production, the Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On several occasions, inspectors observed chickens that were  
contaminated with feces. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak's cause has not been pinpointed. But the U.S.  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has focused on a 
refrigeration unit in the ceiling of the hot dog processing room as 
a possible suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	That unit had been a major headache for the plant for the first  
half of 1998, the USDA records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors noted that condensation dripped from the ceiling onto  
hot dog processing machines, work surfaces and even directly on to 
hot dogs as they raced down the conveyor belt toward the final 
packaging machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The company removed the system in July, but that might have  
caused even more problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers had to cut the system in pieces with a chain saw to get  
the unit out, CDC sources told the paper, possibly spreading dust 
containing Listeria monocytogenes around the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria monocytogenes, a common bacteria, causes flu-like  
symptoms in most people but can be a serious threat to pregnant 
women, young children, older adults and people with weakened immune 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC estimates that in the United States each year, 1,850  
people become seriously ill with listeriosis. Of those, 425 die. 
</P>
<P>
	It can take up to eight weeks for symptoms to develop. The  
bacteria can be killed if food is heated thoroughly.

<HEADLINE> Ford's Trotman Paid $14.9 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Alex Trotman's final year with Ford Motor Co. was  
an extremely profitable one. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired chairman, president and chief executive was paid  
$14.9 million in salary, bonus and dividends last year. He also 
received stock options worth nearly $4 million, exercised stock 
options for a $30.1 million gain, and got another $24.1 million in 
stock under a long-term executive incentive plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 pay packages for Ford's five top executives were  
disclosed Friday in the automaker's annual proxy statement filed 
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All received 
substantial raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said the increased compensation reflected the No. 2  
automaker's financial performance in 1998, when its operating 
earnings increased 10 percent to $6.6 billion over 1997 results. 
Ford stock rose 89 percent in value last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Trotman's 1998 basic pay package of $14.9 million, excluding  
exercised stock options and compensation from the incentive plan, 
was up 39 percent from 1997 when he was paid $10.7 million. His 
bonus alone was increased 43 percent from $7 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Trotman retired Jan. 1 and was replaced by Jac Nasser as  
president and chief executive, and by William Clay Ford Jr. as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Dec. 31, Trotman held options to buy 1.1 million shares of  
Ford stock worth $30.3 million, including a 1998 grant to buy 
431,400 shares at a price of $41.07 a share. Ford stock was trading 
Friday at more than $64.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Trotman's $24.1 million stock grant under the long-term  
incentive plan was nearly 2 1/2 times the payment he received the 
previous year. The payments are based on a formula that takes into 
account various measurements of the company's performance over 
periods ranging up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though paid in 1998, the $24.1 million is listed as compensation  
for 1997 because it is based on the company's performance during 
periods ended that year. Spokesman Jim Cain said Trotman put the 
proceeds into a deferred compensation plan and will receive 
payments over time. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of additional restricted stock he will receive for  
his performance during periods ending in 1998 will be determined 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser received $6.9 million in salary, bonus and dividends, a  
67 percent raise over his 1997 compensation when he was president 
of Ford's automotive operations. Nasser also received stock options 
worth $8.9 million, and was paid $6.1 million in stock under the 
long-term incentive plan. The incentive bonus was nearly six times 
as much as the amount he received a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser did not cash in any stock options last year.  
</P>
<P>
	William Clay Ford Jr., as a nonemployee board member, received  
the normal director's fees last year, totaling $70,000 plus $1,000 
for each of the 22 scheduled meetings he attended. As chairman, 
this year he will instead receive $1.5 million in restricted shares 
of stock, Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. plans to release its proxy statement  
Tuesday. Because the newly merged DaimlerChrysler AG is 
incorporated in Germany, it is not required to file a proxy 
statement with the SEC.

<HEADLINE> The Great One a Canadian Treasure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- It was only natural that Canada's prime minister  
should intervene in the Wayne Gretzky retirement saga. After all, 
Jean Chretien is arguably the nation's second most famous man. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was only natural that Chretien, like so many of his  
compatriots, should plead in vain for the Great One to play on. 
Beyond the borders of the world's most hockey crazed country, 
Gretzky ranks high among the greatest-ever superstars of sport; in 
Canada, he is much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians have been aware of Gretzky since he was a pint-size  
peewee player, scoring goals at unbelievable rates. Over three 
decades, they have marveled at his hockey exploits, admired his 
decorum, gushed over his love life, anguished over his trade to a 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as Gretzky concludes his 20-year NHL career, Canada is  
awash in end-of-an-era nostalgia and retrospection, as if this one 
player's departure from hockey is on a par with the ending of the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a country skeptical of success and wary of evanescent  
heroes, Wayne Gretzky became an icon, for what he accomplished with 
his athletic genius and, just as important, the dignity and class 
of his character,'' wrote Jeffrey Simpson, political columnist of 
the nationally circulated Globe and Mail newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky even became a topic of debate Friday in Parliament,  
where a motion urging him to play one more season was sidelined on 
technical grounds. Lawmaker Cliff Breitkreuz wore a No. 99 hockey 
jersey to the session, and said of Gretzky, ``Wow, what a 
Canadian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Innumerable Canadians know the Gretzky story by heart -- how at 2  
he started taking practice shots with a sponge ball at his 
grandmother in her easy chair; how his father, Walter, a telephone 
repairman, built a rink in their backyard in Brantford, Ontario, 
when Wayne was 3 so he could practice incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gretzky was 8, he scored 104 goals in 62 games. When he was  
10, and stood 4-foot-4, he scored 378 goals in 82 games. Parents of 
some of his teammates would scream ``Puck hog'' at him, even though 
he also led his teams in assists. 
</P>
<P>
	By 14 he had scored well over 1,000 goals and was a celebrity,  
interviewed on a national radio program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew he was good, all right, but to my eye at least, it  
hadn't gone to his head,'' recalled the interviewer, Peter Gzowski. 
``I remember asking him if he thought he'd ever make $100,000 a 
year playing hockey, and he just laughed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within 10 years of that interview, Gretzky was well on the way  
to becoming the greatest hockey player in history, dominating an 
often brutish sport with finesse and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The scope of his achievements are known to fans worldwide -- four  
Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, more than 60 NHL records, 
nine most valuable player awards, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canada, his success transformed him into a national treasure.  
Few Canadians in any field, including politics and entertainment, 
ever have been subject to such coast-to-coast adulation and 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's courtship of American starlet Janet Jones in the  
mid-1980s was covered breathlessly by Canadian media, which 
divulged minute details about her childhood in a St. Louis suburb, 
her career (including a lead role in ``Police Academy 5'') and 
previous flings (with Bruce Willis and tennis pro Vitas Gerulaitis, 
among others). During the romance, an edition of ``Playboy'' with 
Jones on the cover sold out in Edmonton within three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers weren't prurient, one magazine-shop manager said at  
the time -- ``They're just Gretzky fans who want to see what kind of 
woman he's marrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wedding, on June 16, 1988, was depicted as the closest  
Canada ever would get to royal nuptials. Thousands of people 
thronged the streets outside St. Joseph's Basilica in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	Said one of the onlookers, graphic designer Brenda  
Savella-Smith: ``In England they have the royal family. In the 
United States, it's Hollywood. But we have to make our own heroes 
in Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matrimonial euphoria was shattered two months later by the  
most shocking of news -- Oilers owner Peter Pocklington was trading 
Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like ripping the heart out of the city,'' said Edmonton  
Mayor Laurence Decore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky wept at a farewell news conference then, and Canadians  
engaged in overwrought postmortems as to whether Pocklington or 
Gretzky's new wife bore the bulk of the blame. Some fans likened 
Jones to Yoko Ono, whose marriage to John Lennon contributed to the 
Beatles' breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more than a hockey transaction,'' said prominent  
Canadian author Peter C. Newman. ``I'm upset about it and I don't 
even follow hockey. Canada can't afford to lose a hero. We don't 
have enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Gretzky himself retained his hold on the Canadian  
heart, through a decade of often-frustrating seasons in Los 
Angeles, St. Louis and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after his trade to the Kings, he made a point of saying he  
wouldn't change citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Canadian to the core, and I always will be,'' he promised.  
</P>
<P>
	He has kept the vow, and remains active in charity causes and  
the promotion of hockey in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, hockey in Canada needs his help. There is nationwide  
soul-searching about flaws in the youth-league system that seem to 
be reducing the number of creative offensive players like Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is persistent concern about the long-term future of  
small-market Canadian NHL teams, such as Edmonton and the Ottawa 
Senators, who say a high tax burden and a weak Canadian dollar make 
it difficult to compete with wealthier U.S.-based teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, Gretzky lent his support to a planned Canadian  
hockey summit this summer aimed at addressing these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has changed,'' he said. ``And if we're going to make  
sure that Canadian teams and Canadian players remain on the cutting 
edge of the game, we've got to change, too. We can't take our 
leadership for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Gretzky in retirement will play an active role in  
Canadian hockey, but he already has bestowed an invaluable gift to 
the national sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played hockey -- our game -- with an unmatched grace and a  
boyish enthusiasm that whispered to every Canadian kid on every 
frozen pond or rink that this was the way the game should be 
played,'' wrote the Globe and Mail's Simpson. ``Fast and clever and 
clean.''

<HEADLINE>  40 Killed by Colombia Mudslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The search for survivors from a pair of  
mudslides in western Colombia slowed Friday, after rescuers 
recovered 40 bodies and only one couple remained missing, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of torrential rains, mudslides on Thursday buried  
several blocks of the town of Argelia, 150 miles west of Bogota. 
The first slide occurred before dawn, the second after 
firefighters, police and civil defense workers had arrived to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivor Maria Dolores Villa said she tried to warn the new  
relief workers that the area was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shouted to stay away, but they had come to rescue a young  
girl and just kept at it,'' the El Espectador newspaper quoted her 
as saying. ``I saw the mountain break into two and bury them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the disaster could have been prevented.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole town is in mourning, but as always happens in  
Colombia, people die first and find solutions later,'' Jhon Jairo 
Castillo, director of Argelia's disaster committee, told The 
Associated Press in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than two months, the mayor had been pleading with the  
federal and state governments for funding to relocate residents 
living in neighborhoods at risk of mudslides, Castillo said. Those 
requests were ignored, Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feared that one day soon this mountain would cover us  
all,'' El Espectador quoted resident Jersey Quiceno as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Argelia, a city of 8,000, is in the same coffee-growing region  
that was struck by a devastating earthquake Jan. 25 that killed at 
least 1,170 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusually heavy rains over the past few weeks have forced rivers  
over their banks and produced a series of smaller landslides 
claiming 70 lives in this Andean nation.

<HEADLINE> Energy Officials Avoided Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Department officials say they kept a  
House Armed Services subcommittee in the dark last year about 
alleged Chinese espionage at a national weapons lab as part of a 
policy of limiting those being told of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Notra Trulock, the agency's special adviser for intelligence,  
told the military procurement subcommittee Thursday that he was 
under specific orders from Elizabeth Moler, then deputy energy 
secretary, not to talk about the alleged Chinese theft of nuclear 
warhead secrets from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not make full disclosure'' at a closed hearing of the  
subcommittee last October, Trulock said. ``I apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's chairman, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said the  
lawmakers were ``very upset'' by the failure of Trulock and Moler, 
who were under oath at the time, to reply to questions about 
espionage at the national labs and asked, ``Why weren't we told the 
whole truth?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the alleged spy case was revealed earlier this year,  
congressional Republicans have been strongly critical of what they 
say was the administration's slow response to the case and its 
failure to keep Congress adequately informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock on Monday backed up their contentions, telling the  
Senate Armed Services Committee that Moler last July prevented him 
from talking to the House intelligence panel about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday he said Moler edited the testimony he had prepared  
for the October Armed Services Committee hearing to take out 
references to espionage at the national labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler, who also appeared at both the Monday and Thursday  
hearings, took strong issue with Trulock's version of events, 
saying she never tried to stop him from testifying and did not edit 
his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But she acknowledged that Federico Pena, then energy secretary,  
had decided the agency, because of the sensitive nature of the 
case, should limit its Capitol Hill briefings to the House and 
Senate intelligence committees. She said this was ``common 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she told Trulock to limit his testimony to the subject  
of security issues involved in visits to the labs by foreign 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter reminded her that his subcommittee oversees two-thirds of  
the Energy Department's budget and said, ``We need candor from the 
department on (security) losses this country has suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With the benefit of hindsight,'' Moler said, ``we should have  
been more responsive in this area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department and the FBI in 1996 began an investigation  
into suspicions that Taiwan-born American Wen Ho Lee, a scientist 
at Los Alamos, transferred intelligence on the W-88 nuclear warhead 
during the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was fired from his job at the New Mexico facility last  
month, but has not been charged with any wrongdoing and the FBI has 
cautioned it may not have the evidence for a criminal case.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today as the  
deteriorating Kosovo situation led to the weakening of the euro. 
Tokyo share prices rebounded in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.22 yen at late afternoon, down 0.58 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 118.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 124.50 points,  
or 0.74 percent, closing the week at 16,851.58 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed down 37.60 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar initially moved higher on  
massive buying by Japanese trust banks and life insurers, but the 
greenback met selling by foreign funds during lunchtime in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's relative weakness derived mainly from  
heavy selling of the euro against the yen by Japanese exporters and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has been under selling pressure recently because of the  
growing conflict in Yugoslavia, fears of worsening relations 
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia and signs 
of sluggish economic growth, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Kosovo situation appears to be escalating, Japanese  
investors were also trying to hedge their euro-denominated assets, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 117.43 yen and 119.20 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.20 yen, down  
from 128.27 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market rose on continued active buying from foreign  
and individual investors who have grown more optimistic about the 
economic outlook for Japan and other Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrel Whitten, strategist at ABN-Amro, said that overseas  
investors began to see ``a noticeable momentum toward economic 
recovery in the Asia region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was expectation that public and  
pension funds were allocating new funds to the stock market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was active, with about 778 million shares changing hands  
on the exchange's first section, up from Thursday's turnover of 634 
million shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 670 to 522, with 
127 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainers in Tokyo included Honda Motor Co. Its share price  
advanced after the Nihon Keizai business daily reported today that 
the automaker will build a new plant in the United States or Canada 
by 2001. Honda's stocks finished at $44.83 per share, up $1.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Yuzuru Matsuno denied the report, saying his  
company had made no decision to build another North American plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda has two factories in North America -- one in the United  
States and one in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 5.10 points, or 0.38 percent, to 
1,343.03. The TOPIX closed down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.605 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.575 percent, 
pushing its price down to 101.70 yen from 101.97 yen.

	Refugees Stream Out of Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of ethnic Alabanian  
refugees arrived today in Macedonia in convoys of tractors and cars 
after they were herded out of Kosovo by Yugoslav forces. The U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees said it believed 100,000 refugees 
were moving toward Macedonia and that 15,000 had arrived over the 
last two days. Meanwhile, refugees were crossing the Morini border 
post into Albania at a rate of 1,000 an hour Friday. Macedonia, 
which already has taken in 120,000 refugees, is reluctant to accept 
any more out of fear its own fragile ethnic balance could collapse 
into violence.

	U.S. Holds Yugoslav Officer

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Insurgent ground forces in Kosovo captured a  
Yugoslav Army officer and delivered him to U.S. custody today, the 
Pentagon said. U.S. forces taking part in NATO air strikes in 
Yugoslavia flew the officer from northern Albania to the Albanian 
capital of Tirana, where he is being held as a prisoner of war, it 
said. No details of the capture were immediately available. The 
officer is the first Yugoslav POW of the three-week-old campaign in 
and around the Serbian province of Kosovo.

years in the NHL. The 38-year-old center will play his last game 
for the New York Rangers on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in the 
regular-season finale vs. Pittsburgh. He has 10 scoring titles and 
nine MVP awards. In 1,486 games with Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. 
Louis and New York, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 
2,856 points -- 1,006 points more than Hall of Famer Gordie Howe,

<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A shutdown of computers at the  
country's three national weapons labs ended today following a 
two-week security training program for workers. Computers involved 
in secure work at Los Alamos National Laboratory in northern New 
Mexico, Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque and the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California were brought 
back on line. Security checks have escalated since reports surfaced 
last year that the Chinese government may have obtained weapons

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of organ donors increased 5.6  
percent last year, enabling about 600 more transplants in 1998 over 
1997 and marking the first substantial increase in three years. The 
increase was most dramatic among donors age 60 and older, who have 
traditionally been passed over by organ banks and hospitals because 
their hearts, kidneys and livers tend to be less healthy than 
organs from younger patients. A ceremony will be held Sunday in 
Washington to recognize families of people who donated. The 
statistics for 1998 were compiled by the Department of Health and 
Human Services.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO blasted oil refineries,  
military barracks and airports in Kosovo, Montenegro and the 
Yugoslav capital on Friday, claiming one of the most successful 
nights in its nearly month-long air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
Air raid sirens sounded again late Friday in cities across Serbia, 
warning of a 24th possible night of NATO attacks. In what may be a 
final push by Yugoslav forces to rid Kosovo of its ethnic 
Albanians, thousands of refugees were driven into Albania and 
Macedonia -- with tens of thousands more on their heels. On a fund 
raising trip to Michigan, President Clinton said NATO's air 
campaign was vital. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Reserves To Be Called  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen probably will  
ask President Clinton early next week for authority to activate up 
to 33,000 reserve forces in support of NATO air campaign vs. 
Yugoslavia. The administration plans a $5.9 billion emergency 
spending request. The call-up will include up to 25,000 Air 
National Guard members in units that fly aerial refueling missions 
both from the United States and from Europe, according to defense 
officials. The need for reserve forces is linked to NATO's decision 
to expand the air war by adding 300 or more U.S. aircraft.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New limits are being placed on low-altitude  
U.S. military test flights over Italy, following a high-level 
review of the ski gondola accident that killed 20 people in 1998. 
Now a U.S. official as well as an Italian base commander must OK 
such flights. Plus flights lower than 2,000 feet above the ground 
must be limited to 25 percent of U.S. military training sorties 
from Aviano Air Base in Italy.

left parts of Florida a powder-keg. A 2,400-acre blaze, fueled by 
wind gusting to 30 mph, destroyed at least 48 homes in Port St. 
Lucie, Fla., yesterday. Two helicopters and two 3,000-gallon tank 
planes assaulted the smoldering landscape from the air with water. 
About 280 people were forced out of their homes by fires in central

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Hamilton Put on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Joey Hamilton, hit hard  
in his first two AL starts, was put on the 15-day disabled list 
Friday because an injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton (0-2), who allowed 15 earned runs in seven innings, has  
right shoulder impingement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton said his shoulder bothered him in spring training and  
it felt ``really sore'' after pitching last Tuesday. He has not 
pitched between starts because of the soreness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something is not right,'' said Hamilton, scheduled for an exam  
Monday with Dr. James Andrews. ``Whether something is broken, I 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto acquired the 28-year-old right-hander from San Diego in  
an offseason trade for Woody Williams, Carlos Almanzar and outfield 
prospect Peter Tucci, then signed Hamilton to a $17 million, 
three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The DL move retroactive to April 14. Toronto recalled  
right-hander Nerio Rodriguez from Triple-A Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Halladay, who came within one out of a no-hitter on the  
final day of the 1998 season, will start in Hamilton's place 
Sunday. Halladay hasn't allowed an earned run in nine innings out 
of the bullpen this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes to show you that pitching is a fragile commodity,''  
Toronto general manager Gord Ash said. ``You can never have enough 
pitching.''

<HEADLINE> Chicken Manure Tax Break Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While tens of millions of Americans clenched  
their teeth and dealt with the IRS, the Senate's top tax law writer 
proposed giving chicken manure a tax break. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth introduced a bill Thursday to amend the  
Internal Revenue Code to make electric power plants fueled by 
chicken droppings eligible for the same tax credits enjoyed by 
windmills and some other alternative energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Chickens are a half-billion-dollar-a-year industry in Roth's  
home state of Delaware and account for two-thirds of its annual 
farm production. Their droppings are also a big source of 
pollution, not to mention the stench. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the amount of chickens we produce as a nation has grown, so  
too has the need to find a creative means for disposing of poultry 
manure,'' said the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth's bill would give power plants that burn chicken droppings  
instead of coal, natural gas or oil a 1.7-cent-per-kilowatt hour 
tax credit.

<HEADLINE> In Bond Funds, Costs Are Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the specialized world of bond-fund investing,  
it almost always pays to be a penny-pincher. 
</P>
<P>
	While there may be a few exceptions here and there, a mountain  
of evidence shows that bond funds with low expense ratios usually 
produce better bottom-line returns than bond funds with high 
expense ratios. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cost matters,'' says John Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group  
fund family, in the ``On Bonds'' chapter of his new book ``Common 
Sense on Mutual Funds'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons). 
</P>
<P>
	Among other data, Bogle looks at a study of five-year returns  
for 92 funds that invest in high-quality municipal bonds: ``The 
obvious conclusion: Returns go down as costs go up. It's as simple 
as that,'' he declares in the assertive style for which he is 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
	On this subject, unlike some others, many other commentators  
agree with Bogle. The logic of his case is based on the nature of 
bonds themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	As big as the market for higher-quality debt securities may be,  
it offers much less variety than the stock market. Returns in the 
stock market vary dramatically from one issue to the next, 
depending on how each company progresses financially. 
</P>
<P>
	To a lesser extent, that same variability may occur in lower  
quality ``junk'' bonds. But as you move up the credit-quality scale 
for bonds of all types, the distinctions get narrower and narrower. 
If two financially strong issuers sell bond issues of identical 
maturities and interest coupons, those bonds may very well produce 
virtually identical returns over time. 
</P>
<P>
	So what's left to distinguish between two bond funds whose  
managers take about the same degree of credit risk and 
interest-rate risk? Beyond whatever difference may arise from the 
skills of the managers operating in tight quarters, costs are 
likely to play a big role. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember that expenses -- for management fees, research and  
administration -- are collected annually from the assets of the 
fund, and thus get subtracted from the portfolio's gross return 
before the shareholder's net asset value is calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Assume that the Imaginary Bond Fund and the Hypothetical Bond  
Fund each realized a 7 percent return on its portfolio from 
interest payments and capital gains last year. If Imaginary's 
expense ratio was 0.5 percent, it returned 6.5 percent for its 
investors. If Hypothetical's expense ratio was 1.5 percent, its 
owners got a 5.5 percent return. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are no extreme examples. Expense ratios of actual bond  
funds can range from practically zero to upwards of 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent statistical survey of the field, Investment News, a  
weekly newspaper for financial advisers, found five Treasury bond 
funds with expense ratios of 0.15 percent, and nine funds in the 
same category with expense ratios of 2 percent or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest one-year returns for the lowest-cost funds ranged  
from 5.59 percent to 7.51 percent. The nine highest-cost funds had 
returns of 4.76 percent, at best, to minus 4.95 percent at worst. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was much the same in five other categories of bond  
funds examined by Investment News. Among multisector bond funds, 
which mix various types of bonds in highly diversified portfolios, 
the six lowest-cost funds had expense ratios of 0.20 percent or 
less, and one-year returns of 4.42 percent to 7.18 percent. Six 
high-cost funds with expense ratios of 1.90 percent or more had 
returns of 0.55 percent to 4.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the high-yield arena, where managers' bond-picking  
skills can make a big difference, the lowest-cost funds got better 
results than the highest-cost. All but one of the 10 low-cost funds 
did better than the minus 2.14 percent average for the whole 
category, while six of the 10 high-cost funds had a worse return 
than the average. 
</P>
<P>
	As you might expect, Vanguard Group, with its emphasis on  
low-cost operation, placed numerous funds on the low-cost lists. It 
had significant competition, however, from other firms in every 
category of bond portfolios. So Vanguard may be a good place to 
look, but it is not the only place. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it stands to reason the more aware investors become  
about the importance of costs in bond-fund management, the more 
low-cost funds they are likely to find available to them.

<HEADLINE> Military To Improve Safety in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Further limits are being placed on  
low-altitude U.S. military test flights over Italy following a 
high-level review of the ski gondola accident that killed 20 people 
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The review approved by Defense Secretary William Cohen and  
Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio establishes new 
procedures and requires the approval of a newly designated U.S. 
official as well as an Italian base commander for all such flights. 
It also limits flights lower than 2,000 feet above the ground to 25 
percent of U.S. military training sorties from Aviano Air Base in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Special approval will be required for low-altitude flights from  
aircraft carriers or from units not permanently based in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-Italian review represents the highest level conclusion  
on the Feb. 3, 1998, accident in which a Marine EA-6B Prowler jet 
on a low-altitude training mission out of Aviano severed a ski 
gondola cable near Cavalese, killing all 20 people on the gondola 
as it plunged to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The report assigns U.S. responsibility for the accident and  
asserts Italian sovereignty over its territory, airspace and 
waters. It also agrees with the conclusions of a U.S. Marine Corps 
investigation that the accident was caused by aircrew errors and 
supervisory errors within the chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
	The new steps will ``provide for maximum safety in the conduct  
of military flight training,'' said Cohen and Scognamiglio, in a 
joint letter to President Clinton and Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and D'Alema had agreed at a White House meeting March 5  
that a top-level review was needed to minimize the risk of more 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The two defense officials presented the conclusions at a joint  
news conference at which Cohen said, ``This accident clearly posed 
difficult challenges to both our countries, but we remain strong 
partners and very, very good friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen again apologized for the accident. Investigations  
concluded that the plane was flying lower and faster than permitted 
under Italian safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This accident clearly posed difficult challenges to both our  
countries, but we remain strong partners and very, very good 
friends,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scognamiglio said the NATO air assault against Yugoslavia  
demonstrates the need for continued low-altitude flight training of 
U.S. forces in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, such training has to ``be carried out by  
ensuring safety as a paramount requirement for the civilians and 
the territory where the training is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart Bekhaert, a Belgian whose brother Stefan was among those  
killed, said family members are ``relieved to learn that this is 
now a plan to assure that something like this will never happen.'' 
But he added: ``The pain of reliving this horrible nightmare again 
and again with no foreseeable closure from the U.S. government is 
unbearable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said they are being ignored in efforts to get  
more compensation. Legislation is pending to fund restitution 
beyond the $60,000 paid to each victim's relatives by the Italian 
govenment and reimbursed by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	American-Italian relations have been strained by the accident  
and its aftermath. Italy is one of the United States' most 
important allies. Thousands of U.S. troops are based in Italy. 
Aviano, in northern Italy, is currently the central staging base 
for U.S. and NATO planes involved in the war in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The month-long joint review of flight safety procedures was  
headed by Adm. Joseph Prueher, a former commander of the U.S. 6th 
Fleet based at Naples, and Italian Air Force Lt. Gen. Leonardo 
Tricarico. They visited the accident site and several military 
bases in Italy last month. 
</P>
<P>
	One flaw reported in the review was that U.S. command  
relationships in Italy were unclear, and this may explain why not 
all aviators were sufficiently familiar with all flight safety 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	A military jury at Camp Lejeune, N.C., recommended this month  
that the navigator of the Marine jet involved in last year's 
gondola accident, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, be dismissed from the 
military for destroying a videotape of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were dismissed after the  
pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, was acquitted of manslaughter in March. 
Ashby still faces obstruction of justice charges in connection with 
the destroyed videotape.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Must Pay Calif. S&AMP;L $23M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the government Friday  
to pay $23 million in damages to a California savings and loan, a 
decision that mirrored a ruling in a similar case last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert H. Hodges Jr. of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims  
found the government breached its contract with California Federal 
Bank. The bank had originally sought more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes exactly a week after the court's chief judge  
ordered the government to pay $909 million to Glendale Federal 
Bank, also in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases stem from a 1996 Supreme Court decision that said the  
government broke its contract with thrift institutions when it 
changed the rules on how they must count their assets as part of an 
S&AMP;L bailout in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations plunged many thrifts into financial trouble.  
The justices said the government could be forced to pay damages to 
the S&AMP;Ls for their financial harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for California Federal Bank could not immediately be  
reached for comment. The Justice Department, in a statement, 
expressed satisfaction that the judge did not award the full $1.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with the result and that the court has  
agreed with our position,'' said David W. Ogden, acting assistant 
attorney general in charge of the department's civil division. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rulings are the first of what may be numerous damage  
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar claims against the government have been filed by about  
125 other thrifts, many of which were declared insolvent after the 
1989 bailout legislation. Some of them have reached financial 
settlements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	California Federal Bank and Glendale are now merged and owned by  
Golden State Bancorp of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Home Shopping Settles FTC Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Home Shopping Network will pay a $1.1  
million civil penalty to settle charges it violated a 1996 order to 
stop advertising products with unsubstantiated health benefits, the 
Federal Trade Commission said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	HSN is a television retailer based in St. Petersburg, Fla., that  
reaches more than 70 million households. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC in March 1995 accused the network and two of its  
subsidiaries, Home Shopping Club Inc. and Lifeway Health Products, 
of deceptive advertising practices. The case was settled a year 
later, with HSN agreeing to obtain scientific evidence before 
airing claims that any food, supplement or drug could ``cure, treat 
or prevent any disease'' or affect a function of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission accused HSN of violating terms of the settlement  
by broadcasting several ads for skin care, weight-loss, 
premenstrual syndrome and menopausal products from 1996 through 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new proposed consent decree that still has to be  
approved by a federal judge, HSN admitted no wrongdoing but agreed 
to pay a $1.1 million penalty to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC cited one ad for a skin-care product that promised to  
``clear anyone's acne within several months'' and another 
commercial for a product to treat PMS and menopause guaranteeing 
``all the benefits of prescription estrogen replacement drugs.'' 
The FTC said the claims were scientifically unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not immediately return a call seeking comment on  
the commission's announcement.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Merger Would Face Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA may finally have found a white  
knight to rescue it from a hostile takeover by its smaller Italian 
rival, Olivetti SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia has reportedly entered merger talks with Deutsche  
Telekom AG, in a deal that could be the biggest merger in history, 
beating the pending $73.7 billion linkup between Exxon Corp. and 
Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	To pull off their merger, Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia  
would first have to win the approval of the Italian and German 
governments and the European Commission's antitrust department. 
</P>
<P>
	But the regulatory thicket is so dense -- and the likely  
commercial benefits of a combination so limited -- that some 
analysts question whether it makes sense for them to bother trying 
to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal  
reported that serious discussions about the German-Italian merger 
were taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is plausible, but it would face much in the way of  
hindrances if it came to implementation,'' said Robert Grindle, an 
analyst at HSBC in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco seemed to substantiate  
the reports. Speaking in Dresden, Germany, he told reporters on 
Friday that Telecom Italia's chief executive Franco Bernabe had 
informed Italy's Treasury and Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 
the day before about the ``hypothesis'' of a merger between TI and 
Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia spokeswoman based in Rome said Friday that the  
company has been talking with Deutsche Telekom for some time about 
a possible alliance, but not a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, dismissed the  
reports as ``speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation grew more complicated Friday when separate talks  
were reported about a possible merger between Deutsche Telekom and 
British telecommunications firm Cable and Wireless PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-British merger discussions are in ``advanced  
stages,'' according to an advance copy of Saturday's issue of 
Germany's newspaper Die Welt. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom officials were not available Friday evening to  
comment about the reported talks with Cable and Wireless. Officials 
at London-based Cable and Wireless declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia has been actively seeking a way to repel  
Olivetti's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti proposed in February to buy Telecom Italia for $58  
billion and later sweetened its bid to $65.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, a former state-owned company, tried last  
Saturday to persuade its shareholders to approve a stock conversion 
plan that would have made a bid far too costly for Olivetti. But 
the meeting of shareholders fell short of a quorum, making the 
situation even more urgent for Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a merger with Deutsche Telekom would raise several  
regulatory issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom operate an Italian phone  
consortium called Wind, together with Italy's Enel SpA. An Enel 
spokeswoman said Friday that a merger between Deutsche Telekom and 
Telecom Italia would violate the trust between the German firm and 
its partners in Wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters further is the German government's 74  
percent share of Deutsche Telekom. The Italian government has 
frequently voiced concerns about foreign ownership of its 
telecommunications sector and Telecom Italia's ownership structure 
gives the government veto power over any mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you start adding all these issues up, it presents quite a  
few obstacles,'' said analyst Grindle. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also questioned the commercial logic of the planned  
linkup. The merger could lead to cost savings through economies of 
scale, but the German company would gain little in the way of 
desired international assets, except for Telecom Italia's holdings 
in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117  
billion, far bigger than Telecom Italia's $77 billion.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Again Asks for New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Convicted conspirator Terry Nichols has renewed  
his quest for a new Oklahoma City bombing trial, saying prosecutors 
withheld information that could have helped his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are too high. They are getting higher,'' attorney  
Michael Tigar wrote in papers filed Thursday in U.S. District 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar rejected prosecutors' arguments that FBI data sheets given  
to Nichols on Dec. 11, 1997, contained information previously 
turned over to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government counsel argued that Mr. Nichols mixed the bomb and  
that he was with Mr. (Timothy) McVeigh for long periods on April 17 
and 18,'' the attorney said. ``The withheld evidence contradicts 
this key government theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, was convicted Dec. 23, 1997, of conspiracy and  
involuntary manslaughter in the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building, in which 168 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, a former Michigan farmer, is serving a life prison  
term. He is charged in Oklahoma state court with murder and other 
offenses that could bring the death penalty. McVeigh, his former 
Army buddy, has appealed his death sentence on murder and weapons 
convictions in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed Nichols helped McVeigh finance the plan,  
gather the ingredients and mix the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys sought to show others were involved by calling  
witnesses who said they saw McVeigh with an unknown suspect 
identified as John Doe No. 2 or other people during key periods 
prior to the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols' motion focuses on dozens of FBI lead sheets, which are  
used to record information taken during informal interviews or from 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
	In his brief, Tigar identified several FBI sheets he said had  
``truly helpful information'' that the defense would have pursued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government actively concealed these sheets,'' he said.  
``We did not discover them until we smoked them out.''

<HEADLINE> Factors That Pushed Up Gas Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans grousing about paying more at the pump  
may blame the whims of their local gas station owner, or the recent 
megamergers in the oil industry. But experts say the rise in gas 
prices was fueled by different factors. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Production cuts  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, after a glut of crude oil supply had pushed prices  
to 12-year lows, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, 
OPEC, voted to cut crude oil production by 2.1 million barrels and 
maintain the reductions for a year. If the decision sticks, it 
would decrease the supply of oil on world markets by about 2.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier agreements have fallen apart amidst political wrangling  
and allegations of cheating, but the current agreement appears to 
be holding. The price of a barrel of crude is now $16.75 on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, up from $10.72 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever the price of crude oil changes, it affects the price  
to dealer immediately,'' said Roy Littlefield, executive director 
of the Service Station Dealers of America. Gas station operators 
may absorb small increases in order to stay competitive, but must 
eventually increase the price, he said. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Refinery shutdowns  
</P>
<P>
	California is paying a steeper price than the rest of the nation  
because of woes at several oil refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 23, an explosion at a Tosco Corp. oil refinery in  
Martinez, Calif., killed four people and caused production to halt. 
A month later, a fire at a Chevron plant in Richmond, Calif., 
prompted steep production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three other California refineries have operated at less  
than 100 percent capacity this spring, cutting out 250,000 to 
300,000 gallons a day from the state's normal daily supply of 2 
million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental laws in California that require gas to be  
specially formulated make it tough to respond quickly to changes in 
supply, analysts said. Just this past week, supply problems eased 
as California received some gas from the Gulf of Mexico and from 
the East Coast, said Jonathan Cogan of the federal Energy 
Information Administration, . 

</P>
<P>
	-- Heavy demand  
</P>
<P>
	Prices inevitably fall during the winter, when fewer Americans  
drive long distances. They often rise in the summer. The peak 
driving season runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day, but travel for 
the Easter and Passover holidays provided an early surge in demand 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Typo Nearly Shrinks GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was only a typo, but it nearly managed to  
do something that frustrated Democrats have struggled with for 
months: virtually eliminate the tax cuts the GOP wants to approve 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The text of the $1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 that the  
Senate approved said the GOP's prized 10-year tax cut would be 
$777,868,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That's $778 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The final three zeroes were missing.  
</P>
<P>
	The amount was supposed to be $778 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	A 10-year, $778 million tax cut would amount to $78 million a  
year. With 126 million individual income tax returns expected this 
year, that would amount to an annual tax cut for each of 62 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides caught the error on Thursday and the Senate corrected it  
by voice vote shortly before the overall budget was approved.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Support of Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Confronted by protests against the  
bombing in Yugoslavia, President Clinton said Friday that Americans 
would feel even greater apprehension about the airstrikes if ``we 
couldn't lift a finger'' to counter Serb atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 Serbian-American demonstrators, blowing whistles and  
chanting, stood in the rain with signs demanding a halt to the 
bombing. ``Serbia today, who next,'' one sign read as Clinton's 
motorcade rolled by. ``America wake up, stop bombing,'' said 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group of protesters awaited Clinton in the wealthy  
Boston suburb of Weston. ``Stop the war, stop the bombing,'' they 
chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told guests at the Weston fund-raiser that U.S.  
involvement in Kosovo was a moral imperative and, alluding to World 
War II, he cast it as a strategic necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in Kosovo ... because we think we can help stop it,'' he  
said. ``And because we have learned the hard way in the 20th 
century when something like that is going on and you think you can 
stop it and you don't, it's just going to get worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside Dearborn's Fairlane Club, at a $500,000 Democratic  
fund-raising event, Clinton asked the audience to remember the 
``few thousand people killed and a million-plus refugees'' driven 
from Kosovo by the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how many apprehensions you have ... how would you  
feel'' if asked to explain ``why we couldn't lift a finger to do 
anything about it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Americans to stand united.  
</P>
<P>
	``Because in the end, the political leadership of the country  
cannot go where the people will not travel,'' he said. ``That's 
what a democracy is. So it matters what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke in the Detroit area and then flew to Boston  
for another political fund-raising event, that one expected to 
produce $800,000. The $1.3 million raised during the day will go 
toward helping Democrats regain control of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit area has about 40,000 Albanian-Americans along with  
a large community of Serbian-Americans. Both turned out for 
Clinton's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred or so demonstrators supporting NATO's airstrikes gave  
Clinton a friendly greeting in the community of Roseville as he 
arrived to address residents involved in humanitarian relief 
efforts for the Kosovo refugees. A banner bore the legend of the 
``Kosovo Liberation Army'' and said, ``Thank you Mr. Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president met privately with Albanian-Americans who told of  
relatives forced from their homes in Kosovo. Some of them asked 
Clinton to let refugees come to Michigan for temporary housing, 
officials said. Clinton made no commitment and said the United 
States would explore options. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has agreed to accept 20,000 refugees but that  
plan is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also met with military reservists heading to France to  
support the NATO operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking note of the Dearborn demonstration against the bombing,  
Clinton said, ``That was good because that was the American way. 
That is not Mr. Milosevic's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Roseville Recreation Center, Clinton said, ``I know many  
people here have very strong feelings about the conflict in Kosovo. 
... Many of you have loved ones in Kosovo -- relatives, friends 
kicked out of their homes under pain of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he urged that Americans ``not develop some negative feeling  
or bias against Serbian-Americans or even the Serbian people 
themselves, because most of them don't even know what has been done 
in their name in Kosovo because the state-run media has covered it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Serbian-Americans ``overwhelmingly ... want a democratic  
Serbia that is a part of Europe, not apart from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quarrel'' is with a Serbian leadership that ``believes it  
is all right to kill people and to uproot them and to destroy their 
family records and to erase any record of their presence in a land 
simply because of their ethnic heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit marked a return to the campaign trail. He  
canceled a fund-raising swing through Western states at the outset 
of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes into their 
fourth week, administration officials said Clinton was returning to 
normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	The president cast the day's fund raising as a key part of  
participatory democracy. ``I'm here because I care about my 
country's future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving later in the day at Hanscom Air Force Base in  
Massachusetts, Clinton was received warmly by a crowd of about 
1,000 people, including military personnel, in an airport hangar, 
which was draped with state and service flags. He said he hoped 
they understood the NATO mission, which is aimed at stopping ethnic 
cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is doing its best to guarantee that for  
ourselves, and for our friends, and for friends of freedom all 
around the world,'' he told them. ``And you make it possible.''

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Union Fined $45M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilots union will appeal a  
$45.5 million fine it received for not halting an illegal sickout 
that led to the cancellation of more than 6,700 flights earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Thursday fined the Allied Pilots Association  
-- which only has assets of $38 million -- for ignoring his order to 
tell pilots to return to their cockpits during a February job 
action. The money will go to the air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	American said it lost revenue of about $50 million during the  
10-day sickout which stranded hundreds of thousands of travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly disagree with the court's decision to transfer any  
of APA's funds to management, much less the huge fine announced 
today,'' said Rich LaVoy, president of the union on Thursday. ``As 
for our immediate next steps, APA will pursue all of its legal 
options to protect the union and its memberships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall had previously held the union  
and its top two officials -- LaVoy and union vice president Brian 
Mayhew -- in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy and Mayhew had placed $15,000 with the court as damages  
were assessed, along with the union's $10 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine how the fine  
will be divided among the three parties. He also ordered the union 
to place a second $10 million with the court. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines said it took no ``particular pleasure'' in the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're victims of this as are we,'' said airline spokeswoman  
Andrea Rader. ``We went to court to get the sickout to stop. We 
want to close this chapter and get on with labor peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rader said the airline had no comment on how American's  
parent company, AMR Corp., will use the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Although labor relations have been strained for some time  
between the pilots and management, resentment grew over the past 
few months over the way American was integrating its purchase of 
Reno Air, a small low-cost carrier purchased in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The union contends that the company has ignored the contract,  
paying pilots less than mandated by the regulations, so the sickout 
was a legal maneuver. About 2,500 pilots called in to take 
themselves off the flying list. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall expressed sympathy for the three-fourths of the American  
pilots who didn't call in sick, saying that imposing the fine makes 
``me sick to my stomach, because I know what's going to happen is 
some very fine men and women pilots are going to be hurt badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the union, however, for its tactics.  
</P>
<P>
	``The flying public in this instance had zero notice and that's  
why it wreaked such havoc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one union member said the ruling was justified. ``I  
think the judge was right,'' said Capt. Carmen Villani, who flies 
out of Washington D.C. ``I personally was very embarrassed over 
what I experienced in the courtroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union has said the abnormally high number of sick calls was  
a rational response to the stress the labor dispute created for 
individual pilots. The union noted that safety regulations require 
pilots to stay home if they consider themselves under too much 
stress to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all of the legal proceedings, American and the union  
have yet to resolve the assimilation issue involving the purchase 
of Reno Air. The two sides met last week with a federal mediator in 
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were going to go forward, this is not the way to resolve  
problems,'' said LaVoy after the hearing. ``This doesn't do 
anything to help the process.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Lead 2000 Fundraising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is off to a slow start raising  
funds for a possible GOP presidential bid, bringing in less than $1 
million in the first quarter of this year, far behind Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, who spent millions of his own money in  
the 1996 race, and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander also 
reported raising under $1 million in the first three months of 
1999, according to campaign financial disclosure reports filed 
Thursday with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider the first quarter spring training, which doesn't  
count toward the regular season,'' Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer 
said. Mrs. Dole has formed a presidential exploratory committee, 
but has yet to declare she's running for the 2000 Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore led everyone with $8.9 million. Another  
Democrat, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, raised $4.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who established a presidential exploratory campaign on  
March 2, had raised $7.6 million by the end of the month without 
holding a fund-raising event. He spent $854,000, leaving $6.75 
million in the bank, his report to the FEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander actually finished the first quarter in debt. He  
reported owing $212,405 and having just $86,916 in the bank as of 
March 31. He raised $748,773 during the first quarter of 1999 and 
spent $661,856. His chief fund-raiser, Ted Welch, said the campaign 
is just starting to take in money; 26 fund-raisers are scheduled 
between May 4 and June 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole raised $685,253 and spent $108,210. She had $578,042  
in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle raised more than any other GOP  
hopeful except Bush, taking in $2.1 million. But much of that money 
was raised through direct mail, which is expensive; he spent $1 
million on fund raising. Quayle had 35,251 contributors, more than 
the 23,339 people who gave to Bush. Overall, Quayle spent $1.6 
million on the campaign and had $500,443 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who shelled out $37.5 million from his own pocket in his  
run for the White House four years ago, gave his campaign $694,000 
of his own money in the first three months this year and raised 
just $18,538. He had spent $599,004 and had just $113,539 in the 
bank as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Juleanne Glover Weiss said Forbes didn't begin  
raising money for his campaign until this month, after the deadline 
for reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been on the phone a great deal,'' Weiss said. ``You won't  
see the seven-digit number until the next filing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expenditures Forbes reported was $254,000 for polling.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore took in contributions from more than 45,000 people. He  
spent $2 million, including $693,089 for fund raising, and had $6.9 
million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 6,000 people gave $1,000 each to Gore, including  
entertainer Barbra Streisand, Eastman Kodak Chief Executive Officer 
George Fisher, and Alex Ferrari, head of MTV Networks. Gore has 
more than 50 people raising $50,000 apiece for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased with the results of our first-quarter efforts,''  
Gore campaign manager Craig Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley remained financially competitive, finishing the quarter  
with $2.9 million in the bank. He received $1,000 apiece from 
former Chicago Bulls basketball star Michael Jordan and his wife, 
Juanita; and $1,000 apiece from former New York Knicks teammate 
Phil Jackson and his wife, June. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. John McCain of Arizona reported raising $1.8 million and  
transferred another $2 million from his Senate campaign fund. He 
spent $1 million and had $2.8 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	--Conservative activist Gary Bauer raised $1.4 million, but spent  
most of it, $881,518. His cash on hand, $489,367, is barely more 
than the debts the campaign owes, $425,563. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. John Kasich of Ohio is not disclosing how much his  
campaign has raised and spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal election law allows potential candidates to raise and  
spend money without disclosing any information as long as the funds 
are used solely to gauge support for a campaign. Kasich campaign 
officials have said the congressman has raised more than $1 
million.

<HEADLINE>  Dodgers Sent Mlicki, Rojas to Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers made the anticipated  
trade of Dave Mlicki on Friday, sending the right-handed starter to 
the Detroit Tigers along with right-handed reliever Mel Rojas for 
three minor league pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers will receive right-handers Robinson Checo and Aposto  
Garcia and left-hander Richard Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers also announced that right-handed reliever Antonio  
Osuna has been activated from the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers made the anticipated

the Detroit Tigers along with right-handed reliever Mel Rojas for 
three minor league pitchers.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Conducts Final Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. on Friday conducted its final flight  
test to prove its jetliners won't go haywire when the year 2000 
rolls around, this time with the president of the commercial 
aircraft division riding along in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing happened,'' said Alan Mulally, president of Boeing  
Commercial Airplane Group, after he walked down the steps from the 
brand-new 737-600 twinjet. ``Most of the systems on the airplane 
don't use a clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing was one of the first U.S. corporations to start tackling  
the Year 2000 computer problem, beginning work back in 1993. More 
than a year ago, it determined the date change would at worst cause 
only some minor problems with certain cockpit displays, and none 
that would directly affect in-flight safety. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Boeing's airline customers wanted more reassurance, so  
the company agreed to test fly one of each of its nine current 
production models, and change the date to the new century in 
mid-flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulally went along on the final test to publicize that the  
planes will be safe, especially to the flying public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very confident that things will be just fine,'' Mulally  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he wasn't sure where his schedule would take him on New  
Year's Eve, Mulally added, ``I think it would be a very good place 
to celebrate the turn of the century, in a Boeing airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 20,000 feet above Tatoosh Island just off the northwest tip  
of Washington state, Capt. George Adams Jr. set the airplane clock 
to a few minutes before midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	After counting down to the date change, he, first officer Joseph  
MacDonald and Mulally radioed back to Boeing's Flight Test Center 
here that nothing had occurred. The plane returned to Seattle after 
the hour-long flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers were originally programmed to recognize only the  
last two digits of a year. They are at risk of failing when 2000 
arrives, since the software could assume that ``00'' is less than, 
say, ``98'' or ``99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an increasingly digital society, the problem is pervasive and  
often hard to detect, especially in electronic devices with 
so-called ``embedded'' software that may have been programmed years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing began working on the problem in earnest six years ago  
when workers couldn't use some software to order landing gear for a 
767 to be built after the turn of the century, said Willie Aikens, 
Boeing's Year 2000 program manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program burped in '93,'' Aikens said. ``It wouldn't handle  
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Boeing has spent more than $35 million to make all  
its manufacturing and operating systems ``Y2K compliant,'' and to 
check out its aircraft. Aikens and other Boeing officials said the 
job is mostly done, with final work on the telephone system to be 
completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to be sure, Aikens said, Boeing is drawing up a series of  
contingency plans should problems arise Jan. 1. But he said he 
thinks the date change will be a non-event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Huffaker, a Boeing Customer Services engineer working on the  
Y2K problem, said the only aircraft problems found were in loading 
navigational databases into cockpit computers -- a task done on the 
ground, not in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, the cockpit display will simply say the data is  
out of date, but will otherwise function. In a small number of 
early model planes using a different navigation system, crews would 
be unable to complete preflight checks to make the jet ready to 
fly. Huffaker estimated last year that perhaps 20 aircraft in the 
world's fleet would be so affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing sent out service bulletins to its customers early last  
year, telling them how to fix the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing did not study any equipment or systems that airlines  
might have added themselves, such as in-flight entertainment 
systems, but has shared any information it learns about them with 
customers, Huffaker said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Support of Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Confronted by protests against the  
bombing in Yugoslavia, President Clinton said Friday that Americans 
would feel even greater apprehension about the airstrikes if ``we 
couldn't lift a finger'' to counter Serb atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 Serbian-American demonstrators, blowing whistles and  
chanting, stood in the rain with signs demanding a halt to the 
bombing. ``Serbia today, who next,'' one sign read as Clinton's 
motorcade rolled by. ``America wake up, stop bombing,'' said 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group of protesters awaited Clinton in the wealthy  
Boston suburb of Weston. ``Stop the war, stop the bombing,'' they 
chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told guests at the Weston fund-raiser that U.S.  
involvement in Kosovo was a moral imperative and, alluding to World 
War II, he cast it as a strategic necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in Kosovo ... because we think we can help stop it,'' he  
said. ``And because we have learned the hard way in the 20th 
century when something like that is going on and you think you can 
stop it and you don't, it's just going to get worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside Dearborn's Fairlane Club, at a $500,000 Democratic  
fund-raising event, Clinton asked the audience to remember the 
``few thousand people killed and a million-plus refugees'' driven 
from Kosovo by the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how many apprehensions you have ... how would you  
feel'' if asked to explain ``why we couldn't lift a finger to do 
anything about it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Americans to stand united.  
</P>
<P>
	``Because in the end, the political leadership of the country  
cannot go where the people will not travel,'' he said. ``That's 
what a democracy is. So it matters what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke in the Detroit area and then flew to Boston  
for another political fund-raising event, that one expected to 
produce $800,000. The $1.3 million raised during the day will go 
toward helping Democrats regain control of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit area has about 40,000 Albanian-Americans along with  
a large community of Serbian-Americans. Both turned out for 
Clinton's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred or so demonstrators supporting NATO's airstrikes gave  
Clinton a friendly greeting in the community of Roseville as he 
arrived to address residents involved in humanitarian relief 
efforts for the Kosovo refugees. A banner bore the legend of the 
``Kosovo Liberation Army'' and said, ``Thank you Mr. Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president met privately with Albanian-Americans who told of  
relatives forced from their homes in Kosovo. Some of them asked 
Clinton to let refugees come to Michigan for temporary housing, 
officials said. Clinton made no commitment and said the United 
States would explore options. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has agreed to accept 20,000 refugees but that  
plan is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also met with military reservists heading to France to  
support the NATO operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking note of the Dearborn demonstration against the bombing,  
Clinton said, ``That was good because that was the American way. 
That is not Mr. Milosevic's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Roseville Recreation Center, Clinton said, ``I know many  
people here have very strong feelings about the conflict in Kosovo. 
... Many of you have loved ones in Kosovo -- relatives, friends 
kicked out of their homes under pain of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he urged that Americans ``not develop some negative feeling  
or bias against Serbian-Americans or even the Serbian people 
themselves, because most of them don't even know what has been done 
in their name in Kosovo because the state-run media has covered it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Serbian-Americans ``overwhelmingly ... want a democratic  
Serbia that is a part of Europe, not apart from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quarrel'' is with a Serbian leadership that ``believes it  
is all right to kill people and to uproot them and to destroy their 
family records and to erase any record of their presence in a land 
simply because of their ethnic heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit marked a return to the campaign trail. He  
canceled a fund-raising swing through Western states at the outset 
of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes into their 
fourth week, administration officials said Clinton was returning to 
normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	The president cast the day's fund raising as a key part of  
participatory democracy. ``I'm here because I care about my 
country's future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving later in the day at Hanscom Air Force Base in  
Massachusetts, Clinton was received warmly by a crowd of about 
1,000 people, including military personnel, in an airport hangar, 
which was draped with state and service flags. He said he hoped 
they understood the NATO mission, which is aimed at stopping ethnic 
cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is doing its best to guarantee that for  
ourselves, and for our friends, and for friends of freedom all 
around the world,'' he told them. ``And you make it possible.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Finds Time for Fund-Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- President Clinton was returning to the  
fund-raising circuit today even as he tried to maintain public 
focus on the U.S. military's engagement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Between a fund-raising luncheon in Dearborn, Mich., and a dinner  
in suburban Boston, Clinton planned to meet with support personnel 
at military bases and with Detroit-area residents involved in 
humanitarian relief efforts for the Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton canceled a fund-raising swing through western states at  
the outset of the conflict in Kosovo. But with the NATO airstrikes 
into their fourth week administration officials were determined to 
show they were also tending to normal business. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Democrats hoped to raise more than $1 million  
from the two events. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that any president does, whether it's a  
Democrat or a Republican,'' said White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart, ``is, as a leader of the party, participate in party 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As thousands of men, women and children continue to stream  
across Kosovo's borders into Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro, 
concern continues to grow about the plight of refugees trapped 
within the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said on Thursday that there was no easy way to aid the  
internal refugees because the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic stood ready to shoot down relief planes or seize 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	But National Security Adviser Sandy Berger suggested efforts  
were under way to provide relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is working very hard on a number of avenues to get relief  
supplies to these people,'' he said. ``I don't think it would serve 
any purpose to describe them here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and two officials he tasked with coordinating the U.S.  
response to the humanitarian crisis -- USAID chief Brian Atwood and 
James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
-- were briefing community leaders involved in the relief effort 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the United States has supplied nearly $150 million in  
humanitarian relief to aid the hundreds of thousands of Kosovar 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Air National Guard personnel at Selfridge  
Field, Clinton was flying to Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, 
Mass., for another meeting with base personnel before dinner at the 
home of former Democratic National Committee finance chief Alan 
Solomont. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers at Hanscom play a key role in the development of  
avionics equipment that guides the B1 bomber and other tactical 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton told a meeting of the nation's newspaper  
editors that a post World War II-style reconstruction plan will be 
needed in the Balkans once the current conflict there is over. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned that the region ``will never be safe with a  
belligerent tyranny in their midst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the annual convention of the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors, Clinton vowed anew that NATO will prevail and 
reverse Milosevic's forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Organ Donation Up 5.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Organ donations rose 5.6 percent last year,  
aided by recruitment of more older donors and closer cooperation 
between hospitals and transplant coordinators, the government 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase to 5,479 donors enabled about 600 more transplants  
in 1998 than in 1997, the Department of Health and Human Services 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organ donation saves lives, but the need for organs is still  
greater than the supply,'' HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said Friday 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 people die each year waiting for a transplant. At  
the end of 1998, there were 64,423 people waiting, a number that 
has been growing much faster than donation has. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was most dramatic among donors age 60 and older,  
jumping 10.8 percent to 782 donors. Older patients have 
traditionally been passed over by organ banks and hospitals because 
their hearts, kidneys and livers tend to be less healthy than 
organs from younger patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the need for organs has grown and organ transplant  
methods have improved, organ banks have increasingly been asking 
families of older patients to donate. 
</P>
<P>
	Donations also rose 9.6 percent for donors aged 40 to 59. It  
edged up only slightly for younger groups. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS also credited a new federal rule that requires hospitals to  
report all deaths to the organ banks that are responsible for 
approaching families about donation and coordinating transplants. 
Experts believe some 3,000 to 4,000 potential donor families are 
never asked about donation. The rule aims to ensure that hospitals 
do not overlook patients who may make suitable donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's increase came despite a high-profile controversy  
that many feared would make families nervous about donation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centers on how to allocate the scarce organs that  
are donated. The network that runs the transplant system and many 
transplant hospitals want the system to retain its geographic 
boundaries, with organs offered to local patients first. The 
Clinton administration wants organs offered to the sickest patients 
first, even if they are in another city or region. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ultimately put off the administration's proposed  
changes while the issue is studied by the Institute of Medicine, an 
arm of the National Academy of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Judge Quits LAPD Civil Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Saying he was unable to tolerate  
``falsehoods,'' a judge accused of anti-police bias removed himself 
from lawsuits involving killings by an elite LAPD squad. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts disqualified himself  
Thursday, accusing lawyers defending the city and police of using 
``things taken out of context, omissions and outright falsehoods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers have made several efforts to remove Letts, citing  
his public remarks that police ``always lie'' or adhere to a ``code 
of silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his written opinion, Letts said the lawyers, ``backed by  
apparently unlimited public funds,'' had combed through his 14-year 
record as a judge ``for the purpose of producing some appearance of 
truth to the one-sided picture they have chosen to present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letts, 64, also said that because of appeals, by the time the  
suits reach trial he may be retired. 
</P>
<P>
	But what tipped the balance, Letts said, was the nomination of a  
lawsuit defendant for a seat on the appellate court that is hearing 
a motion to disqualify him. President Clinton has nominated Raymond 
Fisher, a former city Police Commission president and currently an 
associate U.S. attorney general, for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The two civil rights suits stem from 1995 and 1997 incidents  
involving the Police Department's Special Investigations Section 
that left four suspects dead and five people injured, including two 
SIS officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits claim that SIS officers allow suspects they are  
pursuing to commit crimes as an excuse to kill them in shootouts. 
Defenders say the officers engage in frequent gun battles because 
they are assigned to arrest violent suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Letts' decision took defense attorneys by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 27 years of law practice, I've never seen anything like  
this,'' said Skip Miller, who represents the mayor, police chief, 
city attorney and members of the City Council and Police 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to have Letts removed, Miller added, ``I did what I  
had to do to protect the legal rights of my clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Stephen Yagman, who brought the suits, praised Letts'  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an example of the stunning integrity by this judge in the  
face of a complete lack of integrity by the lawyers who sought to 
recuse him,'' he said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky, known as the best hockey player  
ever, announced his retirement today after two unforgettable 
decades on the ice, ending his career with the New York Rangers 
despite pleas from friends and family not to go. The 38-year-old 
``Great One'' will say goodbye in Sunday's season finale against

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO pounded military targets in the  
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and hit key sites around Belgrade 
today, while refugees arriving from Kosovo reported a greatly 
intensified push by Serb forces to empty whole communities of 
ethnic Albanians. Thousands of refugees have been crossing into 
Macedonia and Albania in what observers believe may be a final push 
by Yugoslav forces to rid Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian population. 
More than a half-million people have fled or been driven from the

	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- At least 3,600 patients who had blood  
work performed at a lab are being warned to get tested for AIDS and 
hepatitis after a technician admitted sometimes reusing needles, 
health officials said. Health officials in San Mateo and Santa 
Clara counties were preparing to mail out the warnings as early as 
this weekend to people who had been patients since June 1997 at the 
SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratory in Palo Alto, the San

is taken in combination with other AIDS medications. It comes in 
capsule form for adults -- eight capsules twice a day -- and a liquid 
formulation for children 4 and older. In six-month studies, 
amprenavir lowered levels of HIV, the AIDS virus, in patients'

	Greenspan Frets About Protectionism

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
expressed concern today that Americans are losing faith in the 
benefits of free trade and said efforts to pursue protectionism 
will end up being ``unwise and surely self-defeating.'' The 
expansion of international trade has been one of the most 
impressive developments of the last half-century, Greenspan told a 
conference in Dallas. He said increasing competition forces 
companies to develop better goods at lower costs, thus improving 
living standards. But companies that fail to remain competitive 
often back protectionist barriers.

The 73-year-old former ``Tonight'' show host was released from 
Saint John's Health Center on April 9, three weeks after quadruple 
bypass heart surgery. Supermarket tabloids have bannered stories 
saying a chain-smoking Carson was near death because lung disease

<HEADLINE> Baylor Mixed in Rockies' Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Don Baylor had mixed feelings Friday when he  
walked into Coors Field for the first time since the Colorado 
Rockies fired him last October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no bitterness whatsoever,'' said Baylor, now hitting  
coach for the Atlanta Braves. ``When you are at a place for six 
years you have to feel something, but bitterness isn't one of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor managed the Rockies in their first six seasons,  
accumulating a 440-469 record and taking the Rockies to the 
playoffs in 1995, the team's third year. Colorado slumped to 77-85 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things that have happened the last six or  
seven months,'' Baylor said. ``I have gotten away from it and have 
moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Friday night's snowout between the Rockies and Braves,  
Baylor met briefly with Rockies owners Jerry McMorris and Charlie 
Monfort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We exchanged pleasantries,'' Baylor said. ``They came up and  
said hello.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 3-5, the Rockies are off to a slow start again this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get any satisfaction out of that because there are  
some guys on the other side that I like, and don't like to see that 
happen to,'' Baylor said. ``That organization has nothing to be 
ashamed of, because we built something positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Atlanta's game at Philadelphia was rained out.  
Friday's snowout was the second in three days at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad because, we had just started swinging the bats  
well in Philly,'' Baylor said. ``I am enjoying the chance to work 
with these guys, trying to get guys to hit the ball back through 
the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor has taken particular interest in Ryan Klesko and Andruw  
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given Ryan Klesko some attention, trying to get him to  
settle down on one stance, one swing instead of four or five 
different ones at a time,'' Baylor said. ``Andruw Jones, I read a 
lot about him. I think he has grown up a lot since last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Braves and Rockies will make up the game on Aug. 19 at  
3:05 p.m. EDT, making it a four-game series that starts Aug. 16. 
... Tom Glavine, 0-2 for the first time since 1990, pitches for 
Atlanta on Saturday against Darryl Kile (1-1).

<HEADLINE> Canada Auto-Parts Plant Hassle Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRATFORD, Ontario (AP) -- A standoff at a Canadian auto-parts  
plant ended Friday morning, less than a day after 25 workers took 
over the factory to fight for jobs they feared would be lost to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Auto Workers Local 1325 said an agreement was  
reached calling for the company, Canadian Fabricated Products Ltd., 
to keep 57 employees who were losing their jobs after Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Production at the plant, which makes interior trim for cars made  
at Chrysler Canada's plant in Bramalea, west of Toronto, was 
expected to resume Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The occupation of the plant began Thursday morning, preventing  
about 500 workers from entering the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Canadian Fabricated notified 57 workers that they  
would be laid off permanently on April 16, with the company 
planning to shift some operations to a a factory in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the company said the plant will remain the primary  
supplier of seat covers for Chrysler Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Canadian Fabricated was bought by Milwaukee-based Johnson  
Controls Corp. in 1994, the work force at the seat-covering plant 
has been more than halved from about 1,200 people down to 500, the 
union has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the workers -- mainly women aged 40 to 45 who have worked  
at the plant for nearly 20 years -- earn an average wage of $18 an 
hour for cutting and sewing.

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Earnings Off 52 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. reported Friday its  
first-quarter earnings fell 52 percent due to a prolonged drop in 
sales to commodity-based industries such as oil, mining and 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	But the heavy equipment maker's results turned out to be well  
above the scaled-back expectations of Wall Street analysts, who had 
sharply lowered their forecasts after Caterpillar warned last month 
its earnings would be disappointing. And it said it was cautiously 
optimistic about its outlook for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar said it earned $205 million, or 57 cents a share,  
compared with $430 million, or $1.15 a share, in the same period of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $4.87 billion from $4.79 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. anticipated earnings of 42  
cents a share. Before the company's March 12 warning, they had 
predicted Caterpillar would report 84 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar's stock rose $2 to $63.81 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's business is sensitive to changes in the world  
economy, so it was hurt by the financial problems of Asian and 
other nations. It was also affected by a drop in business at U.S. 
raw materials industries such as oil and mining -- as their orders 
from other countries fell, they cut back their own orders to 
Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	``While first-quarter profit was disappointing compared with a  
year ago, our outlook for the full year remains unchanged,'' Glen 
Barton, Caterpillar chairman and chief executive, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer expects a 10 percent to 15 percent drop in  
profits from 1998, but has already outlined measures to cut costs 
to maintain profits, including temporary shutdowns of plants in the 
United States and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	And the company is moderately upbeat for the rest of the year.  
Sales of heavy machinery in the United States have remained strong, 
despite weakness in commodity-driven markets, and Caterpillar 
expects an increase in orders later in the year when highway 
projects begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar also said it has seen sales in Asia start back up  
after the freefall sales took during that area's economic downturn.

<HEADLINE> Team Menard Sues Ex-Driver Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (AP) -- A judge issued a temporary restraining  
order prohibiting race car driver Tony Stewart from working for any 
Indianapolis 500 competitors of his former team, Team Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	John Menard, who owns building supply company Menard Inc. of Eau  
Claire, sued Stewart claiming breach of contract. Menard is trying 
to keep Stewart from driving for another team in next month's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The restraining order by Eau Claire County Court Judge Eric Wahl  
prohibits Stewart from testing, practicing, qualifying or racing 
for any Team Menard competitor's for the May 30 Indy 500. Wahl 
issued the order Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing to determine whether a temporary injunction should be  
placed on Stewart is scheduled for next Friday before Judge Thomas 
Barland. 
</P>
<P>
	Team Menard is asking for a judgment of at least $500,000 from  
Stewart on its breach of contract claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to settle the case would be for Stewart to resume  
driving for Team Menard at the Indy 500, said Menard corporate 
attorney David Coriden. But Coriden said he did not know if it 
would be realistic to expect Stewart to drive for Team Menard 
considering the nature of the team's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who had driven for Team Menard since 1996 and won  
rookie of the year honors in the Indy 500 that year, moved on last 
year to drive for Joe Gibbs in the NASCAR Winston Cup series and is 
signed up to drive in the Indy 500 for Tri-Star Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	Tri-Star is an Indy team Stewart put together with Larry Curry,  
his former Menard team manager, and Andy Card, a former Menard 
public relations man. 
</P>
<P>
	David Steinberg, Stewart's Los Angeles lawyer, said in court  
documents Stewart has fulfilled all obligations to Team Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, Team Menard said Stewart's decision not to drive  
for the team in Indianapolis damages Team Menard's competitiveness 
and its reputation and ability to attract sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
	Team Menard said in its suit it has lost profits because of  
Stewart's decision, which has made it difficult for Team Menard to 
prepare for this year's Indy 500.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's 2000 campaign has  
appointed a campaign pro with local Washington connections as its 
political director. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Brazile, chief of staff and press secretary for Del.  
Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, was national 
field director for Rep. Dick Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign. 
She also works as a consultant to the Democratic Congressioanl 
Campaign Committee, as she did in the 1996 and 1998 campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile is an at-large member of Democratic National Committee  
and an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore's political director, she will be responsible for  
political outreach efforts, including lining up endorsements and 
delegates within the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been criticized within the party -- mostly by women's  
groups -- for lacking more women in his inner circle of advisers. 
Brazile will join Tina Flournoy, the campaign's finance chairwoman, 
as the second black woman in a senior role.

<HEADLINE> Botched Launch Probe Delays NASA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force investigation into a  
botched satellite launch could mean another delay for NASA's $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has impounded an upper-stage motor intended for  
the telescope, to be launched in July aboard space shuttle 
Columbia. It's the same kind of motor that apparently malfunctioned 
April 9 and left the military's newest Defense Support Program 
satellite stranded in a useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile-warning satellite is spinning so fast in its  
lopsided orbit that Air Force controllers have yet to unfurl its 
electricity-generating solar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're continually trying to work with it,'' Staff Sgt. Steve  
Horton of Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado said Friday. 
``There's always a hope that they can recover it and rescue it and 
get it into its proper orbit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $250 million satellite needs to be in a circular  
22,300-mile-high orbit in order to perform its job for the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is working  
with the Air Force's accident investigation board, which convened 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force must deliver the impounded Boeing-built motor to  
NASA by the end of April if the space agency hopes to meet its July 
9 launch date for Chandra, said payload manager Scott Higginbotham. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope-delivery mission already is a year late because of  
bad circuit boards that had to be replaced in Chandra and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost to the point where it doesn't faze me because I'm  
getting used to it,'' Higginbotham said. ``It is a little bit 
frustrating because we've been planning and planning and planning 
to execute this flow for over a year now. We're ready to go do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however: ``This telescope is a multibillion-dollar  
investment. You can rest assured the program is not going to go 
launch it until all the open questions have been answered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, a Hubble-caliber observatory, should have rocketed into  
orbit last summer. Unlike Hubble, the X-ray telescope will be 
placed in an orbit too high to be reached by spacewalking 
astronauts so it will be irreparable once launched.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Turn Triple Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers pulled off a triple play  
Friday in their final home opener at County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sammy Sosa and Glenallen Hill singled to start the seventh  
inning, Benito Santiago hit a sharp grounder against Eric Plunk 
down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Jeff Cirillo fielded it, took one step to tag the  
bag and threw to second baseman Fernando Vina. Despite a wide 
throw, Vina turned and threw to first baseman Sean Berry to beat 
Santiago by two steps. 
</P>
<P>
	As the crowd of 55,770, the second-largest ever at County  
Stadium, roared its approval, Brewers manager Phil Garner jumped up 
and greeted the participants as they trotted to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third triple play in Brewers history, the first since  
July 28, 1997, when Toronto's Alex Gonzalez grounded into a 5-4-3 
triple play. It was the first triple play the Cubs hit into since 
last May 8, when Jeff Blauser lined into one.

<HEADLINE> New Gilbert and Sullivan Song Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A lost song from Gilbert and Sullivan's classic  
operetta ``H.M.S. Pinafore'' has been discovered by a Holy Cross 
professor and a scholar from England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reflect, My Child'' was cut for unknown reasons just before  
the premiere of the operetta in 1878. 
</P>
<P>
	Its words survived, but the music was thought lost until it was  
reconstructed by Bruce Miller, a professor of music at the 
Worcester college, and Helga Perry, a Gilbert and Sullivan expert 
from England. 
</P>
<P>
	``To discover anything knew in Gilbert and Sullivan is an  
increasingly rare occurrence,'' Miller said. ``It's certainly 
exciting when you stumble on something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were lucky,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller announced the find Thursday in New York at the 10th  
annual Interdisciplinary Conference of the Society for Textual 
Scholarship. He then played a taped version of the song, performed 
by two Holy Cross graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert and Sullivan scholars have long known about the song  
because its words are included in a licensing copy of the operetta 
submitted to the English government for approval. The copy is kept 
in the British Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry unearthed the first musical pieces of the song last summer  
when Miller called her for help with a separate Gilbert and 
Sullivan project, knowing she had access to rare band parts in the 
operetta. As an aside, he suggested the parts might contain 
sections of the song. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry called him back about 20 minutes later and recited bits of  
the lost music over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I called her I had no idea it was going to lead to this  
discovery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After eight months of research, about half of the voice parts  
were recovered, along with almost all of the refrain, including 
parts for the violins, violas, cellos, string bass, flutes, 
clarinets and French horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and Perry filled in the gaps to create a ``conjectural  
reconstruction'' -- more of an educated guess than an exact replica 
of the original. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a jigsaw puzzle,'' Miller said. ``Some of it is  
speculation. I'm sure there will be people who are playing around 
with this jigsaw puzzle for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Reflect, My Child'' was originally scheduled to be the sixth  
song in the first act of ``H.M.S. Pinafore,'' when Josephine tells 
her father, Capt. Corcoran, that she's in love with a sailor on his 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	In the song, Corcoran tells Josephine that the sailor is beneath  
her. The song is meant to show that society values superficial 
qualities like wealth over a person's intrinsic worth, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	No obvious clue exists to explain why the song didn't make the  
final cut, Miller said. Among the theories: the singer playing 
Capt. Corcoran couldn't handle it; the song was the second of two 
slow numbers and was thought to be a bit of a drag. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a lost masterpiece, but it gives us more about  
`H.M.S. Pinafore' than we've known for a long time,'' Miller said. 
``It fills a gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world premiere of the song with full orchestration is  
scheduled for July's International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in 
Buxton, England.

<HEADLINE> Oil, Livestock, Gold Up; Grain Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Futures prices for crude oil rose to their highest level in more  
than a year Friday amid concerns that the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries will follow through on promises for production 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grains fell and livestock and precious metals  
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for delivery in May hit a high of $17.46 Friday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange after the previous session saw a 
record 638,387 contracts change hands, Tim Evans, an analyst in New 
York for Pegasus Econometric Group, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is just going nuts,'' Evans said. ``Traders are  
more confident that OPEC will follow up on production cuts that 
they announced last month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline gains were dampened by confirmation of new refinery  
openings by Exxon in Louisiana and Tosco in New Jersey, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	But both gasoline and heating oil futures were buoyed by the  
crude oil rally, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude oil for May delivery was 46 cents higher to  
$17.33 a barrel, its highest level since March of last year. 
Heating oil rose .54 cents to 43.32 cents a gallon, and May 
unleaded gasoline climbed 1.91 cents to 52.82 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices tumbled on the Chicago Board of Trade over concerns  
that recent rains could help the crop, despite freezing 
temperatures overnight in the southern Great Plains, grains analyst 
Dale Gustafson of Smith Barney Inc. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices were depressed over reports that next week's weather  
forecast will be drier and warmer, allowing for planting, trader 
Ron Kucha of O'Connor &AMP; Co. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices also declined, following the lead of wheat and  
corn, Kucha said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was down 6 cents to $2.56 1/2 a bushel; May  
corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.18 a bushel; May oats rose 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.21 a bushel; and May soybeans were down 2 3/4 cents to $4.86 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock and pork futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Vaught, an analyst in St. Louis with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons,  
said the fast food industries interest in bacon has sparked prices 
on pork bellies. 
</P>
<P>
	A belief that the cash market will remain firm supported cattle  
and live hog futures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle for delivery in June were up .18 cent to 65.35 cents  
a pound; May feeder cattle rose .20 cent to 71.60 cents a pound; 
June lean hogs went 1.70 cents higher to 54.67 cents a pound; and 
May pork bellies rose 2.98 cents to 55.60 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Precious metal prices were higher metals on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst William O'Neill with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York  
said gold and silver futures were helped by the crude oil rally. 
But he warned that negative pressures remain on gold prices, 
including Sunday's vote in Switzerland on removing the gold 
standard from the Swiss franc. 
</P>
<P>
	The May contract for Gold was .40 cent higher to $284.80 a troy  
ounce, while May silver was up 3 cents to $5.04 a troy ounce.

<HEADLINE>  3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sergei Babarin had run-ins with neighbors  
and packed a pistol during a fight at a department store four years 
ago. But police don't know why the 71-year-old Russian immigrant 
chose the Mormon Family History Library for a deadly rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	A church security officer and a library patron were killed  
before Babarin was shot by police Thursday, dying later in an 
ambulance. Four other people were wounded as Babarin calmly and 
methodically roamed through the building, even stopping once to 
reload. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything. He just came in and started shooting  
people,'' said Margaret Kane, who huddled under a desk in the 
first-floor research area. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just looked intent on what he was doing. He came to do what  
he was doing,'' she said. ``He didn't call out, no names or 
anything. He just kept his hand held out pointing at people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Deedee Corradini said later that Babarin was  
schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin's wife told investigators he had not been taking his  
medication for schizophrenia and each day would walk a dozen or so 
blocks from their home to the State Capitol and to Temple Square, 
police Chief Ruben Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega said Babarin was arrested after a 1995 fight at a  
department store in downtown Salt Lake City. He had been carrying a 
.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol and was charged with assault and 
carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Mark Zelig said Babarin had a reputation for  
harassing people in his apartment building or who passed his 
window. Last May, a bicyclist told police that Babarin stuck an 
umbrella in the bicycle spokes as he rode by and accused him of 
being a spy. No charges were brought. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, the largest center for genealogical research in the  
world, is across the street from the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints' Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle. It has more 
than 2 million rolls of microfilm copies of census and other 
records from more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Rawley had just settled in at a computer terminal on the  
second floor when she heard the shots. She remembers others 
yelling, ``Get down! He's got a gun!'' as the man in a long coat 
and baggy pants and a cap pulled low over his eyes began firing at 
anyone he saw with a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the lobby and shot a lady in the head and two or  
three other men,'' said Lyman Platt, a genealogist. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were fired as much as 45 minutes after officers arrived,  
at first leading police to believe there might be a second gunman. 
The gunman barricaded himself in an office at one point and 
exchanged fire with police. 
</P>
<P>
	The slain were identified as security guard Donald Thomas, 62,  
and Patricia Frengs, 55, of Pleasant Hill, Calif. Of the wounded, a 
71-year-old woman shot in the face was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	An international genealogical convention had attracted heavy  
traffic to the library, which has two floors below ground level and 
three above. Some 250 people -- patrons and employees -- are in the 
building on a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
	The church has been involved in genealogy since its founding  
nearly 170 years ago. The church amasses the records for what it 
calls the baptism of the dead. Mormons believe that such baptisms 
give the dead the opportunity to join the Mormon church in the 
afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The church said the library would not reopen until Monday.

<HEADLINE>  3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sergei Babarin had run-ins with neighbors  
and packed a pistol during a fight at a department store four years 
ago. But police don't know why the 71-year-old Russian immigrant 
chose the Mormon Family History Library for a deadly rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	A church security officer and a library patron were killed  
before Babarin was shot by police Thursday, dying later in an 
ambulance. Four other people were wounded as Babarin calmly and 
methodically roamed through the building, even stopping once to 
reload. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything. He just came in and started shooting  
people,'' said Margaret Kane, who huddled under a desk in the 
first-floor research area. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just looked intent on what he was doing. He came to do what  
he was doing,'' she said. ``He didn't call out, no names or 
anything. He just kept his hand held out pointing at people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Deedee Corradini said later that Babarin was  
schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin's wife told investigators he had not been taking his  
medication for schizophrenia and each day would walk a dozen or so 
blocks from their home to the State Capitol and to Temple Square, 
police Chief Ruben Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega said Babarin was arrested after a 1995 fight at a  
department store in downtown Salt Lake City. He had been carrying a 
.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol and was charged with assault and 
carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Mark Zelig said Babarin had a reputation for  
harassing people in his apartment building or who passed his 
window. Last May, a bicyclist told police that Babarin stuck an 
umbrella in the bicycle spokes as he rode by and accused him of 
being a spy. No charges were brought. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, the largest center for genealogical research in the  
world, is across the street from the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints' Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle. It has more 
than 2 million rolls of microfilm copies of census and other 
records from more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Rawley had just settled in at a computer terminal on the  
second floor when she heard the shots. She remembers others 
yelling, ``Get down! He's got a gun!'' as the man in a long coat 
and baggy pants and a cap pulled low over his eyes began firing at 
anyone he saw with a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the lobby and shot a lady in the head and two or  
three other men,'' said Lyman Platt, a genealogist. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were fired as much as 45 minutes after officers arrived,  
at first leading police to believe there might be a second gunman. 
The gunman barricaded himself in an office at one point and 
exchanged fire with police. 
</P>
<P>
	The slain were identified as security guard Donald Thomas, 62,  
and Patricia Frengs, 55, of Pleasant Hill, Calif. Of the wounded, a 
71-year-old woman shot in the face was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	An international genealogical convention had attracted heavy  
traffic to the library, which has two floors below ground level and 
three above. Some 250 people -- patrons and employees -- are in the 
building on a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
	The church has been involved in genealogy since its founding  
nearly 170 years ago. The church amasses the records for what it 
calls the baptism of the dead. Mormons believe that such baptisms 
give the dead the opportunity to join the Mormon church in the 
afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The church said the library would not reopen until Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Tens of Thousands Fleeing Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) ---- The residents of entire villages from  
previously spared areas of Kosovo straggled into Macedonia on 
Friday, the leading edge of an estimated 100,000 refugees who are 
being herded out of the country by Yugoslav troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving by the thousands in convoys of tractors and cars,  
refugees reported Serb forces had emptied and burned southeastern 
towns that had earlier escaped ruin. Serb forces also moved border 
control posts from three to six miles away from the Albanian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern suggested the Serbs were clearing strategic swaths  
along the Macedonian border to defend the province in the event of 
a ground attack by NATO troops. 
</P>
<P>
	All 3,000 residents of Perlebnic, an ethnic Albanian village in  
southern Kosovo, were escorted out of town by Serb forces Tuesday, 
villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hadn't gone five kilometers when we saw the village  
burning,'' said Ramadan Syleymani, who collapsed with his neighbors 
in the Brazda refugee camp, Macedonia's largest. Two more hamlets 
were on the road behind theirs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the Albanian villages we've been through, we didn't see a  
single living soul,'' he said. ``I think they're going to clear it 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it believed 100,000  
refugees were on the move toward Macedonia; 15,000 have arrived 
over the last two days. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb purge of western Kosovo was pressing ahead at a similar  
pace: Refugees were crossing the Morini border post into Albania at 
a rate of 1,000 an hour Friday. Conservative estimates topped 6,000 
by evening, with reports of refugee columns stretching back nine 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The crush threatened to overwhelm the meager resources of  
Macedonia and Albania, two of the poorest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania sent army trucks north to ferry refugees away from the  
crowded border camp at Kukes. At the crossing, refugees were handed 
cups of warm milk and beans to strengthen them after days on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the latest refugees arriving in Macedonia came from the  
region around Gnjilane (Guh-KNEE-la-nay), one of Kosovo's largest 
towns, with a prewar population of 70,000. Kosovo Albanians said 
Serbs had forced out 10 percent of the city's ethnic Albanians in 
the last week, ordering the rest to reopen shops, which had been 
shuttered for days while residents cowered at home. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR estimated 50,000 were on the road from Gnjilane and  
another 20,000 from nearby Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Doguna, 20 miles from Gnjilane, Serbs simply  
opened fire to clear the village, killing one man, villagers said. 
Turned back by Serb authorities at the border, the villagers said 
they spent days in the mountains before trying again, this time 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, which already has taken in 120,000 refugees, is  
reluctant to accept any more ethnic Albanians, fearing its own 
fragile ethnic balance could collapse into violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Nikola Kljusev said there was no room for any  
more refugees and demanded that foreign countries step up their 
refugee airlifts out of Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia previously closed its borders against earlier mass  
expulsions, but the UNHCR said officials have pledged to keep 
accepting newcomers. However, Friday's arrivals said they had 
waited at the border for up to two days before Macedonia let them 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia agreed Friday to allow aid workers to expand the main  
refugee center at Brazda. The tent city currently holds between 
20,000-25,000 refugees on an abandoned airstrip outside of the 
Macedonian capital of Skopje, the UNHCR said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's arrivals slept in the open, on the ground. Exhausted,  
men, women, old people and children collapsed on top of their 
belongings, sprawled in sleep under a burning sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to have made it,'' said Salih Ismaili, even as he  
showed what he said were welts from a beating by Macedonian police 
on the border. ``So far, so good.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry in Seclusion, Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- With the New York Yankees still trying to  
sort out the facts, Darryl Strawberry was in seclusion Friday, two 
days after he was charged with cocaine possession and soliciting a 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who will represent the eight-time All-Star,  
charged with possession of 0.3 grams of cocaine and offering an 
undercover female officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Strawberry's release on $6,000 bond, his agent Eric  
Grossman referred callers to Tampa lawyer Mike Tonelli. There also 
is a chance Strawberry will be represented by Joseph Ficarotta, 
Dwight Gooden's lawyer during a 1997 dispute with a Texas taxi 
driver that was settled for $130,000. 
</P>
<P>
	No court date was scheduled for the latest charges, the  
prosecutor's office said. Neither Tonelli nor Ficarotta returned 
repeated telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I feel bad? Sure. Is it sad? Yes. But there are certain  
things you can't control,'' Yankees interim manager Don Zimmer said 
before Friday night's game at Detroit. ```We all feel bad -- Mr. 
(George) Steinbrenner, everybody, but the game goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Strawberry's history of substance abuse, he is  
subject to random drug testing twice a week by major league 
baseball. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Thursday the 
team had not been informed of any positive tests, but was cautioned 
by baseball's central office not to publicly discuss test results. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if results from his test Tuesday had come in,  
but any positive result likely would trigger discipline from either 
commissioner Bud Selig or the National Association of Professional 
Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minors. Strawberry 
currently has a minor league contract and is not on the Yankees' 
40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	If Strawberry is convicted of cocaine possession, or pleads  
guilty, the Yankees attempt to void his contract and refuse to pay 
the remainder of his $2.5 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner continues to await the outcome of the  
court situation,'' spokesman Howard Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, suspended for 60 days after he tested positive for  
cocaine in 1995, waived his right to a lawyer when he spoke with an 
officer after his arrest and asked whether there was anything that 
could help his case, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocaine possession is a third-degree felony with a maximum  
penalty of five years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Pam Bondi 
said. The maximum penalty for solicitation, a misdemeanor, is 60 
days in jail for a first offense. Otherwise, offenders could face a 
year in jail, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's tax conviction may jeopardize his eligibility for a  
pretrial program that would require intensive drug treatment and 
result in charges being dropped, the St. Petersburg Times reported 
Friday. In 1995, Strawberry also was ordered to repay $350,000 in 
back taxes and sentenced to six months of home confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the cocaine found wrapped in a $20 bill inside  
his wallet did not belong to him. And while he acknowledged 
discussing sex with the undercover officer, he insisted he was 
joking around and didn't intend to meet her at a nearby motel.

<HEADLINE> Cadbury Acquires Hawaiian Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Cadbury Schweppes PLC has agreed to buy Hawaiian  
Punch, America's leading brand of fruit punch, from household goods 
maker Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. for $203 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday will give Cadbury Schweppes an even  
bigger share of the American soft drinks market, where it already 
dominates the non-cola carbonated drinks business with its Dr 
Pepper, 7Up and Canada Dry brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition came as little surprise to analysts, given  
Cadbury's stated goal of focusing on candy and American soft drinks 
after it completes a planned $1.85 billion sale of its non-U.S. 
beverage brands to Coca-Cola Co. later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hawaiian Punch, Cadbury should make inroads with younger  
American customers while avoiding head-to-head competition in the 
U.S. market with the cola giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc., said 
David Lang of the brokerage Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense to add to what's already a very successful  
presence,'' Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
deal shows that Cadbury is moving in the right direction by 
acquiring a niche product with greater potential for growth than 
exists in the highly competitive carbonated drinks market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaiian Punch, which had annual sales last year of $133  
million, will be integrated into Cadbury's Dr Pepper/7Up division. 
Around 70 percent of the volume will be distributed through the Dr 
Pepper/7Up franchised bottler networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining 30 percent will be distributed by Cadbury's Mott's  
Inc. fruit juice business and sold alongside Mott's apple juice and 
Rose's Lime Juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble is a leading household goods maker whose brands  
include Tide detergent, Folgers coffee and Pampers diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadbury, which expects to complete the deal by May 30, said the  
purchase will not affect its earnings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a value-enhancing addition to the portfolios of our U.S.  
beverages operations and furthers our strategy of building strong 
brands and businesses,'' said Cadbury chief executive John 
Sunderland. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadbury is the world's No. 3 soft-drink vendor, with about 15  
percent of the U.S. market, behind Coke's 44 percent and Pepsi's 31 
percent. Its other soft drink brands include A&AMP;W Root Beer, 
Sunkist, Schweppes, Squirt and Crush.

<HEADLINE> Hello, I'm Johnny Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Performers often say that an audience's applause  
is an elixir. The look on Johnny Cash's face told you this is true. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of TNT's tribute concert for the veteran singer at  
New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, the crowd stood and cheered Cash's 
performance of ``Folsom Prison Blues.'' It wasn't clear beforehand 
whether Cash, hobbled by a nerve disorder, would sing publicly for 
the first time in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	As the cheers washed over him, Cash stood with his eyes closed,  
as if soaking in the warm rays of the sun. He's heard cheers 
thousands of times but this was clearly special. It seemed he 
wanted to bottle them for painful days when he's far from a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of many memorable moments on ``An All-Star Tribute to  
Johnny Cash,'' which was taped earlier this month and first airs on 
TNT Sunday at 8 p.m. ET/PT. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really inspired him,'' Cash's singer-songwriter daughter,  
Rosanne, said after the concert. ``He said he felt like his feet 
never touched the ground. The crowd kind of lifted him up, the 
energy was so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TNT has hit upon a fine idea in the crowded world of music  
television, gathering artists to pay tribute to some of the 
industry's veterans. The series began with Burt Bacharach last 
year, and is due to continue with the late Bob Marley next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow,  
Dave Matthews and Trisha Yearwood were some of the artists who 
agreed to give musical tributes to Cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his stark version of ``Give My Love to Rose,''  
Springsteen said he admired Cash for the way he blended the social 
consciousness of folk music, the humor and tragedy of country and 
the rebellion of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan recalled the words of support he received when he  
unexpectedly veered into country three decades ago and dueted with 
Cash on his ``Nashville Skyline'' album. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank you for standing up for me way back when,''  
Dylan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute was instructive as well as respectful. Segments  
explained Cash's gospel roots, how he tried to stick up for 
society's downtrodden and how he rejuvenated his career in the 
1990s with the help of a former rap producer. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the big names, two of the most memorable performances  
were wholly unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, June Carter Cash, strummed an autoharp and sang ``Ring  
of Fire,'' the song she wrote with Merle Kilgore when she was 
falling in love with Johnny. It's one of those signature songs that 
has lost meaning with repetition. She emphasized the words and 
brought forth the foreboding that went along with the exhilaration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was kind of scary at that time,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wyclef Jean of the Fugees donned on oversized black cowboy hat  
and strummed an acoustic guitar. He sang Cash's frightening song 
from the early 1990s, ``Delia's Gone,'' about a man pacing in his 
prison cell, tormented by the memory of the wife he killed. Jean 
even added a rap interlude. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it wasn't much of a fashion stretch in Manhattan, all of  
the performers paid a sartorial tribute to ``the man in black'' by 
wearing black. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosanne Cash wanted to sing ``I Still Miss Someone,'' but throat  
problems limited her to a short speaking role. Instead, Willie 
Nelson and Emmylou Harris both wanted to sing the song. The honor 
fell to Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert taping brought together all seven of Cash's children  
for the first time in a decade, which Rosanne said made for a 
``weepy'' backstage scene. 
</P>
<P>
	As young artists in the 1980s, Ms. Cash and her sister, Carlene  
Carter, found it difficult to be Johnny's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like any young person in their 20s,'' Ms. Cash said.  
``You want to get as far away from your parents as you can to 
differentiate yourself. It was particularly hard with my dad 
because he was so public and we were in the same field. I did feel 
very rebellious and even competitive when I was younger. I had 
quite a bit of an attitude for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time softened the edges. ``You start maturing, you start seeing  
your parents as people instead of your parents,'' she said. ``You 
get a little experience under your belt and you realize you're not 
immortal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She most appreciates her father's honesty and originality as an  
artist. ``You can't say Johnny Cash is like somebody,'' she said. 
``He's not like anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps hopefully, Willie Nelson campaigned on stage for a  
reunion of the Highwaymen, the band of country outlaws he performed 
in with Cash. Nelson said the Highwaymen had the bus idling to hit 
the road again whenever Cash was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cash isn't sure her dad has the stamina at 67 to go back on  
tour. He has Shy-Drager Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that 
causes progressive damage to the nervous system. While his voice 
was strong and true, some of his onstage moves were halting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't feel great,'' Ms. Cash said, ``but he has kind of  
an indomitable spirit that overrides how he feels in the moment a 
lot of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her father has one clear point he wants to make about the  
future: ``He doesn't see this as an ending or goodbye,'' she said. 
``He wants to see this as the beginning of something else.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mets Recall Catcher Vance Wilson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets catcher Vance Wilson hopes his  
second stint in the major leagues lasts a bit longer than his 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who spent seven innings with the Mets last July before  
being sent back to Triple-A Norfolk, was recalled to the majors 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll beat my seven-inning record,'' Wilson said before  
the Mets' game against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have deprived Wilson of a couple of other chances to  
spend time in the majors. He broke his arm last May in a home-plate 
collision one week before Mets backup catcher Tim Spehr went on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed a chance for a September callup when he had surgery on  
the arm. And when Mike Piazza sprained a ligament in his right knee 
last Friday night, Wilson re-injured his arm the same day -- a 
warmup pitch hit the plate in his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a slider that got away and I didn't try to block it  
because it was warmups and it hit me right on the arm,'' he said. 
``There was no way I was coming out, so I continued to catch. After 
about 10 pitches they saw I couldn't catch and took me out. The 
pain was worse than when I broke it. I was sure it was broken 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news was that X-rays showed only a bruise. The bad news  
was that it delayed his recall to the majors. Two days later, his 
wife broke the news that Piazza was going on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who hit .263 with 35 homers and 161 RBIs in five minor  
league seasons, was unable to join the Mets until he proved his arm 
was healthy. He did that Thursday night by catching nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in an organization with Piazza as its starting catcher  
doesn't leave much opportunity for backups. But Wilson said he was 
all in favor of the team's decision to re-sign Piazza for $91 
million in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about what I can't control,'' Wilson said. ``All  
I can do is play my best and hope an opportunity comes up either 
here or with another team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Piazza on the disabled list, Mets manager Bobby Valentine  
was forced to keep Mike Kinkade on the bench as an emergency 
catcher. The addition of Wilson gives Valentine the flexibility to 
use Kinkade as pinch-hitter or as a spot starter at third or first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vance gives us a lot of extra maneuverability,'' Valentine  
said. ``We can give Kinkade a start or two if we want so he can 
refine his skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets optioned outfielder Terrence Long to Norfolk to make  
room for Wilson.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Lab Says Needles Were Reused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- At least 3,600 people who had blood  
work performed at a lab are being warned to get tested for HIV and 
hepatitis B and C after a technician admitted reusing needles since 
June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Any patients sent to the SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratory  
since the technician began working there could be at risk, state 
health officials said Friday. Letters warning of the risks are 
being mailed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the risk of anyone being infected is extremely  
low,'' said Dr. Jon Rosenberg, the state epidemiologist directing 
the investigation. Still, ``we believe these people have the right 
to be notified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technician, a woman in her 50s who has since been fired,  
typically worked alone. She told investigators that she washed the 
needles with water and diluted hydrogen peroxide, then put them in 
clean needle containers before drawing blood from patients with 
difficult-to-pierce veins. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how often she did this, or why, although  
investigators who interviewed her said she apparently didn't do it 
maliciously. Her name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing she said that suggests she was deliberately  
putting patients at risk even though at some point she realized 
that it was wrong,'' Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline only learned what she was doing after a co-worker  
discovered the needles being washed in a sink and ``was 
nauseated,'' said Dr. Ed Kaufman, national medical director for 
SmithKline Beecham labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we are both shocked and baffled by this practice. It's  
a breach of medical care,'' Kaufman said at a news conference with 
Rosenberg. ``She can't explain why she did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said the risk of anyone being infected is low because  
drawing blood is less likely to transmit viruses than injections, 
because she claimed she only reused needles occasionally and 
because the hydrogen peroxide would kill some viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, doctors at Stanford University Hospital, which is  
adjacent from the lab, were alarmed. The lab is not affiliated with 
the hospital 
</P>
<P>
	``It breaks a lot of rules we teach our staff here not to do,''  
said Jim Schweikhard, director of environmental health and safety 
at the hospital. ``It really puts patients at risk for various 
diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerri Paley, who had blood drawn at the lab in November, had her  
blood tested Friday for HIV and hepatitis B and C. ``I'm upset,'' 
she said. ``I just want to find out what the results are,'' Ms. 
Paley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The technician, who was trained as a phlebotomist in 1994 and  
certified to draw blood by SmithKline after a company training 
program, also worked at several other laboratories in the San 
Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and county health departments ``are intensively  
investigating every one of those places'' although they have no 
evidence she reused needles elsewhere, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it learned of the problem on March 22, SmithKline has  
reviewed training procedures at its 800 blood test sites across the 
country, and is satisfied that its training procedures are 
adequate, Kaufman said.

<HEADLINE> IMF-World Bank Relief Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An International Monetary Fund-World Bank debt  
relief initiative for poor countries may not reduce amounts these 
nations already pay to keep up their accounts, the two 
organizations said in an internal document. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the borrowing countries, international  
organizations, churches and charities are disappointed with the 
depth of debt relief as well as its slowness in coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``This point is often summarized as 'too little, too late,'''  
said the report, which was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was discussed by the World Bank's executive directors  
Thursday and the IMF's executive board Friday, an IMF official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Further discussions on the debt initiative are expected at this  
month's spring meetings of the World Bank-IMF and in June at the 
G-7 summit in Cologne, Germany. Five of the wealthy nations have 
proposed changes in the program, including selling some of the IMF 
gold reserves to make more money available to reduce poor 
countries' debt burdens. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., vice chairman of the Congress' Joint  
Economic Committee, said proposed IMF gold sales would ``face tough 
congressional scrutiny in the coming months and an increasingly 
uncertain future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Friday that Congress must approve any commitment by the  
Clinton administration to sell the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty countries, mostly in Africa, were judged poor and indebted  
enough to qualify for the debt initiative -- called HIPC for highly 
indebted poor countries -- which the World Bank and IMF announced 
with great fanfare in September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 40, 12 have had their cases reviewed and seven -- Bolivia,  
Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guyana, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda -- 
have been promised $6 billion in aid. So far only Uganda and 
Bolivia have had debt forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing how the program is working, the IMF-World Bank  
report said the seven countries' ``estimated scheduled debt service 
payments after receiving HIPC assistance are not significantly 
different from the actual debt service payments'' they had been 
making. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the report says, if the countries implement economic  
reforms the program requires, then they will have more resources to 
devote to debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the debtor countries consider the program slow  
and inadequate, while U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the 
program is disappointing and not sufficiently flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and other creditor countries in the G-7  
consider the initiative has broken new ground, the report said, and 
they want to strengthen the ``the links between debt reduction and 
poverty alleviation.'' This means demonstrating that money saved 
from debt-service payments be used for programs such as building 
schools or medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	On financing, the report said, all the countries mention gold  
sales by the IMF, while four explicitly record their support for 
such sales.

<HEADLINE> One Dead As Storms Slam Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEMBROKE, N.C. (AP) -- Storms that unleashed tornadoes and fierce  
winds in the Southeast killed at least one person and left hundreds 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	A North Carolina man died Thursday evening when winds toppled  
his trailer home in Pembroke in the southeastern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trapped underneath the mobile home,'' said sheriff's  
Maj. Jimmy Maynor. ``He had to be dug out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 other people in North Carolina were injured in the  
thunderstorms, and two dozen more were hurt where tornadoes struck 
in two counties in central Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a miracle no one was killed,'' Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes  
said Thursday after touring Dooly County. ``It's bad but it 
could've been much, much worse and I think that is the message that 
we take out from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 25 homes were destroyed and another 40 were damaged.  
Barnes declared a state of emergency in Dooly and Candler counties. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 people in Vienna, Ga., 50 miles south of Macon, were  
left homeless and took shelter at two high school gyms. The storms 
ripped roofs off businesses and homes, and knocked down trees and 
power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Hooks, 42, operated a beauty shop from her trailer home,  
where she and four customers weathered the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `My Jesus, what is this and then I heard the woooo,'''  
she said. ``I said, `Oh Lord, a tornado!''' 
</P>
<P>
	A few blocks away, Vincent Gaston watched the winds carry away  
his 15-month-old Rottweiler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I peeked out the window and saw the dog floating in the air,  
going around the tree,'' said Gaston, 27. Neither he nor his dog 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, at least eight mobile homes were destroyed  
and many more damaged. A wind gust of 165 mph was reported, and a 
Norfolk Southern freight train was knocked off the tracks near 
Bridgeton. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a bunch of rumbling coming through,'' Johnny  
Hunt said of storms in Robeson County. ``I just did a Hail Mary and 
got on the floor. That's all I could do.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal Foreman Discusses Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONWAY, Ark. (AP) -- The jury foreman in the Susan McDougal trial  
says he was put off by the ``arrogance'' of Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors and felt the testimony of Starr's deputy was evasive. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Thomas also said in an interview that as jurors in the  
monthlong trial deliberated over Mrs. McDougal's defense that she 
was mistreated by prosecutors, there was ``yelling and screaming 
and one lady even looked like she was coming to tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors acquitted President Clinton's former Whitewater  
business partner on the charge of obstruction of justice and 
deadlocked on two counts of criminal contempt for her refusal to 
testify before two grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal evoked some sympathy by crying and enduring five  
days of questions on the witness stand, Thomas said. But emotions 
toward Mrs. McDougal or Starr's office played no role in deciding 
the charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said they want to interview the jurors before  
deciding whether to seek a retrial on the two criminal contempt 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said testimony from other witnesses -- especially Julie  
Hiatt Steele, who like Mrs. McDougal was charged with obstructing 
Starr's probe -- convinced some jurors that Mrs. McDougal's fears 
about testifying to a grand jury were justified. Mrs. McDougal said 
she thought she'd be charged with perjury unless she falsely 
implicated the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fear by itself, I don't think is innocent, but after listening  
to some testimony from other witnesses, that once again kind of 
backed up what she was fearing,'' said Thomas, a supervisor at a 
chair and table manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much did I think Kenneth Starr was trying to get  
Mrs. McDougal to lie, it's just that some witnesses backed up Mrs. 
McDougal's story'' that Starr's office ``was trying to get her to 
say something that was not true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the performances in court, the foreman said  
representatives of Independent Counsel Starr displayed ``a certain 
amount of arrogance,'' saying prosecutors ``showed more anger or 
displeasure from things that went on than the defense did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said prosecutor Hickman Ewing's testimony struck him as  
``evasive'' because his answers ``were like a paragraph long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of hard to pick out where the answer to the  
question really lied,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing testified that he drafted and circulated inside the office  
a proposed indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton and that he told 
colleagues he would have graded her at ``about an `F''' for her 
July 1996 Whitewater testimony because she said ```I don't recall' 
about 50 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas also said prosecutor Ray Jahn's testimony about  
``developing a witness'' gave the impression Starr's office used 
heavy-handed tactics to lead people into saying things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought you developed an antidote or vaccine, or something  
like that,'' Thomas said. ``I didn't know that you had to develop a 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But juror Angela Smith, who wanted to convict on all counts,  
said she saw no evidence Starr's team acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't see a lot that would indicate to me that he was  
trying to get her to lie,'' Smith said earlier this week. ``Every 
piece of paper they showed said they were seeking truthful 
testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A juror who wanted to acquit on all counts, Becky Boeckmann,  
said Friday she doubted Mrs. McDougal knows anything of value. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the prosecutors, Ms. Boeckmann said, ``I don't know if harass  
is a good word. I think they wanted information from her, but I 
don't think she had the information to give to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the obstruction charge on which Mrs. McDougal was  
acquitted initially was 11-1, but changed to 12-0 after a 
half-hour, the foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	On one of the criminal contempt charges, jurors first voted 8-4  
to acquit Mrs. McDougal for refusing to testify in 1996. A later 
vote was 7-5 to acquit, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second count, for refusing to testify in 1998, jurors  
voted 6-5 to acquit, with one person uncertain, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge told the jury that contempt had to be committed  
``willfully,'' which was defined as ``voluntarily and 
intentionally, and not by accident, mistake or other innocent 
reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and others focused on ``innocent reason,'' deciding that  
Mrs. McDougal's fear of testifying was genuine, strong and 
supported by others who had encountered Starr's investigators.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Bench Ripken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Cal Ripken, in a hitting and fielding slump,  
didn't start for the Baltimore Orioles in their game against the 
Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who missed two games earlier this season because of a  
bad back, has five errors -- three short of his 1998 total -- and had 
two on one play in New York on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Ironman played into 2,632 consecutive games to break  
Lou Gehrig's record and ended his streak on the night of 
Baltimore's final home game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is hitting just .174 (4-for-23) this year with two doubles  
and one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't feel that bad,'' Ripken said Thursday night.  
``I wish I could claim a physical problem but there's not one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, a two-time Gold Glove who hold or shares 12 fielding  
records, missed a week of spring training last month following the 
death of his father, Cal Ripken Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge mentally right now,'' Ripken said. ``Maybe  
I'm pushing it a little too much right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has been taking extra hitting and fielding and intends to  
take more. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some respects, I feel a little rusty,'' he said. ``The good  
news is physically I feel very good.''

<HEADLINE> Farewell Opener for County Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Warren Spahn made his longest walk to the mound  
Friday, throwing out the first pitch in the last home opener at 
Milwaukee County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Hall of Famer strolled to the mound, stood there  
and surveyed the scene for several seconds. Then he went into that 
famous windup, swinging both arms, rearing back and ... tossing a 
three-hopper to Bobby Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter, he was cheered as if it were the old days.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a warm place in my heart for County Stadium,''  
said Spahn, who pitched 10 innings for the victory as the Milwaukee 
Braves beat the Cincinnati Reds in the first game in the park on 
April 14, 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers are expecting 2 million fans this year and they've  
sold a record 10,000 season tickets. The following year they go to 
Miller Park, which will have a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place really looks old. There's exposed beams and  
concrete ceilings, but it's comfortable,'' said Gorman Thomas, a 
Brewers slugger of the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like putting on an old pair of shoes,'' Thomas said.  
``The new place looks fantastic, but this place is home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pregame ceremonies included huge banners with the logos of the  
Braves, who played in the park from 1953-65, the Brewers and the 
Packers, who used to split their home games between Lambeau Field 
and Milwaukee until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Wendy Selig-Prieb said her favorite memories  
include Paul Molitor's 39-game hitting streak, Robin Yount's 
3,000th hit and the 1987 team that started 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I would add this,'' Selig-Prieb said. ``I hope that some  
of those favorite memories are yet to come.''

	LONDON (AP) -- World record holder Ronaldo Da Costa of Brazil  
faces tough opposition from Olympic champion Josia Thugwane of 
South Africa and world champion Abel Anton of Spain in the London 
Marathon on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-time winner of the race, Antonio Pinto of Portugal, also  
is in the field and says it's like a mini-Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best in the world. When you win here you can probably  
call yourself the best in the world,'' Pinto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in Olympic runner-up and Asian Games champion Lee Bong-ju  
of South Korea and last year's second place finisher Abdelkader El 
Mouaziz of Morocco and the men's field looks awesome. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's field, hit by withdrawals, isn't so hot.  
</P>
<P>
	Ireland's Catherina McKiernan isn't defending her title because  
she's pregnant. So is 1996 champion Liz McColgan. Fernanda Ribeiro, 
Portugal's Olympic 10,000 meter gold medalist who was planning to 
run her first marathon, has pulled out with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of these top stars has left Kenya's 1997 winner  
Joyce Chepchumba the odds-on favorite over European champion 
Manuela Machado of Spain and 1992 Olympic 10,000 meter runner-up 
Elana Meyer of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa, who did a cartwheel after setting his world mark in  
Berlin last year, is planning another spectacular celebration if he 
wins here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always something different if I win,'' the 28-year-old

<HEADLINE> Radioactivity Unrelated to Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An independent report released by the Pentagon  
indicates that exposure to a radioactive material used in the Gulf 
War is unlikely to have caused the health complaints from veterans 
whose illnesses remain unexplained eight years after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rand Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif., think tank, reviewed  
scientific literature and found no evidence of harmful health 
effects directly linked to exposure to depleted uranium, which 
coats U.S. artillery shells and bombs designed to penetrate tank 
armor. On impact, the shells create an airborne dust. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 Gulf War veterans have complained  
of chronic maladies such as fatigue, joint pain and memory loss, 
but no official cause has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Rostker, a defense official in charge of Gulf War  
Syndrome issues, said the Rand study supports a Pentagon conclusion 
that while depleted uranium ``can pose a chemical toxicity and 
radiological hazard under specific conditions, the available 
evidence does not support claims that DU caused or is causing the 
undiagnosed illness some Gulf War veterans are experiencing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998, a group of U.S. veterans said at least 400,000 of  
the 700,000 men and women who served in the war had come in contact 
with depleted uranium. Some claimed to suffer from unexplained 
illnesses or increased cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon believes that figure is exaggerated. Rostker  
estimated ``several hundred'' American soldiers were exposed, 
primarily through friendly fire incidents in which military 
vehicles accidentally came under U.S. attack or during cleanup and 
investigation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Baltimore  
are following 33 Gulf War veterans with the greatest exposure to 
depleted uranium, including 17 with embedded fragments from 
shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans have an array of health problems related to combat  
injuries, the researchers said. But researchers have not found 
signs of radiation illness or ``manifestations of kidney disease 
attributable to the chemical toxicity of depleted uranium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Rand literature review found, exposure to depleted  
uranium at levels similar to during the Gulf War has not caused 
increased cancer rates, kidney disease or other illnesses, mostly 
because the body is very effective at eliminating ingested and 
inhaled uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Pentagon released a case study concluding that  
Gulf War veterans likely were not exposed to chemical warfare 
agents at a cement factory outside Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pentagon could not rule out the presence of such agents,  
saying it lacked all the evidence for a definite ruling. For 
example, soil samples were not properly packed to guarantee against 
evaporation and a tape from a special military vehicle that can 
detect the agents is missing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case showed the need to handle evidence more carefully and  
to inform soldiers on the scene about whether they had been 
exposed. In this case, he said the Marines operating the vehicles 
``were told they didn't have a need to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very unfortunate,'' Rostker said. ``It's resulted in  
suspicions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has been fighting a climate of mistrust regarding  
Gulf War Syndrome since the end of the 1991 war. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials initially downplayed veterans' complaints and  
did not fully investigate the possibilities of exposure to chemical 
and biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report, a policy review by Rand found U.S. officials  
poorly handled a program to use experimental drugs on American 
troops to protect soldiers from biological and chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Gulf War veterans blame illnesses on the drugs, including  
pyridostigmine bromide and botulinum toxoid, which they were not 
told were still being investigated for human use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration had authorized an exception to  
an informed-consent requirement. The president now has sole waiver 
authority under a 1997 law Congress passed.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Frets About Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
expressed concern Friday that Americans are losing faith in the 
benefits of free trade. He warned that efforts to erect 
protectionist barriers were ``unwise and surely self-defeating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan called the expansion of international trade one of the  
most impressive developments of the last half-century and one that 
has greatly benefited the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is overwhelmingly persuasive that the massive  
increase in world competition -- a consequence of broadening trade 
flows -- has fostered markedly higher standards of living for almost 
all countries who have participated,'' Greenspan said in a speech 
to foreign ambassadors at a conference in Dallas, Texas. Copies of 
his remarks were made available in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	America's swelling trade deficit hit a record $169 billion last  
year and is expected to rise even higher this year as American 
manufacturers and farmers continue to suffer from a loss of export 
markets because of the global financial crisis that began in Asia 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Those soaring deficits have triggered calls for the Clinton  
administration and Congress to do more to protect domestic 
industries. American steel companies have filed a number of cases 
seeking higher tariffs to protect their industry from a flood of 
cheap foreign steel pouring into the United States because of 
slumping global demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan did not mention any particular industry, but he said  
he was concerned ``about the recent evident weakening of support 
for free trade in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting markets from new technologies has never  
succeeded,'' Greenspan said. ``Even should our trading partners not 
retaliate in the face of increased American trade barriers ... we 
do ourselves great harm by lessening the vigor of American 
competitiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said increased competition from a global marketplace  
has forced companies to develop better goods and services at lower 
costs, thus improving living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he strongly held to the traditional view that  
protectionism is the wrong approach to take because while it may 
protect some jobs in uncompetitive industries temporarily, it does 
so at high costs to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end it is clear that all economic progress rests on  
competition,'' Greenspan said. ``It would be a great tragedy were 
we to stop the wheels of progress because of an incapacity to 
assist the victims of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the better approach for government is to provide  
retraining programs for workers who lose their jobs in 
uncompetitive industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The protectionist propensity to thwart the process of the  
competitive flow of capital, from failing technologies to the more 
productive, is unwise and surely self-defeating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said that it is a widely accepted view among  
economists that increased competition from trade may alter the 
employment in particular industries but does not affect a country's 
overall employment level which depends on other factors such as the 
conduct of monetary policy to spur or slow overall economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has  
impacted the level of total employment in this country over the 
long run,'' Greenspan said. ``Indeed, we are currently experiencing 
the widest trade deficit in history with a level of unemployment 
close to record lows.''

<HEADLINE> Journal of Commerce Makes Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Holt retired Friday as editor of the  
Journal of Commerce, the nation's oldest business newspaper, and 
his replacement announced several major changes including shifting 
the publication's format from broadsheet to tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Managing Editor Peter Tirschwell, 37, will take over  
as editor from Holt, who served as the newspaper's editor the past 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the tabloid format is more appropriate to the  
specialized direction we're going in,'' Tirschwell said, announcing 
the changes that will take place in the 172-year-old newspaper 
beginning June 1. ``Once it was strictly a business newspaper while 
it is now a trade publication serving a different audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s, the Journal of  
Commerce was considered the shipping industry's bible since there 
was no other outlet for shippers to publish their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	It has suffered a steady decline in recent years with paid  
circulation falling 11 percent between September 1995 and September 
1998 to 18,290. Those figures are expected to dip even further to 
an estimated 17,500 through March, said the newspaper's marketing 
director, Steve Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Tirschwell, news space will shrink by 15 percent and there  
will be more analytical stories. He said it would become ``a more 
specialized trade publication focusing on the business of 
international trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking news and commodity price information will be shifted to  
the newspaper's Internet site at www.joc.com. Some portions of the 
Web site will be free but full access will cost the same as a 
year's subscription, $365. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsstand prices will remain unchanged at $2.  
</P>
<P>
	The paper also plans to add to its circulation base by giving  
away several thousand free subscriptions to consumers involved in 
air, ocean, shipping and other international trade related 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt, 63, plans to teach journalism and work on several book  
projects. ``I'm looking forward to being busy on my own schedule,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal of Commerce was founded in 1827 by Samuel F.B.  
Morse, the inventor of the telegraph. In 1848, the paper helped 
create The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper is owned by the Economist Group of London, a division  
of media conglomerate Pearson PLC, and is based in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield: Punch Stats Deceiving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield says Lennox Lewis landing a  
lot more punches than he did was deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
	A punch tally of the fight for the undisputed heavyweight title  
bout March 13 that ended in a controversial draw credited Lewis 
with landing 364 of 613 punches to 130 of 385 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	A rematch is expected Nov. 6 or 13 at site to be determined.  
</P>
<P>
	``In pro boxing, it's not how many punches you throw, it's  
effective punches, punches that hurt,'' Holyfield said at a hearing 
before the New York State Senate Committee on Investigations, 
chaired by State Sen. Roy Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield called many of the punches Lewis landed ``taps.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said in a taped interview with Goodman that the punch  
statistics were proof of his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the most aggressive fighter,'' Holyfield said. ``Once  
the fight got to the eighth round you could see I was doing all the 
work. All the judges started giving me all the rounds. I was trying 
to make a fight and here's a guy who don't want to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Eugenia Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., who scored it  
115-113 for Holyfield, gave Holyfield four of the last five rounds. 
Stanley Christodoulou (116-113 Lewis) of South Africa called the 
last five rounds 3-1-1 for Holyfield. Larry O'Connell (115-115) of 
England also thought Holyfield won four of the last five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, the scoring was very bad,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was highly criticized for scoring the fifth round for  
Holyfield, when it was that round in which Lewis seemed to have him 
in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is clueless in knowing what her job is and what she should  
be scoring,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the scoring of O'Connell, Lewis, of Britain, said: ``I  
was quite amazed. It definitely showed me he wasn't watching my 
jab. My jab was doing the most damage. I think he overcompensated 
not to show favoritism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Goodman said his committee had turned over to a  
Manhattan grand jury evidence of potential criminality in the 
judging of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams admitted before the committee March 18 that she had  
recently filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned whether judges with financial problems ``could not  
be subject to temptation. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman previously said testimony indicated O'Connell was behind  
in his mortgage payments. However, on Friday he said that report 
was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. O'Connell called us from England yesterday and assured us  
this was not the case,'' Goodman said. ``I want this on the 
record.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel To Subpoena Chung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung  
will be subpoenaed to testify before a House panel April 27-28 on 
Chinese connections to 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign contributions, 
Rep. Dan Burton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, said the Justice Department has given permission for the 
testimony. Chung has been cooperating with the department under a 
plea agreement in which he admitted making nearly $30,000 in 
illegal contributions to Democrats, including $20,000 to the 
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have dropped our objections'' to Chung's testimony,  
department spokesman Carole Florman said. Justice officials, who 
requested anonymity, said they were still negotiating with the 
committee over the scope of Chung's testimony, but they anticipated 
any restrictions on it would be minor and designed to avoid damage 
to ongoing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton had written Attorney General Janet Reno that ``the  
American people have a right to know the truth'' about any 
``Chinese government efforts to subvert our elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chung has told federal investigators that China's chief military  
intelligence officer sent him $300,000 to give to the Democratic 
Party to aid President Clinton's re-election effort, The Los 
Angeles Times has reported. China has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung apparently gave only $35,000 of the money to the  
Democratic National Committee and put the rest into a bank account 
in August 1996, the Times reported. It's not known how that money 
was used. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic  
National Committee have said they did not know of any connection 
between Chung's contributions and the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a businessman born in Taiwan who is now a U.S. citizen,  
donated some $400,000 to Democratic candidates and causes from 1994 
to 1996, but the money was returned after questions arose about its 
legality. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a frequent visitor to the White House, once  
escorting Chinese businessmen to watch Clinton deliver a radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, he was sentenced to five years probation and 3,000  
hours of community service as part of the plea bargain.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico AD Quits; Joins Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico State athletic director Jim  
Paul resigned Thursday to try his hand at politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, the Aggies' AD for two years, is leaving effective May 31  
to work as a fund-raising volunteer for Texas Gov. George Bush's 
presidential exploratory committee that has already raised more 
than $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing it for George and for our country,'' Paul said of  
his decision. ``I think our country needs a leader like him. I'm 
willing to devote the next 18 months of my life to that end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has not entered the Republican presidential race, but is  
expected to announce his formal candidacy this summer or fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Paul is a great friend of mine. I am honored that he feels  
so strongly about my exploratory committee that he is willing to 
leave his job and volunteer his time to this effort,'' Bush said in 
a statement. ``I am grateful for his friendship and support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul said he will stay at New Mexico State until a successor is  
hired. University president William Conroy said a search committee 
has already been formed. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul said he has known Bush since the Texas governor was an  
executive with the Texas Rangers and decided to join Bush's camp 
after the two talked briefly about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, former owner of the El Paso Diablos minor league baseball  
team, was hired as athletic director in August 1997. When he took 
over, the men's basketball program was on three years' probation 
for academic fraud, the school president and football coach had 
been fired and the athletic department had a deficit of between 
$600,000 and $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after being hired and two days before the start of  
practice for the 1997-98 season, Paul reassigned basketball coach 
Neil McCarthy, saying McCarthy had placed winning ahead of 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy had led the Aggies to five NCAA tournaments in the '90s  
and was the school's winningest coach, but Paul defended his 
decision by saying New Mexico State had created the perception that 
``we have people who cheat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, McCarthy was fired by the school. In January, the  
school agreed to pay McCarthy $835,000 to settle his 
breach-of-contract lawsuit against the university. 
</P>
<P>
	After firing McCarthy, Paul coaxed Lou Henson out of retirement.  
In two seasons under Henson, the Aggies won 41 games and this year 
went to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball program is now off probation, and the football  
team broke home attendance records last season, averaging more than 
20,300.

<HEADLINE> IRS Moves To Fire Whistleblower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just as the Internal Revenue Service was  
beginning to improve its image, managers in its Houston district 
office took action that could lead to the firing of an agent who 
blew the whistle on taxpayer abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the new and improved IRS that we heard so much  
about this week is up to its old tricks again,'' said Rep. Bill 
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
``I am appalled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials said Friday they will investigate the personnel  
action against Jennifer Long, the first active IRS agent to tell 
Congress about taxpayer abuse without concealing her identity 
during high-profile Senate Finance Committee hearings in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, a revenue agent in Houston for 16 years who previously  
received solid performance ratings, said she believes the move 
against her is to retaliate for her testimony. She acknowledges 
that she went public then in part because of grievances against her 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are enraged,'' Long said in a telephone interview Friday.  
``They feel like I've betrayed the code of silence by testifying 
before Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long said her superiors abruptly summoned her from an audit  
Thursday and handed her a 13-page memo describing her alleged poor 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very upsetting. It was done in a very threatening  
way,'' she said. ``It's clear that the conclusion has already been 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours after word began circulating in Washington about the  
action, Long said she was again confronted by her superiors and 
given a terse one-page notice that the earlier memo was ``withdrawn 
until further notice.'' But Long said her bosses told her verbally 
that it would likely be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just trying to fool somebody,'' she said of the second  
memo. ``This way they'll have the opportunity to tell everybody 
they rescinded it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said he was ``extremely  
disturbed that we may have taken an action that could be 
retaliatory'' and sent Deputy Commissioner Bob Wenzel to Houston to 
review the case. In addition, the Treasury Department's tax 
inspector general will investigate, Rossotti said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not tolerate retaliation against employees who come  
forward to testify before the Senate Finance Committee or who come 
forward to report allegations of wrongdoing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said he was  
outraged by the action against Long and will focus on the Houston 
district office in future hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his appointment almost two years ago, Rossotti has been  
winning wide praise for his efforts to make the IRS less secretive, 
more responsive to taxpayers and more efficient. Some skeptics 
wonder if the reforms will trickle down to field managers who 
resist change. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear example of how some in the IRS's old  
management culture are using their power to destroy people, like 
Jennifer, who are trying to make the IRS a better place,'' Roth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo to Long from IRS Houston district manager Karie L.  
Gulley says Long's performance was judged ``unacceptable'' in June 
1998, only a few months after she told Congress how agents are held 
to numeric enforcement quotas that she said often result in the 
violation of taxpayer rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Other IRS agents testified behind a dark cloak and with voices  
electronically modified. ``She was the turning point,'' said Roth 
aide Bill Nixon. ``She was the critical witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1993 through 1997, Long consistently got ``fully  
successful'' performance ratings, according to personnel records 
she provided. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo, however, says Long's work ``remains unacceptable'' and  
gives her 68 days to improve or face dismissal. It lists numerous 
specific examples of how she allegedly failed to prioritize her 
audits, didn't use her time wisely, made incomplete work plans and 
sometimes neglected to gather sufficient evidence.
