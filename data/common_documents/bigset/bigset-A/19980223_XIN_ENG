<P>
According to Mohammed Khalfan Kharbash, the minister, the

<HEADLINE> Annan Talks With Iraq on Verge of Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan felt that he is on the verge of a breakthrough to resolve
the crisis over weapons inspections in Iraq after his talks with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Sunday, said a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of those discussions he feels he is on the verge
of a breakthrough," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"Substantial progress was made," Eckhard said, "We feel that a
deal is within reach."
</P>
<P>
Annan "certainly hopes that he can reach agreement tonight or
tomorrow morning and that this will be to the benefit of all the
Iraqi people," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard made the announcement shortly after Annan had a
three-hour meeting with Saddam here.
</P>
<P>
He said Annan would hold further talks with Iraqi Deputy
Premier Tariq Aziz later Sunday, hoping to finalize a written
agreement on U.N. weapons inspections of Iraqi presidential sites
before leaving Baghdad early Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. spokesman cautioned that the deal is not
finished. "It's not done yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Friday evening to make a "last-ditch"
effort to avert possible U.S. military strikes on Iraq, held four
rounds of "difficult" talks with Aziz during the past one and a
half days.
</P>
<P>
The two sides made progress in their lengthy talks, but they
could not reach agreement on the time limit of inspections of
presidential sites by U.N. arms monitors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has offered to open its presidential sites to U.N. arms
inspectors for 60 days, saying the time would be enough for them
to go through every corner of the sites.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States has insisted that there be no time
limit to the inspections, and that U.N. arms inspectors be allowed
to re-inspect the sites whenever they feel it's necessary.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has amassed nearly 30,000 troops in
the Gulf region, said unfettered, unconditional and free access to
presidential sites must be granted to U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Before Annan started his trip to Baghdad, the United States
warned that it reserves the right to reject any compromise that
Annan might work out with Iraq, and to unilaterally launch
military strikes on Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
France has said that any deal reached by Annan in Baghdad
should be respected by all.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Annan has been in touch with some leaders and
representatives of the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council during his stay in Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Cook Says Sanctions Against Iraq Could be Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here today that sanctions against Iraq could soon be
lifted if the Iraqi government agreed to carry out U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC Radio interview early today, Cook said: "If
he (President Saddam Hussein) really is willing this time to
cooperate, that (lifting sanctions)could be done in the fairly
near future."
</P>
<P>
Further clarifying his view, Cook said:"Sanctions could not be
lifted if he (Saddam) sign up to the agreement, but sanctions
could certainly be lifted if he carries out the agreement."
</P>
<P>
However, Cook, whose country is in strong favor of military
action against Iraq, stressed that any agreement must be in
writing and must ensure that Iraq's program of weapons development
was stopped in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that UNSCOM (the U.N.Special Commission)
must be able to get back to work and must be able to stop Saddam
developing his weapons program," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary also indicated that the London
government was also prepared for flexibility on minor points.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Wishes Success for Annan's Mission in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday expressed
wishes of success for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in his
mission in Baghdad to spare the region more tension and
escalation of violence, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz
Dakhil Al-Dakhil was quoted by the agency as saying in a Cabinet
statement that Kuwait Council of Ministers followed up Annan's
efforts within the framework of the international community's
concern at reaching a peaceful solution to the Iraq-U.N. stand-off
over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Annan held a three-hour meeting with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein in Baghdad Sunday on reaching an agreement which Annan
hopes he would bring back to the U.N. Security Council Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's spokesman Fred Echard told reporters that
"substantial progress was made" but more work should be done to
reach a final agreement Sunday night or Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Annan who held three rounds of talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Saturday will continue to hold consultations
with him Sunday night in the final efforts to reach the agreement
which would avert a U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah urged Iraq Saturday to use the
chance of Kofi Annan's Baghdad visit to implement unconditionally
all the U.N. Security Council resolutions to avoid a perilous
situation for its people.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad said that Saddam Hussein must "see reason and act
pragmatically for the sake of the helpless and impoverished Iraqi
people," adding that "Saddam must implement all U.N. resolutions
without exception."

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Ends Visit To UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's President Ali
Abdullah Saleh ended his two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Sunday afternoon after talks on Iraq-U.N. crisis on arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's official news agency Wam said Saleh and the UAE
President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan issued a joint
statement calling upon the U.S. to avert a military end to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they urged the international community to exhaust
all efforts to defuse the Iraqi crisis by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president's visit coincided with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's trip to Baghdad to mediate a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, which was triggered by Iraq's refusal to
let U.N. weapons inspectors enter presidential sites suspected of
hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Saleh and Zayed expressed the hope that Annan would succeed in
his mission, which was considered as the last-ditch effort to
avoid a military showdown between the U.S. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Wam said that during the visit, Saleh also discussed with Zayed
ways of boosting bilateral relations. Yemen was treated coldly by
the UAE and other Gulf Arab states in the past years due to its
sympathy with the Iraqi authority in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Yeman has been trying to seek ways of improving ties with the
Gulf Arab states. It applied to join the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), a political, economic and defense alliance formed by the
Gulf Arabs in 1981, but has got no response.

<HEADLINE> 8 Killed by Fire in Two Separate Accidents in Paris </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Eight people, including an
unborn baby and the mother, were killed in two separate fire
accidents in Paris Sunday morning, reported Agence France-Presse
(AFP).
</P>
<P>
The fires, which also seriously injured four people and lightly
injured 11 others, are the most murderous ever recorded in Paris
since 1988, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
One of the fire was caused by a young drug addict, who set his
bed on fire when heating heroin early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The fire spread to other parts of the seven-stage apartment
building located in the working class 10th district, killing a
pregnant woman and a nine-year-old girl, AFP quoted police as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified man survived the fire and was sent to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Another fire was apparently caused by a failing water heating
machine in a 19th century bourgeois apartment building in the
well-off ninth district, said police.
</P>
<P>
Two people died of suffocation from smoke and three others were
burnt dead. All of them were adults.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Raps U.S. Double Standards in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Sunday slammed the United States for applying double standards in
the Middle East and warned of the implications of U.S. air
bombings of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, a key leader in the Arab world, told the Cable News
Network here that he felt the U.S. has been dealing differently
with Israel and Iraq, two Mideast countries both accused of
possessing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"For sure, not just media, but also the man on the street,
students in universities, intellectuals, businessmen (have the
same feeling)," he told the American TV network.
</P>
<P>
"At any seminar, I met the same question. If Iraq is not
implementing the U.N. resolutions, Israel is doing the same. If
Iraq has the weapons of mass destruction, Israel has the same
weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqis are desperate and Arabs feel the U.S. double
standards ... If (U.S. President) Clinton stands up to (Israeli
Premier Benjamin) Netanyahu (it) will certainly help defuse
tension in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has been a close friend of the U.S., said
the U.S. double standards and its position on the Israeli problem
are something "which I don't like."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stranded since
last March over Israeli settlement expansion and are feared to be
upstaged by the Iraqi crisis. The U.S. is blamed for failing to
force Israel to implement the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a "U.S. air bombing of Baghdad or a Saddam Hussein
armed with chemical and biological weapons," Mubarak said both are
"worse" choices and would lead to "very risky" situations.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot prevent him (Clinton from attacking Iraq). But
(then) we will have a lot of problems. Troubles, problems and
violence, but not more than that, at least for the time being,"
Mubarak said, anticipating a breakout of Palestinian violence in
the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he warned "it will be very dangerous for the
region and the world" if Iraq's possession of lethal weapons is
proven true.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he has sent eight messages to the Iraqi president
since Iraq began to deny U.N. arms inspectors unrestricted access
to sensitive sites last November, which set off the current
standoff.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a member of the U.S.-led alliance that drove Iraq out of
Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf war, has been opposing the use of force
against Baghdad and urging Iraq to fully implement Security
Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Public Urged to Ready for Iraqi Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet on Sunday
urged the public to get prepared with gas masks and sealing
materials against possible eruption of war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet issued the call at a weekly session held here,
during which the ministers heard a review of the situation in Iraq
presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said the defense establishment is requesting the
public to equip itself with gas masks and sealing materials and
get ready for possible Iraqi retaliation in case the United States
bombs Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Ministry has requested the public to guard
against possible Iraqi biological and chemical attacks. Officials
have notified citizens that the safest way of protection during an
attack is staying in sealed rooms while wearing the gas masks.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, there has been a rise in the sale of plastic
sealings and people have continued to queue up in front of gas
masks distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the public should
listen to the defense establishment's instructions on how to
prepare for a possible Iraqi attack. He said that the government
knows what must be done to deal with the crisis and is adopting
decisions with maximum responsibility.
</P>
<P>
As the military standoff between Iraq and the U.S. over
weapons inspections continued escalating, Israeli government has
been nervously monitoring the developments in the Gulf. Netanyahu
has already chaired several meetings of senior ministers and
military commanders to assess the situation and formulate ways to
tackle contingencies.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon
postponed a scheduled visit to Jordan Sunday due to the current
situation in Iraq, where United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan is making a last-ditch effort to avert a military strike.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army repeated its assessment Sunday that the chance of
an Iraqi attack on Israel remains remote. Ben Ami, the army
spokesman, added that no date has been set for the delivery of
additional "Patriot" anti-missile missiles from the U.S., adding
the missiles would be sent when Israel needs them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dispute erupted in the political spectrum over
the proposed distribution of antibiotics to residents living in
areas under bigger threat of attacks, such as Haifa and Dan areas
along the coast.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee comprising health, defense, police and
army officials discussed the proposal. But a leading figure,
Health Minister Yehoshua Matza, voiced his opposition to issuing
such drugs now, saying this could only create panic among the
public.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert agreed with Matza, saying
delivering drugs could alarm the public though in fact the
possibility of an attack is very low.
</P>
<P>
But President Ezer Weizman supported the proposal, noting that
it is better prepared than not. Opposition Labor Party's lawmaker
Ephraim Sneh, a former health minister, agreed with Weizman,
saying it is good time for Israeli public to get prepared for the
biological and chemical warfare because such threat is long-term.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel has expressed regret
Sunday at recommendations issued by the United States and Canada
for their citizens to leave Israel for fear of an Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post Sunday quoted unnamed
Israeli officials as criticizing the U.S. and Canada for ignoring
the effect on the Israeli public by recommending their
non-essential diplomats, tourists and business people to leave
Israel voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright advised on Friday
the voluntary departure of U.S. citizens concerned for their
safety as a precautionary measure. The U.S. administration also
advised its citizens to cancel non-essential trips to Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas, where the anti-U.S. sentiment
is very high.
</P>
<P>
But Washington stressed the decision did not mean any change in
its assessment that the possibility of an Iraqi attack on Israel
is remote, though it cannot be excluded.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government made a similar recommendation Saturday
to its non-essential diplomats and citizens in Israel for a
voluntary departure paid by the government. The recommendation
also advised Canadian citizens to defer non-essential travel to
Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel expressed reservations at the U.S. and Canadian moves,
which were believed to be aimed at impressing Iraq that their
intention to strike was serious, saying they could hurt Israeli
tourism and further alarm Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
To offset the negative impact of the U.S. and Canadian moves,
Israeli Prime Minister's Office issued on Saturday a statement
reiterating that "the Israeli assessment of chances of an Iraqi
attack on Israel has not changed one bit."
</P>
<P>
"We still consider the likelihood of such an attack as
extremely low," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf crisis over the United Nations weapons
inspection in Iraq erupted weeks ago, a panic has been created
among Israeli public. They feared about a possible Iraqi
non-conventional retaliation against Israel if the U.S. launches
military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Despite the repeated reassuring messages issued by political
and military leaders, people have been flooding gas masks
distribution centers across the country, leading to a shortage of
supply and forcing the government to seek urgent purchases of
masks and antibiotics in the U.S. and Europe.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG for Final Resort on S. Leone Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) with headquarters in Liberia has begun testing
artillery pieces in that country, apparently for the final resort
on the remnants of the junta forces in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG press release today warned the public to keep off
their pitches surrounding the Robertsfield International Airport
near the Liberian capital Monrovia while the test firing is going
on.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has also warned ships, tankers, aircraft and fishing
trawlers to avoid danger by keeping distance, said a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the test firing has entered the
second day Sunday and will continue until February 28.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG also called on the public not to be panic because the
exercise is normal.
</P>
<P>
The test firing exercise came in the wake of the frantic
efforts by the Nigerian-led sub-regional force to contain Sierra
Leone's junta forces who have submerged into the countryside
after being dislodged from the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a batch of soldiers from the Ghanaian contingent of
ECOMOG left Liberia at the weekend following the completion of
the peacekeeping mission. But it is not known whether the
soldiers are heading for home or moving toward Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In another development, ECOMOG on Sunday arrived at Bo, where
the remnants of the junta forces and their allied rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have controlled the western part
of the second largest city in southern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG reportedly entered the city from the east this morning
with little resistence and is moving to the center of the town.
</P>
<P>
After their ousting in Freetown, the fleeing junta elements
and RUF rebels broke into Bo and other major towns by defeating
the civil militiamen known as Kamajors fighting against the
junta.
</P>
<P>
The junta remnants and RUF rebels now also hold control of
Makeni, a major city in northern Sierra Leone, where fleeing
junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma is reportedly based.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Makeni was heavy Sunday with the junta forces shot
one of ECOMOG's fight jets flying over the town.
</P>
<P>
Rampant looting and killing of civilians are also reportedly
continuing their by the junta remnants and their RUF allies.

WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen on Sunday expressed his caution on reports from
Baghdad that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was on verge of a
breakthrough to resolve the crisis over weapons inspection in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that any agreement Annan might reach with the Iraq
Authorities must in full compliance with U.N. resolutions on
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
He told NBC television's "Meet the Press" program that the real
issue was whether the Security Council was "going to insist upon

</P>
<P>
Cohen also disclosed that he would sign orders later on Sunday
to call up "several hundreds" more military reservists to prepare
for possible early action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's prestige
among Arabs could be bolstered by any U.S. military action that
left him in power.
</P>
<P>
"Could he go up in stature? Possible," he said. But he argued
Saddam would be "stronger" without substantial air strikes on his
sensitive sites, thus diminishing his ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Hopeful About Annan's Mission in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat expressed hope Sunday that
the Iraqi crisis could be solved diplomatically through the
efforts of United Nations (UN) Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza after meeting with a German
parliamentary delegation, Arafat said he believed that "talks
would get rid of the threat of war."
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Annan's mission which is aimed at
averting a possible military confrontation between Iraq and the
United States over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians in the West Bank continued holding
demonstrations Sunday in support of Iraq. Two protesters were
wounded by rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers in Bir Zeit
village near Ramallah. During the clashes, four protesters were
detained by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, about 500 Palestinian protesters marched through
the city, chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans to show
solidarity with Iraq over its military standoff with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Carrying a model of Scud missile and burning Israeli, American
and British flags, the protesters cheered Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, calling on him to fire missiles at Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, thousands of Palestinian protesters staged
pro-Iraqi demonstrations in major West Bank cities of Ramallah,
Hebron and Bethlehem in defiance of a PNA ban on such protests. No
serious clashes occurred thanks to the efforts made by
Palestinian police to separate them from Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli General Security Service head Ami Ayalon told Sunday's
Cabinet session that the overwhelming majority of Palestinian
people strongly support Iraq. What alarms Israeli leaders is that
a poll discovered that 80 percent of Palestinians support Iraq's
bombing of Tel Aviv as it did in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon claimed that intelligence shows the daily Palestinian
protests in the territories were in fact organized by the Fatah
Movement, the mainstream faction of the Arafat-led Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are furious about the U.S. for its double
standards in dealing with Iraq and Israel. They pointed out that
while the U.S. threatens use of force to wrest Iraq's abiding by
U.N. Security Council resolutions, it is reluctant to pressure
Israel to honor those resolutions calling for its withdrawal from
the occupied Palestinian land.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King: Ma'an Returns to Calm After Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said
Sunday that the situation in the southern city of Ma'an was calm
as army tanks entered the city and a curfew was imposed following
pro-Iraq riots in the past two days that left one dead and 10
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Security forces are "in total control of Ma'an and there were
no clashes" since Saturday night, the king said in a statement to
Jordan's official news agency and the state-run Jordan Television
Station.
</P>
<P>
All the necessary measures have been taken to prevent
re-occurrence of riots, he said. Inspection for illegal arms and
rioters who incited violence in the city are underway, according
to the king's statement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to future measures against such incidents, the king
said that dialogue was open for all the parties, but violence
instigated by "outsiders" was strongly rejected.
</P>
<P>
The entrance to the city, some 250 kilometers south of the
capital city of Amman, was sealed off on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The security force issued a statement Sunday saying that
security and calm have been fully restored in the city, which
witnessed two pro-Iraqi and anti-U.S. riots breaking out Friday
and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local people were defying a government ban on march and
movement and taking to the streets to express their support for
Iraq and vent their anger over a threatened U.S. military strike
against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations turned into riots and clashes with the
police, killing one man and injuring two on Friday, and leaving
eight more wounded on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There is a heavier presence of police force in the city, where
destroyed automatic cash-dispensing machines beside the main
streets could still be seen and electricity remains out of reach
in some parts - power lines were cut off during the riots.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein went to Ma'an on Saturday after the riot was
stopped to persuade the residents not to help "infiltrators,
vandalists and elements" endanger national security.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian popular support for Iraqi people remained strong,
despite strained Jordanian-Iraqi ties and Amman's much closer
links with Washington since it signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The first rally this month expressing solidarity with Iraqi
people erupted more than a week ago when over 1,000 prayers took
to the streets around the famous Al-Hussein Mosque in downtown
Amman.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened military attacks to force Iraqi
compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions and the free
and full access by U.N. weapons inspectors to the "off-limits"
presidential palaces suspected of hiding prohibited weapons.

Madeleine Albright said on Sunday that the Clinton administration
was waiting to see what deal U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan

ATHENS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos expressed his willingness Sunday to meet with
his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem, but ruled out any
possibilities of negotiations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in Greece's "The Tribune" newspaper
Sunday, Pangalos said that he said to Cem that he was ready to
meet with Cem, not however, to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that it was an opportunity for them to meet on
the sidelines of the forthcoming meeting in Greece's Rhodes island
of foreign ministers of Western European Union (WEU) member and
affiliated states.
</P>
<P>
It would be an open discussion in which each minister could say
whatever he wanted and would not be restricted by agendas, by
colleagues or by the press, Pangalos said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Turkey wanted political negotiations on
what they saw as problems in the Aegean, which in reality were
Turkish claims against Greece.
</P>
<P>
The only disputes in the Aegean between the two neighboring
countries was the continental shelf, he said, adding that Ankara
was free to refer any other claims it might have to the
international court of justice in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Vice-President Urges Muslims to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian
Vice-president Salmin Amour has urged Muslims to maintain unity
of the country through cooperation with people of other
religions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during special prayers in Dar es Salaam on Friday,
Amour, who is also President of Zanzibar, said the government
respects all religious groups and will strive to promote the
freedom of worship.
</P>
<P>
He, however, cautioned that the government will not hesitate
to intervene in preachings against other religions.
</P>
<P>
Amour also took issue with fanaticism, saying that it is a
dangerous path to follow and is not one of the tenets of Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Entering mosques with weapons is highly against Muslim
teachings," Amour said at his office at Oyster Bay.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-President was referring to a group of fanatics of
Khidmat Daawat Islamia, an Islamic organization, who unlawfully
organized a gathering to preach against other religions early
this month.
</P>
<P>
As the police tried to seize the fanatics, who fled into the
Mwembe Chai Mosque and armed themselves with iron bars, violent
clashes ensued.
</P>
<P>
In two separate violent clashes during February 12-13 in the
mosque area between mobsters and the police, three people,
including a Muslim school teacher, were killed and more than 260
rioters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
At the special prayers, retired president Ali Hassan Mwinyi
underscored the importance of religious tolerance. He said just
like a person cannot choose his parents and neighbors, Tanzanians
need to respect each other regardless of their religious
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
The chief Sheikh, Hemed Bin Juma Bin Hemed, called on Muslims
to conduct prayers aimed at enhancing unity of the country.

<HEADLINE> No Deal with Jordan, Says Lewinsky Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The lawyer for former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky said Sunday that his client made no
deal with the president's confidante Vernon Jordon to secure a job
in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
William Ginsburg told CBS's "Face The Nation" there was
"unequivocally no quid pro quo" with Jordan, who first discussed
job prospects with Lewinsky in early November -- before she
received a subpoena to testify in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
Jordon, a top Washington lawyer, arranged job interviews for
Lewinsky with several major U.S. corporations of which he is a
director, including Revlon in New York.
</P>
<P>
Special prosecutor Kenneth Starr is trying to prove the
allegation that Jordan, at the urging of the White House, arranged
interviews for Lewinsky as an inducement to deny the alleged
affair to Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"She met Vernon Jordan in early November, on either the 4th,
5th or 6th," said Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned, that was before she was on any
noticed witness list or received a subpoena. Therefore, I don't
believe the White House knew that, either."
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg also said Lewinsky stood by her affadvit in the Jones
suit, in which she swears she did not have a sexual relationship
with Clinton, and denies the charge that he asked her to lie about
it under oath.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg said Starr was "trampling on Lewinsky's fourth, fifth,
sixth and 14th amendments."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Linda Tripp's secret telephone recordings of
Lewinsky, Ginsburg said Starr was using illegally obtained tapes,
"then causing more tapes to be made illegally, and then using a
sting to bring Monica Lewinsky into federal investigatory
purview."

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief Kofi Annan has
reached a deal with the Iraqi authorities on solving the Iraqi
crisis over weapons inspections peacefully.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials here confirmed "there is an agreed text" which
is in full conformity with the U.N. Security Council resolutions
and maintains integrity of the U.N. inspection body UNSCOM (United
Nations Special Commission) on disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But they did not go into details, which are expected to be
announced later Sunday or early Monday. The U.N. chief is to make
a formal statement on the deal Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The deal came after the Iraqis dropped their "time-limit"
condition on UNSCOM inspection of all suspected sites, which had
been considered a "deal-breaker" threatening Annan's mission here.
</P>
<P>
The deal to be signed by Annan and one of Iraqi leadership
before Monday morning will be brought back to the
U.N. headquarters in New York and briefed to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan has been on close contact with representatives of the
five permanent members of the Security Council. "We expect the
text will be acceptable to all 15 members of the Security
Council," including the United States and Britain, which have
threatened military attack on Iraq if diplomacy fails, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan was said to be very happy after he struck the deal in the
wake of two days of difficult negotiations with Iraqi leaders,
especially a three-hour meeting with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general was congratulated by his colleagues on
his successful mission to avert a U.S.-British military strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a U.N spokesman called the talks between Annan and the
Iraq president "very positive," saying that most of the problems
between Iraq and the U.N. have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had been keen to reach an agreement to defuse the
crisis over U.N. inspections of Iraqi presidential sites, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Killing of Iranians in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry
Sunday issued a statement severely condemning the killing of two
Iranian engineers in Karachi, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, the
Iranian Foreign Ministry asked the Pakistani government to
"pursue the case immediately and without slight in association
with the arrest and punishment of the actors of criminal acts."
</P>
<P>
The two Iranian engineers, Ali Mohammad Habibzadeh and Mortaza
Adibzadeh, who were in charge of a flyway construction in the
Clifton of Karachi, were shot dead by unidentified armed men
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that consequence of negligence and lack of
strict measures against the murderers of the previous atrocious
acts have been the cause which motivated the criminals to commit
further inhuman atrocities.
</P>
<P>
It is high time that these criminals were brought to justice
for their terrorist activities, it stressed, adding that the
killing of the two Iranian engineers has deeply shaken both the
Iranian government and the nation.
</P>
<P>
The statement further emphasized that the guarantee of safety
and well-being of Iranian citizens and those Iranians working in
Pakistan is the responsibility and commitment the government of
Pakistan can not shirk.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Iranian government would incessantly follow
up the case until concrete and acceptable results are achieved.
</P>
<P>
In a swift response following the incident, the Iranian Foreign
Ministry Saturday summoned Pakistani ambassador to Iran Javid
Hussain, lodging strong protest to the killing.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh handed over a
note of protest to Hussain, warning that the relations between
Tehran and Islamabad would be gravely affected if Pakistani
officials failed to take severe measures against the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Pakistani President Mohammad Rafiq Tarvar and Prime
Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif sent cables of condolence to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, expressing regret to the incident.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA said that the bodies of the two Iranians were flown to
Tehran early Sunday and delivered to Iranian authorities.
</P>
<P>
During recent years, 11 Iranian nationals have been shot dead
by gunmen in Pakistan, but no groups or persons claimed
responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has strongly urged the Pakistani
government to take serious measures against the terrorist
actions, but so far no person was found guilty for the killings
of the Iranian nationals in the country.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Chinese Farmer with Passion for Trees Elected NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Xingren, a 55-year-old
farmer in central China's Hubei Province, and his family have
planted trees on 333 hectares of wasteland in the last 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Zhou has used more than 57,000 yuan of his own savings on the
reclamation project. He even refused to sell the trees to pay his
hospital expenses when he was diagnosed with cancer in July of
1994. Instead, the family borrowed money from their neighbors to
pay the medical cost.
</P>
<P>
Before his operation, Zhou said to his wife: "All the trees
were planted for future generations. Please don't cut down a
single tree for sale if the operation fails. Otherwise, I will die
with a grievance."
</P>
<P>
Soon after Zhou recovered from the disease, local people put up
a monument for his environmental contribution and cited him as an
example of selflessness.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was recently elected a deputy to the Ninth People's
Congress, which will be held in Beijing early next month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Zhou said: "I'll take an active
part in state affairs, reflect the voice of the Chinese farmers and
call on the whole society to be more closely involved in
afforestation."
</P>
<P>
Zhou used to be head of a village-run brick kiln. In 1984, he
quit the job in a bid to attain his long-cherished wish for
"greening" the hilly land near his village.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Zhou and his family worked more than 10 hours a day
on the hills. He has worn out 112 spades and picks. In controling
the spread of forest fires, the couple have been injured on three
occasions.
</P>
<P>
So far, Zhou's family has planted 600,000 trees with a live
timber reserve of 20,000 cubic meters.

CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid expressed welcome to the agreement
signed by the U.N. and Iraq Monday for a peaceful ending to the
Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was concluded Monday morning by Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
who was commissioned by the U.N. Security Council and arrived in
Baghdad Friday in a last-ditch effort to bring about a political
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan has left for New York and will discuss the agreement with
the five Security Council permanent members Tuesday. He said he is
hopeful that all the permanent members will accept the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed the hope that the Security Council would
"complete the success" fulfilled by the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
"Giving diplomacy a greater role in settling such a crisis will
spare the entire Middle East a critical turning point which could
make the region face a disaster," he added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the importance of resolving all disputes
peacefully, noting that the military option would lead to nothing
but further escalation of the tensions.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the agreement would help fully implement
the U.N. resolutions and lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people have been living under more than seven years
of sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
embargo can not be lifted until U.N. inspectors verify the
destruction of all long-range missiles and weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has insisted that any agreement must allow free and
full access to all monitoring sites and maintain the integrity of
the U.N. Special Commission on scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction. It had threatened to launch military strike against
Iraq to force its compliance otherwise.

North America and the Middle East produced results well ahead of
1996, while business in Asia was affected by turbulent conditions
(brought about by the regional financial turmoil)."
</P>
<P>
The investment banking business "weakened in the second half of
1997" but "remained profitable", Purves added.
</P>
<P>
A special general provision charge of 175 million pounds (286
million U.S. dollars) has been set aside "as a precautionary
measure in view of the uncertain conditions within Asia", and
other general provisions have been increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
The group's total assets reached at 286 billion pounds (468
billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1997, about 20 percent higher
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the two leading subsidiaries of HSBC Holdings, Hong kong
Bank's net profits rose 3 percent to 19.79 billion HK dollars (2.5
billion U.S. dollars), while the Hang Seng Bank reported a 10
percent rise in net profits to 9.36 billion HK dollars (1.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both banks predicted a difficult year in 1998 amid the regional
economic downturn, but they voiced confidence in Hong Kong and the
long-term prospects of Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Purves, who is to retire at this year's annual
general meeting in May, the group will shift from sterling to the
U.S. dollar in reporting its results starting 1998, "since the
U.S. dollar and currencies closely linked to it form the main
currency bloc in which the group's business is transacted."

<HEADLINE> India's GDP to Grow by 5 Percent in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- India's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth is likely to fall to five percent in fiscal
1997-98 (April 1, 1997-March 31, 1998) compared to a growth rate
of 7.5 percent achieved in the last fiscal year, according to
initial estimates issued by the Central Statistical Organization
(CSO) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The estimates are based on an anticipated level of agricultural
and industrial production, budget estimates of government
expenditure and performance of key sectors.
</P>
<P>
Gross national product at factor cost was likely to grow by 5.2
percent in 1997-98 compared to 7.7 percent growth in the last
fiscal year, the CSO said.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in projected growth rate is mainly due to a
negative growth in agriculture, forestry and fishing at two
percent as against 7.9 percent growth witnessed in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which along with agriculture accounts
for over 47 percent of total GDP at factor cost, is likely to
perform below par compared to last year with the ESO estimating
the growth at 6.1 percent against 7.4 percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
However, the other two sectors of industry -- mining and
electricity -- are likely to post higher growth rates of 6.3
percent and 6.4 percent respectively compared to minus 0.3 percent
and 5 percent recorded last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to Hong
Kong slumped by almost a quarter in January from a year ago due to
the market downturn, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors totaled 745,243 in January, declining
24.6 percent from the same month of 1997, according to the latest
figures released by the HKTA.
</P>
<P>
All the major markets where tourists to Hong Kong come from
sank into a downturn, with North Asia falling by 65.9 percent,
Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific dropping by 31.2
percent, and the Americas, by 19.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But good growth was recorded in such markets as India,
Malaysia, the Netherlands and Central America as Hong Kong's
leading airline Cathay Pacific offered luring tour packages.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA forecast that the total number of visitors to Hong
Kong would reach 10.6 million this year, up two percent from a
year earlier. Most of the growth is expected in the second half of
this year, said the association.
</P>
<P>
About 10.4 million tourists came to Hong Kong in 1997, down
11.1 percent from 1996.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Inflation Edges Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Hong Kong was
fueled up slightly to 5.4 percent in January this year by higher
prices of food, traveling and hair-dressing during the traditional
Chinese Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Consumer price inflation as measured by the Composite Consumer
Price Index (CPI) showed a year-on-year increase of 5.4 percent in
the first month of 1998, higher than that of 5.2 percent in
December 1997, according to the latest figures released by the
government here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Census and Statistics Department attributed
the rise in Composite CPI to higher food prices, and higher
charges for package tours and hair-dressing before the Lunar New
Year's Day, which fell on January 28 this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of many consumer items were usually subject to seasonal
rise shortly before the Lunar New Year, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Housing cost rose 8.8 percent in January, higher than the
average inflation rate, but durable goods, fuel and light,
clothing and footwear recorded lower rates of price increase.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat Monday
made separate telephone calls to King Hussein of Jordan to commend
Jordan's role in averting U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both Annan and Arafat expressed thanks and appreciation for
the king's efforts in the Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons
inspections, Jordan's official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed U.N.'s appreciation for Jordan's "clear and
active stand" which contributed to defusing the crisis and
averting a military option.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in his call that the king's efforts paved the way
for the U.N. secretary general to hold talks with Iraqi leaders.
</P>
<P>
In response, Hussein reaffirmed Jordan's firm stand which
called for solving regional and international conflicts through
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for Annan's successful mediation
which resulted in a U.N.-Iraqi agreement signed Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the crisis triggered by Iraq's refusal to allow
U.N. arms inspectors to full access to Iraq's sites suspected of
hiding banned weapons, Jordan had exerted efforts at national,
bilateral, regional and international levels to help prevent the
United States from staging military strike on Iraq to force it to
fully comply with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Untied States has threatened to resort to force if
diplomacy fails to solve the confrontation with Iraq
peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Operation Removes "Time Bomb" From Patient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese surgeons conducted a
successful operation here today to keep a tumor in a patient's
abdomen from rupturing due to pressure from the blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such operation in China.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts called the tumor a "time bomb" inside the human
body, as more than 50 percent of such tumors rupture, resulting in
massive life-threatening hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally such tumors were excised in the course of a major
operation, which itself was dangerous for elderly and weak
patients.
</P>
<P>
The patient who received the ground-breaking operation today is
79 years old and had suffered from the illness for three years.
</P>
<P>
An opening with a diameter of about two cm was cut in the
patient's leg. A special duct -- a man-made blood vessel -- was
then inserted to channel the blood away from the tumor, thus
avoiding the danger of rupture.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A book titled "Zhou Enlai in
Shanghai" became available to readers today to mark the 100th
anniversary of the birth of the late Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Zhou had close ties with this eastern China metropolis. In 1920
the 22-year-old Zhou boarded a ship in Shanghai heading for Europe
to explore a way to save the nation.
</P>
<P>
During the democratic revolution Zhou led a lot of struggles in
Shanghai and continued to pay attention to its revolutionary
affairs after he left.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Zhou
visited Shanghai more than 40 times, giving directions concerning
various aspects of the city's development.

<HEADLINE> China to Implement Strict Family Planning Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Peng Peiyun
stressed here today that China will spare no efforts to pursue its
strict family planning policy in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"China will not slacken its family planning policy in the next
century," Peng, also minister in charge of the State Family
Planning Commission (SFPC), told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She denied a recent rumor spread by the Western media that
China would loosen its birth control policy. "China's family
planning policy and its target for population control will not
change," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the family planning policy in the late 1970s,
and encouraged every couple to have one child in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China implements a flexible policy in
poverty-stricken areas and ethnic group regions.
</P>
<P>
The success of China's population control and its great
contributions over the past 20-odd years have drawn the close
attention of, and have been praised by, experts all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Peng explained that since China has a very big population, it
has a natural increase of about 13 million people a year
though its birth rate is relatively low.
</P>
<P>
She said the country's growth of population is not balanced
in different communities and areas, and therefore it is incorrect
to draw a conclusion from some local changes that China will
slacken its control over population growth.
</P>
<P>
China has already entered an important stage of its population
and family planning undertakings, she said, adding that a
strategic goal of family planning has been set for the coming 50
years, including population growth, improvement of people's
quality and structure, services for child-bearing women, and reformed
mechanism for birth control work.
</P>
<P>
SFPC Deputy Minister Yang Kuifu said today at a ceremony to
grant awards for the best reports by China's Population News that
China is a country with a population of 1.236 billion. The
strong pressure of population will last for a long time due to the
inertial function of this huge population.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, China will not slacken control over the birth
rate in the slightest degree," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that in some of China's rural areas family planning
is not properly managed. "And we have also encountered many new
problems during the present transition period from a planned
economy to a market one.''
</P>
<P>
He concluded that China has to make more efforts to realize a
coordinated growth of its population, economy and society.

<HEADLINE> Annan Leaves Baghdad After Successful Mission (Update) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan left here at 2:15 p.m. local time (1115 GMT) after
successfully concluded a deal with Iraq to defuse the four and a
half month old weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off at the Saddam International Airport by Iraqi
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, other senior Iraq officials and
U.N. staff stationed here.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Annan held a meeting with Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan. He expressed appreciation at the
atmosphere of his talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
the Iraqi side which led to a balanced agreement Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan conveyed Saddam's satisfaction at and appreciation of
the sincere efforts by Annan to defuse the crisis "fabricated by
America" over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the agreement as a great achievement not only for
Iraq, but the entire region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived here Friday afternoon in a last-ditch
attempt to settle the Iraq crisis and avert a U.S. military strike
against Iraq to force its opening up of all suspected weapons
sites to inspection.
</P>
<P>
In what the Iraqs called a "historical" visit, Annan held five
rounds of "difficult" talks with Aziz and a three-hour meeting
with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
He successfully persuaded the Iraqi leadership to comply with
U.N. resolutions and grant U.N. inspectors free and full access to
all sites without time limits.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraqi agreement, which Annan said he believed
"acceptable to all the 15 members of the Security Council," will
be presented to the council for discussion and approval.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Signs Amended Agrarian Reform Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Monday signed an agrarian reform bill into law to give more
funds to the government's land reform program that will benefit
six million farmers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The amended Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program of 1998
doubles the amount for the agrarian reform fund from 50 billion
pesos (1.25 billion US dollars) to 100 billion pesos (2.5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It mandates the use of the amount as revolving fund, allowing
the farmers' payments for the land they acquired to become part of
the fund to be further used for agrarian reform.
</P>
<P>
Ramos hailed the amended law for representing the commitment of
the legislative and executive branches to social amelioration and
economic equity for peasants and small farmers.
</P>
<P>
It also serves to strengthen the safety net for the
agricultural sector as the country strives to modernize
agriculture in this crucial period of transition towards
globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Ramos assumed office in June 1992, the Department of
Agrarian Reform and the Department of Natural Resources have
distributed to farmer-beneficiaries a combined total of 2.68
million hectares land covered by agrarian reform.
</P>
<P>
The president said that to protect small farmers, the leasehold
scheme on lands not yet covered by the amended law has been
installed.
</P>
<P>
Records show that there are some 1.44 million hectares
currently under such leasehold arrangements, wherein a third of
the said total was done during the Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ramos also signed four other bills to boost
its social equity program. All these measures were passed during
the just-concluded special session of Congress.

<P>
ABU DHABI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
said it was "gratified" with an agreement reached Monday between
Iraq and the United Nations on a peaceful solution to the Iraq-U.N.
crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's official Wam news agency said the UAE cabinet
considered the agreement will help avert dangers of new wars
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet said in its weekly meeting Monday morning that
the UAE was gratified with such a settlement to the crisis,
which was triggered by Iraq's decision in October to bar U.N.
inspectors charged with dismantling weapons of mass destruction
from entering sites suspected of hiding biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
It also said the four-day trip by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan to Baghdad, starting from Friday has achieved
"positive outcome."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baghdad should also be praised for its cooperation
with international efforts to bring the crisis to an end, the
cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan signed the
agreement on peacefully resolving the crisis in Baghdad Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Baghdad will unconditionally allow
U.N. inspectors charged with dismantling weapons of mass
destruction access to all sites suspected of hiding biological or
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement could help defuse a possible military
showdown against Baghdad by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The two western powers have threatened to use force to make
Iraq comply with the U.N. resolutions if Annan failed to
persuade Iraq to back down.

MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Total investment in the
Philippines rose by 29 percent from 140 billion pesos (3.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 181 billion pesos (4.53 billion dollars)
last year, the Philippine News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The additional investments of on-going concerns jumped 23
percent from 90 billion pesos (2.3 billion dollars) to 122 billion
pesos (3.05 billion dollars) in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos expressed satisfaction on Monday with the
increase of the total investments, "because it was achieved among
the currency turmoil which hit the country starting in the third
quarter of 1997," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Perfecto Yasay, chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), as saying that the SEC registered
29,953 new companies in 1997, up 16 percent from the 1996 total.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said foreign investments in local companies, a critical
indicator on foreign perception about the economy, rose by 8
percent with direct foreign capital came through joint ventures in
existing domestic firms and through remittances by foreign-based
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The direct foreign capital represented 54 percent of total
investments raised for the business section in 1997, Yasay said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that foreign investors were apparently not
discouraged by the deterioration of the currency considering that
the value of their capital has increased by more than 50 percent
since the peso depreciation.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Hails Peaceful Solution To Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamed bin Jassim bin Jaber al Thani said Monday that Doha
was happy to see the reaching of a peaceful solution to a crisis
between Iraq and the United Nations on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published by the official Qatari news
agency, the foreign minister said Qatar welcomed "the peaceful
solution which saved the Iraqi people from consequences of
military confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"It also helped achieve security and stability in the Gulf
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan signed an agreement on peacefully resolving
the crisis in Baghdad Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Baghdad will unconditionally allow
U.N. inspectors charged with dismantling weapons of mass
destruction access to sites suspected of hiding biological or
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement could help defuse a possible
military showdown against Baghdad by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The two western powers have threatened to use force against
Iraq if Annan's three-day trip to Baghdad, starting from Friday,
failed to persuade Iraq to back down by allowing U.N. arms
inspectors free and full access to all sides suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister said Sunday's agreement between
Iraq and the U.N. was also "a positive step towards the
implementation of U.N. Security Council's resolutions related to
lifting economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions was imposed by the U.N. in 1991 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven years, tens of thousands Iraqi children
and women have died because of lack of food and medicine due
to the economic ban.

<HEADLINE> Australian Troops to Stay Until Proof of Iraq Deal: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian troops are to
remain in Kuwait until there is proof that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein will deliver on a proposed peace agreement between Iraq
and the United Nations, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a breakthrough which could avert a U.S. military attack on
Iraq, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reportedly struck a deal
with Saddam Hussein on the core issue of the Iraqi crisis, opening
Saddam's presidential compounds to U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Howard said he had not seen the text of the document, which
the United States still has not approved, but he was hopeful of a
peaceful end to the Iraqi crisis," the Australian Associated Press
(AAP) reported Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"I'd be happy to support a continued (Australian troops')
presence until such time as we can be properly satisfied that this
is an agreement that is going to be honored," AAP Quoted the prime
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Australia has sent 190 elite air force soldiers to Kuwait in a
show of support for the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I think most people would agree that there'd be nothing more
absurd than to have some kind of military withdrawal and then to
discover that something was not being delivered," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister last Saturday postponed his visit to
Malaysia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) because of the Iraq crisis.
The visit, the first by the Howard to Malaysia, would have begun
on Sunday if not postponed.

<HEADLINE> Kim Jong-pil Named South Korean Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President-elect Kim
Dae-jung on Monday nominated Kim Jong-pil as his prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe Kim Jong-pil is the best candidate for the
premiership as he is undoubtedly capable of addressing the
unprecedented national crisis in light of his rich experience,"
said Kim Dae-jung, who will be sworn in on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil, 72, was prime minister from 1971-73 under the
government of the late President Park Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
The eight-term veteran legislator was also the founder of the
Korea Central Intelligence Agency, predecessor of the Agency for
National Security Planning.
</P>
<P>
However, the major opposition Grand National Party (GNP), which
controls the National Assembly (parliament) with 161 seats, is
threatening to veto the nomination in a parliamentary session
due to open Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The GNP is opposed to the appointment of the politically
conservative Kim Jong-pil, claiming he is unsuited to steering
the nation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"We won't tolerate the nomination of Kim because we regard it
as an indication that the President-elect and his ruling coalition
will ignore our party and dominate the assembly hereafter," GNP
spokesman Maeng Hyung-kyu said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect, who is also 72, urged the GNP to approve
the appointment in parliament on Tuesday to help him overcome the
economic crisis caused by corporate failures and bad loans of
financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Voters have taken it for granted that I would name him as
prime minister since I had pledged to do so during the
presidential campaign,'' President-elect Kim added in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Before the 15th presidential election last December, the
National Congress for New Politics led by Kim Dae-jung joined
with the United Liberal Democrats led by Kim Jong-pil in an
effort to win the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Under an alliance agreement, Kim Jong-pil must be appointed as
prime minister of the coalition government if Kim Dae-jung wins
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The two Kims also agreed to share cabinet posts and revise the
Constitution for the establishment of parliamentary cabinet system
before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Kim Jong-pil might be endorsed by the parliament
if a last-minute political compromise is reached between the
ruling and opposition groups because the GNP is likely to ask the
ruling coalition to pledge that it won't entice GNP members of
parliament to defect in exchange for the GNP's approval of Kim's
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Iraq-Annan Agreement Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday termed as "encouraging" an agreement between Iraq and the
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on resolving the crisis over
arms inspections peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the agreement would serve as the final solution to the
Iraqi crisis so that inspection process would continue according
to the U.N. Security Council resolutions," Mubarak told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian TV broadcast live the signing ceremony of the
U.N.-Iraq deal. Mubarak said he has just watched the ensuing press
conference given jointly in Baghdad by Annan and Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this agreement is indeed good and will be approved
by the U.N. Security Council especially in light of the fact that
Annan was authorized by the Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader received a telephone call from Annan after
the U.N. chief signed the agreement Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed hope that the U.S. would back the agreement
in the Security Council, referring to the fact that Annan had
phoned U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright twice during the
negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has insisted that any agreement must allow free and
full access to all sites and maintain the integrity of the
U.N. Special Commission charged with scrapping Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction. It threatened to attack Iraq to force its
compliance otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he expected the deal to get full Iraqi compliance
after its approval by the Security Council. But he warned that
violation of this agreement would lead to "grave consequences" to
the region.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough in settling the crisis came after rounds of
intensive talks Annan has held with Iraqi leaders since his
arrival here Friday in a last-ditch effort to bring about a
political solution.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said, "The agreement
simply means that the interests of the world, the region, the
U.N. and the international legitimacy have been put into
consideration."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: How China Achieves Sustained Trade Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Jian, associate research fellow at the China Foreign Trade
Research Section, stresses the role of overseas-funded enterprises
in promoting foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has approved the establishment of about 30,000
overseas-funded enterprises, about half of which have become
operational. Imports and exports of these firms have grown rapidly
since 1992, reaching 152.62 billion dollars or 46.9 percent of
China's total foreign trade volume in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also attribute the progress in foreign trade to the
reform of China's structure which enables it to be more compatible
with international trade norms.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reform started with the highly centralized and
monopolized foreign trade system. Major efforts include
decentralization of management rights, introduction of a
contractual responsibility system, and granting of independent
foreign trade rights to enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 14,000 state-run enterprises -- including 300
scientific research institutes -- are engaged in foreign trade, as
compared with only dozens prior to the reform.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also note that the expansion in external relations and
a rise in international status also helped create a favorable
international environment for China to boost its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and its neighboring countries are at
their best; economic and trade ties with developed countries are
growing; progress has been made in efforts for China's re-entry
into the WTO. In addition, new headways have been made in
enhancing multilateral economic cooperation with relevant agencies
of the United Nations, as well as in providing technical
assistance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to expand into the international markets and
its strategy to pluralize the export markets have also paid
off. To date, China has established economic and trade relations
with more than 220 countries and regions, and opened more than 200
trading institutions overseas.
</P>
<P>
China has been actively involved with major traders of the
world, with relevant trade volume hitting 272.16 billion dollars
in 1997 or 83.7 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Besides progress recorded in traditional markets in Asia,
Europe and North America, China has increased its exports to Latin
America, Africa, and Oceania by over 47, 24 and 22 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's export structure has also improved markedly, with
manufactured goods making up the bulk of exports.

<HEADLINE> Oriental Plaza Project Speeded Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong investors have
stepped up the pace of construction of their largest project in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Workers on the Oriental Plaza project here set a national
construction record over the weekend by pouring 10,445 cu m of
concrete within 24 hours from 8 a.m. February 21, according to a
project office spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
The previous record was less than 10,000 cu m, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Huixian Investment Company has poured 1.96
billion US dollars into the project, which is scheduled to be
completed in 1999 in time for the 50th anniversary of the founding
of New China.
</P>
<P>
The 24-story building, occupying an area of nearly 100,000 sq m
and with a floor space of over 870,000 sq m, will include shopping
malls, luxury flats, hotels and offices.
</P>
<P>
The giant complex stands on Wangfujing Street, the capital's
major shopping thoroughfare, and is near the Palace Museum and
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 workers with 300 pieces of construction machinery
had finished the foundation work by the end of November last year.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters spokesman estimated that the entire four-story
underground construction will be completed before June this year,
and the final landscaping and outbuilding work should be finished
by October 1999.
</P>
<P>
There has been some controversy over the project. The main
building's architectural style and construction scale caused some
disquiet among government bodies and experts.
</P>
<P>
The construction was also impeded for some time by a land lease
dispute between the investors and a McDonald's fast food franchise
on the street.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, archeologists found a large number of ancient
stoneware items, as well as animal fossils dating back 20,000
years at the construction site. The finds were removed and stored
temporarily in a museum in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The plaza's investors then decided to build a special
exhibition hall on the building's first floor and organize regular
cultural relics shows there.

<HEADLINE> Australia Welcomes China not to devaluate Yuan: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Monday China's decision not to devalue its
currency is "extremely welcome".
</P>
<P>
In a speech Monday night at a meeting of Australian exporters
on Asian financial crisis, the foreign minister said China had no
intention to devalue the yuan and was likely to escape the worst
of the current Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he had received assurances from Chinese Deputy
Premier Li Lanqing during a visit to Europe last month that there
was no intention to devalue the yuan.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is extremely welcome," he said. "Were China to
devalue, another round of regional depreciations might follow."
</P>
<P>
"This would set back further the restructuring going on in the
rest of East Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer also said supportive for China not to be drawn into a
currency spiral are four factors: China's strong external
position, its heavily managed exchange rate, the
non-convertibility of the yuan on the capital account, and the
fact that its financial system is not deeply integrated with the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said China could expect its exports to hold up well because
of its diverse range and competitive labor costs.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Long Yungtu, Chinese deputy minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, told reporters that Australian
exports would also be boosted by China's decision not to devalue
its currency.
</P>
<P>
"We're very determined that we are not going to devalue the
Chinese currency," said the deputy minister, who was here to
address the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"If we can maintain our exchange rate it will provide a lot of
confidence to the Chinese economy," he said, adding that if China
did devalue its currency, it might trigger another competitive
devaluation of the neighboring countries, that would make the
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy decision, because we know we have to pay some
price, that is, to reduce our competitiveness and slow down our
exports. That is a price we have to pay," he said.
</P>
<P>
Long said Asian financial crisis would slow down growth in
China's exports and cut its economic growth to about eight percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
But China is seeking to boost imports this year to help lower
its massive trade surplus, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Warmly Welcomes Annan's Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat termed Monday as "good
news" the signing of the agreement between U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and Iraq to avert an Iraqi-U.S. military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat said he was happy to
hear the good news from Baghdad, which he welcomed and really
appreciated. "It is a very successful step, we appreciate it very
much," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader called the agreement as "good start to
achieving real peace and to avoiding military activity."
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, Arafat voiced optimism about the breakthrough in
Annan's last-ditch efforts to avoid a possible U.S.-led military
strike against Iraq. Speaking after meeting with a German
parliamentary delegation, Arafat said he believed that "talks
would get rid of the threat of war."
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S.-Iraqi military standoff escalated in the past
weeks, Palestinians across the PNA-ruled areas have been holding
demonstrations in support to Iraq, which always led to violent
clashes with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Angry protesters were often seen burning Israeli and American
flags and chanting slogans calling on Iraq's firing Scud missiles
at Israel as it did in the 1991 Gulf War. A recent poll showed
that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians support Iraq in
its standoff with the U.S., and 80 percent of them support Iraq's
bombing of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accuse the U.S. of adopting double standards
in dealing with Iraq and Israel. They pointed out that while
the U.S. threatens to use force to pressure Iraq to honor
the U.N. Security Council resolutions, it has been reluctant to
pressure Israel to honor the U.N. resolutions calling for its
withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian land.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expresses Satisfaction With Baghdad Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt welcomes the agreement
reached Monday in Baghdad between Iraq and U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan on resolving the crisis over arms inspection in Iraq
peacefully, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is satisfied with the agreement between Baghdad and
Annan who represents international legitimacy," Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa told reporters upon news of the signing of the deal
having reached Cairo.
</P>
<P>
In statements he made at the Presidency Headquarters, Moussa
said the concluded agreement is one between Iraq and the
international legitimacy, something which Egypt has been calling
for.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement simply means that the interests of the world, the
region, the U.N. and the international legitimacy have been put into
consideration," said the Egyptian top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt has not yet been informed of the details of
the agreement, which was signed by Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have refused to divulge details of the agreement
before Annan takes back to the Security Council for discussion on
Tuesday. The council, which controls the inspection program, would
have the right to accept or reject it.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough to the crisis over U.N. arms inspection came
after rounds of intensive talks Annan has held with Iraqi
officials including President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad over the
past four days.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Baghdad on Friday in a last-ditch attempt to
seek Iraqi implementation of U.N. resolutions and avert imminent
U.S. military punishment of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has insisted on free access to all sites
in Iraq to determine its compliance with U.N. resolutions that
demand the destruction of all long-range missiles and mass
destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., a permanent member of the Council, has insisted that
any agreement must allow unrestricted access to all sites and the
integrity of the U.N. Special Commission charged of scrapping
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.

BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan left here at 2:15 p.m. local time (1115 GMT) after
successfully concluded a deal with Iraq to bring the four and a
half month old weapons inspection crisis to a peaceful end.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off at the Saddam International Airport by Iraqi
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, other senior Iraq officials and

The U.N. chief arrived here Friday afternoon in a "last-ditch"

against Iraq to force its opening up of all suspected weapons
sites to inspection.

<P>
In what the Iraqs called a "historical" visit, Annan held five
rounds of "difficult" talks with Aziz and a three-hour meeting
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He successfully persuaded the Iraqi leadership to comply with
U.N. resolutions and grant U.N. inspectors free and full access to
all sites without time limits.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraqi agreement, which Annan said he believed
"acceptable to all the 15 members of the Security Council," will

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cautiously welcomed
Monday the agreement reached between United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi government that could
avert a possible U.S.-led strike.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a meeting of the
Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the preliminary reports he
heard is that Iraq has accepted free and unfettered access to
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the agreement is good news as long
as there's no "complicating details" within it.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Netanyahu came under strong criticism for
causing unnecessary panic among the public in the past weeks.
But he defended the government's behavior, saying the government
had acted properly and Israel's defense capability was not
harmed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan refused to make
comments on Annan's agreement, saying he will only do so until
the details are released. But he stressed that the accord has
left Israel no safer, adding it is always preferable to solve
the crisis diplomatically provided Iraq is denied the ability to
threaten its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said the agreement
is good news for Israel, while suggesting the United States
military presence remain in the region to monitor the future
developments.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, Israel has been nervously following the
developments in the Persian Gulf as the military
Iraqi-U.S. standoff continued escalating. While hoping the
U.S. could eradicate Iraq's ability to develop weapons of mass
destruction which threaten Israeli safety, Israel feared that
Iraq could retaliate the U.S. military actions by firing
biological and chemical weapons at Israel.

<HEADLINE> Cashew Nut Production Drops in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's cashew nut
production in the season from last October to January was 50,000
tons, a 30 percent drop from the 65,000 tons in the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
This was released at the cashew nut seminar held recently at
Northern Mozambique's Nampula city, the local press reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from bad weather, the lack of financial support in the
small-and-medium sized plantations is the reason for its output
decline.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for the decrease in cashew nut production were
listed as the blazing of grass on and around nut plantations,
aging trees and the uncurbed pest disaster.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has taken measures to stop the raw nut
from going out of Mozambique, nut plants in the country still
find it hard to get enough raw materials for processing.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, once the number one cashew nut producer in the
world, turned out 150,000 tons of cashew nut in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Monday warned that the
danger of an attack on Iraq is still in place even though the
United Nations and Iraq have signed an agreement on the arms
inspections, the Jordan Television reported.
</P>
<P>
"The chances for a military strike are becoming less but we
should be more careful within these hours because those who seek
the military action will continue their efforts until the last
minute," Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Jawad Anani said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that people who are against military attack on
Iraq by the United States should not relax their vigilance until
the possibility fades away.
</P>
<P>
After two-day intensive talks, the U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan signed the agreement on Sunday with the Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz to solve the arms inspections crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. has said it will not decide whether to endorse the
agreement until after making a careful study.
</P>
<P>
Anani hailed the flexibility shown by Iraq in the efforts to
achieve the diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We in Jordan feel relieved because we have exerted enough
efforts to avoid military action against Iraq," he added.

BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China became the 10th largest
trader in the world in 1997 as its foreign trade grew for the 15th
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Total trade volume rose 12.1 percent in 1997 to hit 325.06
billion U.S. dollars, much higher than the world's average of 7
percent as estimated by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Improved level of China's opening-up, deepening of economic
reforms, restructuring of the foreign trade system and
pluralization of international market are among major factors
behind sustained foreign trade growth, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
China initiated the opening-up and economic reform programs in
1979, and further embarked on the track of a socialist market
economy since the early 1990s. The enormous change as represented
by an open economy and export orientation not only helped enhance
China's competitive edge in foreign trade, but also enabled the
country to gradually integrate itself into the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China's status in world trade rose
constantly. China ranked 32nd in 1978 with 20.6 billion dollars,
or 0.78 percent of the world's total. The ranking improved to 15th
in 1991, 11th in 1992 and 10th in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Expanded exports built a solid foundation for China's foreign
trade. According to Li Yushi, a research fellow with the Economic
and Trade Research Institute of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), China's exports exceeded the
world's average by 9 percentage points during 1979-1995. Its
export volume accounted for 2.96 percent of the world's total in
1995, as against 0.75 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"It's no doubt that foreign trade, especially exports,
constitutes a motivating factor in helping China's economy develop
in a fast, sustainable and healthy manner," says Li.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A museum in memory of the late
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao is to open
in north China's Tianjin City this month.
</P>
<P>
Zhou and his wife joined in the revolution in Tianjin
early this century, and they regarded the city as their second
hometown. According to their wills, their ashes were thrown into
the Haihe River in the city.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of six heactares in Tianjin's main park, the
museum has a floor space of 7,150 sq m and contains nine halls, of
which one is used to display the lives of the couple, one
to contain books and letters they wrote, one to contain artistic
treasures connected with them, a video hall, a multifunction hall
and a research center.
</P>
<P>
The museum has collected about 8,000 historical objects and
relics connected with Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao, who was once
chairwoman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the museum started in December, 1996. So
far, more than 12 million yuan has been donated by people both at
home and abroad for its construction.

<HEADLINE> High Regular Macroeconomic Forecast System Launched in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A High Frequency
Macroeconomic Forecasting System to gauge and analyze Hong Kong's
economic movements was launched here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-year project, funded by the Better Hong Kong
Foundation, will be developed by a team of three economists from
the APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong in
collaboration with Nobel Laureate in Economics, Professor Lawrence
R. Klein of the University of Pennsylvania, United States.
</P>
<P>
Richard Wong, director of the APEC Study Center, said at a
press conference here Monday that the objectives of developing the
new system are to provide good forecasts of Hong Kong's
macro-economic performance, evaluate the quantitative effects of
different economic policies and enhance public understanding of
economic affairs and improve economic policy performance.
</P>
<P>
The Macroeconomic system is characterized by its depth and the
high volume of data including price movements, imports and
exports, investments, consumption, interest rates, Gross Domestic
product, inflation, taxation, public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's economy is heavily influenced by the Chinese
mainland, so data from the Chinese mainland's economy will also be
incorporated into the model, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed by the end of this year
with the first forecast result released in March next year. Due to
the ever-changing economic environment, the system will be updated
continuously with later forecast results issued on a quarterly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Professor Klein who arrived in Hong Kong Sunday evening briefed
 the media on the High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecasting System
at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1980
because of his founding and building of Macroeconomic forecasting
models.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Foreign Ministry Defends Position on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Department of Foreign Affairs Monday rejected criticism of the
opposition National Party over Taiwan issues.
</P>
<P>
The National Party's criticism of Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo's instructions to government ministers and officials on South
Africa's relations with Taiwan was "somewhat disingenuous",
Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni said.
</P>
<P>
The severance of relations with Taiwan in favor of ties with
the People's Republic of China had certain practical
implications, Boni said.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa officially established diplomatic
relations on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique signed on December 30, 1997, South
Africa "recognizes that there is but one China in the world, the
Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government representing the whole of China and recognizes China's
position that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China".
</P>
<P>
Nzo reportedly had written a letter calling on his cabinet
colleagues and government officials not to attend functions of
the Taipei Liaison Offices if members of the public were also
present.
</P>
<P>
Boni stressed that South Africa's position was in line with
international law and state practice.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is the practice followed by no less than 159
countries and the reaction of a political party is somewhat
disingenuous because they ought to know that it is incumbent on
the minister to advise government on this new relations."
</P>
<P>
The National Party at the weekend criticized the ruling
African National Congress government (ANC), saying the ANC was
conducting a disgraceful vendetta against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It claimed in a statement that Nzo's letter "nullifies
President Mandela's pious promise that South Africa would
continue with the highest level of relations with Taiwan after
the recent breaking of official ties."
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela pledged at the end of last December that his
government would never resume its official ties with Taiwan after
the normalization of Pretoria-Beijing relations.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Changes Ministry Permanent Secretaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
changed the permanent secretaries in half of the ministries in a
bid to improve the efficiency of the functionaries, diplomatic
sources told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the permanent secretaries in 17 of the 34
ministries were told last week to report to new ministries.
</P>
<P>
None of the permanent secretaries has lost his post as the
reshuffling exercise is only a series of transfers among
ministries, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The ministries affected are mostly those in charge of economic
activities, such as ministries of petroleum resources, commerce
and tourism, works and housing, and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The move came in the wake of the cabinet reorganization last
December, when 17 new ministers were appointed, 11 of the old
ministers transferred to other ministries and five others
maintained their positions.
</P>
<P>
Head of State General Sani Abacha has been concurrently
Minister of Defense since he came to the country's top seat in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet was reshuffled for better efficiency, according to
the government.
</P>
<P>
To further monitor the performance of ministries, Abacha
disclosed last week that special teams would be set up to verify
the judicious use of funds allocated to all ministries and
parastatals for capital projects in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The teams would complement the existing monitoring
arrangements to ensure that the nation gets value for the funds
provided for projects that have been designed to improve the
living standards of Nigerians, Abacha said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998 budget, the Nigerian government will
allocate 143 billion Naira (about 1.79 billion U.S. Dollars) for
capital projects this year, compared to the recurrent allocation
of 117 billion Naira (1.46 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
This year will witness the termination of Abacha's military
regime which came to power in 1993 and has repeated its
commitment to a hand-overls since a three-year transition to
civil rule program ending October this yea wasannoenced.
</P>
<P>
Thnation's economy has been improving under the government's
macro-control measures over the past few years. However, the poor
living standards of Nigerians have remained almost unchanged.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons, to many observers, goes to the corruption
in the government functionaries.

ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) --President Rafiq Tarar said
here Monday Pakistan is directly affected by internecine conflict
in Afghanistan and "it is our earnest hope that peace should be
restored in that country."
</P>
<P>
Efforts of the Pakistani government, the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) and the United Nations to persuade
various Afghan groups to resolve their disputes through
negotiations must be appreciated, Tarar said while addressing the
joint sitting of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's relations with China, the President said that
Pak-China relations have always stood the test of the time. Mutual

</P>
<P>
He also said on the occasion that Pakistan is also
consolidating its relations with Russia, and "attention is being

</P>
<P>
Relations with the United States have an important place in
Pakistan's foreign policy, said Tarar, adding that during its
recent contacts with the American leadership, Pakistan stressed
the need for an equitable policy instead of the one-agenda nuclear
non-proliferation stand on their part.
</P>
<P>
Because of its national security requirements, and extremely
strong historical, cultural and religious affinities, Pakistan
enjoys a very close relationship with Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and other Islamic states, said the President.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always played an active role in promoting the
interests of Muslim world, Tarar said, adding that the present
government is working on many projects in the economic sectors and
expressed the hope that this cooperative relationship will
continue with the same spirit.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, gives utmost importance to the newly
independent central Asian states and is assisting them in everyway
to bring about political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
On the latest Gulf situation, Tarar said that "the escalating
tension in the gulf region is a cause of concern for Pakistan".
"Pakistan has always opposed aggression or the use of force for
settling disputes," he added.

"We are hopeful that a peaceful solution to the Iraqi issue
will be found and Pakistan's position is well known", said Tarar.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Attaches Importance to Education, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The General Secretary of the
Vietnamese Communist Party said that his party and the government
defined education and training as a strategic task in the national
development, the Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The recent years saw a constant increase in pupil and student
enrollments at all educational levels in Vietnam, General Secretary
Le Kha Phieu said during a working session with the Ministry of
Education and Training here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that there remain problems relating to
poor education quality which should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Phieu noted that national identities should be further promoted
when the nation is being modernized and integrated into the region
and the world.
</P>
<P>
The party leader stressed that respecting teachers means making
every possible effort to improve their living conditions in a
way to attract more talented people to choose this career.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, in its socio-economic development strategy, has set a
target of having 22-25 percent of the work-force trained by the
year 2000. However, the goal is difficult to achieve because of
the poor performance of vocational training schools and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there has been a shortage of teaching staff at
schools and of a contingent of successors for universities and
higher educational establishments.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Urges Government to Curb Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq
Tarar Monday urged the government to take "immediate and
effective" steps to curb the menace of terrorism and improve law
and order situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his maiden address to the joint sitting of the parliament
here, Tarar, who was elected President last December, said that
despite signs of improvement in law and order, incidents of
sectarianism and terrorism continue to occur.
</P>
<P>
"The government should take immediate and effective steps to
eliminate terrorism," he said. "It will convey a clear message to
the culprits that they could not make hostage the entire nation."
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, he said, the most serious problem facing
the country is its "bad financial and economic condition", adding
that every Pakistani is under debt of 1,600 rupees (about 35 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed his satisfaction over the present
government's reforms and policies covering industry, agriculture,
payment of foreign debt, investment and so on.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the President pointed out that improvement of social
conditions and consolidation of the political and social systems
can only be successful within the framework of an impregnable
defense system.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Attributes Karachi Killings to Foreign Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif on Monday attributed foreign hand in the killing of
two Iranians in the southern port city of Karachi last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have the initial information about the hidden hands behind
the recent terroristic incidents," the Prime Minister told
journalists here soon after the address by President Rafiq Tarar
to the joint sitting of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the killings of four Iranians last September and
four Americans last November and the latest killing of two
Iranians, Sharif said that "we are deeply concerned and feel sorry
over the loss of life in these sad incidents."
</P>
<P>
"But we have information that not only some Pakistanis, but
also foreign hands are involved in these acts of terrorism in
different parts of the country," the Prime Minister added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the walkout by Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)
during the address by President Tarar in Parliament Monday, Sharif
said, it was about Sunday's killing of eight people in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
"But the matter could have been settled by sitting around the
table and I don't think there was any need to stage a walkout,"
said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The allies can always have a talk and the issues could have
been discussed between us," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, when talking about the walkout by the major
opposition, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), during the address by
the President, Sharif said that "nothing can be said about it, it
was entirely different from the MQM issue."
</P>
<P>
He termed the attitude of PPP towards the President as
"negative". "I fail to understand the reason behind it," said the
Prime Minister.

still sound.
</P>
<P>
Chuan made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the United
Nations Economic and Social Commission in Asia and the Pacific

making every effort to strengthen the economic fundamentals of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The significant achievements
and economic fundamentals of Asia should be kept in sight despite
the recent financial turmoil there, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a letter Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the meeting of ministers of industry and
technology sponsored by The United Nation's Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Annan said it is
essential to consider Asia's significant achievements and the
fundamentals that made them possible, when analyzing the crisis
and possible remedies.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies have long displayed an impressive commitment to
building up capacity in industrial and technological fields, Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and technological fundamentals leave the region
"well-placed" to sustain momentum for development and progress, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the current financial crisis will not
undermine the fundamental strengths of Asian industry and
technology, nor deter Asia from its path of long-term growth and
development," the world body leader said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that the U.N. system will continue to cooperate
with Asian countries.

</P>
<P>
The president noted that a military solution to the crisis
could be extremely dangerous especially because "Iraq may have
some chemical weapons."

<HEADLINE> Large Antimony Deposit Discovered in Southwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have found
a large antimony reserve of 123,000 tons in southwest China's
Guizhou Province after two years of prospecting.
</P>
<P>
The newly found reserve sits at the juncture of three
counties: Rongjiang, Sandu and Leishan. The grade of the antimony
ore is 11.7 percent. The mineral deposits are densely distributed,
with the antimony ore found in 38 locations. The antimony ore is
shallowly buried at an average depth of 700 meters with the ore
body 566 meters long.
</P>
<P>
Geologists say the age of the reserve is about 496-to-614 million
years and the mineralized antimony comes from deep magma.
</P>
<P>
The exploration of the antimony resources will help improve living
standards and the cultural life of local residents, said local

<HEADLINE> Currency Crisis Renders 19,000 Philippine Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 19,000 workers had
become unemployed from January 1 to February 6 this year due to
the economic slow-down as a result of the currency crisis raging
in the region, the Department of Labor and Employment said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the department, 18,864 workers
had been displaced during the period because of the retrenchment
and closure of 477 firms all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said 9,335 of the newly unemployed lost their jobs
permanently while 8,772 were laid off temporarily. The rest of the
workers had their working hours reduced.
</P>
<P>
The top three causes of workers' unemployment were market
slump, high cost of production and lack of capital, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Metro Manila, or the national capital region, accounted for 52
percent of the jobless.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, particularly in food, wearing apparel
and textile manufacturing, had the biggest number of displaced
workers.
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders earlier warned that tens of thousands of workers
would lose their jobs in 1998 as many companies would have to
close down or downsize their business due to the currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Urged to Be More Committed to Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday called on the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrialized countries to be more committed to liberalizing
trading practices with the region in line with their policy
pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
All G-7 members must be more committed in terms of liberalizing
trade and seen to be "conspicuously present" because they also
reap a lot of advantages and benefits from the region, he said
after opening an international seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the call by Japan's partners in the G-7 to pull its
economy into shape and help Asia recover from its economic
problems, Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said that focusing
purely on the need for Japan to take the necessary measures is not
quite adequate. The roles played by other G-7 members like the
United States must also be looked into, he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 finance ministers and central bank's governors held
talks over the weekend aimed at easing the Asian economic problem
and enhancing progress in global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The G-7 commitment certainly is a departure from their earlier
inaction, but I would certainly like to see more determined
efforts by them to promote regional and international trade,
consistent with their policy pronouncements all these years,"
Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also urged donor countries and agencies to take into
account the integrity of recipient states when insisting on the
latter's compliance with conditions attached to their aid.
</P>
<P>
It is crucial that donor countries take cognizance of this
factor so as to enable a recipient country consolidate its system
while preserving the right of its people to chart their destiny,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is for that reason Malaysia has declined bail-out offers
from international agencies to help steer it out the present
economic woes, he said, adding instead Malaysia opted for
consultations and negotiations on measures implementable in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"In fact we have effected several reforms and adjustments based
on talks and negotiations with the IMF. But we've stressed that
we're the ones who'll make the decisions," he said.

PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- All signs were positive by Sunday evening that the
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan's ``impossible
mission'' to Baghdad will be a success to avoid a U.S. bombing of
Iraq. But the United States remains reserved over the perspective
of an agreement, which will be submitted to the U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday. The talks between Annan and Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein were focused on the inspection of Iraq's
presidential sites, which triggered a military mobilization by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with the Liberation, Burundian President
Pierre Buyoya said that the maintenance of economic embargo on his
country by eight African states at a regional summit on Kampala was
the sign of frustration of ``certain personalities of the
sub-region'' in which Burundi is located. ``My arrival in power went
against some very advanced projects of intervention in Burundi when
it was in full chaos,'' said Buyoya, who came to power in a
bloodless coup 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The hope for saving peace prevailed Sunday evening in Baghdad,
following a three-hour meeting between United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who reached
an agreement on inspection of presidential sites. But the United
States said that even in case of an agreement, the U.S. troops will
remain in the Gulf region for a necessary period of time to verify
that Iraq allow U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll by the BVA polling institute for Le
Figaro, 55 percent of French people think that the objective of a
military intervention against Iraq should be ``eliminate Saddam.''
Sixty percent said that Iraq makes up a big threat to the world, but
55 percent said that France should remain ``totally neutral'' in
case of an American military intervention.

<HEADLINE> Israel Intends to Find Measures of Stimulating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is to hold discussions with business leaders in
the coming days on measures to stimulate economic growth, the
Jerusalem Post daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman, Governor of Bank of Israel
Jacob Frenkel, leader of Histadrut (Trade Union) Amir Peretz,
President of the Israeli Manufacturers' Association Dan Propper
will attend the discussion, according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the discussions, Netanyahu, Neeman and several
industrialists held a meeting last Friday on the macro-economic
situations, in which the economic slowdown continues due to
massive budgetary cuts and belt-tighting monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they reached an agreement that emergency
measures should be taken immediately to boost economic activities
and check the slowdown, Netanyahu's economic adviser Ofir Akoonis
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Netanyahu has believed that the key to economic
recovery is to increase investments in infrastructure projects,
which include road-building and improvement plans, advances of
telecommunication, high-tech education programs and construction
of industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
Industrialists have been pressuring the government to lower
interest rates to bolster exports, and Bank of Israel is to
announce the key lending rate for March on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank reportedly remains committed to tight
monetary policy, citing that the economy will benefit from low
inflation rate and economic liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Since the Likud-led coalition came to power in 1996, Israel's
annual economic growth has continued slowing down from an average
rate of 6.5 percent in the past decade to 4 percent in 1996 and
about 2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was caused by Israel's measures to accelerate
privatization, cut budget deficit and reduce inflation rate, which
have been aimed at achieving economic independence.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of industrialists, the Israeli government
seems to be easing its belt-tighting monetary policies, which may
yield a moderate economic recovery with an estimated growth of 3
percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Eulogizes Zhou Enlai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) --- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
delivered a major speech earlier today to mark the 100th birthday
anniversary of late Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Jiang lauded Zhou as a leader of both the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and State.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Zhou Enlai was a great Marxist, a principal leading
official of the Party and State, one of the founders of the
People's Liberation Army, and great proletarian revolutionary,
statesman, military strategist and diplomat, said Jiang during a
grand gathering to mark Zhou's centennial birthday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that Zhou's glorious life, brilliant achievements
for the liberation of Chinese people and the cause of socialism,
as well as his lofty spirit and personality, stand like a monument
in the history of the nation and are deeply engraved in the
memories of people of all ethic groups in China.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Zhou was born late in the 19th century during a period
in which the nation struggled in an abyss of misery against a
background of domestic turmoil and foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was born in 1898 at a time when German forces occupied
Jiaozhou Bay, Russian troops held Lushun and Dalian by force,
France controlled Guangzhou Bay, and Great Britain held Weihai,
Kowloon and the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was only three years old when the Eight-Power Allied
Forces waged an attack against China and occupied Beijing, the
Chinese capital, for over a year. The nation was subjected to
grave humiliation and China was virtually on the verge of
extinction. Even as a child, Comrade Zhou Enlai was determined to
save the nation and dedicated himself to study.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of the Democratic
Revolution, and a group of other noted Chinese citizens engaged in
exploration and the struggle to save the nation and people. Each
and everyone of the individuals contributed greatly and now enjoy
their due place in history.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation paid a great cost, but was nonetheless faced
with an abyss of misery.

In 1917, Zhou traveled to Japan in search of a new road. He
suggested the use of "new thought", the pursuit of "new knowledge"
and doing "new things". "China is hopeful that all people will
keep the word 'New' firmly in mind," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was introduced to Marxism and Lennism after the outbreak
of the Russian October Revolution.
</P>
<P>
He returned from Japan in April 1919, and shortly thereafter
joined the May 4th Movement. He was arrested by the reactionary
government in January of 1920, and throughout his imprisonment
continued to ponder the issue of China's future. He travelled to
Europe for a work-study program following his release from prison,
and during the period engaged in numerous practical investigations
and compared various trends of thought which eventually led to his
strong convictions concerning Communism.
</P>
<P>
Zhou joined a Communist group in Paris in 1921, and thereafter
participated in activities to found the Communist Party of China.

Comrade Zhou returned from France and immediately immersed
himself in the tumultuous Great Revolution in China
(1924-1927). He lived in Guangdong and served as the director of
the Political Department of the Huangpu (Whampoa) Military
Academy, as well as head of the Military Department under the CPC
Guangdong Regional Committee. Zhou was one of the first Party
leaders to realize the importance of armed struggle and military
readiness.
</P>
<P>
The political work system he established provided an entirely
new look for the National Revolutionary Army, a fact which played
a vital role in guaranteeing victory during the two Eastern
Expeditions and the Northern Expedition. The people's army founded
by the Communist Party carried forward the system during the long
period of revolutionary wars.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Zhou served as a member of the Interim Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and
secretary of the CPC Front Committee and led the Nanchang Uprising
following the end of the Great Revolution in 1927. The Uprising
marked the Party's first armed resistance against Kuomintang
reactionaries and heralded the birth of the people's army under
the Party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was virtually in charge of the major work of the Party
Central Committee for a period of nearly two years following the
CPC's Sixth National Congress. Zhou defied extremely dangerous
and adverse circumstances by using his wit and courage to defend
the Party's central departments and protect a large number of
leading Party officials. He contributed greatly to masterminding
the Party's secret work then in the Kuomintang-controlled areas,
directed armed struggles throughout the nation and expanded the
Red Army force and revolutionary bases in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1931, Zhou travelled from Shanghai to the Central
Revolutionary Base in Jiangxi Province and served successively as
secretary of the CPC Central Bureau in the Soviet Areas, general
political commissar of the First Front Army, general political
commissar of the Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army, and
vice-chairman of the Central Revolutionary Military Committee. He
joined Comrade Zhu De in commanding the Fourth Counteroffensive
Campaign, a successful campaign which set a precedent for
ambushing and eliminating enemy forces.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the ill-advised guidance of "Leftist"
adventurism in the Autumn of 1934, the Central Red Army lost the
Fifth Counteroffensive Campaign and was forced to embark on the
epic Long March. The Chinese Revolution once again reached a
critical stage.
</P>
<P>
Zhou and a contingent of other comrades attempted to overcome
the grave situation by fully supporting calls to convene the Zunyi
Meeting. The forum enabled Zhou to effectively advocate the
correct ideas of Comrade Mao Zedong. The meeting established
Comrade Mao Zedong's leading role in the Red Army and the Party
Central Committee, and thereby ushered in a significant and
historic turn in the Chinese Revolution.

Jiang noted the Comrade Zhou's most important task in handling
state affairs was to organize and lead the national economic
construction. He quoted Zhou as saying that "changing the image of
a state should proceed from changing the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The most important aspect centers on a united effort to improve
our country's productive forces".
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed to the early years following the founding of New
China and noted that Zhou and Comrade Chen Yun shouldered arduous
tasks related to normalizing economic construction and reversing
the crumbling financial and economic situation inherited from KMT
government. War erupted in Korea, with Zhou assisting Mao Zedong
in organizing and commanding the War to Resist the U.S. Aggression
and Aid Korea. He also extended great efforts to harness the
Huaihe River, a perennial source of serious flooding and rebuild
the nation's railway system.
</P>
<P>
Zhou joined comrades Chen Yun, Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo in
formulating and implementing the First Five-year Plan
(1953-1957). The leaders also visited Moscow on several occassions
and inked agreements with the former Soviet Union for the
development of 156 key projects in China. Construction of the key
projects and several hundred related projects laid down the basic
foundation for realizing China's socialist industrialization, said
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
China faced grave economic difficulties following the "Great
Leap Forward", according to Jiang. He noted that the painstaking
efforts of Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi, Chen Yun and Deng Xiaoping
led to an economic upturn based on firmly adhering to Mao Zedong's
Eight-Word Principle focusing on readjustment, filling out,
consolidation and improvement.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that Zhou and a number of other comrades, including
Li Xiannian paid close attention to economic work in order to
quell all disturbances resulting from the tumultuous "Cultural
Revolution" (1966-76). Despite being seriously ill, Zhou fully
supported Deng Xiaoping's efforts to straighten out the economy
and promote work in wide-ranging areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhou not only participated in advancing the lofty targets of
the Four Modernizations (agriculture, industry, national defence,
and science and technology), but also meticulously organized and
drafted plans for implementing related programs. The late premier
exhibited special concern for the construction of water
conservancy projects which he recognized as the lifeline of
agriculture, as well as the growth of most advanced science and
technology which has an important bearing on the process of
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that China lacked the capacity to produce
automobiles during the early years following the founding of New
China. However, after the early 1960s, China successfully
developed atomic and hydrogen bombs, as well as satellites. The
Chinese President spoke highly of Zhou's outstanding contributions
to the monumental success in related areas.

Comrade Zhou Enlai was a model leader who valued science and
technology, and respected intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
"Science is a decisive factor directly related to our nation's
defence, economy and culture," said Zhou. "Science and technology
are the keys for realizing the modernization of science and
technology, agriculture, industry and national defence, as well as
for building the motherland into a strong socialist country."
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun and Nie Rongzhen carefully
considered Mao Zedong's opinions when drafting and executing the
12-Year Plan for the Development of Science and Technology
(1956-1967).
</P>
<P>
This long-term plan, which was basically fulfilled five years
ahead of scheduled in 1962, effectively solved a number of major
scientific and technological issues existing in China's economy
and national defence development. The successful effort also
significantly narrowed the gap between China's scientific and
technological levels and advanced international standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai also led efforts to draft the scientific and
technological development plan for 1963-1972. Implementation of
the plan yielded a number of notable achievements, despite
impediments arising during the "Cultural Revolution".
</P>
<P>
Comrade Zhou Enlai stressed that building socialism "must rely
on the active participation of intellectuals, and the labor of the
working class". He also noted that talented professionals
represented a "decisive factor".
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai not only introduced a series of policies and
measures, but also engaged in a meticulous efforts to fully
promote the active role of intellectuals in socialist
construction. Zhou increased the contingent of intellectuals, and
at the same time improved their ideological, political and
professional standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhou presented his "Report on the Issue of Intellectuals" to a
meeting of the CPC Central Committee in January 1956. In March
1962, he presented a speech entitled "On the Issue of
Intellectuals" during a meeting in Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province. The latter speech reaffirmed that the
overwhelming majority of intellectuals belonged to the working
class. He noted that intellectuals were indeed working class
people, and expressed hope that they would continue to progress
along the path of being red and expert, namely the path of
socialism and professional proficiency.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's insightful theses regarding the issue of intellectuals
were warmly welcomed by officials and ordinary people both inside
and outside the Party. His words effectively aroused the
enthusiasm of intellectuals for participation in building up the
socialist motherland.

The late Premier tabled repeatedly important views concerning
the nature, tasks, principles and policies of education in New

implementation of an independent foreign policy of peace, guided
the campaign on eliminating the privileges of imperialists in
China, and ending the diplomatic policy of national betrayal and

large number of backbone Party officials, democratic personnel and
intellectuals during the extremely complicated and special
conditions characteristic of the "Cultural Revolution".
</P>

Between 1970-1971, Zhou joined Mao Zedong in quelling the
conspiracy Lin Biao and the anti-revolutionary clique launched to
usurp the supreme Party leadership and state power. Following the
"September 13th Incident", Zhou presided over the routine daily
work of the CPC Central Committee and guided a favorable turn in
all aspects of related work. Zhou persisted in exhibiting his
tenacity despite suffering from cancer. He joined comrades Deng
Xiaoping, Ye Jianying and Li Xiannian in the firm struggle against
the counter-revolutionary clique led by Jiang Qing.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil of the "Cultural Revolution" failed to shake the
foundation of China's socialist system. Our country has remained
united and is exerting ever greater influence throughout the
world. The features of the Party, the political power of the
people, the People's Liberation Army and society as a whole have
remained intact. The national economy has continued to advance
despite the burdens of heavy losses, with steady growth in grain
production and major achievements scored in industry,
transportation and the construction of infrastructure and in
science and technology. China has also witnessed new situation in

Zhou began his illustrious career as a leading member of the
CPC Central Committee in 1927 and held important leading posts
with both the Party and government after the founding of the
People's Republic of China. He played a monumental role in a
series of key events during China's New Democratic Revolution and
socialist construction. Zhou participated in formulating,
organizing and implementing major policies during every historical

century of struggle represented the epitome of the CPC's history,
and indeed the history of New China from its birth, period of
maturation and acquisition of high international prestige.

<P>
Zhou was highly proficient at integrating the basic principles
of Marxism with the concrete practices of the Chinese revolution
and construction, as well as at determining and summarizing the
people's creative historical experience of people, and absorbing
wisdom from the the nation's fine cultural heritage and world
civilization. Zhou attained theoretical breakthroughs in several

The spirit of Zhou Enlai integrates the lofty ideals of
Communism with down-to-earth work style. The late Premier spent
all his life fulfilling the pledge he made as a youngster: "I
won't alter my belief in Communism, and will resolutely publicize
its merits." He retained an unshakable belief and high-spirited
fighting will. Zhou never depressed or retreated when the
revolution encountered obstacles, nor when facing an
enemy. Neither did he exhibit an trace of cowardice when faced
with imperialist blockades and embargos, nor when faced with
disappointment resulting from difficulties created by natural
disaster and faulty decisions.
</P>
<P>
He always maintained a down-to-earth attitude and exhibited
perseverance when pursuing the right goals, especially at crucial
points in the course of events. Zhou called on others to do things
according to objective laws, opposed reaching for things beyond
one's grasp. He was highly successful at doing a solid job, as
well as coordinating goals and related activities, and engaging in
discussions and actual practice. He stressed "speaking
truthfulness, working with a down-to-earth attitude and achieving
efficient results". Zhou sought steady progress at a reasonable
speed and according to both needs and feasibility.
</P>
<P>
The spirit of Zhou Enlai also represents a combination of
responsibilities to superiors and responsibilities to
subordinates. He placed priority on the interests of the Party and
people. Zhou steadfastly followed Party policies and principles,
and served as role model for caring comrades and the masses. Zhou
served as the premier of the People's Republic of China and upheld
the leading position of Chairman Mao and Party leadership. He
regarded himself as a "chief servant" of the people, worked
diligently, and realized his pledge to serve people until his
death. The most obvious characteristic of Zhou's life centers on
hard work, both night and day.
</P>
<P>
He always keep people in his mind, worked hard, led a simple
life and honestly performed his official duties. He was intently
concerned about all aspects in the life of Chinese citizens. He
routinely exhibited his concern by visiting disaster-ridden areas,
regardless of whether the areas were affected by floolds or
earthquakes. Despite his own failing health, Zhou expressed
concern about a Yunnan tin miner suffering from lung cancer. The
more he achieved, the greater modesty his exhibited. Zhou was open
to varied views and selected good points. He was very strict on
himself and continued studying and seeked self-improvement until
his death. He exhibited great responsibility for his work, and
always treated people in a cordial manner.

The spirit of Zhou Enlai is the combination of principle with
flexibility. No matter if it was fighting with an enemy or coping
with contradictions among the people or within the Party, or if it
was in diplomacy or domestic affairs, Zhou was always good at
combining the firmness of principle and the flexibility of
strategy.
</P>
<P>
He said correct ideas could succeed only after much waiting and
many setbacks. And much painstaking and accurate work had to be
done before the truth could be specified and widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Zhou, quick-witted and considerate, was an expert in
dealing with complicated situations and urgencies.
</P>
<P>
He was adept in grasping the overall situation and taking every
aspect into account, incorporating hardness into softness and
entrusting arguments into feelings, which displayed the superb art
of leadership and lots of political experience.
</P>
<P>
The whole Party, the whole army, the people of all ethnic
groups, especially leading officials at all levels, should learn
the lofty spirit of Comrade Zhou Enlai, and incorporate that
spirit into their own thoughts and actions for accomplishments in
their respective posts.
</P>
<P>
Zhou liked to quote two verses from late Chairman Mao Zedong's
poem "Ode to the Plum Blossom":
</P>
<P>
"When the mountain flowers are in blossom,
</P>
<P>
She smiles among flowering shrubs."
</P>
<P>
The quotes reflected his profound feelings for the countless
martyrs who died heroic deaths before the success of the
revolutionary cause and his expectation of greater success of the
cause in the future.
</P>
<P>
Today, 22 years after his passing away, Comrade Zhou could take
comfort in the fact that New China is already successfully on the
correct road to building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
and has made tremendous achievements which have caught the
attention of the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, which opened in late 1978, Deng Xiaoping
Theory, the Party's basic line, which centers on economic
development and adheres to the Four Cardinal Principles and the
reform and opening-up policy, have charted the way for us.
</P>
<P>
In the just-ended year of 1997, the Chinese government smoothly
resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and wiped out
the humiliation of being occupied for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The successful convening of the National Congress of the 15th
CPC in September 1997 has mapped out the strategy of holding high
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and advancing the great
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Our cause is presently at the critical moment of carrying on
the past and opening a way for the future.
</P>
<P>
The eminent feats and great spirit of Comrade Zhou Enlai will
continue to encourage the whole Party and the people of all ethnic
groups in China to unite together and, under the leadership of the
the CPC Central Committee, strive for the goal of building China
into a prosperous, democratic and civilized socialist modern
country.

<HEADLINE> 1stWritethru: UN, Iraq Sign Deal Over Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan described his mission in Iraq as a "success" in striking a
deal Monday with the Iraqis which could avert a U.S. military
attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan signed the deal with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz here earlier, saying he is confident that "if we (U.N. and
Iraq) cooperate and what was signed is implemented," there will be
no more crisis or problem as what is witnessed now.
</P>
<P>
Telling a joint conference with Aziz, Annan termed the deal,
whose details were not disclosed so far, as "acceptable" and will
help remove obstacles in implementing the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement, reached after five round of "difficult"
talks with Aziz and a three-hour meeting with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, is in conformity with the resolutions of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the talks Iraqi leaders held with Annan have been
constructive, objective and frank, expressing the appreciation of
the type of discussion with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He said both sides have agreed on implementing U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz attributed the signing of the deal to the goodwill brought
by Annan, not the American and British military buildup in the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Iraq will continue cooperation with the
United Nations for implementing U.N. resolutions and for an early
lifting of the U.N. sanctions upon Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan said there is no time limit or deadline in the agreement
and the United Nations special commission will do its work "in a
reasonable period" of time.
</P>
<P>
He said he will present the deal to the Security Council and
until the council "is convinced we have a serious and credible
agreement, we hope that will settle" the four-and-a-half-month
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The standoff was triggered by Iraq's refusal to let
U.N. weapons inspectors into presidential sites suspected of
hiding biological and chemical weapons and weapon programs.
</P>
<P>
Annan said U.N. inspectors had had a difficult time in Iraq and
his visit will help build a "practical and effective" relationship
between the inspectors and the Iraqis and enhance their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq will work with the U.N. in good faith, in a
balanced manner and he believed the lifting of sanctions "will be
done soon."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, on the other hand, said the removal of
sanctions will be after "the completion of the work" of the
U.N. weapons inspectors and International Atomic Energy Agency. "I
hope ... we will be seeing light at the end of the tunnel," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Aziz did not disclose any details of the written
agreement, which Annan said the United States has "neither
rejected nor accepted."
</P>
<P>
"Any individual does not change the nature of an organization,"
Aziz said. He added that Iraq has succeeded in bringing up its
case and enabled everybody in the international community to
"reach the truth" and legitimate purposes of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Annan further expressed appreciation of the strenuous peace
efforts exerted by many world leaders and the good wishes for
diplomatic solutions by millions of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world, particularly Security Council
permanent members China, France, Russia, and Arab states strongly
support a political and diplomatic solution to the Iraqi
crisis. The United State and Britain, however, threatened the use
of force to wrest Iraqi compliance if diplomacy failed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., backed by Britain and a small number of allies, has
amassed nearly 30,000 troops, and fielded three aircraft-carriers,
400 sophisticated warplanes, dozens of warships and other smart
weapons in the region to thunder a "substantial and sustained"
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz pointed out that the current crisis Iraq has is not with
the United Nations but with the United States, which "wants to
impose its will" on others.
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at London's role in the current crisis,
saying history shows Britain hardly kept its promises to the
Arabs. Britain is regarded as the firmest supporter of the
U.S. threat to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived here Friday evening in a "last-ditch"
effort to persuade Iraq to open up all suspected sites to
U.N. inspection and avert an imminent U.S. military threat.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Told not to Grow Bhang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Kenya Wildlife Service
(KWS) official has urged the government to tighten controls and
discourage the planting of bhang, saying a bhang plantation has
been discovered in the forest.
</P>
<P>
The independent Daily Nation newspaper Monday quoted Tom Amisi
as saying that the 600 acres of plantation was found in forest by
the Mount Kenya, some 200 km northeast of the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Amisi's revelation comes at a time when Kenya has been
mentioned by the U.N. Drug Control Program as a major trafficking
and consumption point for opium and its by-product, hashish.
</P>
<P>
While heroin and cocaine have been recovered at the airports,
large hauls of hashish have been confiscated at the Mombasa port
and in rural areas around Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Drug-trafficking has thrived in this eastern African country
despite harsh penalties spelt out by a new regulation that
provides for life imprisonment and the confiscation of property
acquired through drug deal.
</P>
<P>
"The plantations are guarded by armed people who attack game
rangers who go to destroy the drug," Amisi said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed escalating violence and thuggery in the region
to bhang-smoking since there was a racket by drug-traffickers who
grew the drug in the forest.
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts by the KWS to destroy the drug proved futile
owing to the large area covered, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Control Over Imports of Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China has reined in the
once-serious phenomenon of import of harmful wastes, thanks to the
efforts made by the country's various inspection organs.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 these organs inspected a total of 5.66 million tons of
imported wastes, of which 99.59 percent proved harmless, according
to the latest statistics from the State Administration of
Inspection of Import and Export Commodities.
</P>
<P>
This was a rise of 2.09 percentage points over the previous
year. This means that only 0.41 percent of the total failed to
meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that imported scrap metal, paper and plastics,
which could be recycled, would reduce the country's shortage of
raw materials to some extent. But, they said, the import of
harmful wastes would cause environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Commodity inspection authorities at all levels have adopted 15
strict rules for the inspection of imported wastes, and ordered
traders to have their imports inspected at the first port of
arrival.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone China's overseas inspection organs checked 1.59
million tons of wastes, 117 shipments of which were discovered to
be harmful.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration admitted that the situation was not
satisfactory, and that some substandard waste materials have been
found at ports of Tianjin, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur
autonomous regions.

KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has deployed troops at

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses 7.5% GDP to Corrosion Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria loses 7.5 percent of
its Gross Domestic Product to corrosion every year, the Corrosion
Association of Nigeria (CAN) has said.
</P>
<P>
According to CAN National Coordinator Chief Dele Sanni, 90
percent of the country's infrastructure are based on metals that
are prone to corrosion.
</P>
<P>
The effects of corrosion is unquantifiable because it leads to
pollution whhch has hazardous consequences and above all, death,
Sanni noted.
</P>
<P>
He therefore urged the chief executives of industries to put
in place corrosion preventive measures since any environment that
is careless to corrosion stands to lose more in terms of
materials and resources.
</P>
<P>
Sanni said that Nigeria has, as of now, no accurate data on
corrosion because of the inflated figures that companies submit
to the Federal Office of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
But effort is underway for the association to fashion out a
model for getting accurate figures in cooperation with its
counterparts in the United States, France, Poland and South
Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Mozambique to Benefit from Maputo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and its
neighbor Mozambique will benefit a lot from a toll road, known as
the Maputo Corridor, local daily the Star quoted the South
African Transport Department as reporting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo Corridor was designed to link South Africa's
industrial heartland Gauteng Province, with what has become known
as the entrepreneur's dream, the capital of Mozambique, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Mozambique signed the agreement to this
effect in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The corridor will be the result of the upgrading and expansion
of the existing connection road which stretches some 440 km from
Gauteng Province to Maputo, with 350 km of it in South African
territory.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the most ambitious project being
developed in Southern Africa, which will offer a quicker and
safer road for motorists by 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this project presents both countries with numerous
benefits ... These benefits include a boost in exports and tourism, and
therefore the economy, because of the saving in distance, easier
access and convenience of a better and well-maintained road," the
Transport Department said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department officials said, the project would also
provide employment in both countries.
</P>
<P>
"Many Mozambicans will no longer need to come to South Africa to
seek work but will rather be employed within the borders of their own
country," they added.

BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Raise Producer Price of Sugarcane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Producer prices of Kenya
sugarcane will increase by 10 percent from 1,553 Shillings (25.8
U.S. Dollars) to 1,730 Shillings (28.8 Dollars) per ton from
March 1, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in four years that millers in this
eastern African country have agreed to raise prices, according to
growers.
</P>
<P>
The hike was agreed at a closed-door meeting of key players in
the beleaguered industry held in the western Kenyan city of
Kisumu on February 14, a following-up to the first on January 31.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting chaired by Kenya Sugar Authority's Chief
Executive Francis Chahonyo, farmers' representatives argued that
the old price of the crop had remained stagnant since 1994 when
it was last increased.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's sugar industry has undergone severe pressures in the
last few years ranging from dumping of uncustomed sugar, low
production at sugar factories in the western Kenya cane-growing
zone and alleged mismanagement of farmers' money by millers.
</P>
<P>
In a number of areas, farmers have stopped planting cane
altogether because low millers' crushing capacity meant that
their mature cane could not be harvested for as long as 36
months.
</P>
<P>
"When the sugar industry finally collapses, it will go down
with more than 40,000 jobs and the livelihoods of two million
Kenyans," the Sugar Growers' Association warned in a statement
last year.
</P>
<P>
A committee of farmers and millers under the auspices of the
Kenya Sugar Authority was formed to monitor and review cane and
sugar prices from time to time for the next six months beginning
February.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan described his mission in Iraq as a "success" in striking a
deal Monday with the Iraqis which could avert a U.S. military
attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan signed the deal with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz here earlier, saying he is confident that "if we (U.N. and
Iraq) cooperate and what was signed is implemented," there will be
no more crisis or problem as what is witnessed now.
</P>
<P>
Telling a joint conference with Aziz, Annan termed the deal,
whose details were not disclosed so far, as "acceptable" and will
help remove obstacles in implementing the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement is in conformity with the resolutions of
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the talks Iraqi leaders held with Annan have been
constructive, objective and frank expressing the appreciation of
the type of the discussion with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He said both sides have agreed on implementing
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz attributed the signing of the deal to the goodwill brought
by Annan, not the American and British military buildup in the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Iraq will continue cooperation with the United
Nations for implementing U.N. resolutions and for an early lifting
of the U.N. sanctions upon Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan said there is no time limit or deadline in the agreement
and the United Nations special commission will do its work "in a
reasonable period" of time.
</P>
<P>
He said he will present the deal to the Security Council and
until the council "is convinced we have a serious and credible
agreement, we hope that will settle the" crisis, and hopefully the
continuing American military buildup in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. inspectors had had a difficult time in Iraq and
his visit will help build a "practical and effective" relationship
between the inspectors and the Iraqs and enhance their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq will work with the U.N. in good faith, in a
balanced manner and he believed the lifting of sanctions "will be
done soon."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, on the other hand, said the removal of
sanctions will be after "the completion of the work" of the
U.N. weapons inspectors and International Atomic Energy Agency. "I
hope ... we will be seeing light at the end of the tunnel," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Aziz did not disclose any details of the written
agreement, which Annan said the United States has "neither
rejected nor accepted."
</P>
<P>
"Any individual does not change the nature of an organization,"
Aziz said. He added that Iraq has succeeded in bringing up its
case and enabled everybody in the international community to
"reach the truth" and legitimate purposes of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Annan further expressed appreciation of the strenuous peace
efforts exerted by many world leaders and the good wishes for
diplomatic solutions by millions of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Aziz pointed out that the current crisis Iraq has is not with
the United Nations but with the United States, which "wants to
impose its will" on others.
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at London's role in the current crisis,
saying history shows Britain hardly kept its promises to the
Arabs. Britain is regarded as the firmest supporter of the
U.S. threat to attack Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Christian Rebels to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Some top commanders of the
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group of Christian
fundamentalists, have planned to surrender, a former rebel said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeant James Okello said the commanders were tired of
fighting against the government but had not taken the last
decision because they had no assurance from the international
community, the government and the local people.
</P>
<P>
The rebel commanders "have no total trust on the government
and wanachi (people in local language) in particular," the former
rebel was quoted by The New Vision paper as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said some surrendered rebels have been killed
by local people due to their atrocities against them.
</P>
<P>
Okello was abducted in 1996 by the LRA rebels and was taken to
Sudan where he has been trained as a fighter. He said he has been
promoted to a sergeant for his active participation in fighting.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Joseph Kony, the top leader of LRA,
was pursued by government troops in the north. Vincent Otti, one
of the three main field commanders of LRA, was wounded in
fighthng. He cancaled some meetings with the other LRA rebel
commanders.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the north said the government has launched
an operation to search for remained rebels.
</P>
<P>
LRA, the main rebel group in the country, is a rebel group
with some 350 soldiers in its ranks acting in the north. Another
rebel group is the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) operating in
the west.
</P>
<P>
LRA had 2,000 soldiers, while ADF had 1,500 in their ranks
years ago before the government troops launched major offensives
against them last year.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Monday that no time limit has been set for the
completion of the U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq but they will
be completed "in a reasonable period."
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference after signing an agreement with
the Iraqi authorities on weapons inspections that the accord with
the government of Iraq is "balanced and in conformity with
Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He added the agreement was reached "in good faith" and hoped it
"will be acceptable to all members of the Council." The agreement
will "take us beyond crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he will not reveal the details of the
agreement until he returns to New York and reports to the Security
Council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said at the press
conference the deal was "an agreement of reason."
</P>
<P>
"The priority for the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government"
now is the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after the Gulf war in
1991. He hoped that the lifting of the sanctions will be very
soon.

<HEADLINE> Project Financing Has Good Prospects in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Market prospects for project
financing, an international practice to pool funds, look bright in
China in coming years, said a senior government official today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the State Planning Commission (SPC) Chen Jinhua
told an international seminar held here that China is set to
fulfill its targeted investment of 13 trillion yuan (1.5 trillion
U.S. dollars) during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, China has accomplished an investment
of nearly 5 trillion yuan and an additional 8 trillion yuan is
planned to be injected in the following three years, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will make necessary adjustments to its
investment structure to cope with the changing domestic and
international situations. Infrastructures, urban residential
housing and hi-tech industries have been pinpointed as key areas
for investment in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the investment package, Chen said, China will mainly
rely on its huge savings deposits and internal
accumulation. Active efforts will also be made to attract overseas
funds and diversify investment channels.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the seminar said that project financing is
still in its primary stage in China, and that practices in this
sector should be carried out strictly in line with relevant
regulations to avoid negative effects in the process of using
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggested that the Chinese government should create
a lasting and stable market environment for the development of
project financing.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the SPC detailed China's policy on
build-operate-transfer (BOT) practices and project financing, as
well as basic policies governing overseas participation in the
banking and insurance markets in China.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly sponsored by the SPC, the China-British
Trade Group and the British Invisibles, with more than 100 experts
and scholars from both China and overseas participating.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Efforts to Ease Employment Pressure (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China is making a new effort
to ease employment pressures and to maintain social stability at
the same time as the state sector trims its payrolls to improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to Labor Minister Li Boyong, in the next three years
the re-employment project, which has been operational nationwide,
will focus on:
</P>
<P>
-- Providing new jobs for laid-off workers in the state sector;
</P>
<P>
-- Opening up more channels for re-employment;
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing spending on re-employment projects by
establishing special funds;
</P>
<P>
-- Intensifying efforts to build labor markets and develop the
employment service sector;
</P>
<P>
-- Defining social security policies.
</P>
<P>
An analysis by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences indicates
that the country's labor force will increase by 12.63 million
people in 1998, mainly because of a birth peak in the
1960s-'70s. This will add pressure to an already inadequate labor
market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the labor market has also been cornered by an
increasing number of laid-off workers from state
enterprises. Unemployment and the increasing number of laid-off
workers are considered the biggest economic problem that is sure
to crop up in the process of China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out during a recent tour in
Tianjin that the re-employment project is of vital importance to
the success or failure of reforming the state-owned enterprises,
and demands more devotion from officials at all levels. The
central government has decided to bring the majority of the poorly
performing state sector out of difficulty within three years.
</P>
<P>
The solution to the problem lies in economic development. In
the near future, Minister Li Boyong said, collective and
non-state-owned economies, the service sector, and small
businesses will be the major areas to create job opportunities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Economists attribute the increasing numbers of laid-off workers
to an inevitable period of China's economic development, without
which the country could not enter into the market-oriented
economy, and the state enterprises could not adopt the
modern-enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
More laid-off workers are not caused by the reform drive
itself, economists say, but because of deep-seated contradictions
long accumulated in economic construction and management
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Various localities are taking steps to promote the
re-employment project. Beijing, for example, offered employment
for 137,000 people in 1997, with more than 60 percent of the
laid-off workers finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, plans to spend 50
million yuan to provide re-training for 100,000 laid-off workers
this year. Tianjin, the largest port city in north China, had
265,000 of its 320,000 laid-off workers re-employed last year,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 cities set up a bottom-line security system for
urbanites by the end of last year, sociologists said, adding that
the system will serve as the final safety net to ease social
conflicts, ensure smooth economic restructuring, and in
particular, speed up state enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a sound social security system as well as a
market-directed labor mechanism are needed to realize the
distribution of labor forces based on market demands, economists
say.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry has issued guiding principles for
employment, which include laborers finding jobs independently,
market regulation, and government assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, governments at various levels will no longer take care
of everything concerning employment. Instead, they will focus on
developing the economy, improving economic structures and
providing employment services to increase job opportunities as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Exploitation of Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its gas
production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by 2005 as part of
a major strategy to develop energy resources.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to verify additional onshore gas reserves of
1 trillion cubic meters by the end of the century, with the
cumulative total approaching 2 trillion cubic meters, accoding to
experts with the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) estimate .
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas-production capacity is estimated to
rise 10 billion cubic meters, with the cumulative total topping 25
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
CNPC president Zhou Yongkang forecasts major breakthroughs in
the expansion of proven gas reserves and production capacity in
the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, the Tarim Basin and Sichuan
province. The annual gas output should reach 30 billion cubic
meters by 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the country's gas production is of huge
potential. Through years of vigorous development, three
large-scale gas production areas have taken shape.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, total
gas reserves of 230 billion cubic meters have been verified. Total
gas reserves of 200 billion cubic meters have also been confirmed
in the eastern part of Sichuan, while in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region total gas reserves of 160 billion cubic meters
have been located, in addition to the discovery of a group of new
gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
province, a large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion
cubic meters has been identified.
</P>
<P>
Alongside domestic gas exploration, active efforts are underway
to utilize the gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project with planned construction of a long-distance
gas pipeline running through China and the Korean Peninsula to
Japan. The project could provide China with a gas supply of 25
billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia should deliver 25 billion cubic meters of gas
annually to China.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Decides to Ban National Day Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has decided to ban
the public festivities usually seen on the country's National Day
on February 25 and Liberation Day on 26, in view of the Iraqi
crisis over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
A director at the Interior Ministry, Bader Saleh, told
Al-Seyassah newspaper that the ministry would strictly ban any
march or car rally organized in any of the country's streets to
commemorate the occasions.
</P>
<P>
People usually pour into the streets to hold rallies, using
certain agents such as "foam spray" and other forms of
celebration means to mark the occasion every year into wee hours.
</P>
<P>
Saleh called on citizens and expatriates to contribute to
boosting the country's security, giving no opportunity to what he
described as Iraqi regime agents to destabilize national security.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have it that the Interior Ministry has evidence showing
Iraqi agents have infiltrated into Kuwait to do things
detrimental to the security and stability of the country which
now hosts 12 U.S. F-117A stealth fighter bombers and eight
British Tornado warplanes in preparation of a possible military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the last several days, Kuwait policemen have
intensified security patrol activities on the streets and all the
time, day and night, they are seen checking identity cards of
drivers on many roads.
</P>
<P>
A car belonging to the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation
Mission was robbed by unidentified persons last week.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said efforts of the Interior Ministry under the present
situation would be more profitably expended on the security issue
rather than concentrating on the traffic congestion that usually
accompanies rallies held to celebrate the national day.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Dutch Talks Held on Two-Way Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the
Netherlands will play an active role in solving the problem of the
European Union's (EU) imposition of anti-dumping on Chinese
products to ensure the sound and smooth development of China's
trade ties with the EU and with the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made here today by Chinese Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi during her talks with
visiting Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs G.J. Wijiers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Minister said that China is pleased to see that
the EU commission recently put forward the proposal to remove
China from the EU's list of non-market economy countries.
</P>
<P>
"The move is an active approach which conforms to the
development trend of Sino-EU relations and will help promote
Sino-EU ties," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the EU is China's major trade partner, but at the
same time adopted the policy of discriminative anti-dumping
towards China because it treats the country as a non-market
economy country.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out socialist market economy policy since
beginning its reform and opening to the outside world 20 years
ago, Wu said, adding that at present the pricing of more than 95
percent of the means of livelihood and more than 85 percent of the
means of production are decided by market demands in China.
</P>
<P>
She said that China's market economy status is an obvious fact
and that many countries have removed China from their lists of
non-market economy countries.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her hope that the Netherlands would support
passage of the motion on removing China from EU's list of
non-market economy countries.

Wijiers said he guaranteed that his government would actively
support the passage of the motion when the EU commission discusses
the issue next month.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed her satisfaction with the advancement of
Sino-Dutch trade ties, saying that, in general, two-way trade
between the two countries had been good in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China's customs department show that the
Sino-Dutch trade volume reached 5.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1997,
making the Netherlands China's fourth largest EU trade partner
behind Germany, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
By September, the Netherlands had invested in 518 projects in
China with contracted and paid-in funds amounting to more than 2.6
billion and 800 million U.S. dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the two countries had signed more than 200
contracts for technological cooperation with 500 million
U.S. dollars involved.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has used 330 million U.S. dollars of mixed
loans from the Dutch government in 46 projects.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
more than 1 U.S. cent lower Monday in Sydney as investors decided
that a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations would
do little to help the stumbling economies in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 66.46 U.S. cents, down 1.1 cents
from the 67.57 U.S. cents previously.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe a falloff in growth in Asia is seen
likely to threaten Australian domestic growth, although to what
extent is yet uncertain. Economists currently expect the Asian
effect will shave between 0.5 to 1 percent off the country's
economic growth in the fiscal year of 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
So as the Japanese yen declined Monday against the U.S. dollar
and other Asian currencies fell also, the Australian unit was
marked lower.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar has broken its nexus as a dollar-bloc
currency and some would say it is now in the yen-bloc of
currencies" representing Asia, said Peter Whitley, foreign
exchange manager with Colonial State Bank.
</P>
<P>
"I think yen weakness will continue," Whitley said. "And
unfortunately I think the Aussie is going to be weak as well."
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead Monday night, Whitley said a test of 66.4-66.5
U.S. cents was likely and the unit probably would be capped around
66.80-66.85 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for the Aussie to fall away. There is good
support all the way down but the sentiment is negative at the
moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar ended here also at 85.62
Japanese yen, up from 85.59 previously, and at 1.2127 Deutsche
marks, down from 1.2261.

persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to back down from
obstructing U.N. arms inspectors from searching all sites
suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction freely and
unrestrictively.

<P>
The Iranian official said that as soon as the Iraqi crisis came
into being, Iran began launched active diplomatic efforts to help
defuse the crisis.

<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A 2,000-year-old buried
camphor tree unearthed in Yangdong county of south China's
Guangdong province was still fresh enough to produce camphor oil.
</P>
<P>
This ancient camphor tree was first discovered in August
1997. Experts estimated that the tree has been buried for at least
1,000 years, according to today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts found that the surface of the tree trunk had become
carbonized, and they were surprised to see camphor oil coming out
of the tree trunk when they dug 6 centimeters into it. The wood
chips were as fresh as that of a newly felled tree.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the discovery provides an important reference
for studying ancient meteorology, hydrology, geology and
vegetation in Guangdong province and China as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Myanmar Strives to Develop Border Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, the Myanmar
government has been taking various measures to promote economic
development and social progress in its border areas, where ethnic
minorities are benefiting greatly.
</P>
<P>
In the 19 border regions including Kachin, Kokang, Wa,
Kengtung, Shan, Kayah, Kayin, Mon, Rakhine and Chin, the
government has been focusing its efforts towards community
development, integrated and rural development, poppy plantation
eradication and poppy substitute crop plantation.
</P>
<P>
The official New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted a senior
official as saying that the implementation of development projects
during the period between 1989 and 1993 were encouraging, but
after that it began slowing down for some time.
</P>
<P>
Work has been picking up in recent years. The government hopes
to expedite the development of border areas, improvement in the
living standards of ethnic minorities living there and eradication
of narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
After the first four years of project implementation, the
government laid down an 11-year master plan for the development of
its border areas beginning in 1993, including the first short-term
three-year plan (1993-94 to 1995-96), the first medium-term
four-year plan (1996-97 to 1999-2000) and the second medium-term
four-year plan (2000-01 to 2003-04).
</P>
<P>
The government has spent billions of Myanmar kyats (one U.S.
dollar equals about six kyats) in the past nine years on
infrastructure projects, including the building of roads, bridges,
dams, schools, hospitals, hydropower stations and
telecommunications systems, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent work review of the country's Work
Committee for Development of Border Areas and National Races, 50
percent of the border development-related projects have been
completed.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been cooperating with United Nations agencies in
this regard and seven projects have been or are being implemented
with the involvement of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP).
</P>
<P>
The development of border areas has received a great boost
since the government made peace with various anti-government armed
groups.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the anti-government armed groups, including 15
ethnic rebel groups and the Khun-Sa-led drug trafficking Mong Tai
Army which had controlled several border areas, have made peace
with the government, and they are reportedly getting involved in
the development of border areas in cooperation with the
government.
</P>
<P>
An example is in the Mongla region in eastern Shan state which
became an opium-free zone in 1996. The government is striving to
create more opium-free zones including Kokang, Wa and Monkoe.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also been cooperating with neighboring countries
like Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in
fighting drug trafficking in common border areas under bilateral
or multilateral agreements.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
will launch a formal inquiry into the power failure which
paralyzed the central business district of New Zealand's largest
city of Auckland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Max Bardford said that given the seriousness of
the situation, a special committee of seven Cabinet ministers has
been set up. They will monitor developments and coordinate the
government response to the problem.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ Monday night quoted the city's power supplier Mercury
Energy as saying that the power failure was caused by the aging of
the power supply cables and it may take three weeks to restore
supply.
</P>
<P>
The central business district received only 10 percent of its
normal power supply on Monday. Many shops and offices were either
shut or relocated, and those still operating were running on their
own power generators.
</P>
<P>
Traffic lights went out and enrollments in Auckland University
and other institutions were delayed. Workers were urged to stay
away from the central business district.
</P>
<P>
The power supply failure also affected court proceedings. In
some cases, proceedings were conducted in suburban motels.
</P>
<P>
About one third of New Zealanders live in the Auckland region.

Organization (ILO), is the first devoted solely to the refining
sector of the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
Government officials from 19 countries, representatives of
trade unions and employers' organizations are expected to be
present at the meeting with focus on challenges facing the oil
refining industry.
</P>
<P>
Increasing competition, excessive refining capacity and the
mounting investments needed to meet tightening environmental
standards are threatening the profitability of the industry and
have cast a shadow over the job prospects of oil refinery workers,
said the ILO in a report.
</P>
<P>
Overall world employment in oil refining remained stable, at
about one million, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of job reductions came in countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
where the industry is mature, and in central and eastern Europe,
which, since 1989, experienced a decline in refinery employment
estimated at about 200,000 jobs, with further reductions likely.
</P>
<P>
Demand for refined petroleum products is enjoying slow, steady
growth in most countries despite mounting concerns over the
hydrocarbon fuels' effects on the climate, the ILO noted.
</P>
<P>
Also souring demand for transportation fuels in developing
countries, especially in Asia, is expected to be a major source of
future growth, the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, environmental considerations related to global
warming and urban air quality and government fiscal measures may
on the other hand serve to depress the demand.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will conclude on February 27.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: War Possibly Avertable with Global Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi crisis over
weapons inspections is closing to a peaceful settlement with a
dash of global efforts, avoiding a war that could claim lives of
thousands of servicemen and civilians, including children.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is in Baghdad
on a last-ditch effort to defuse the heightened tension of a
possible U.S.-led military attack against Iraq, clinched a deal
with Iraqi leaders Sunday on all major issues over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to sign the deal with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz Monday morning in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain reacted cautiously by insisting
continuing preparation for a military strike on Iraq if the
agreement could not meet all their demands.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said the U.N. chief
believed the deal was acceptable to all the 15 U.N. Security
Council members, including the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Details of the deal are yet to be announced, but Annan said it
"fulfills the two principal objectives" of the Security Council,
which are the full implementation of U.N. resolutions and the
preservation of integrity of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM), charged with eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the news of the deal came out of the
negotiation room in Baghdad, several countries, including some
Gulf nations, hailed it and appreciated Annan's efforts and
diplomatic skill as well as Iraq's positively flexible stand.
</P>
<P>
No doubt a peaceful solution to the crisis reflects the common
wishes of the world on the verge of a war which means bombs
raining down on Iraq from American and British warships.
</P>
<P>
The United States, angered by Baghdad's standoff with the U.N.
arms inspection team, has sent a naval armada and some 25,000
troops to the Gulf region and threatened to mount air strikes to
force Iraq to open all sites suspected of hiding weapons of mass
destruction, including eight presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tough stance has aroused anti-war demonstrations both
abroad and within the United States.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the
White House with a banner holding high, which reads, "Do not bomb
Iraq." It is the first time such a big rally took place outside
the White House.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. politicians also expressed their worries that a
military action against the Gulf nation could worsen the situation
in the region and ignite anti-American sentiments in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
When the United States was busy preparing for a possible air
strike against Iraq, Russia, China and France spared no efforts to
gain a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
A successful outcome of Annan's Baghdad trip may be claimed by
the United States as a mission backed by military muscle.
</P>
<P>
But it definitely shows that dispute can be settled peacefully
and war is avoidable through joint efforts of the world
community.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
release a fund of 60 million Rupees (almost one million U.S.
dollars) within this week to activate and strengthen the newly
elected local government bodies in the north.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Provincial Council and Local Government
Ministry said Monday that the Jaffna Municipal Council, one of the
17 local government bodies elected on January 29, will receive 10
million Rupees (161,290 dollars) within this week to fund initial
operations.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga is scheduled to meet
representatives of those Tamil parties, which won the local
government elections in the north, to discuss rehabilitation work
in the region this week, they said.
</P>
<P>
The parties have complained that due to a lack of funds, they
have to start from zero. Most of the elected officials to the
local authorities haven't take oaths yet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they have said that once they were sworn in, top
priority would be given to the reconstruction of roads, which had
been destroyed during the ongoing ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Eradication of the mosquito menace in the area, restoring the
drainage system and repairing government buildings will also be
given priority, the officials said.

Envoy Robert Gelbard said Sunday in Pristina, capital of the
"Kosovo Republic."
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper, Gelbard made the remarks during

<HEADLINE> Leading Cadres Urged to Learn from Zhou Enlai's Noble Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The whole Communist Party, the
entire army and the people of all ethnic groups in China,
especially leading officials at all levels, should learn from the
lofty spirit of Comrade Zhou Enlai and apply the same to their own
thinking and actions in order to improve their work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and state president, made the remarks at a
rally this morning to mark the centenary of the birth of late
Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Zhou was a great Marxist, a principal Party and
state leader, one of the founders of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), a great proletariat revolutionary,
a statesman, a strategist and a diplomat, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Zhou led a glorious life and his remarkable contributions to
liberating Chinese people and socialist construction, as well as
his lofty spirit and personality represent a towering monument in
the history of the CPC and the nation. Zhou memory is deeply
engrained in the minds of the people of all Chinese ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Zhou joined the Communist group in Paris in 1921 and became one
of the first members of the CPC. Zhou participated in the
activities for founding the CPC, said Jiang, adding that Zhou
worked in the headquarters of the Chinese revolution during the
battle for liberation from the Yan'an Period (1936-1948) to the
eve of the founding of New China in 1949. The late leader served
as a senior aid for Comrade Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Zhou served as Premier of the State Council for 26 years
following the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949. Zhou, an excellent organizer and administrator, as well as
one of the main architects of the nation's blueprint for socialist
construction, devoted painstaking efforts to the development of
all areas, including the economy, diplomacy, defense, the United
Front, science and technology, culture, education, the media,
public health, and sports.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that Zhou was not only a model in terms of
placing value on science and technology, but was also an
outstanding leader in forming, developing and promoting the CPC's
united front efforts work.
</P>
<P>
Zhou entered the leadership of the CPC in 1927, and was
involved in formulating and implementing almost all major policies
during the course of Chinese revolution and socialist
construction. The record of his achievements over a half century
and more epitomizes the history of the CPC, and represents the
embryo, birth and growth of New China, as well as the nation's
rising international status.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's monumental achievements and lofty spirit will continue
to encourage the Communist Party members and the people of the all
ethnic groups across China to further consolidate and extend even
greater efforts to strive for a modern, prosperous and powerful
socialist country.

<HEADLINE> Goods to North Sri Lanka Still to Be Loaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- All food and other essential
items sent to North Sri Lanka will continue to be loaded at the
Colombo Port instead of the Galle Port as had been ordered
earlier, the Daily News newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Ports Development, Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction Minister M. H. M. Ashraff after many traders,
shippers and members of parliament expressed their concerns about
shipment arrangements for the goods to be sent to the north, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, Ashraff, citing reasons such as security,
lack of space and congestion in the Colombo Port, ordered that all
north-bound goods should be shifted to and loaded at the Galle
Port, some 115 kilometers south of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision triggered complaints from some
businessmen and politicians, who criticized that the move would
make transportation both costly and inconvenient. They also said
the shift could lead to a price hike in the northern areas.
</P>
<P>
After carefully accessing the concerns, the minister decided
that all ships would be allowed to load at the Colombo Port,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of last year, ships chartered by the
government transported 23,113 metric tons of food and essential
items, including medicine and fuel, to the Jaffna Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Peso Higher Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban peso rose slightly
against the U.S. dollar in the past two weeks thanks to an
increase of foreign exchange supply in Cuba's currency market.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was trading at 21 peso, up from the level of 23 peso
as of last summer. Back in 1995, the exchange rate was 1:150.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the appreciation of peso indicated a change in
the relation between supply and demand in the country's financial
market.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the change to increased exports of aquatic
products, nickel and Cuba cigarette. That the current tourism
season had generated more foreign exchange income was another
reason.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Fuel Sales Up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The rapid growth of Sri
Lanka's industrial sector resulted in a 10-percent rise in fuel
sales last year, an official of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation
(CPC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
CPC Marketing Manager Saliya Unamboowe said that in 1997 the
corporation sold more than 2.11 trillion liters of fuel valued at
37 billion rupees (596.8 million U.S. dollars) as against some
1.92 trillion liters in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The CPC expects a further increase in demand for fuel this year
as the industrial sector will continue to expand and vehicle
imports are expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
Unamboowe said that according to their calculations, there
would be a jump of 25 percent in diesel sales and 11 percent in
kerosene sales this year.
</P>
<P>
While sales of diesel reached some 1.57 trillion liters in
1997, 14 percent more than in 1996, those of gasoline dropped by 4
percent, the marketing manager said.
</P>
<P>
He said the transport sector consumed nearly 62 percent of
total supplies, followed by the industrial sector 23 percent, and
the fisheries, plantation and agricultural sector 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million liters of unleaded gasoline, introduced
last June, had been sold by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Work on Guangzhou's New Airport to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south
China's Guangdong Province will initiate the building of a new
airport at the end of this year, as soon as the people who are at
the moment living on the construction site are evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The New Guangzhou Airport, covering a total area of 1,333
hectares, will be located on the boundary of Renhe Township in
Baiyun District and Xinhua Township near Huadu City.
</P>
<P>
It will replace Guangzhou's Baiyun International Airport,
located in the the urban area of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will have an annual handling capacity of 27
million passengers and 800,000 tons of cargo after completion.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the new airport is to be built to meet the
increasing demand for passenger and cargo services through
Guangzhou, which is the biggest transportation hub in south China.
</P>
<P>
At the moment Baiyun International Airport can handle 12.5
million people and 351,000 tons of cargo a year. However, it is
impossible to expand the airport since it is surrounded by
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The land on which the old airport stands will be jointly
developed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the
Guangzhou city government. The funds raised will be used to offset
the cost of the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 30-km highway and a light railway will be built to
connect the new airport with downtown Guangzhou, as well as an
oil-supply project and a base for China Southern Airlines at the
airport.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's automotive industry is
seeking a government stimulus for further growth, said today's
China Daily
</P>
<P>
"That's true we have recently discussed a possible consumption
policy to stimulate the domestic demand for motor vehicles, " an
State Planning Commission official was quoted as saying in the
Beijing-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the final decision will not be made until the
end of the upcoming ninth National People's Congress in March.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that the central government is
considering restructuring the 13 large automakers throughout the
country into two giant auto groups.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent price war among domestic carmakers sweeping
across China, the newspaper said that the central government would
not muffle any pricing strategy developed by enterprises
themselves even if it has once issued a price range of vehicles
for automakers' guidance.
</P>
<P>
The auto market reported five billion yuan (600 million US
dollars) in its transaction volume last year.
</P>
<P>
The total demand for motor vehicles is forecast to reach 1.66
million units this year, with the actual demand for sedans
expected to hit 550,000 units, noted the paper.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Reform Outlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Government institutions must
gradually lift restrictions on the financial operations of banks
and non-bank financial institutions, today's China Daily quoted a
senior Chinese official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shuqing, secretary-general of the State Commission for
Reconstructing Economic System(SCRES), said that the government
roles are to enact and improve rules and regulations governing the
market, and exercise necessary supervision and control in
accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
SCRES is one of China's most authoritative bodies guiding the
country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
State-owned commercial banks must be given the decision-making
power over financial activities as soon as possible, he said,
adding that the banks should also be allowed to determine the
interest rates on their loans.
</P>
<P>
The establishedment of new financial institutions, including
commercial banks, insurance companies, investment companies, and
the expansion of their activities, will be encouraged, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the financial reform is to increase the
efficiency of financial services, and all reform measures should
help promote fair and rational competition," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the state banks and other financial institutions have
long been plagued with such problems as big organizations,
overstaffing, bad debts and inadequate funds, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
"There is still room for the readjustment of the state economy
in China," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The excessive debts of state banks and enterprises are mostly
incurred with the state economy, and this issue can be resolved
through recapitalization of the existing assets and the
rescheduling of debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's state economy is huge and the debt of the Chinese
government is very limited, he said. Aggregated state bonds
unpaid only amount to 400 billion yuan, about seven percent of the
country's GDP. The figure is much lower than those in many market
economy countries in the world.

<HEADLINE> Textiles Enjoy Growing Export Rebate Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Taxation has issued a document to raise two percentage points of
the export rebate rate for textile products to 11 percent starting
retroactively in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The rate growth means that the State will increase three
billion yuan in export refunds to textile exporters, said today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a package of favorable government polices
aimed at bailing out the debt-ridden textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry suffered five consecutive years of deficit, which
amounted to 10.6 billion yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But it has been the engine driving China's exports for years,
with more than 50 percent of its products intended for export.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996 the industry has lost its leading position in
exports. Although textile exports saw progress last year, those
from processing imported materials accounted for the major
increase and general exports actually experienced a decline.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the textile industry as the most difficult to bail
out, the central government has decided to revitalize the industry
as a breakthrough for reforms of State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Besides export tax rebates, the government will offer
preferential policies on export quotas and financial subsidies to
the industry.
</P>
<P>
China refunded a total of 82.8 billion yuan to exporters in
1996 and 43.2 billion yuan in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Quicken Nationals Evacuation From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Foreign Ministry has
ordered preparations for the evacuation of Thais from Iraq to
nearby countries in case of a U.S. military attack on the Middle
East country, the Nation newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said on Sunday that
the decision to help move the Thais to either Iran or Jordan came
after the U.S. suggestion that its citizens leave Iraq as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
There are now 43 Thais in Iraq, including 23 students who went
there on religious scholarships, 10 members of the diplomatic
corps and their families.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic officials in Iraq have started drawing up a list of
those who want to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are giving priority to students as well as women, children
and elders," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the evacuation will be on a voluntary basis.

<HEADLINE> More Drug Addicts Seek Treatment in North Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Drug rehabilitation centers in
Thailand's northern provinces are observing a dramatic rise in the
number of new patients seeking treatment, according to the Thai
Public Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Most new drug addicts seeking rehabilitation are men aged
between 20 and 24, who are mainly addicted to heroin, Deputy
Health Minister Khamron Na Lamphun was quoted Monday by the
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The northern provinces, particularly those bordering Myanmar,
are said to be the main narcotics trafficking route.
</P>
<P>
Out of an estimated 19,160 drug addicts in the north, 48
percent are new ones, Khamron said.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Expects 10 to 11 Percent GDP Increase in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's economic powerhouse
of southern Guangdong Province is estimated to have a GDP increase
of 10 to 11 percent in 1998, according to an economic blue book
codified by the provincial Economic and Social Development
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Other major goals include a 15 to 18 percent increase for
industrial output, an eight to 10 percent rise for export, and a
15 percent growth for consumer goods sales. Efforts will also be
made to hold the consumer goods retail sales price index at two to
three percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong had a GDP increase of 10.6 percent in 1997, with the
consumer goods retail sales price rising by only 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented province will enjoy more development
opportunity due to sustained growth of the world economy as a
whole, as well as the smooth return to the motherland of the
neighbouring Hong Kong, the book predicts.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), which was held last September, has greatly encouraged
Guangdong in its efforts to further promote economic advances.
</P>
<P>
Heavy investment in infrastructure and energy supply over the
past few years now have begun to pay off, providing a greater
support and favorable conditions to the province's economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Lower Economic Growth in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has scaled down economic targets for the Philippines with
the gross national product (GNP) predicted to rise in 1998 by only
3 to 4 percent compared with 5.6 percent last year, a local
newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second lowest full-year GNP growth under Fidel
Ramos' administration which took office in June 1992, the
Philippine Journal said.
</P>
<P>
An IMF review team currently in Manila expects a slowdown in
business activity this year as a result of the region-wide
currency crisis, high interest rates and other spillover factors.
</P>
<P>
The IMF panel, which is conducting a performance review of the
economy, believes that gross domestic product (GDP) will reach
only 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine negotiating panel, headed by Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson, has accepted the scaled-down projections
of the IMF including a revised inflation target of between 7 to 8
percent from the original estimates of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the average interest rate is expected to
stand at 17 percent from the original projection of 16 percent to
17 percent and the foreign exchange rate to average at 42 pesos to
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also expected the country's consolidated public sector
deficit to reach 25.9 billion pesos (640 million U.S. dollars) in
1998, much higher than the 12.9 billion pesos (320 million
dollars) earlier estimated by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
The consolidated public sector includes the national
government, government-owned corporations, social security
institutions, government financial institutions, local government
units and some government funds.

<HEADLINE> China's Tea Market Expected to Remain Stable This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's tea analysts have
anticipated a rise in output but a slight growth in sales in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The cautious optimism on the prospect of China's tea market
this year is based on the stable tea plantations and a balanced
supply and demand last year, according to experts of the China Tea
Distribution Association.
</P>
<P>
China's tea output of 1997 was estimated at 516,000 tons, a
rise of 5.7 percent over 1996; And domestic sales reached
395,000 tons, with sales value at 7.1 billion yuan (855.4 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiduan, general secretary of the Association, expected that
output of brand-name tea promising better economic returns will
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Because of brisk demand, the output of black tea is expected to
rise by a big margin. In comparison, the output of green tea will
not go up remarkably due to stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
The price of brand-name tea will possibly fall due to ample
supply.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Tighten Supervision of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers have
investigated into the enforcement of more than 30 laws over the
past five years in an effort to strengthen the conditioning of
government power.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) said today that more than 20 investigation teams
led by eight vice-chairman of the NPC went to provinces last year,
and 40 provinces have made self-investigations and 20 central
government departments have reported their work to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of major laws, including the Agriculture Law,
Environmental Protection Law, Labor Law and Education Law, have
been supervised by the NPC workers, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China has drawn more than 6,000 laws and regulations since the
reform and opening-up began in 1978 and some departments and
personnel have ignored them or even violated them.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the key to turn China into a country with
advanced legal system is to solve the problem that "laws are
usually disobeyed". Traditionally, China is eyed as a country
governed by people rather than law.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the NPC supervision has successfully
curbed corruption. For example, a judge of the Hainan Higher
People's Court was dismissed from his post by the provincial
People's Congress of Hainan province after he was found to have
abused his duty.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the NPC and its local institutions are
placing the same importance to the supervision of law enforcement
as to law-making to ensure a clean and efficient government.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Hopes for Diplomatic Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Slovak hopes United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Baghdad trip would bring about a
diplomatic solution to the crisis over weapons inspections in
Iraq, the Slovak Foreign Ministry said in a special statement
issued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official comment by the Slovak government on
the current Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Slovak government is paying close
attention to the developments in Iraq and hopes Annan and Iraqi
officials could reached a deal on the U.N. weapons inspectors'
operation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Baghdad Friday on his widely believed "last
hope" mission to avoid a threatened U.S. military strike against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After several rounds of talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz and a meeting with President Saddam Hussein, Annan's
spokesman Fred Eckhard said Sunday night that Annan had reached a
deal with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. chief is to sign an agreement with Aziz
at 10:30 a.m. local time Monday, but he refused to disclose any
details of the "positive deal."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Sign Land-use Extension Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Li Gaofu, in Jianghan
Plain of central China's Hubei Province, is working harder on his
half-ha paddy field as he has just signed a 30-year land-use
extension contract with village committee.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government allowed farmers a 15-year
land-use right in the early 1980s. This was widely acclaimed in
rural areas and has dramatically boosted the country's rural
economy.
</P>
<P>
The state has decided to extend the land-use term for another
30 years, clearing up the widespread rumors that the contract
household responsibility system would change.
</P>
<P>
Hubei began the contract extension work three years ago. By the
end of 1997, 80 percent of its rural households had signed the
second round of land-use contracts with local village authorities,
involving approximately 2.8 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Farmers now feel relieved as they have land at their own
disposal. Consequently, they spend more on water conservancy and
farmland improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the province's multiple crop index
has grown by five percentage points, with science and technology
contributing nearly 45 percent to agricultural production. And
farmers' average income on per hectare has been raised from 9,090
yuan to 21,750 yuan. Stable policies for rural economy are said to
have a role in this change.

SHANGHAI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, has attracted some 42,000 college
graduates from other provinces in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The number of non-Shanghai graduates introduced to work in
Shanghai has been increasing by 15 percent annually. Almost one of
every four of them is a doctor's or master's degree holder. In
1997, 26 percent of non-Shanghai graduates who found jobs in the
city were postgraduates, up 7 percent over the past years.
</P>
<P>
These college graduates were no longer employed only by large
state-owned enterprises or governmental institutions. While quite
a lot of them are working in high-tech and other major industrial
sectors, a growing number of them have found jobs in enterprises
at district or county level, foreign-funded firms and private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The in-flow of increasing non-Shanghai college graduates has
played an important role in Shanghai's economic and social
development, a local official source has said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Miners End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Miners of Gorubso, the largest
Bulgarian ore-mining company, ended a ten-day strike on Sunday
after signing an agreement with the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
All mines will resume work on February 23, which was the main
clause of the agreement signed by Finance Minister Mouravei Radev
and a group of strikers from the Eastern Rhodopes area in
southeastern Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that Gorubso must be transformed into
eight joint-stock companies and the size of staff at the
headquarters will be cut.
</P>
<P>
All branches of Gorubso will become economically independent
since Wednesday and the new companies will be registered in court.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement did not include wage hikes, a demand
previously pressed for by the strikers, who had urged a 200
percent pay rise.
</P>
<P>
However, each new company can increase the wages of its workers
on the basis of corporate economic performance.
</P>
<P>
"Once Gorubso branches become independent, they will be
motivated to survive," said Radev, who hailed the agreement as a
very good solution.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is likely to provide an interest-free loan
of three billion leva (about 1.71 million U.S. dollars) as working
capital to newly established companies.
</P>
<P>
Gorubso owes four billion leva (about 2.27 million dollars) in
taxes, which may be rescheduled, Radev said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, miners are to work on weekend days to
compensate the time used by the strike.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Tuition Reform Into Vocational Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING 23 (Xinhua) -- Students studying in China's 3,200
technical secondary schools will pay tuition starting this year
after China adopted the reform at universities.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at the State Education Commission announced today
that the reform is meant to topple the Soviet model under which
students were paid by the state and their jobs were assigned by
the government.
</P>
<P>
China's vocational schools teach practical skills to high
school graduates who can not enter universities. The number of the
technical secondary schools accounts for one-third of the total
vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
The commission spokeswoman urged the schools to thoroughly
consider students' ability to pay the tuition and set moderate
criterion.
</P>
<P>
The reform can ease schools' burden, improve their efficiency,
and train more students who are really wanted by the market, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
There are 3.7 million students studying in the technical
secondary schools.

<P>
BONN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Swiss teenager Patty
Schnyder upset top-seeded Jana Novotna to win the Faber Grand Prix
title at Hanover on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Schnyder saved two match points to secure her
second career title with a 6-0, 2-6, 7-5 victory Novotna.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who played only her second tournament since taking a
two month break, was pinned at the baseline for much of the match
because of Schnyder's passing shots.
</P>
<P>
But when Novotna attacked the net twice at match point while
leading 5-4 in the third set, Schynder fended off both by ripping
a cross-court backhand and dropping a hard return at Novotna's
feet.
</P>
<P>
The victory will promote Schnyder's world ranking to No. 15.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia to Remain Major Trade Partner for Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries
will remain the major economic and trade partners for central
China's Hunan Province, despite the on-going financial crisis in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"Markets there are shrinking, and those countries' purchasing
power has been weakened. This will have an adverse impact on
Hunan's exports, but we will treat every one of our trade partners
the same as before, and help them to overcome their difficulties,"
said Chen Shuhong, head of the province's Commission for Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian countries, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and
Hong Kong and Macao are the most important trade partners for
Hunan. The province exported more than 1.3 billion US
dollar-worth of products to these countries and regions last
year -- 59 percent of its total export value.
</P>
<P>
Hunan is working on more favorable policies to attract foreign
investment and promote labor services. In addition, it encourages
local businesses to continue their cooperation with Southeast
Asian countries, but on condition that they do not lose money,
Chen said.

morning, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).

The fires, which also seriously injured four people and lightly

district, said police. (France-Fire)

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's number one Greg
Rusedski beat defending titlist Marc Rosset of Switzerland three
sets to one Sunday to lift the European Community Tennis
Championship in Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
The fifth seed of the tournament, playing his second final this
season, won the finals 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-1 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian-born Briton last won an ATP tournament in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski once slammed down his racket in disgust after the
Swiss broke his serve in the second set but he soon calmed down to
plow back and took control of the match though he seemed to still
have problems with his backhand chops.
</P>
<P>
Rosset, the former Olympic champion, took the second set but
Rusedski ran away in the ensuing set with a five-to-nothing lead.
</P>
<P>
"The third set was perfect for me," said Rusedski who outserved
Rosset in the big-serve match.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski served 23 aces whereas Rosset served eight but
committed 12 double-faults.
</P>
<P>
"I was a bit tired mentally and physically," said Rosset.
"It's tough to play well every day. This was my 16th match in 20
days."
</P>
<P>
Both were eyeing the 1-million-U.S.-dollar, diamond-studded
golden trophy made in the shape of a tennis racket. The trophy
will be offered to anyone who won the Antwerp event three times in
five years.

<HEADLINE> Pak Trade Deficit Reduced in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit
dropped by 24.33 billion rupees (about 553 million U.S. dollars)
last year, according to figures released Sunday by the Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports went up by 5 percent while imports jumped by
about 8 percent in 1997 as compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The fall in imports was due to the reduction in import of motor
vehicles and the power generating sector while the import of
machinery registered a substantial increase.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that exports of textile items, which account
for about 70 percent of Pakistan's total exports, registered an
improvement of 11 percent in value terms.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the Pakistani government took a number of
measures to boost exports. An export facilitation terminal was
commissioned to facilitate exports to meet all concerned
departments' procedural formalities at one place.
</P>
<P>
The Export Promotion Bureau was revamped to make it
service-oriented and meet the specific requirements of exporters.
</P>
<P>
A no-duty, no drawback scheme was also launched for the first
time to facilitate exports.
</P>
<P>
Export of potatoes up to 100,000 tons and sugar up to 300,000
tons was also allowed.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Clinton Discuss Iraq on Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and US President Bill Clinton spoke about the Iraqi crisis
by telephone for 15 minutes on Sunday evening, according to a
Downing Street spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders talked on telephone on the news that United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan is close to a deal with Iraq
to end the weapons inspection row with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that there must be no concessions on matters of
fundamental principle, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam must grant full and unfettered access to the
presidential sites, which UNSCOM (United Nations Special
Commission of weapons inspectors) wants to inspect," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Annan has reached an agreement in meetings
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz in Baghdad today to end the UN weapons inspection row
with Iraq and the text is set to be signed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The British and US leaders were later briefed by Annan on his
deal with Iraq and they agreed to keep in touch as the situation
in Iraq unfolded.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been standing firmly side by side with the US in
the weeks-long crisis and has maintained a very tough position on
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Insists Annan's Deal on Iraq Must meet its Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Sunday that it was waiting to see details of an agreement reached
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein on the settlement of the crisis over weapons inspections
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's top aides said any deals on
weapons inspections must meet its objectives, unfettered access to
all sites for inspections and full control of weapons inspections
by UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission). Any deal short of those
objectives would be unacceptable and the crisis would be settled
with military action, they said.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the United States
would have to make sure that any deal, in addition to satisfying
the U.N. secretary-general, "meets our national interests."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated a demand that UNSCOM remain in "operational
control" of the disarmament process agreed to by Iraq at the end
of the 1991 Gulf War. He also repeated a demand that UNSCOM
inspectors must be free to go wherever they want.
</P>
<P>
"If an arrangement is reached with Saddam Hussein that meets
that test, we'll be very, very pleased," Berger said on the "Fox
News Sunday" program.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it was possible that
Annan could come up "with something we don't like, in which case
we will pursue our national interest."
</P>
<P>
She said Saddam's ability to threaten the world with weapons of
mass destruction must be diminished, by military means if
necessary. "We will pursue that, that's what our job is, that's
what we will do," she told ABC television's "This Week" program.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said any Iraqi insistence on a
time limit for U.N. monitoring of suspected weapons sites would be
unacceptable to the United States.
</P>
<P>
An "artificial" time limit was unacceptable because "you can
switch from making pharmaceuticals to making a chemical weapons in
a very short period of time," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, a diplomat briefed on Annan's talks said all major
issues, including the matter of a time limit, had been settled,
but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the real issue was whether the Security Council was
"going to insist upon full compliance with its own resolutions,"
demanding "full, unfettered, unrestricted" access to dismantle any
residual chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and the missiles
to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Security Council) should back up those words with
deeds and insist upon full compliance," he said on NBC
television's "Meet the Press" program.
</P>
<P>
The White House said on Sunday it was waiting to see details of
the reported agreement and would welcome a deal that met its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we'll need to wait and see the details before making
any formal comment," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"Any deal that meets our criteria of allowing full unfettered
access and maintaining the integrity of UNSCOM (the United Nations
Special Commission) would be welcome."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that President Bill Clinton was aware of the
reports of the deal but had not been formally briefed, adding that
the president will not make any public comment on Sunday about the
new development.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who threatens to use force against Iraq to solve the
weapons inspection crisis, had not and would not order any
relaxation of military readiness in the Gulf, said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spent the afternoon in the Oval Office, speaking by
phone with Sultan Qaboos of Oman and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair. Lockhart said Clinton and Blair had agreed to to look
closely at the details of any arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also disclosed that he would sign orders later on Sunday
to call up "several hundreds" more military reservists to prepare
for possible early action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Saddam's prestige among Arabs could be
bolstered by any U.S. military action that left him in power.
</P>
<P>
"Could he go up in stature? Possible," he said. But he argued
Saddam would be "stronger" without substantial air strikes on his
sensitive sites, thus diminishing his ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> UK Position on Iraqi Crisis Unchanged: Spokesman Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain reacted cautiously
Sunday to news of a possible deal between United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraq, but stressed that its
position on the arms inspection crisis remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"We won't know if there's a deal until tomorrow, and we won't
know the contents -- if there is a deal -- until he (Annan) gets
back to New York," said a UK government spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported today that Annan has reached an agreement in
meetings with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz in Baghdad today to end the UN weapons
inspection row with Iraq and the agreed text is set to be signed
Monday
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that it was premature to comment
on any possible accord, but pointed out that the UK government's
position on the Iraqi crisis remained unchanged, that is "(U.N.)
inspectors in Iraq should be allowed to do their work unfettered".
</P>
<P>
In the weeks-long showdown over UN arms inspections, the United
States has vowed military strikes unless Iraq allows unrestricted
access by U.N. inspectors to its weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been standing side by side with the US in the
crisis, insisting the use of force if diplomacy failed to settle
the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Britain Encouraged by Annan-Iraq Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said here this evening that his government was
encouraged by a possible breakthrough in resolving the U.N.-Iraq
standoff over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.N. secretary General Kofi Annan has
reached an agreement with the Iraqi government over the settlement
of the current arms inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cook said in a statement issued this evening:"There have been
some encouraging signs coming from Baghdad following U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's talks this weekend."
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose government maintained a tough position upon Iraq,
noted: "If the result of his (Annan's) talks is to bring Iraq into
full compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions, this will
be a most welcome breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
"The critical issue is that Saddam Hussein must allow UNSCOM
(U.N. Special Commission) to have full and unrestricted access to
all the sites in Iraq they want to inspect. There can be no
concessions on points of fundamental principle enshrined in U.N.
Security Council resolutions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hails Iraq-U.N. Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government Sunday
evening hailed an Iraq-U.N. deal over weapons inspection which is
expected to be signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
the Iraqi government Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government warmly welcomed the positive outcome
achieved by Iraq and the U.N. chief, said Jordan's Deputy Prime
Minister for Development and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad
Anani in a statement to Jordan's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the written agreement between the two sides will
be accomplished as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan is happy that the crisis has come to an end ... and
appreciates the efforts and positive stands taken by the Iraqi
government and the U.N. secretary general to achieve a solution
that averts the region from devastating consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan calls on all concerned parties, particularly the
permanent members of the (U.N.) Security Council to try
positively with these good achievements," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials in Baghdad confirmed Sunday that Annan and the
Iraqi authorities achieved "an agreed text" which was in full
conformity with the Security Council resolutions and maintained
the integrity of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The deal was reached after Annan held a three-hour meeting with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at the Republic Palace, one of the
eight presidential sites which Iraq had declared off-limits to
U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's refusal to open all sites to U.N. weapons inspectors
sparked off the current Iraq-U.N. crisis. The U.S. and Britain
have threatened to launched military strike on Iraq if diplomacy
fails to end the crisis.
