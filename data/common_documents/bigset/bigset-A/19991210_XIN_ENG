<HEADLINE> S. Africans Wooed to Invest in Uganda's Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has called on South African businessmen to invest in his
country's power sector in order to fully exploit its power
potential.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the call while meeting with a delegation from the
South African Electricity Supply Commission at State House here on
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president briefed the delegation led by South
African Minister of Public Enterprise Jeff Radebe on Uganda's
potential in producing cheap electricity.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has assured them that Uganda possesses a lot of
electric energy potential.
</P>
<P>
He urged the guests to bring into Uganda their expertise and
invest in Uganda's partially utilized electric energy resources
for the benefit of people on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
If the electric energy resource in Uganda is to be fully
exploited, the country would export it cheaply to the region which
would trigger off a big volume of industrial development with a
strong bias to agricultural industrial processing, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Radebe appreciated Uganda's potential in this sector and said
that his commission, the biggest producer of electric power in
South Africa, could participate in electric power development in
Uganda by investing in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, which has a big share of Lake Victoria and long
stretches of River Nile, is in dire need of power. Power shortage
leads to frequent load shedding and hampers the booming industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Parliament in the country recently passed an electricity bill,
giving the go-ahead to an American company to build a big power
plant at Bujagali near Jinja, some 80 km east of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
More foreign investors are expected to help exploit the power
potential in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Declare AIDS National Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has urged Zambia to declare the HIV/AIDS pandemic a
national emergency and formulate a national policy on orphans and
strengthen its institutional framework if it is to mitigate the
effects of AIDS in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government should handle the HIV/AIDS crisis as it
would treat a military invasion from another country, UNICEF
country representative, Peter Mcdermot, said at a workshop on
orphans and vulnerable children in Lusaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia with the second largest orphan population in the world
needs a strong orphan management framework, Mcdermot said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that Zambia has about 550,000 orphans with 15
percent of them losing their parents from HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Mcdermot noted that the world in general and Africa in
particular are in a state of war against a formidable enemy
HIV/AIDS which is threatening to wipe out humanity.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that current responses to the ravaging pandemic
falls short of expectations considering the gravity of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Countries on the continent have taken a very casual approach
toward the fight against the killer disease which is claiming more
lives yearly in comparison to those lost collectively to the
numerous wars on the continent.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Terming Israeli government's
recent decision to halt tenders on settlement houses as
insufficient, Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo has
urged stop of all forms of settlement expansions.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo made the remarks after the ninth session of the
final-status talks Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's session, co-chaired by Abed Rabbo and Israeli chief
negotiator Oded Eran, focused on the settlement issue as demanded
by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
At the session, Eran explained the decision on settlements
adopted by Israeli Prime Minister shortly after Palestinian
boycotted the final-status talks Monday to protest against
Israel's settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Barak offered to halt tenders on settlement house for the
duration of negotiations on a framework for a permanent peace deal
scheduled to finish in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Palestinian side stressed the necessity of
clarifying the Israeli stance on a number of issues related to
settlement construction and land confiscation in Jerusalem and
other occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli side made clear its position on such points, the
door for serious and effective talks will open, Abed Rabbo
said. The Palestinian National Authority will waste no time in
dealing with the agenda of the final status talks, which are
scheduled to conclude by September, 2000.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced hope that the coming talks would be more
positive and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eran said that Israel would not call any new tenders
for settlement construction in an effort to enhance the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to start a fresh session next week to
tackle the settlement and refugee issues.

"The claim to chase elements rebelling against the Turkish
authority does not give it the right to violate the land and space
of Iraq," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq maintains the full right to set the place and time of
retaliation on this aggression," added the letter.

UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000
television stations around the world will air programs by and for
children that showcase how "kids are changing the world" Sunday,
the eighth annual International Children's Day of Broadcasting (
ICDB) launched by the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), a UNICEF news
release said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Children's Day of Broadcasting is an opportunity for children
around the world to participate in the huge and influential world
of broadcasting. On this day, children actually help create and
convey messages about their lives that are seen by millions of
people around the globe," said William Hetzer, the UNICEF's
broadcasting chief.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child -- ratified by almost
every country in the world -- is the force behind the ICDB.
</P>
<P>
"The Convention on the Rights of the Child says the freedom to
express opinions and participate in public discussion is a
fundamental right of all children," Hetzer said. "On International
Children's Day of Broadcasting that right becomes real."
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting participating in Sunday's activities will air new
material created by a 10-nation Special Broadcasters Group, a
consortium of child broadcasting units from Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Jordan, Latvia, Namibia
and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The special programming in Sunday's activities focuses on the
theme "Kids are changing the world." Video portraits of children
who are making a difference will be shown on more than 2,000
participating media outlets, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
These presentations will be supplemented by locally produced
profits. Children will also be featured as broadcasters, reporters
and creators of media content.

GAZA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat Thursday briefed visiting Polish Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek on the latest developments in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in the West Bank city of Ramallah, the two

DAR ES SALAAM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has assured his people that the government will not
tamper with the money allocated for social service, especially
education funds, in its ongoing cost cutting measures.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of a modern primary school

"Tanzania can not face the challenge of the next century which
is dominated by science and technology if it does not develop its
education sector," Mkapa told the huge crowd attending the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzanian education sector is under-funded due to the
tight budget of the government and that he is well aware of the
shortage of reference textbooks, school buildings and teachers.
</P>
<P>
If the education sector is strengthened it could help
Tanzanians to excel best among the international organizations
such as the East African Community (EAC) and Southern African
Development Community (SADC).

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Effective Steps to Aid Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appeal came as Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative
to the United Nations, was speaking at the plenary meeting of the
54th General Assembly session on Africa, which began here
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The African continent is still the least developed region of
the world," he said. "The number of conflicts in Africa still
surpasses that in many other continents."
</P>
<P>
"While humanity is entering the new millennium, Africa is in
danger of being further marginalized," he said. "The African issue
is far from being settled and the international community still
has a long way to go toward that end."
</P>
<P>
"First, the key to resolution of African issues is economic
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are already a number of initiatives on African
development proposed from both within and outside the U.N. system,
he said. "What is urgently needed now is to coordinate and
prioritize the many initiatives so as to avoid repetition and
improve efficiency."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the priorities should include: to stop the
continuous downslide of official development aid, to reduce the
debt burden of African countries to a sustainable level and to
help them effectively raise fund; to help African countries in
human resources development through education, technology transfer
and other means, and to help them reform economic structure; to
support African countries in their capacity-building on trade and
market access and to help ensure that they get their fair share
while integrating into the globalization process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, the various U.N. bodies should strengthen their
coordination and cooperation on African issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council, which has the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of peace and security in the world, has the
biennial foreign ministers' meeting on Africa, and the 15-nation
Council conducts regular discussions on relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.N. Economic and Social Council, the
principal organ to coordinate the economic and social work of the
United Nations and the specialized agencies and institutions, has
also made the African issues a recurrent item on agenda that is
put under regular discussions.
</P>
<P>
"However, given the wide range of issues concerned and the
complex internal and external factors involved, the African issues
cannot be solved by one or two institutions alone," he said. "We
encourage more parties to get involved."
</P>
<P>
Qin also voiced his hope to see that the 188-member General
Assembly should further play its coordinating role and take on a
more important part in mobilizing the international community and
other relevant international organizations to increase input on to
the African issues.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly is holding a plenary session to discuss a
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Africa and how to
further promote peace and development on the war-torn continent.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Official Assures World of Secure Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Petroleum
and Mineral Resources Ali al-N'aimi has said that sufficient
global oil reserves and a surplus production capacity would secure
a stable oil supply, playing down doubts of many people who were
concerned of insecure crude delivery.
</P>
<P>
Naimi was addressing the "Energy Policies for the 21st
Century" conference in Washington Wednesday night, official Saudi
Press Agency monitored here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Naimi said the increase of global oil reserve, stocks and the
presence of a surplus in the production capacity are among the
factors which erase the worry over the security of crude supply.
</P>
<P>
He said total global oil reserve was estimated at over 1
trillion barrels this year, almost doubling the amount in 1970.
Of the total, about 25 percent is controlled by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Naimi said the world is producing an estimated
surplus of 6 million barrels per day (bpd), which equals 8 percent
of the global demand and can be used in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled his country's key role during Iraq's invasion
and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991, when Saudi Arabia used its
surplus capacity to avoid global shortage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Saudi oil minister had reaffirmed at a
Saudi-U.S. businessmen council dinner in Washington earlier
Wednesday that his country was committed to contributing to a
stable oil market.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer with an output
of 8 million bpd, has spearheaded oil production cuts that has
rescued prices from below 10 U.S. dollars a barrel at the turn of
the year. The crude is now sold at about 25 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Naimi, who is attending the two-day conference sponsored by
the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the
Financial Times, is also expected to meet U.S. officials,
including Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, on Saudi-U.S.
cooperation in the fields of energy and oil.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz, during a visit in Washington last year, invited
U.S. oil companies to invest in the Gulf kingdom's oil and gas
sectors. The call has attracted immediate attention of many
world's oil giants, including U.S. oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Chief executives of more than a dozen oil majors have visited
Riyadh, hoping to secure a share of its lucrative energy
development pie. The Saudi government is studying the investment
plans offered by these companies, but a decision has yet to be
made.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Meningitis Epidemics to Break Out in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Adequate preparedness is crucial
to reduce the impact of meningitis epidemics and to prevent deaths,
said the World Health Organization (WHO) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There is still no way of accurately predicting the location and
extent of future epidemics, WHO said. But the epidemics are likely
to occur in the near future in some countries which have not yet
experienced meningitis outbreaks during the current pandemic cycle.
</P>
<P>
The projection by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on
Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control is based on a
review of historical and recent patterns of meningitis. The ICG is
strongly encouraging health authorities in countries at risk to
verify the state of preparedness for such an eventuality.
</P>
<P>
Preparedness includes carrying out thorough disease
surveillance in countries at risk, and having ready and sufficient
stocks of meningococcal meningitis vaccine, the antibiotic oily
chloramphenicol, and single-use syringes for efficient
distribution, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
At their two-day meeting ending here Thursday, ICG members
discussed how preparedness for epidemics can be better ensured,
analyzed past experiences, made projections of new epidemics and
reviewed current research.
</P>
<P>
The ICG members include WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund,
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies, Medecins sans Frontieres, l'Association pour la
Medecine Preventive, and other international non-governmental
organizations and manufacturers of meningococcal meningitis
vaccine, single-use syringes and antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Economic Growth Faster Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- After several gloomy years at
the start of the 1990s, the Swiss economy is ending the millennium
on an upbeat note with GDP rising by 2.4 percent in the third
quarter over the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest quarterly GDP growth rate for nearly two
years, according to a report released Thursday by the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for the second quarter was also corrected
upwards, from 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent, the report said. An
increase in consumer spending by 2.5 percent in the third quarter
was the main reason for the strong economic showing. Consumers
were spending more on transport and communications, as well as
leisure and cultural pursuits.
</P>
<P>
The amount of investment in the previously dull construction
sector also continued its upward trend even if it was not as
buoyant as in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
A sharp rise in exports was achieved, according to the report.
The second and third quarter figures showed a rise of 9.2 and 8.2
percent respectively, the biggest growth rates for two years.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for next year also remain good, said the secretariat.
An overall GDP growth rate of 1.3 percent for 1999 is expected to
reach 2 percent next year. Previous estimates had put the likely
growth rate at 1.8 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is predicted to fall by half a percent to 2.7
percent in 2000, but the secretariat says inflation is expected to
rise, if only marginally. The forecast is for an inflation rate of
1.25 percent next year compared to the current level of 0.8
percent. The rise in consumer spending and a big boost for exports
in the third quarter of this year are the main reasons for the
positive performance.

Kyprianou said that during the talks, Hassan briefed him on the
latest developments in the peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said he also discussed with Hassan the Cyprus issue which
shares many common points with the Middle East peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island after an abortive pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Proximity talks between the two communities under the auspices
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan are going on in New York to
find a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hassan said Kyprianou "is a good friend of the
Palestinian people and of President Arafat." "Peace in Cyprus
means peace in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official expressed hope that all political
forces will play their role in pushing Israel to pursue peace with
its Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Adams Says Bug Would Have Wrecked Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said Thursday that the alleged bugging of a car used by the party'
s negotiators during the recent Mitchell talks could have wrecked
the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the silver Ford Mondeo car was shown off to reporters at
Sinn Fein's west Belfast headquarters, Adams said he intended to
express his anger and concerns to Prime Minister Tony Blair
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Adams said, "If, in the course of the Mitchell review, this had
been discovered, would it have succeeded? I think we can say with
certainty that it wouldn't have succeeded."
</P>
<P>
He criticized media speculation that the highly sophisticated
listening and tracking device had been found some time ago, but
kept quiet until an appropriate time to make it public.
</P>
<P>
He said, "That isn't the case. This was brought to my attention
within the last 36 to 48 hours."
</P>
<P>
A Sinn Fein spokesman said the car belongs to a party supporter
and was used by both Adams and new Education Minister Martin
McGuinness to ferry them to secret meetings with senior
Provisionals during the 11-week review.
</P>
<P>
Despite its complexity, the device, part of which was fitted
under a wheel arch and partly concealed in the foam roof lining of
the family saloon, could have been installed within two hours by
highly trained British experts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Adams said the Northern Ireland peace process
had been damaged by the controversy arising out of the bugging
claims.

<HEADLINE> France to Reinforce Security on New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- France will reinforce security
measures on new year's eve in Paris to avoid a chaotic situation
on the streets, said Paris police chief Philippe Massoni Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several parts of Paris, including the Champs-Elysee grand
avenue, and the area around the Eiffel Tower, will be closed to
cars and other motor vehicles on new year's eve, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people, especially youths, are
expected to throng onto the main streets of Paris on December 31
to celebrate the passing into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Dangers and criminal activities are more likely to take place
then as the number of police deployed in the streets is
outnumbered several times more than ordinary days.
</P>
<P>
"The police department will put everything into work to make
sure that the public will live these exceptional moments keeping
an image of jubilation," said Massoni.
</P>
<P>
Police will try to avoid a repetition of the dawn of July 13,
1998, when a chaotic situation occurred on the Champs-Elysee among
people celebrating the winning of the Football World Cup by France.
One person was killed and more than 100 injured in several car
accidents on that street with a crowd of more than 1 million.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Advocates Two-track Policy Within ECOWAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Thursday advocated a "two-track policy" for the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) at the organization's
22nd summit held in Togo's capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out West Africa's huge diversity, Obasanjo suggested
that the ECOWAS should let certain member states to go ahead first
with some programs, while others could take a slower track and
join later.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will take the fast-track in a number of programs, he
told the summit attended by nine presidents and seven presidential
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will take the lead in achieving free movement of
persons, one of ECOWAS's main objectives, by inviting its
neighbors to open and jointly manage common borders, Obasanjo
said.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional power will embark upon the ECOWAS's objective
of free trade zone by freeing trade with its immediate neighbors
first, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, Nigeria will invite Ghana and other
non- CFA franc countries to team up to establish a second
currency, which would subsequently be fused with the CFA franc,
thus achieving the ECOWAS's goal of a single convertible currency.
</P>
<P>
His country will also inter-connect its national electric grids
with that of Benin, Ghana and Togo, with a view to facilitating
the realization of common pool of the sub-region's power
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the security issues, Obasanjo promised that his country will
continue to play a leading role in peacekeeping and conflict
management in the sub- region.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the urgency to establish a permanent machinery in
 preventing and managing the sub-region's conflicts, another focal
point of the summit.

BONN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder Thursday warned Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the
West would abolish the financial help to Russia if Yeltsin was
determined to eliminate Chechen terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"We will make it clear that one cannot demand help from
international financial institutions while going on with the war
at the same time," Schroeder told Germany's ZDF television.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Thursday evening's Foreign Country Journal
television magazine, Schroeder linked the financial aid to Russia
with the stop of its military actions in Chechnya. "The
international pressure (against Russia) must and will go on," said
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya will be included in major issues at the European Union
summit scheduled for later this month in Finland, he said. "The
international society should think about the measures, which will
show our stands clearly," said Schroeder.

LUSAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,500 Angolan refugees
entered Zambia's Western province over the past four days, a
statement from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This sudden increase of refugees followed a brief period
during which the refugee influx appeared to have stabilized.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Angolan refugees in Zambia since early
October has now risen to 7,400.
</P>
<P>
"This development clearly indicates that fighting in Angola's
Moxico province intensified, forcing large numbers of Angolans to
flee from their homes," UNHCR Representative Oluseyi Bajulaiye
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, some 200 Angolan soldiers
were also among the group of new arrivals and they have already

<HEADLINE> Putin: Russia Maintains Good Relations With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said here Thursday that Russia maintains very good relations with
Washington and that U.S. President Bill Clinton's criticism of its
operation in Chechnya "was motivated by the wish to save Russia
additional problems."
</P>
<P>
He rejected suggestions that the Russian government fears
international isolation or the termination of financial aid, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is a great power. It does not and will not fear
anything," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
There has been mounting pressure from the West on Russia's
military operation against rebels in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya. The campaign was launched in September following armed
incursions by Chechen rebels into neighboring Daghestan and a
series of terrorist bombings that killed over 300 people in Moscow
and two other Russian cities. Chechen militants were accused of
planning and staging the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the reaction from Western leaders over Chechnya
might have resulted from "an insufficiency of information about
the situation in the North Caucasus, maybe through our own fault."
</P>
<P>
"Russia is ready to elaborate on its position at any level,"
the prime minister said. "Russia desires to be on friendly terms
with all countries and maintain good-neighbor relations with all."
</P>
<P>
"But if the break-up of the state is the sacrifice for such
relations, we must think long and hard," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Astrophysicists: Uranus, Neptune Born Closer to Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian astrophysicists are
suggesting a new theory on the mysterious birth of Uranus and
Neptune, the two giant ice planets billions of kilometers away
from the sun.
</P>
<P>
In a paper published Thursday in the science journal Nature,
Queen's University scientists suggest the ice giants were born
between 800 million and 1.5 billion kilometers away from the sun.
</P>
<P>
The newly suggested distance is much closer than the present
positions at 2,870,972,200 kilometers from the sun for Uranus and
4,498,252,900 kilometers for Neptune.
</P>
<P>
The huge celestial bodies were then gradually flung outward by
the gravity exerted by the simultaneous formation of the gas
giants Jupiter and Saturn.
</P>
<P>
The theory is a way-out from the traditional paradox that it
would have taken 10 billion years for Neptune to take form at its
present position, while the solar system is only an estimated 4.5
billion years old.
</P>
<P>
The latest theory, a result of a newly devised computer model,
was advanced by Queen's University doctoral student Edward Thommes
and his supervisor, physics department head Martin Duncan.
</P>
<P>
Canadian scientists created computer models of planets with
rocky cores, adding gases to simulate the makeup of Saturn and
Jupiter, and icy particles to imitate Uranus and Neptune.
</P>
<P>
The scientists studied the evolution of their orbits as they
interacted among themselves and with other celestial bodies.
</P>
<P>
In half of the computer simulations, they ended up with a solar
system that looks much like ours, according to the scientists.

WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador Zalman

peace talks starting next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Look, in the Middle East one has to be either an optimist or a
pessimist. I am an optimist," he said in an interview with Fox TV.

His remarks came after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced
Wednesday that Israel and Syria would reopen their peace talks
next week in Washington after 45 months of suspension since 1996.
</P>

Shoval said that if there is peace between Israel and Syria, "
it should be full diplomatic relations, open borders, just as
neighbors should behave to each other."
</P>
<P>
"We do believe, we do hope there's a change now," he added.

<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- As the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region pursues its food security
policy for the new millennium, projections indicate it would face
regional deficit in major commodities such as maize and cereals.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest quarterly bulletin of SADC Food
Security Unit released here Thursday, the region is faced with an
overall cereal deficit of 2.77 million tons for the 1999/2000
marketing year.
</P>
<P>
National level maize surpluses are anticipated only in South
Africa, Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania due to high carry-over
stocks brought over from last agriculture season.
</P>
<P>
Following significant improvements in the 1999 wheat harvests
in South Africa and Zimbabwe, the assessed deficit or imports have
been reduced from earlier amount of 1.19 million tons to 886,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
In the regional food security strategy document, the SADC Food
Security Unit said its main thrust is mainly on strategies for
improving access, availability and nutrition in the region.
</P>
<P>
There is need for a renewed focus on small scale agriculture in
areas where it has a comparative advantage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report for the 1999/2000 season predictions also point to
below normal rains for Tanzania, Namibia and southern Angola.
</P>
<P>
However, climate experts continue to suggest better than
average rainfall for South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique,
Zimbabwe, Malawi and most of Zambia on account of the current La

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama No Guard of Human Right: Tibetan Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dalai is not only a religious figure but also a political one,
who has been engaging himself in the activities aiming to split
Tibet from the motherland after he fled the country in 1959, Ragdi
said.
</P>
<P>
Ragdi made the remark when interviewed by Thai media.
</P>
<P>
Tibet was a slave society 40 years ago under Dalai's rule when
five percent of the one million population were slave owners who
were free to trade, exchange and even torture the rest 95 percent
slaves they owned, Ragdi said.
</P>
<P>
But now, he said, the Tibetan people are their own masters, who
enjoy the right to administrate their own affairs, the right of
education and the right to develop their own culture and religion.
</P>
<P>
For the past 40 years, the central government has been waiting
patiently for Dalai to give up his separatist stance and return
home to do something beneficial to Tibet and the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
But on the contrary, Dalai plotted a series of riots and even
terrorist activities in Tibet, greatly undermining the ethnic
unity, peace and stability of Tibetan society.
</P>
<P>
"Is it ironic that a person like Dalai was given the Nobel
Peace Prize and called 'guard of human right'?" Ragdi said.
</P>
<P>
Ragdi also warned that any government which invites Dalai for
a visit or provides him with a forum is actually interfering with
China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
As for the so-called Tibetan independence, Ragdi said the idea
was fabricated by some imperialists who failed to occupy Tibet by
force in the second half the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China, which has
been exercising sovereignty over the territory since the 13th
century.
</P>
<P>
Even the status of Dalai himself, the 14th spiritual leader of
Tibetan Buddhism, was authorized by the central government at that
time.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that those who advocate the independence of Tibet,
are lack of knowledge about Tibet's history, Ragdi said.
</P>
<P>
Ragdi is here for a five-day visit at the invitation of Thai
Senate Speaker Meechai Ruechupan. It is the first time that a
Tibetan delegation has ever visited Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ragdi held talks with Meechai, president of
the National Assembly and speaker of the House of Representatives
Wan Muhammad Nor Matha and other figures from the parliament and
the religious circle. They exchanged views on issues of common
concern.

He said the situation of the Chechens who were "thrown on the

a process a problem which looks like a colonial problem," said the

<HEADLINE> Bank Of England Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England held
interest rates steady at 5.5 percent Thursday despite signs that
another hike may be needed to slow the UK economy.
</P>
<P>
With signs that consumer demand is slowing and the pound riding
high on the foreign exchange markets, the bank's decision was
widely forecast in the City.
</P>
<P>
The base rate's significance is that it determines the level of
interest rates across the economy -- from mortgages to personal
loans and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
There were quarter-point increases in the base rate in
September and November, taking it from 5 percent to 5.5 percent in
just three months, and many analysts still expect to see it rise
further to about 6 percent early next year.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the decision, Ian Peters, deputy director general
of the British Chambers of Commerce, said, "The bank has taken the
only sensible course of action for UK business."
</P>
<P>
"What the UK economy needs now is a chance to absorb fully the
effects of the previous rate rises," he added.
</P>
<P>
The bank's announcement made little impact in the stock markets
.London's FTSE 100 remained 0.6 percent ahead at 6,658.60 while
the pound was unchanged against the dollar at 1.62 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hezbollah Guerrillas Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, were killed Thursday
in an Israeli air attack in south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two were killed when Israeli warplanes bombed suspected
Hezbollah targets in Iqlim Toufah on the verge of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters
also attacked positions of Israeli forces and its allied South
Lebanon Army (SLA) inside the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the year, a total of 35 Lebanese guerrillas,
mostly from Hezbollah, and 13 Israeli soldiers, have been killed
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation troops and
SLA militiamen out of the country.

<HEADLINE> AL Welcomes Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Thursday
welcomed the upcoming resumption of peace negotiations between
Syria and Israel next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said the
decision was an important step in the Middle East peace process,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed hope that the peace talks would lead to
Syria's recovery of its territory, the Golan Heights, and
ultimately a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle
East under the relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in Washington on
Wednesday that Syria and Israel have agreed to resume their peace
talks next week in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations came to a halt in early 1996
after a series of suicide bombings in Israel by Palestinian
Islamic extremists. Their disputes included a full Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights and security arrangements
following withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967
Israeli-Arab war.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expels Russian Diplomat on Espionage Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department declared on Thursday the Russian
diplomat, Stanislav Borisovic Gusev, who was first identified as a
second secretary and later as an attache in the Russian embassy, "
persona non grata" in Washington by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
"Counterintelligence agents of the FBI and the State Department
's Diplomatic Security Service have worked jointly to neutralize
this intelligence-gathering effort," Assistant Secretary of State
David Carpenter told a special briefing at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
"This episode should be a stark reminder to all of us at
government that despite the thawing of tensions between competing
nations, government facilities and personnel remain a desirable
target for foreign intelligence services," Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
"This matter reinforces the department's belief that its
counterintelligence program must remain a cornerstone of its
overall security posture," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same briefing, Assistant Director Neil
Gallagher of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said the
incident was "a very important story of Russian intelligence
activity within the United States."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said that a U.S. surveillance team made an
observation that Stanislav Gusev was standing in the vicinity of
State Department, and "it took them as a little bit odd."
</P>
<P>
"Over a period of some time, what they identified was that on
a rather frequent basis, each week, Mr. Gusev would show up in the
vicinity of State Department, literally just walking around the
surrounding street," Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
The team also noticed that Gusev's manner in parking his car
and the way that he located -- where he located his car -- was a
little bit unusual, and it suggested to them that this may take on
some more significance, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials said eavesdropping devices were put into
sensitive areas of the State Department, but no such device was
found in Secretary Madeleine Albright's office.
</P>
<P>
Gusev was arrested Wednesday on a bench outside the State
Department, where President Bill Clinton was holding a press
conference. Gusev was later turned to the Russian embassy and
ordered to leave within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was kept informed of the case over the course of
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian authorities ordered the expulsion of a U.S.
diplomat in Moscow, charging that the diplomat, identified as
Cheri Leberknight, has tried to steal Russia's secret military
information.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. law enforcement said that the U.S. move
should not be seen as a retaliation measure. Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder said the arrest of Gusev was not "a question
of any retaliation" for Russia's action, adding, "They are
separate matters."

ADDIS ABABA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Urged to Redouble Efforts in Integration, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) should redouble its efforts to push
forward economic integration and materialize its conflict
management mechanism, Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema, current chairman of the sub-regional organization,
made the appeal at the opening of the 22nd ECOWAS summit, which
was attended by 10 heads of state from the 16 member states.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from 15 west African states, at a meeting
ended Tuesday night, suggested that such a mechanism should
include a Mediation and Security Council, a multinational
stand-by force, and four Zonal Observation Bureaux.
</P>
<P>
The peace in Sierra Leone, control of light-arms are expected
high on the agenda of the two-day session, while the long-desired
mechanism of crisis mediation and prevention will be officially
launched by the summit.
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, the ECOWAS has been criticized
for its tardiness in promoting west Africa's growth and
integration, but it did launch many remarkable activities such as
the ECOWAS traveller's cheques, the west African gas pipeline
project and the sub-regional financial institution the Ecobank.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG has successfully
restored peace in the former war-torn Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The west African sub-regional organization headquartered in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, was established in May 1975 in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The members of the ECOWAS include Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape
Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,
Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone
and Togo.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, the ECOWAS has held 21 summits, with the
last one being held in Abuja in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes Resumption of Israeli-Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Prime Minister Salim
Hoss on Thursday said he welcomed the announcement of resumption
of Israeli-Syrian talks stalled for three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Information Minister Anwar Khalil quoted
Hoss as telling the weekly cabinet session that he hoped talks
between Lebanon and Israel will resume in the near future.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that Israel
and Syria have agreed to resume peace negotiations "at the point
where they left off" in 1996 and the talks will start next week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the U.S. ambassador in Lebanon David
Satterfield transferred a letter from U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, House
Speaker Nabih Berri and Hoss briefing them on the announcement of
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud and Hoss also telephoned Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa respectively to discuss the
latest developments of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the Syrian and Lebanese track have been suspended
since Israeli hardline former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
came to power in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights it
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon asks Israel to pull out its troops unconditionally
from its south where the Jewish state set up a self-styled
security zone in 1985 with the claimed aim to stop cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which keep special ties, have been insisting
that their negotiations with Israel be conducted simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, has a strong
political influence on the country, especially in its policy
toward Israel.

<HEADLINE> Team Formed to Probe U.S. Plane Crash Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A team of Kuwaiti and
U.S. investigators was formed to probe the crash landing of a
U.S. military transport plane at a Kuwaiti airbase early Friday,
said a spokesman for Kuwaiti Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the accident, in which three of the 96
U.S. military personnel on board were killed and 16 others
wounded, occurred as a result of bad weather and a technical
failure in the plane, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Zuhair Abdul Mohsen al-Zamei, deputy director
general of Kuwait's Civil Aviation, the control tower at Kuwait
airport received a Mayday from the C-130 Hercules plane after it
sustained a defect in the main landing gear.
</P>
<P>
The plane crash landed at 02:48 Friday (23:48 GMT Thursday),
after the airport took all necessary precautions including
spraying the runway with foam, Zamei said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry spokesman said the plane was on a routine
mission to transport American military servicemen. Kuwait and the
United States are bound by a joint defense treaty since the 1991
Gulf war that ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.

Chinese, Russian Presidents Confer Again (Wrap-up)
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin held the second round of their informal summit here this
morning after having a short stroll in the Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state continued to confer on the bilateral
friendly and cooperative ties and reached a wide-ranging consensus.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reiterated their mutual support in safeguarding
national unity, sovereign and territorial integrity, and advocate
pushing forward the formation of a multi-polar world on the basis
of the United Nations Charter and existing principles of
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the settlement of the Taiwan issue and China's final
reunification have become "still more pressing" after China
resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Macao on December 20.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin reiterated the Russian government's
consistent adherence to its principled stance on the Taiwan issue
and its support to China's great reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not accept the absurdity that the cross-strait
relationships are "state-to-state relations," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang expressed thanks to the Russian side for its
support to China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, President Jiang re-affirmed that China supports
Russia's move to crack down on terrorism and separatism and
safeguard its national unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen issue is an internal affair of Russia, Jiang said,
emphasizing that no country has the right to intervene in a
sovereign nation's crackdown on the terrorist and splittist
activities within its territory.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government signed the final contract
documents with the Walt Disney Company Friday to provide for the
opening of Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to go ahead with the theme park project was first

Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said at the signing ceremony

Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Disney has gained access to the world's freest economy in
order to do business. What better place could there be?" he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Disneyland is seen as a key step by the government
towards enhancing Hong Kong's attractiveness as a visitor and
tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
"We need to continue to diversify and enrich our tourism
products. Hong Kong Disneyland will be an important anchor for us
to develop further the family travel market," said Mike Rowse,
commissioner for tourism.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that the theme park will serve to attract other
interesting tourism developments in Hong Kong in the years to come,

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- All transport service
providers in Hong Kong are gearing up to ensure the continuous
provision of satisfactory transport services and a smooth
transition during the rollover to the millennium, a senior Hong
Kong transport official announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Assistant Commissioner for
Transport Alan Lui said that all transport service providers,
including Transport Department (TD), Highways Department, railway
corporations, bus companies, ferries, tunnel and parking operators,
had completed Y2K rectification works and developed contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
A well-thought-out sector-wide contingency plan is in hand to
deal with any incidents or disruptions during the rollover, be
they Y2K-induced or not, Lui said.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from these, they have also taken active steps in
undertaking drills and testing to refine the procedures,
organization and resources planning for the contingency planning,"
he added.
</P>

cooperation is in the interest of the two countries' development
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks here in a
speech at a reception hosted in his honor by Japan's Federation of
Economic Organizations (Keidanren).
</P>
<P>
China and Japan have made remarkable achievements in economic

economic relations have entered a period of stable development.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been China's largest trade partner for six years,
while China has become Japan's second largest trade partner, Li
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is conducive to the
development of the economies and good-neighborliness of the two
countries and to the stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific
region and the world at large, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Japan, two neighbors separated by a
strip of water, have similar cultures and traditions. He added

experience and abundant capital, can supplement China's needs in
economic development.

at the reception that Japan-China relationship is most important
for the Japanese economic community in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE>   OFW 1999 Remittances Could Hit 10-B U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange remittances by
overseas Filipino workers (OFW) this year could hit 10 billion U.S.
dollars, the Philippine government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The projection was based on records of the Department of Labor
and Employment (DOLE) which showed that for the January-July
period alone, remittances had already reached 4.7 billion dollars,
some 1.7 billion dollars more than remittances for the same period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
OFW remittances for the second half of the year usually are
bigger as many of them go home to spend the Christmas holidays
with their families.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 OFWs are expected to come home this year,
according to DOLE.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Blas Ople urged the government to create more
benefit programs for OFWs whose remittances have served to support
the domestic economy, particularly during the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The support extended by OFWs to the economy and the nation
must
find commensurate response in terms of improved services and
lifetime benefits," Ople said.
</P>
<P>
Current programs for OFWs include warm official welcome and
efficient services at Customs desks at their points of entry, and
special opportunities for small businesses for the retiring among
them.
</P>
<P>
Ople called for faster action on proposal to create new
services for OFWs, including the establishment of a special bank,
a hospital and a housing program for them.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed that under his leadership, the senate will pass a
law extending them voting rights as mandated by the constitution.

<HEADLINE> France: British Proposal on Iraq Needs Clarification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- France said Friday that the
British proposal on suspending U.N. sanctions against Iraq needs
to be clarified, especially the preconditions for a permanent
lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The British have presented a new draft resolution coming out
from the discussion of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council. Difficulties remains on certain important points,
especially on the mechanism for suspending the sanctions," French
Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau said.
</P>
<P>
The British draft resolution proposes that economic sanctions
against Iraq be suspended for a renewable period of 120 days if
Baghdad "cooperates fully" with a new U.N. supervisory authority
of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"This text could be clarified and more precise. Especially it
should point out the difference between a temporary suspension and
a definite lifting of sanctions," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that France always wishes the U.N. Security Council
will unanimously adopt a resolution on establishing a new
authority for supervising disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will vote on Saturday on a new resolution
on Iraq, after Baghdad rejected last week a British-initiated
resolution which extended for only one week the "oil for food"
program.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell some oil products in exchange
for food and other daily necessities.

PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Europe's new Ariane-5 rocket
began its maiden commercial flight Friday, sending a scientific
satellite into orbit from the Kourou space center in French Guiana.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Ruling Party Plays Down Official's Defection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan ruling People's
Alliance (PA) government on Friday played down the defection of a
deputy minister to the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
in the run-up to the December 21 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told a press briefing that
the defection of P. Chandrasekaran, deputy minister of estate
infrastructure, was "absolutely negligible."
</P>
<P>
Chandrasekaran, who heads a party representing the minority
Tamil estate workers, resigned Tuesday and pledged to defeat
President Chandrika Kumaratunga who is seeking reelection.
</P>
<P>
However, Samaraweera, also PA campaign manager, said he was
confident President Kumaratunga would be reelected at the polls.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the resignation of Chandrasekaran to a power
struggle and Tamil rebels' pressure.
</P>
<P>
He said the resignation of Chandrasekaran was due to his
unfulfilled desire to succeed the late Minister S. Thondaman.
</P>
<P>
He said Chandrasekaran had also been under pressure from Tamil
rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to support the
UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, the main rival to the incumbent
Kumaratunga in the election.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old civil war fought
between majority Sinhalese-dominated government troops and LTTE
rebels who demand a separate state for minority Tamils in the
country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
How to end the ethnic conflict and bring peace have been the
major topics during the campaign period since November 16 when a
record number of 13 candidates filed nominations for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera on Friday unveiled a brochure written by President
Kumaratunga, entitled "The Ethnic Question &AMP; the War."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Kumaratunga's stand of ending ethnic conflict by
meaningful devolution and challenged Wickremesinghe to take up
with his version of solution to the burning ethnic issue.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe was not immediately available to comment on the
challenge but he might respond at election rallies ahead of the
election.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says Its Airports Y2K-Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

KUALA LUMPUR, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's all five
international and 15 domestic airports as well as 17 short take-

the country's airports, beginning September last year, Adnan
Shamsuddin, the company's Executive Director, said in a statement.

"We are well aware that the air transport industry is an area
that many people are concerned about, and on our part we have made
every effort to ensure that all our airports are Y2K-ready," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since July this year when the Ministry of Energy,
Communications and Multimedia verified the company's network of
airports as being 99.7 percent Y2K-ready in July this year, "we
had stepped up our preparations. Representatives from the ministry
had been conducting regular checks and endorsed our networks as
100 percent Y2K-ready on November 5 this year," he said.

s Y2K program included passenger, runway and terminal building
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Even though Malaysia's airports are 100 percent Y2K-
ready, we have a well-thought-out plan to ensure continuity of
operations and minimize any foreseeable risks in the event that a
glitch occurs. We will have a full-fledged force during this
period at all airports to manage any contingency."

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Adopts Treaty to Curb Financing of Terrorist Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Taking a new step in
international efforts to combat terrorism, the 188-member General
Assembly has adopted a new treaty that would make it a crime to
provide financing for terrorist activities, the U.N. said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a series of resolutions recommended by its Sixth
Committee, which is in charge of legal affairs, the assembly
Thursday afternoon adopted without a vote the International
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In approving this measure, the General Assembly said that the
number and seriousness of acts of international terrorism depended
on the financing that terrorists might get and that existing
multilateral treaties did not expressly address such funding.
</P>
<P>
According to the convention, it is a crime for anyone to
provide or collect funds to be used to carry out acts that are
considered terrorist activities, as defined by existing treaties.
Any other act intended to kill or harm civilians in order to
intimidate them or a government or international organization
would also fall under the treaty's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also compels countries to confiscate funds found to
be intended for use in terrorist activities and to investigate
information that a person who has or is alleged to have committed
such a crime is in its territory.
</P>
<P>
In a related resolution on measures to eliminate international
terrorism, the General Assembly strongly condemned terrorism as "
criminal and unjustifiable" and called on countries to refrain
from "financing, encouraging, provide training for or otherwise
supporting" such activities.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged countries to ratify the relevant
multilateral treaties on terrorism and to adopt measures to
prevent such crimes and to share information about them.
</P>
<P>
Among other actions Thursday afternoon, the General Assembly
adopted resolutions on the convention on jurisdictional immunities
of states and their property; the U.N. assistance program on
international law and the reports of the International Law
Commission and the U.N. Commission on International Trade Law.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council to Renew Iraq's Oil-For-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council is expected Friday to renew the oil-for-food
program in Iraq for another period of six months.
</P>
<P>
U.N. diplomats said the 15-member Security Council has reached
consensus on the renewal of the program under which Iraq is
allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil and use 300
million U.S. dollars of the oil revenues to import equipment and
spare parts for its oil dilapidated industry.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations Saeed Hasan has said
that his country would accept the straightforward rollover of the
program and would resume the oil exports once the oil price
mechanism is submitted and approved.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended oil export on November 24 to protest against a
U.N. resolution on the two-week extension of phase six of the deal
which should have expired on November 20. The Security Council
last Friday extended the program for an additional week until
December 11.
</P>
<P>
It is widely see here the stopgaps are the attempts by the
United States and Britain to pressure the Security Council to
reach an agreement on a new comprehensive policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The policy seeks to create a new weapons inspection regime in
Iraq to replace the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Weapons inspectors from the UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq days
before the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq last December
and Iraq has barred them from returning to resume their regular
work.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Uncover Hamas Bomb-Making Hoard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police uncovered
a stash of bomb-making material belonging to Hamas militants in
the West Bank city of Hebron, senior Palestinian security
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian security police in Hebron seized a few days
ago 300 kilograms of raw material that could be used to make
explosives and a large amount of electrical equipment and
equipment to detonate explosives, local media quoted an official,
who was not identified, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the material, which was very sensitive and liable to
explode if shaken or moved too hard, was found in an apartment in
a crowed residential area in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hamas - the Islamic Resistance Movement - which opposes the
Israel-Palestinian peace talks, has killed scores of Israelis in
suicide bombings since a landmark interim peace deal was stricken
between the two sides in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police were acting on information which
Israeli security police extracted from a detainee from Hamas's
military wing, the Izzdeen Al-Qassam Brigades, another
Palestinian security official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that several arrests had been made in Hebron after
discovering of the bomb-making hoard.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Qassam Brigades threatened to renew attacks on
Israel in response to Jewish settlement policies. But this
militant group has not staged a major bombing against Israel in
over a year due to arrests and tight security by the Palestinian
police.

<HEADLINE> Russia Puts More New Strategic Missiles on Combat Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Another regiment of the Russian
Strategic Rocket Force equipped with 10 advanced Topol-M
intercontinental ballistic missiles was put on combat duty Friday,
said a top Russian military official.
</P>
<P>
The regiment began its combat duty at 3 p.m. Moscow time and it
is the second strategic rocketry regiment deployed at Tatishchevo,
the Saratov region, said Colonel General Vladimir Yakovlev,
commander-in-chief of the Russian Strategic Rocket Force, at a
ceremony in Tatischevo.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Russian Defense Ministry, the government and
the presidential administration also attended the Friday ceremony
</P>
<P>
The first such regiment of the Tatischevo division has been
staying in the Saratov region since December of 1998, said the
Russian Strategic Rocket Forces Press Service.
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Yakovlev said that the Topol-M is the
only missile system developed for his force and the first one
developed solely by Russian experts. The system concentrates all
the R and D achievements of Russian rocket-making, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Topol-M is 50-100 percent superior to missile systems of
the previous generations in all key combat readiness parameters
and 150-200 percent superior in strike efficiency, said Yakovlev.
</P>
<P>
The system, which has a standard solid fuel missile that can be
stationed in a silo or on a carrier, permits the formation of a
grouping that will be able to operate in various military
political conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commander said that Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, who reminded Washington Thursday that Russia was a
nuclear power, simply meant "Russian nuclear arms are a means of
deterrence."
</P>
<P>
Russia's nuclear stockpiles "were, are and will be weapons of
deterrence," he told reporters, commenting on a statement, in
which Yeltsin responded to U.S. President Bill Clinton's harsh
criticism on Russia's military action in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, as supreme commander in chief, was
speaking about the weapons of deterrence that Russia possesses,"
Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "is perfectly well aware of the current situation in
the missile forces and is aware that another regiment is being
implemented for combat duty."
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev said Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles were
no longer targeted at the United States under a deal with
Washington.

GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee expressed their confidence Friday in next year's Sydney
Games while dismissing as minor the problems resulting from the
controversial premium package program.
</P>
<P>
Sydney organizers SOCOG have seen their hospitality ticketing
program, involving 200,000 tickets, backfire as sporting company
Reebok terminated its sponsorship and Olympic host broadcaster
Channel Seven suspended its agreement with the organizers.
</P>
<P>
But after a conference call with SOCOG, Jacques Rogge, head of
the IOC commission coordinating Games organization, said virtually
all the Sydney facilities were ready and the infrastructure was in
place.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely confident that despite these little
difficulties the Games will be a success," said the leading
official.
</P>
<P>
"In the same period nine months before the (1976) Games in
Montreal we didn't know whether there was going to be an Olympic
Stadium because of a construction strike. Four years later we were
struggling to know whether there would be Games because of the (U.
S-led) boycott.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of today are minor compared to those we have had
in the past." said Rogge.

BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's personal computer
market has entered a period of readjustment characterized by a
lower but steady growth rate since 1998, after seven previous
years of rapid development, said an expert from the Ministry of
Information Industry (MII).
</P>
<P>
Wang Lintong, with the Computer and Micro-electric Development
and Research Center under the MII, said a seminar here today that
the growth period will last through 2000, with an estimated
average annual growth rate of 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1997 period, the rate for PC sales volume
jumped by 56.8 percent every year.
</P>
<P>
"But the growth rate is going to slow down as the overall
economic growth rate is lowering somewhat and the consumers are
more rational about buying PCs," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total number of PCs installed in the country
is expected to reach 16 million by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the total sales volume of PCs is estimated at 170
billion yuan, an increase of 14.9 percent from last year, and in
2000, the figure will increase by 17.6 percent to reach 200
billion yuan, he predicted.

On his part, Obuchi said that the relations between Japan and
China have been growing despite their different social systems.

<HEADLINE> HK Transport Sector Prepared for Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- All transport service
providers in Hong Kong are gearing up to ensure the continuous
provision of satisfactory transport services and a smooth
transition during the rollover to the millennium, a senior Hong
Kong transport official announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Assistant Commissioner for
Transport Alan Lui said that all transport service providers,
including Transport Department (TD), Highways Department, railway
corporations, bus companies, ferries, tunnel and parking operators,
had completed Y2K rectification works and developed contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
A well-thought-out sector-wide contingency plan is in hand to
deal with any incidents or disruptions during the rollover, be
they Y2K-induced or not, Lui said.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from these, they have also taken active steps in
undertaking drills and testing to refine the procedures,
organization and resources planning for the contingency planning,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
To monitor the transition into the millennium, TD's Emergency
Transport Coordination Center (ETCC) will be set up from 8 pm on
December 31, 1999, and may be in operation until January 3, 2000,
the first working day of the year, according to Lui.
</P>
<P>
Lui said the center will maintain close liaison with transport
service providers and concerned government departments to ensure
that the provision of transport services is smooth and
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"Each transport service provider will set up its command center
for direct liaison and communication with ETCC," he said. "To
enhance coordination, representatives from the police and major
public transport operators will also station at ETCC."
</P>
<P>
The entire sector will deploy an additional 2,000 staff to
monitor the provision of services, to standby for urgent
rectification and recovery works and to implement contingency
measures as necessary during the rollover, according to Lui.
</P>
<P>
Lui called for the public's cooperation in keeping everything
smooth during the Christmas and New Year period, when "both
passenger and vehicular traffic will be much busier than usual."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public are strongly advised to make use of
public transport as much as possible and give up their own
vehicles to avoid congestion," Lui said.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Protests U.S. Support of Taiwan in WHO (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China today lodged a strong
protest against U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent signing of
two bills in support of Taiwan's participation in the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi made the protest in a
meeting with the Charge d'affaires of the U.S. embassy in China G.
Eugene Martin today.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that President Clinton disregarded the Chinese
opposition to the matter when he signed the bills, saying that the
U.S. State Department will report to the U.S. Congress the various
governmental departments' support of Taiwan's participation in
international organizations, especially the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, President Clinton also signed the Omnibus Act,
containing clauses in support of Taiwan's participation in the WHO,
and saying that the U.S. State Department will submit a report
every half year to Congress on the efforts of governmental
departments' support of Taiwan's participation in the
international organizations which are composed of sovereign states,
according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
"I, entrusted by the Chinese government, have lodged strong
protest against the U.S. government's acts of seriously infringing
upon China's sovereignty and grossly interfering in China's
internal affairs," the Chinese vice-foreign minister said.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Protests U.S. Support of Taiwan in WHO (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yang pointed out that Taiwan is a province of China, and under
international law does not have the right to join the
international organizations for which statehood is required. He
added that the U.S. government has made a clear commitment to the
Chinese government and people that it would not support Taiwan's
membership in these world organizations.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. bills which support Taiwan's participation in the
World Health Organization and other international bodies of which
statehood is a condition of entry are playing semantics in order
to help Taiwan to squeeze into them and bolster Taiwan's expanded
activities in the international arena and create "two Chinas" and
"one China, one Taiwan," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. government's action completely violates
the principles of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and
relevant commitments made by the U.S., and is also a serious
obstruction to China's reunification, and a wanton trampling on
basic norms of international relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have expressed their strong
resentment and firm opposition to this, Yang said.

Yang stressed that it is the common aspiration of all the
Chinese people including the Taiwan compatriots to settle the
issue of Taiwan and accomplish the reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are ready and able to achieve
the total reunification of the nation, and no one can stop this,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the Taiwan issue is the most important and
sensitive in Sino-U.S. relations, and the U.S. side knows this
clearly.
</P>
<P>
China solemnly demands that the U.S. strictly abide by the "one
China" policy, observe the three joint communiques and relevant
commitments, take concrete steps to correct its wrong-doings and
never support Taiwan's entry into the WHO and other international
bodies in which only a sovereign state can join; if it does, it
must be prepared for serious consequences, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-foreign minister urged Martin to immediately
report China's solemn representations and strong protest to the U.
S. government.
</P>

In reply, Martin said that he will immediately do so, according

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- SOCOG will sell 118,000
tickets to the Olympic opening ceremony dress rehearsal to help
make up funding shortfall caused by the axing of its premium
package program to appease sponsors, Australia's Nine TV Network
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The TV report said that the rehearsal will be staged two days
before the main event and including everything except the athletes,
speeches, and lighting of the Olympic flame.
</P>
<P>
The September 13 dress rehearsal is expected to be a sell-out,
raising 20 million Australian dollars (13.2 million U.S. dollars)
for the coffers of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG).
</P>
<P>
Olympic organisers are still facing a 140-million-Australian
dollar (92.4 million U.S. dollars) sponsorship shortfall, worsened
by the decision to end its controversial hospitality ticketing
program to appease the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The decision to axe the hospitality program came after sporting
giant Reebok this week terminated its sponsorship with SOCOG and
launched legal action for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
And it was revealed on Thursday that Olympic host broadcaster
Channel Seven had not yet signed its sponsorship agreement with
SOCOG and had cancelled all Olympic ads on its network pending
talks between the two parties on Friday.

<HEADLINE> HK Celebrities Condemn Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of celebrities on
politics, science, law, religion and business in Hong Kong Friday
gathered here to strongly condemn Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Participants to a forum on refuting Falun Gong, which was
sponsored by the Hong Kong-based Chinese newspaper Wen Wei Po,
strongly condemned it as an organization which spreads malicious
fallacies which are harmful to people's minds and bodies.
</P>
<P>
They warned Hong Kong residents be guard against that some
persons in Hong Kong are attempting to create social disturbances
and to undermine the stability of Hong Kong in resort of China's
ban on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, there are some people who have spread
fallacies attacking China's handling of Falun Gong in accordance
with law. Close attention should be paid to this issue," said Liu
Zaiming, director and editor-in-chief of the newspaper in his
opening remarks at the forum, the first of its kind that has ever
been held in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Participants called on the followers in Hong Kong not to enter
the mainland to spread malicious fallacies or to organize any
activities of supporting Falun Gong, warning that anyone who
violates the law of the mainland will be punished in accordance
with the law of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to refute Falun Gong in Hong Kong in order to
uphold the concept of 'One Country, Two Systems' and to maintain
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," said Dr. Tsang Hin Chi,
member of the Standing committee of the Ninth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Chu Lien Fan, member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and managing director
of Tung Wui Securities Co. Ltd., said that Hong Kong people need
to understand that Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong,
concocted Falun Gong in order to destroy people's minds and
disturb public order and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Chun Meng Siu said that he firmly supports China's ban on the
illegal Falun Gong. Falun Gong deceives its followers by misusing
Buddhist terminology, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
By citing the numerous examples of cracking down various kinds
of cults around the world, participants said that the correct
handling of Falun Gong by the Chinese government is fully in line
with the world trends of modern civilization.

<HEADLINE> Manila Welcomes U.S. Senator's Support for Toxic Waste Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Friday welcomed the call of American Senator Richard Lugar for the
U.S. government to address its obligation in the clean-up of
former U.S. bases in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said the statement of
Lugar in his letter to U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen "is
certainly in line with the Philippine government's adoption of a
two-pronged approach towards the resolution of the hazardous waste
issue."
</P>
<P>
"The Philippine government welcomes Senator Lugar in his letter
to Defense Secretary Cohen, a copy of which has been provided to
the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the Philippine embassy
in Washington," Barican said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"His letter supports the Philippine position that the United
States should address its obligations in the former U.S. bases,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government, according to Barican, is hopeful
that Lugar's letter will prompt the U.S. government to act on the
issue of flushing out alleged toxic materials left behind at Clark
and Subic bases.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the letter of Senator Lugar will create
significant attention and interest in the U.S. Congress that would
go beyond rhetorical support of the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has taken twin steps to address the
issue of toxic waste contamination at the two former installations
of the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Through the Philippine Task Force on Hazardous Wastes in the
former military bases, the government has adopted concrete steps
to address the issue while pursuing at the same time efforts to
secure the cooperation of Washington in the clean-up.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops vacated their bases in Clark and Subic after
the rejection in 1992 by the Philippine Senate of the Philippines-
U.S.Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Security which could
have further prolonged the stay of Americans in their military
facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Various environmental groups have been calling on the U.S.
government to facilitate the clean-up of the toxic wastes left
behind by the American troops, but no commitment has been given by
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Book on Life of Hong Kong and Macao Entrepreneur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held in Beijing
this afternoon to launch a book featuring the life of Stanley Ho,
a well-known entrepreneur in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The album is a gift to celebrate the return of Macao to the
motherland on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
head of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and Guo Chaoren, President
of Xinhua News Agency, attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Published by Xinhua Publishing House, the book in English and
Chinese is simply entitled "Stanley Ho". There are over 200
photographs and a 40,000 word text. The book mirrors Dr. Stanely's
colorful life, his contributions to Macao's economic growth and
Macao's pending return to China.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee, and Ye Xuanping, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee, wrote inscriptions for the book. Wang Zhaoguo
wrote the foreword.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ho enjoys enormous prestige in Hong Kong and Macao.
Born in Hong Kong in November 1921, he started his business career
in Macao. Ho is now a member of the Standing Committee of the
CPPCC National Committee and a vice-chairman of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Ho founded Shun Tak Holdings Limited in Hong Kong, a shipping
company that operates between Hong Kong and Macao. Ho owns the
world's largest jetfoil fleet. In 1962, Ho founded a tourism and
entertainment business (Sociedade de Turismo d Diversoes De Macau,
S.A.R.L.).
</P>
<P>
Ho has invested more than 10 billion yuan in real estate and
tourist projects in several major cities in China since the 1980s.
Ho has also set up scholarships at the University of Macao. He
donated a huge amount of money to build the Macao Culture Plaza
which will be the venue for the grand handover ceremony on
December 20. Ho also invested one billion Hong Kong dollars in
building a view tower in Macao, ranked as one of the world's ten
major sightseeing towers.
</P>
<P>
Cai Mingzhao, deputy president of Xinhua, said Macao's return
to China in 10 days is another major event for the people of China
after Hong Kong's return in 1997. Both Hong Kong's return to China
and Macao's pending handover aptly illustrate the success of the "
one country, two systems" policy advocated and implemented by Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ho pledged at today's ceremony that he would continue
to promote Macao's economic prosperity and stability, support
China's modernization and promote the relations of both China's
inland areas and Macao with the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Golan Heights Withdrawal Divides Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Public opinion in Israel is
split down the middle on whether to return all of the Golan
Heights to Syria, according to polls published Friday ahead of
the high-level Israeli-Syrian peace talks in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
The 560 Israeli adults surveyed in a Gallup poll for the
newspaper Maariv were split 46 percent to 46 percent on Israel's
full withdrawal from the Heights which it occupied in the 1967
Middle East War. Eight percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
Another poll, conducted by Dahaf Institute for Yedioth Ahronoth
among 502 Israelis, showed that 54 percent were against a full
withdrawal and 45 percent in favor. But 57 percent said they
supported a pullout from "nearly all" of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The two polls, conducted Thursday night, envisaged a deal that
will also enable Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq Al-Sharaa will meet in Washington next week on resumption
of peace talks between the two sides, which stalled almost four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mina Tzemah, who heads the Dahaf Institute, said Israelis
will have a clearer idea of how they feel once the terms of any
agreement are published.
</P>
<P>
The polls forecast that a planned referendum on any peace deal
may elicit the overwhelming support which Barak predicts.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israeli leader manages to forge a deal that overcomes
the psychological barriers, there truly could be an overwhelming
majority for Barak," Mina said.
</P>
<P>
Indicative of the split in the Israeli public, leaders of the
Jewish settlers on the Golan Heights began planning a public
campaign to stop the handover while Israel's leading peace group
Peace Now planned a drive of its own.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now advertisement in the newspaper Haaretz Friday urged
Barak to go ahead with the peace talks with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the majority in Israel supports
your historic decisions. As you depart for the meetings in
Washington, we all say: go in peace and return with peace...Peace
is greater than the Golan Heights," it said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Confident of Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's top consultant Li
Ruihuan said Friday that there should be a long-term friendly
cooperative relationship between China and Japan as the two
neighbors have a long history of cultural exchanges and a strongly
complementary economy.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, Li,
Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the two countries
should realize the favorable conditions for bilateral friendship,
draw lessons from history, and make efforts to enable the two
peoples to be friendly with each other from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should expand channels of exchanges, boost
people-to-people contacts, especially those between the two
countries' gross-roots institutions, Li said, adding that the
purpose of his current visit to Japan is to deepen mutual
understanding, enhance friendship and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Calling Kono an old friend to the Chinese people, Li expressed
thanks to the Japanese foreign minister for his contributions to
the development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Kono agreed with Li's view on bilateral ties, saying that the
two countries had established a new bilateral relationship thanks
to the joint efforts made by the two countries' politicians of
older generation.
</P>
<P>
We should not forget those politicians, neither should we
forget the unfortunate period of history between our two countries,
Kono said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the two countries now enjoy stable ties and
deepened mutual understanding, Kono voiced the hope that more
exchanges between the two peoples would be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on an official good-will visit to Japan, later met
separately with former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,
Social Democratic Party Chairwoman Doi Takako and Japanese
Communist Party Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa. The Chinese leader
exchanged views with the Japanese politicians on bilateral ties,
and on issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Greater Access Called to Medicine in Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Medecins Sans Frontieres
(MSF), an international medical relief organization, Friday urged
international pharmaceutical companies and governments to do more
to fight diseases in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
MSF Hong Kong Director Olivier Bonnet said at a media briefing
Friday in Hong Kong's Admiralty Center that the issue of access to
life saving drugs is marginalizing much of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing inequality in access to essential drugs
between people living in developed countries and those living in
the developing countries," he said. "Each day medical exclusion is
the very first border MSF teams must overcome despite the fact
that medicine has such huge steps during this last century."
</P>
<P>
People have died because the drugs to treat these diseases do
not exist anymore, and this is because making them is not
financially lucrative for the drug companies or because they are
no longer effective, Bonnet added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of the 17 million deaths from infectious
diseases every year throughout the world, 1.2 percent occur in
industrialized countries and 43 percent in less developed
countries, and more than 75 percent of the world's population
living in the developing countries use only 15 percent of the
total amount of drugs produced in the world.
</P>
<P>
Between 1975 and 1997, only 11 out of the 1,233 new medicines
brought to the market were specially designed to treat tropical
diseases and out of the 11 only 4 have come from original research
conducted by drug companies, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Dr. R. Lasserre, MSF Hong Kong's medical adviser, emphasized
that tropical diseases always rank lowest in the priorities of
research and development in the pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
This is an issue that the people in Hong Kong should be
concerned about because although most people were affected in
developing countries everyone is at risk, Lasserre said. People in
Hong Kong are often exposed to malaria, tuberculosis and dengue
fever if they travel around the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1971 by a group of French doctors who wanted to
create an international medical relief agency, MSF was not bound
by restrictions and conventions and could cross borders to help
people in need, according to Lasserre.
</P>
<P>
As a medical emergency organization, it is now present in over
80 countries around the world with over 400 medical assistant
projects.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Restrict Black Market with Tickets Database </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- FIFA will reduce the number of
tickets hitting the black market by using a database to record the
names and addresses of buyers.
</P>
<P>
David Wills, a FIFA vice-president and head of the 2002 World
Cup ticketing sub-committee, said that they adopt the database in
a bid to restrict if not remove the black market of the 2002 World
Cup tickets.
</P>
<P>
Wills said earlier this week here for the World Cup preliminary
draw that they will restrict sales at the end point, where they
are finally sold, to four tickets per person, who will have his
details entered into a database.
</P>
<P>
FIFA hoped to have its ticketing strategy in place by March,
and to start selling tickets by September or October next year,
added Will.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 World Cup in France produced a huge black market for
tickets after 65 percent were sold in the host country.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Authority "Positively" Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) is positively viewing the resumption of
Israeli-Syrian talks, Palestinian chief negotiator for the
transition phase Saeb Erekat has said.
</P>
<P>
He added the PNA is not worried that the resumption of
Israeli-Syrian talks will undermine the peace making on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
In statements to Voice of Israel radio, Erekat pointed out that
the move will positively reflect on Palestinian-Syrian relations
and will alleviate tension between the two parties, besides
reducing tension in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said everybody is aware of the special character of
the Palestinian track, which is the crux of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, adding Israel can proceed along all tracks.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that
Israeli-Syrian negotiations, suspended since February 1996, will
be resumed next week in Washington when Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak meets with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration and the Israeli government reassured
the Palestinian side that such development will not affect the
Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Palestinian relations with each of Syria
and Lebanon have been characterized with tension ever since the
conclusion of its 1993 Oslo interim peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tensions recently became more acute when the Lebanese
authorities arrested a number of officials of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement in Palestinian refugee
camps in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Erekat called upon Israel to release
Palestinian prisoners on the occasion of the Muslim month of
fasting, Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The Sharm El Sheikh memorandum stipulated that Israel will
release the third group of 1,500 Palestinian prisoners before the
advent of Ramadan which already began Thursday.

SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Three officers and a driver
from Singapore Immigration and Registration (SIR) were charged in

<HEADLINE> HK Celebrities Condemn Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of celebrities on
politics, science, law, religion and business in Hong Kong Friday
gathered here to strongly condemn Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Participants to a forum on refuting Falun Gong, which was
sponsored by the Hong Kong-based Chinese newspaper Wen Wei Po,
strongly condemned it as an organization which spreads malicious
fallacies which are harmful to people's minds and bodies.
</P>
<P>
They warned Hong Kong residents be guard against that some
persons in Hong Kong are attempting to create social disturbances
and to undermine the stability of Hong Kong in resort of China's
ban on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, there are some people who have spread
fallacies attacking China's handling of Falun Gong in accordance
with law. Close attention should be paid to this issue," said Liu
Zaiming, director and editor-in-chief of the newspaper in his
opening remarks at the forum, the first of its kind that has ever
been held in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Participants called on the followers in Hong Kong not to enter
the mainland to spread malicious fallacies or to organize any
activities of supporting Falun Gong, warning that anyone who
violates the law of the mainland will be punished in accordance
with the law of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to refute Falun Gong in Hong Kong in order to
uphold the concept of 'One Country, Two Systems' and to maintain
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," said Dr. Tsang Hin Chi,
member of the Standing committee of the Ninth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Chu Lien Fan, member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and managing director
of Tung Wui Securities Co. Ltd., said that Hong Kong people need
to understand that Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong,
concocted Falun Gong in order to destroy people's minds and
disturb public order and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Chun Meng Siu said that he firmly supports China's ban on the
illegal Falun Gong. Falun Gong deceives its followers by misusing
Buddhist terminology, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
By citing the numerous examples of cracking down various kinds
of cults around the world, participants said that the correct
handling of Falun Gong by the Chinese government is fully in line
with the world trends of modern civilization.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market's Bull Run Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Stock Market's
bull run continued Friday with the benchmark Straits Time Index (
STI) rising by 23.33 points to end at 2,395.44 points, its fifth
consecutive all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Overall turnover fell to 348.06 million units valued at 798.59
million Singapore dollars (475.92 million U.S. dollars) with
declining issues edging out advancers by 161 to 140 while 169
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
RafflesH topped the volume list with a turnover of 67.75
million units. It was followed by MfgIntegTec which had 25.77
million shares done. TPV, transacted at 1.48 Hong Kong dollars
per share, was the next with 25.02 million counters changing
hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 was the biggest gainer of the day roaring up 260
cents to close at 32.00 Singapore dollars. DBS and Venture jumped
up 90 cents to finish at 24.70 and 20.50 Singapore dollars
respectively. Datacrft and PacCent ran up 80 cents to end at 6.60

sank 80 cents to finish at 5.00 Hong Kong dollars and 35.50
Singapore dollars respectively. F&AMP;N fell 55 cents to end at 6.80

</P>
<P>
Brokers noted the STI bulldozed its way to new record high for
the fifth consecutive day in the week, rising today nearly one
percent on a week-long wave of jubilant sentiment.
</P>
<P>
They attributed today's rally to a glowing outlook for the
local economy and to international funds wanting to take positions
ahead of the millennium changeover.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts and investors seem to think that stock market has
yet to move into "overvalued" territory despite a 7.5 percent
surge in just five days.
</P>
<P>
However, brokers noted, some stocks consolidated after their
strong run-up this week and on broader market declines led
advances although selected electronics shares and blue chip stocks
continued their upward move.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Michael Doohan Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Michael Doohan,
who won the 500cc motorcycling championship five times between
1994 and 1998, announced his retirement from the sport on Friday,
according to reports from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Doohan said he had decided to quit because of
continuing injury problems since his high-speed crash in
qualifying for this year's Spanish grand prix.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, who ranks as one of motorcycling's greatest ever riders,
has endured a succession of operations and corrective surgery
since crashing at Jerez in Spain but all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The Australian said: "I had hoped to continue racing but
unfortunately it's not possible.
</P>
<P>
"Since the crash I've had three operations and I've done
everything I can to get back to full fitness and now I've got to
accept that my body is not up to racing a 500 again."
</P>
<P>
But Doohan said he planned to retain a strong involvement in
the sport with the Honda Racing Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Before his 1999 season came to a sudden halt, Doohan had
competed in 137 grands prix, winning 54, second only to Italian
legend Giacomo Agostini.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Afghans Face Hunger: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Millions of poor Afghans in
urban and rural areas may not be able to get enough food to feed
their families if the price of wheat does not decrease
significantly, the World Food Program (WFP) for Afghanistan warned
Friday here.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the WFP officials expressed extreme concern
about the increasing cost of wheat in Afghanistan, which follows a
bad harvest, the reduction of trade across the Afghan border and
speculation in Afghan markets.
</P>
<P>
Prices have continually increased since the beginning of
October and reached their highest level in the second week of
December. In Kabul and Kandahar, flour prices have gone up by over
80 percent in the past ten weeks. In some other area, prices have
soared by over 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The aid community will not be able to meet the entire food
needs of millions of Afghans, WFP emphasized. Pakistan is the
major wheat supplier to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Twenty to 40 percent of household in Kandahar, Kabul and
various food insecure rural areas have already been affected by
the increase of wheat prices, the statement estimated.
</P>
<P>
Late November the Iranian authorities agreed to reopen the
border with Afghanistan. While prices in some Afghan cities
initially fell at that news, they began to shoot up again one week
after the announcement due to limited inflows of wheat.
</P>
<P>
According to the WFP, seven trucks a day, with a capacity of 40
metric tons, are entering Afghanistan from Iran carrying wheat and
another seven trucks a day are from Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
WFP is currently considering how to respond to the situation in
Afghanistan, said the statement, which added that only an increase
in food supplies from neighboring countries will reduce wheat
prices and prevent a major threat to vulnerable Afghans.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Membership A Burning Issue for EU: Parliament Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament President
Nicole Fontaine said Friday that the position of the European
Union (EU) on the status of Turkey is a burning issue at present
for the 15-nation bloc's enlargement process and its future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the EU summit meeting here, the head of the EU
supervisory branch said Turkey's application for EU membership "
presents a dilemma in simple terms" despite endorsement by many EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
"If the answer were in the end to be negative, Turkey, with its
long-standing patience exhausted, could only look to other avenues
for the future, entailing considerable geopolitical risks," she
told the EU leaders who are gathering here for the historical
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, if it were one day to join the Union, its
accession would of course be to the Union's advantage economically
and politically, but it would not be possible to evade the problem
of cultural integration," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Other issue will also arise, such as what criteria to adopt to
determine the limits of Europe's new borders in face of new
applications from countries to the east or south of the Union
which would inevitably be encouraged by Turkey's accession," the
president added.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders are trying to tackle the Turkey issue in their
first-day meeting of the two-day summit. Observers here said it's
hard for them to reach a consensus because Greece has set
preconditions for Turkey's status as a EU member in the future.
</P>
<P>
But Finland, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, is
optimistic about the issue.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the summit, Turkey warned Greece that it would be
difficult to sustain the recent improvement in their relationship
if Athens were to prevent it from becoming a full candidate for EU
membership at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Greece wants EU leaders to set clear terms relating to the two
foes' disputes on Cyprus and their territorial boundary in the
Aegean before accepting Turkey as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
Greece also requests EU assurance that a divided Cyprus will be
admitted as a EU member if attempts to reunite the island fail.
Turkey strongly opposes the Greek stance in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"To tell the truth," Fontaine told the summit, "the European
Parliament is divided on this burning issue at present."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, the Parliament considers it essential to
immediately identify and prepare for the economic and even
democratic requirements that applicant countries must meet," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"These requirements will enable the Union itself to control the
ambitious enlargement and make it a success without diluting its
cohesion, identity, solidarity or powers of decision," she added
</P>
<P>
"Among these conditions, cultural integration is an aspect
which should not be underestimated," the European Parliament
President stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is an Islamic country with its territory covering part
of Europe and Asia. It is now a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. Ankara's hoping to join EU overshadows the
bloc's enlargement process due to its row with Greece and the
concerns over European dimension.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Abolish Customs Duties on Computer Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is expected to abolish the
customs duties on computer components and units in the near future
in a bid to enhance the development of the industry, the Egyptian
Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The measure is part of a plan worked out by the Ministry of
Communication and Information, Ali al-Hefnawi, advisor to the
communication minister, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a symposium on
Egypt's computer industry and its future, Al-Hefnawi said the
Finance Ministry has approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt currently imposes 5-10 percent customs duties on
computers and computer components in addition to 10 percent sales
tax and 3 percent administrative fees, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such high taxes and fees have caused the computer prices to
skyrocket in the local market, the English-language newspaper
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of the Cabinet Information and Decision
Support Center (IDSC) Rafaat Radwan said Egypt's computer assembly
industry is facing challenges in light of the rapid developments
of the information technology in the world.
</P>
<P>
In time, state-owned computer companies will have to focus
efforts on producing components for themselves or for possible
export, Radwan added.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, these companies are not capable of competing with
international computer firms, especially those in Southeast Asian
countries, which have taken a lead in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Terming the customs abolition as a proper move, Radwan said
Egypt must step up efforts to follow up the radical changes of the
computer industry worldwide, which will govern the trends of the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Feelings for Houghton's Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese media expressed mixed
feelings for the Chinese Football Association (CFA)'s decision to
sack Briton Bobby Houghton as head coach of the Chinese national
team on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I will miss Houghton," said Xue Shouyuan, a senior football
reporter who has covered three World Cups and four Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's not Houghton to blame for China's failed attempts to win
football honors," he said. "Chinese football is under-developed
and no one is able to change it overnight."
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based sportswriter Ma Xiaolin said neither Franz
Beckenbauer nor Bora Milutinovic could save Chinese football.
</P>
<P>
"The standard of Chinese football is so low that we can't count
on one or two foreign coaches to rejuvenate it. If Beckenbauer or
Milutinovic is brave enough to coach here, he will be finished in
six months or less," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Xue and Ma, most of Chinese sports press had been
calling for Houghton's step-down with mass-circulation Ball Games
Weekly most vocal.
</P>
<P>
"Houghton must pay for China's waterloo defeats in the Olympic
qualifying ties," the Liaoning-based weekly commented in a recent
editorial. "He has done Chinese football more harm than good."
</P>
<P>
Houghton took over the Chinese senior side with a four-year-
contract following China's failure to reach the World Cup finals
in France.
</P>
<P>
The former Nottingham Forest coach had also been in charge of
the Chinese Olympic squad which was shut out of the Sydney Olympic
Games after finishing second to arch rival South Korea late this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We have formally informed Mr. Houghton that his contract and
the contract of his two British assistants will not be renewed,"
CFA said in a statement which was faxed to Xinhua Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Chinese team led by Mr. Houghton didn't qualify
for the Sydney Games, his advanced football thinking and
techniques are set to affect positively Chinese football in the
future and we appreciate the efforts of Mr. Houghton and his
assistants," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old Houghton was the second foreigner to coach the
Chinese team. Germany's Klaus Schlappner was sacked in 1993 after
the national side failed to make the 1994 World Cup finals in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
After guiding China's national team to a bronze medal finish at
the Asian Games last December, the British coach has run out of
luck.
</P>
<P>
In the final Asian qualifying tournament for the 2000 Olympics,
China lost to South Korea and Qatar, placing second in a three-
team group whose winner goes to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Chinese football fans were greatly disheartened by China's
failure to make the Olympics, while the over-critical press has
suspected Houghton's competence.
</P>
<P>
In a recent poll conducted by website www.sohu.com, less than
one third favors Houghton as head coach with two thirds against.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Football Association has bad blood with Chinese
media which has been blasting inefficiency and bureaucracy in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
A CFA official which picked up Xinhua's phone refused to
comment. "Yes, I knew everything. But I can't talk to you no
matter which news agency you are with. We have a spokesman who is
away from Beijing and you can't reach him," the official said, and
hang up.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government confirmed that the decision to allow former Ethiopian
dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam into South Africa for treatment was
taken by the Presidency, The Citizen newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said South Africa's
High Commission in Zimbabwe, where Mengistu lives in exile,
consulted with the Presidency, then the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
A South African presidential spokesman admitted on Tuesday
night that Mengistu had left the country the previous week. It was
reported that he returned home in Zimbabwe's capital Harare.
</P>
<P>
When asked why Mengistu contacted with the Presidency instead
of South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department, Mankahlana said that
this was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to comment on whether an assurance was given
to Mengistu that he should not worry about the extradition request
by the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
Kangelani Hlongwane, spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister
Nkosazana Zuma, also confirmed that the decision was taken at the

<HEADLINE> Japan to Further Ties With China: Emperor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 10 (Xinhha) -- Japanese Emperor Akihito said
here Friday that it is of great significance to develop relations
with China so as to enable the people of the two countries to have
a better knowledge about histories between them.
</P>
<P>
The emperor made the remarks while meeting with Li Ruihuan,
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, who is on an official good-will
tour to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China had close relations historically and the
exchanges between the two peoples will become more brisk and
active, Akihito said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that peace, friendship and cooperation between China
and Japan will conform to the fundamental interests of the two
peoples as well as the general trend of the times.
</P>
<P>
However, the important thing is that the two countries should
draw lessons from history and look to the future so that people of
the two countries will be friendly with each other from generation
to generation, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese top consultant also touched upon how to deal with
the traditional and cultural heritage in respective countries.

<HEADLINE> European Union Opens Helsinki Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
opened its last summit of this century on Friday in Helsinki, the
capital of Finland, which is holding the current EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
By opening the meeting of the European Council, the highest
decision-making body including all EU leaders, president of the
European Parliament Nicole Fontaine said the summit intends to
initiate the process of institutional reform which will pave the
way for EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, three key themes, a new enlargement strategy, the
Inter-governmental Conference on EU institutional reform, and the
common European security and defense policy, are the most
important issues for the future of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the agreement which has been reached by your
ministers on the subject of European defense. Our parliament,
which has for years been calling for decisive action in this field,
can, I am sure, only approve the setting-up of a rapid reaction
force capable of taking part in peace-keeping missions with the
minimum of delay," Mrs. Fontaine said.
</P>
<P>
"In order for the EU to exist fully and be capable of autonomy,
it must possess the means to match its ambitions. This calls for
troops, equipment and institutions. Your decision is eagerly
awaited by public opinion in our countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit was held at Helsinki's Fair Center with some 4,
000 people attending. Finnish organizers said over 2,000
applications have been received for press accreditation, about 500
of them from Finnish media.
</P>
<P>
Journalists from over 40 countries are covering the meeting,
most of them from European countries. The largest contingent from
outside Finland comes from Belgium because more than 350 Brussels-
based journalists are here, most of them international
correspondents for European affairs, in particular for the EU.
Over 60 press agencies and 70 radio broadcasting companies
gathered here to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
"It's likely that the Helsinki meeting of the European Council
will attract the greatest media participation of any high level
meetings ever held in Finland," said Christer Haglund, press
director of the EU Presidency Secretariat, on the eve of the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Tanzanian Capital Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of illiterate
people in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, is currently on
the rise due to uncontrolled births and public indifference on
education, the local daily African reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than one million residents, almost one third of the city's
 population, are reportedly illiterate, Charles Keenja, chairman
of the City Commission, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Keenja said the city has lagged behind other regions in the
country on education because its population is increasing at a
high rate.
</P>
<P>
New comers pouring into the city for jobs from country regions,
most of whom illiterate, also contribute to the increase of
illiteracy rate.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly increasing population coupled with life hardship and
lack of schools in the city aggravated the illiteracy problem, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Keenja, only nine percent of pupils who complete
primary education join secondary schools in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the number of schools in Dar es
Salaam has increased from 164 in 1996 to 178 in 1999.

More money will be poured into telecommunications to promote

<HEADLINE> Latest Result Changes Makeup of New Zealand Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The latest result of the
New Zealand general election, which came out here Friday after
counting the special votes, has changed the makeup of the next
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary result of November 27 election day,
the Labor Party and the Alliance won a combined total of 63 seats
in the 120-seat Parliament, enjoying a majority to pass
legislation after their coalition government was formed. But the
latest result has dramatically changed the situation.
</P>
<P>
After the counting of the special votes, Ms Jeanette Fitzsimons,
co-leader of the Green Party, won the Coromandel electorate on the
North Island with a majority of 246 votes, overturning National
Party's Murray Mclean's 114 vote election night majority. Moreover
the share of the party vote nationwide won by the Green Party led
by Ms.Fitzsimons and Mr. Rod Donald, also raised from 4.9 percent
to 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand adopts the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting
system. According to the system, a party qualifies for
parliamentary seats by winning either at least five percent of
party votes or an electorate seat. Party vote, in general, decides
the total number of seats for each party.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Fitzsimons' win of Coromandel seat and the Green Party's
share of the party vote nationwide exceeding the threshold of five
percent have enabled seven members of the Green Party to sit in
the Parliament, cutting the Labor-Alliance coalition's seats from
63 to 59 and upsetting its parliamentary majority into minority.
The Labor-Alliance has to rely on the Greens to govern.
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, Ms. Fitzsimons and Mr. Donald said after they were
informed of the victory that the Greens had promised for months to
back a Labor-Alliance government on confidence and supply, and
nothing had changed.
</P>
<P>
Miss Helen Clark, who was sworn in as the prime minister of the
Labor-Alliance coalition government Friday, said that the Greens
can join the minority government before the next election.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that at some time in the future the Greens can
formally join the Government," said Miss Clark, leader of the
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Green Co-Leader Donald said that the changed result does not
alter the Greens' support for the Government but it obviously
gives the party more leverage.
</P>
<P>
He also left open the option that the Green Party may formally
join the coalition some time before the next election.
</P>
<P>
"I would not rule it out. We are looking for an enduring
relationship. While we would want to remain distinctive we would
want to ensure a progressive government will last into the next
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest result of the election, the makeup of the
House is 49 seats for the Labor Party, 39 seats for the National
Party, 10 seats for the Alliance, 9 seats for ACT New Zealand,
seven seats for the Green Party, five seats for New Zealand First,
and one seat for United New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the date for publishing the official final result of
the election is still unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks "End of War" at Washington Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will bring to next week's meeting in Washington with Syria a
proposed Israeli-Syrian declaration of principles, as a first step
toward a peace treaty between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The document is likely to put an end to the state of war
between Israel and Syria, as well as to the war in Lebanon and
bring about Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon, the local
daily Haaretz Friday quoted a source in Barak's office as saying.
</P>
<P>
As announced by United States President Bill Clinton, Barak
will fly to Washington next Monday to hold his first meeting with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa to discuss the resumption
of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks which stalled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, Barak's advisor Danny
Yatom and head of Israel's team for negotiations with Syria Uri Saguy
will travel to Washington with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Levy has canceled his planned trip to Japan and South Korea to
participate in the Washington meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government said in a statement that it understands
the reason for the cancellation and recognizes the importance of
Israel obtaining peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"There is a logic in creating a step which will help guarantee
the success of the more detailed negotiations," the source said,
adding that Barak's proposal does not call for the signing of a
framework agreement with Syria, as it planned with the
Palestinians, but rather for drafting more general understandings
regarding the aims of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak's proposal is in effect an imitation of the peace process
with Jordan, which began with a public meeting between the then
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the late King Hussein in the
White House, in which the two countries declared an end to the
state of war between them.
</P>
<P>
In the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, the two sides will negotiate
on the issue of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights which
it occupied in the 1967 Middle East War, security arrangements,
water resources and a peace treaty between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Zhuhai Bridge Opens to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Lotus Bridge, the second
land passage linking Macao to China's inland areas, opened to
traffic today, adding to the jubilant atmosphere for Macao's
approaching return to China.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira, Chief Executive-designate of
the Macao Special Administrative Region Edmund Ho Hau Wah, and
Director of the Macao Branch of the Xinhua News Agency Wang Qiren
cut the ribbon at the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The bridge runs more than 1,780 meters and connects land
reclaimed from sea between the Coloane and Taipa Islands with the
Hengqin Island of the neighboring Zhuhai city of Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the bridge began in 1998 with investment of
some 200 million yuan from Zhuhai and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The six-lane bridge and the newly-built border inspection
building there can receive 53,000 passengers and handle 21,000
vehicles a day, to greatly ease off the pressure of the Gongbei
Border Gate, Macao's first land passage to the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will help promote economic and cultural exchanges
between Macao and the inland areas, a local expert said.
</P>
<P>
The Coloane-Taipa Border Inspection Building was also put into
use here today.

ANKARA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry said
Ankara supports and welcomes the announcement of the resumption of
peace talks between Syria and Israel, Anatolia News Agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton declared Wednesday that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq Al-Sharaa will hold talks in Washington next week to put
the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
Turkey endorsed the peace process "from the very beginning"
and "actively" encouraged all sides, Syria and Israel in
particular, to reach a lasting peace, said a Foreign Ministry
source.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials rejected the saying that improved relations
between Israel and Syria will negatively affect Turko-Israeli
relations, insisting they are two independent spheres.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which last year came to the brink of war with Syria
over Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers'
Party who then took shelter in Damascus, has always been concerned
over its relations with Syria.

<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Bridges are becoming a focus in
media reports filed from Macao as the date of the region's return
to China is approaching, which is on December 20.
</P>
<P>
And today on December 10, the Lotus Bridge opened to traffic,
striding over Macao's Coloane and Hengqin, an islet of the
neighboring Zhuhai, to become the second land passage to the
inland areas following the border gate at Gongbei.
</P>
<P>
Macao has long been known for its bridges, which not only
constitute sightseeing spots but also serve as a bridge in
literary sense, linking the West and East cultures, Eurasian
economies, and the two sides across the Taiwan Straights.
</P>
<P>
On the top of Macao's tourist attractions are neither
Portuguese-style relics nor casinos, but two bridges spanning
Macao and Taipa. And the 3,900-meter long Friendship Bridge,
completed five years ago, ranks first in Asia's cross-sea bridges.
</P>
<P>
Macao, a tiny area of 23.5 square kilometers, is crisscrossed
by roads, viaducts and overpasses. Visitors are all impressed by
shuttling vehicles and various kinds of bridges, which are not
only convenient for transportation, but add to Macao's beauty.
</P>
<P>
And more important, Macao has been playing an intermediary role
like a bridge in many aspects. That's why bridges are selected as
one of the four designs for the regional flag and emblem of the
Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Since it was opened in the middle of the Ming Dynasty (1368-
1644), Macao has become an important outlet of the then China's
largest foreign port of Guangzhou. And gradually, it grew into a
busy port city and a cultural exchange center as East-West goods
and business people flocked to the port.

<P>
As a result, the then first Western-style college -- St. Paulo
College -- was founded in Macao, and accordingly, Western
sinologists and Chinese scholars on the Western science and
culture met here, triggering off the interflow of Chinese
philosophy and tea to the West and Western natural sciences to
China.
</P>
<P>
Macao, a member of the World Trade Organization, has
participated in more than 80 international and regional
organizations or agreements, serving as an indispensable bridge
for the motherland's opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The European Union signed a preferential agreement with Macao
seven years ago, and now has promised to extend the only agreement
of the kind in Asia-Pacific region after Macao's return to China.
So, China and some other countries in Asia are planning to develop
markets in Europe as well as in the Latin America via Macao.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some international organizations and Western
countries are looking forward to the intermediary role Macao can
play in helping them enter the vast Chinese market. The United
Nations, the World Tourism Organization, the World Bank, and the
UN Food and Agricultural Organization have all opened offices in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao plays an even more important role in the cross-Straight
exchanges. Upon completion four years ago, the Macao International
Airport opened a route to Taiwan for the convenience of
compatriots on both sides. And by now, some two million Taiwanese
have visited the inland areas via Macao.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and Portuguese leaders value very much the
intermediary role of Macao, which China and the rest of the world
need.

<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris

<P>
At the ceremony, President Yeltsin said that not so long ago,
the two countries celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China and the 50th anniversary of
establishing Sino-Russian diplomatic relations. The celebrating
activities reflected the two countries' desire to further promote
good-neighborly relations and all-round cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Handover Atmosphere Thickens in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Upon arrival at the Macao
International Airport, a passenger would be immediately attracted
by eye-catching red "welcoming handover" posters on his or her way
out. A handover atmosphere hangs heavily over the city.
</P>
<P>
Walking in the main streets of Macao, people are greeted by big
red banners that are strung between street lamp posts. The banners
are printed with schedules for handover-related activities.
Displayed in the windows of many shops are slogans such as "Toward
a beautiful new century and a bright future for Macao" and various
kinds of handover-related souvenirs. Some shops have opened
special counters selling handover souvenirs such as national flags
and emblems, watches, coins, plaques and albums.
</P>
<P>
Comendador Ho Yin Garden was built in memory of Ho Yin, a late
prominent figure in Macao, in an area reclaimed from the sea. A
few days ago, construction of "Pavilion Marking the Homecoming of
Macao" started in the park. A man in charge of the construction
project said that this permanent memorial will be completed in
three months.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lam, a gardener who has worked in the park for many years,
said that in the second half of this year, several activities in
anticipation of Macao's return to its motherland have been held in
the park. He said that ordinary people in Macao all wish that
after the handover, the government of the special administrative
region (SAR) led by Ho Hau Wah would meet their expectations and
run Macao well. "One is economy, the other is social order. These
are the two areas where ordinary people in Macao place high
expectations on the SAR government," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Mr. Wang, a guard at a telecoms company, expressed full
confidence in the future of post-handover Macao, noting that the
handover will not have any negative impact on his life. He said
that none of his colleagues, friends and relatives has left Macao
because of the handover since every one has seen that in Hong Kong
"nothing has changed" since its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
By evening, Macao becomes a sea of light. Some workers are
still adjusting strings of color lamps in the streets in
preparation for celebrating the handover. In front of the building
where Tai Fung Bank is headquartered and where the chief executive
of the Macao SAR is to have his temporary office, a huge neon
light in the shape of a flying "homecoming swallow" shines over a
big red lotus flower and an orange-colored banner carrying the
slogan "Celebrating the Homecoming and Greeting the New Year."
</P>
<P>
As more than 3,000 journalists from all over the world are
coming to Macao, the press center that opened on Monday has become
livelier. The local media are seeking a competitive edge in the "
media war" by taking advantage of all good conditions that are not
available to outsiders. Local Chinese newspapers such as Macao
Daily News, Jornal Va Kio and Dialio Palatodos, the Macao
Broadcasting and Television Company Ltd. and Radio Macao are
offering large amounts of news about the coming handover every day.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Disaster Response Units Are Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
assured the public Friday that its disaster response units are
ready to address any potential problem that might be triggered by
the so-called Y2K bug during the rollover to year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
(DND) said all contingency plans are ready for implementation in
case of emergencies, even as other government agencies have
certified that they are ready for Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
"We have contingency plans in place in case of disruption of
public services. But the different departments have assured us
these problems will not happen," Mercado said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
As DND secretary, Mercado also chairs the National Disaster
Coordinating Council, which coordinates response actions to
natural and man-made disasters.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada earlier assured the
business community that the Philippines is virtually ready to
shield critical sectors from the possible problems that may ensue
when the Y2K or millennium bug strikes.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was assured by Secretary Filemon Uriarte of the
Department of Science and Technology that the country is already
almost 100 percent Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Uriarte recently assumed the post of chairman of the
Presidential Commission on Year 2000 Compliance, which the
president tasked to coordinate efforts to strengthen the country's
defense system against the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government asked the media to help allay public
fears by clarifying misconceptions about this perceived threat
posed by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre, who chairs the
National Y2K Contingency Task Force (NYCTF), said the NYCTF has
provided media outfits with information materials on the
millennium bug.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumers Embracing Online Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of the
U.S. consumers rate their online banking experience higher than
their traditional brick-and-mortar banking experience, according
to an Internet survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 444 consumers, conducted by the research firm
Frederick Schneiders Research, also found that 13 percent of
respondents do all their banking online.
</P>
<P>
While the majority of users are satisfied with their online
banking experience, the survey also found that some consider the
process of opening and funding new accounts online inconvenient
and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of all respondents said they have started the
process of opening an online checking account and then quit it.
More than half stopped because too many forms had to be completed
and mailed or faxed, and the method of depositing funds was too
inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
"This survey shows that (U.S.) Internet users are embracing
online banking," the research firm said. "But the results also
show they want online financial services companies to provide more
services, and --given the high abandonment rate of new accounts--
make the account opening and initial funding process easier to
accomplish."
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of respondents said they prefer to use a
service that would allow them to transfer funds electronically to
an online account from accounts at other financial institutions,
and nearly 80 percent rated such a service as convenient.
</P>
<P>
About one quarter of current online checking account holders
initially funded their accounts by mailing a check from another
institution, the study found. Others funded it with a direct
deposit of a paycheck, or by transferring funds from a separate
traditional account within the same institute.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the majority of consumers are
concerned with the security of the Internet. Nearly 85 percent of
respondents are concerned with the security of online transactions,
such as credit card purchases on the Web. More than 90 percent are
concerned with the security of their personal information on the
Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tenth, the two countries reiterate that they support each other
in safeguarding national unity and sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Russia supports China's reunification efforts, reiterates its
stance on the Taiwan issue as already announced in previously
published documents, and does not accept the rhetoric that that
cross-Straits relations are those of a "state-to-state
relationship." The Chinese side is satisfied with the stand taken
by the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
China reiterates its position that the Chechenya issue is
purely the internal affair of Russia, and China supports the moves
taken by Russia to crack down on separatist forces. Russia is also
satisfied with China's position in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Sino-Russian equal and trustworthy strategic
partnership of cooperation, the two sides are willing to
strengthen their cooperation, considering that the two countries
share similar or identical views on such issues as the
establishment of an international multi-polar order and democracy
and justice in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Such coordination between the two countries in international
affairs is not targeted at any third nation, but aimed only at
safeguarding the fundamental interests of each country and
consolidating peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
the entire world.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Declare War against Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has declared war against
 criminals, especially against those armed bandits in the capital
city of Lusaka rocked by increasing violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
The escalating crimes called for concerted efforts from the
community at large, Inspect-general of the police Francis Ndhlovu
was quoted as saying by Times of Zambia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
When handing over 10 vehicles to Lusaka police chief Bernard
Mayonda, Ndhlovu said the cars have beefed up the skeleton fleet
used by police to patrol the city.
</P>
<P>
"We want all cases, criminal or traffic handled expeditiously
by relevant authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndhlovu appealed to Lusaka residents to clearly label their
residences with addresses to enable police to locate scenes of
crime easily and urged the Lusaka City Council to light up and
name the streets.
</P>
<P>
He said that most roads in the capital city are now tarred and
it is easy for police to follow up criminals but lack of street
names is a draw back.
</P>
<P>
Like many African countries, the communities and residence have
no labeled names, and houses, buildings have no serial numbers in
Zambia. In recent years armed robberies have been increasing in
the country particularly in Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Falungong Cult's Tax Evasion Being Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China's tax authorities have
disclosed that the Falungong cult and its founder Li Hongzhi have
been dodging taxes.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration of Taxation said
that China's Taxation Offices investigated tax evasion cases
involving Li Hongzhi, Falun Dafa Research Society, 549 Falungong
organizations, 142 manufacturers of Falungong materials and 338
retailers in the past three months. Taxation officers have imposed
more than 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) in fines.
</P>
<P>
Falungong organizations and operators have attempted every
possible means at their disposal to dodge taxes. Preliminary
survey that has been done show that from 1994 to 1998, Li Hongzhi
and Falun Dafa Research Society acquired 2.685 million yuan (323,
500 US dollars) from giving lectures and conducting other
activities without declaring any tax.
</P>
<P>
Falungong organizations nationwide earned more than 22 million
yuan (2.6 million US dollars) from selling Falungong cult
materials, including books and audio-video products. Retailers
made profits of over 66.6 million yuan (8 million US dollars) from
more than 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) of Falungong
materials.
</P>
<P>
Under Li Hongzhi authorization, the Shandong Provincial Youth
Science and Technology Service Center evaded taxes worth more than
2.79 million yuan (336,000 US dollars). During June and July of
1997, the Center donated 500,000 yuan (60,000 US dollars) in cash
to the Falun Dafa Research Society of Falun Dafa and bought Li a
car worth nearly 200,000 yuan (24,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Center also planned to donate to the Research Society 1.86
million yuan in royalties, but the case was uncovered by police
before the money was transferred.
</P>
<P>
The official said the evidence fully exposes Li Hongzhi's true
evil nature by taking advantage of the Chinese people to further
his political ambitions and become filthy rich in the process.
</P>
<P>
Investigation of tax evasion cases of the Falungong Cult is
still proceeding.

<HEADLINE> Hot Sellers in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- "Hi, handover souvenirs
available Now!" This has been the most popular and eye-catching
commercial ad in Macao these days as the date of Macao's
homecoming to the motherland is approaching.
</P>
<P>
Souvenirs that are specially made to mark the handover, which
falls on December 20, have become the hottest items in Macao, a
world tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
At the Nam Kwong Retails Co. Ltd., where a special counter has
been designated to sell the souvenirs, namely, Macao Pataca coins,
postal stamp, wrist watches and clocks, badges, China's miniature
national flags, miniature flag of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR) and posters.
</P>
<P>
A manager of the company, who only gave his surname as Chen,
said, "The souvenirs are selling well here, especially those with
characteristics of Macao." Most of the buyers are tourists and the
sales volume of the souvenirs of his company reaches nearly 10,000
patacas a day.
</P>
<P>
According to a shop assistant at the Nam Kwong, a water-proof
wrist watch (50 patacas) and a memorial album of coins and stamps
(128 patacas each) are best sellers while China's miniature five-
star national flag and the miniature flag of the Macao SAR are
favored by institutional buyers. As the Portuguese rule over Macao
is approaching to an end, Portuguese-made ceramic wares have also
become a main shopping target of tourists.
</P>
<P>
"The Blossoming Lotus and the Flying Homecoming Swallow" are
the main design of these souvenirs. At zero hour of December 20,
the Macao SAR flag with the design of a lotus will be raised in
Macao , together with the Chinese national flag, the Five-Star Red
Flag, amidst the strains of the Chinese anthem. "Flying Homecoming
Swallow" implies Macao's return to the motherland after more than
400 years.
</P>
<P>
The designs of Blossoming Lotus and the Flying Homecoming
Swallow are seen everywhere in local streets and on colorful
buntings, street lamps and ads.
</P>
<P>
For local shops, the designs have been used for price hikes of
such items as gold pens, gold watches and cameras. A Japanese-made
camera marked with Chinese characters "Macao 1999" is sold at 2,
260 patacas while similar cameras are sold at less than 2,000
patacas each.
</P>
<P>

camera has been selling well ever since its debut in Macao in last
month.

<HEADLINE> Macao Develops Modern Transport Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The 1,500-meter Lotus Bridge
linking Macao with Zhuhai city opened to traffic today, ensuring
closer and smoother communications between Macao and the inland
areas of China.
</P>
<P>
The Lotus Bridge represents the second gateway between Macao
and its motherland. It will help accelerate the flow of personnel
and goods between the two places and has great significance in
promoting economic growth in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is the third in Macao with six lanes for two-way
traffic. The completion and commissioning of the new bridge today
signifies that Macao has developed a modern, multi-dimensional
transport network.
</P>
<P>
Located on the southern coast of China, Macao has been a major
port for trade between the East and West since the 16th century.
Facing the sea in three directions, it has developed a shipping
industry, that has formed an important part of its economy. At
present, Macao is home to more than 20 shipping companies and over
30 shipping agencies. It has some 40 specialized and public docks.
</P>
<P>
Macao will retain the right to register ships after it returns
to China on December 20, 1999. Since it cannot receive big ships
because of shallow waters, Macao has developed effective sea
transport links with Hong Kong that is about 40 nautical miles
away. Speed ships shuttle between the two places throughout the
day, taking only one hour to cover the distance. Sailing up along
the Pearl River, ships from Macao can reach numerous areas of the
Pearl River delta in the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
The Lotus Bridge is a milestone in the development of a highly
efficient transport network in Macao, which consists of one
peninsula and two separate islands. A 2,570-meter bridge was built
over the sea between the peninsula and Taipa Island in 1974.
Another 4,414-meter bridge was built in 1994. And as early as 1969,
Taipa Island and Coloane Island was linked by a 2,225-meter
highway built on reclaimed land. Thus, the peninsula and the two
islands that used to be separated by sea have been linked with one
another.
</P>
<P>
Efficient and convenient road access to inland areas has
greatly facilitated communications between Macao and the outside
world. Covering a total area of 23.5 square kilometers and with a
population of 450,000, Macao has more than 100,000 cars, dozens of
bus routes served by over 500 buses and more than 200 travel
agencies and transportation companies. In 1998, the transport
system in Macao carried more than 6.9 million passengers, 17 times
the local population.
</P>
<P>
The Macao International Airport that was completed and put into
operation at the end of 1995 has added wings, literally, to
Macao's transport network. The airport has so far handled more
than seven million passengers and more than 160,000 tons of cargo.
Today, 16 airlines use the airport, flying more than 400 scheduled
flights to more than 30 cities around the world every week.
</P>
<P>
The local airline Air Macao has opened a flight route between
Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, on which passengers need not
change airplanes. Thus Macao has become an aerial way station for
both sides across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the Macao International Airport will reach a handling
capacity of 7.8 million passengers and more than 240,000 tons of
cargo a year. It will become a major aviation center in south
China.

<P>
ANKARA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- "Turks will be stunned" if
Greece prevents the European Union (EU) Helsinki summit from
declaring Turkey a candidate for accession to the European club,
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks in an exclusive interview with
Turkish Daily News, which was published on Friday when the
Helsinki summit started.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the EU Summit, Demirel cautioned Greece that an
attitude of obstruction by Athens will not help in the resolution
of the outstanding Turko-Greek problems but add a crisis of
confidence to the existing troubles.
</P>
<P>
He said it now seems that there is consensus among the EU
countries, with the exception of Greece, for accepting Turkey as
a candidate for accession.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is in Greece's court. I am sure that Greece will act
with the prudence that is in conformity with the positive
atmosphere that has emerged in recent months in our relations, "
Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
He warned Greek veto to Turkey's candidacy will lead to the
loss of Turkey's confidence in Greek sincerity, but with its
constructive role in Helsinki, Greece can open a new chapter in
the history of Turko-Greek relations and start building common
future with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Demirel indicated that Turkey is ready to meet not only
the Copenhagen criteria but all the other standards of the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
here today with Carlos Lage Davila, vice-president of the State
Council of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Cuba is an important country in Latin America and the
Caribbean region. The Cuban people have waged protracted and
painstaking struggles to safeguard their national independence and
sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is delighted to see the achievements Cuba has made in
developing its economy and improving the people's living standard,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that bilateral relations have entered a new
stage of steady and all-round development. Friendly cooperation
has been developing further in the fields of politics, economy and
trade, science and technology and culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed the hope that the two countries' relations would
reach new levels in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Lage said that China's economy has continued to make rapid
progress. China has not only weathered the Asian financial crisis
unscathed, but has also made a great contribution to restoring and
developing the economy in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cuba attaches great importance to its relations
with China, and Cuba is willing to enhance its cooperation with
China in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Suffers Annual Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese official has warned
that his country is suffering an annual water shortage of more
than 1 billion cubic meters, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day seminar on environment and water
resources here on Thursday, Fadi Qmeir, director-general of the
Ministry of Electricity and Water Resources, attributed much of
the shortage to wasted water from leaky pipes in the network.
</P>
<P>
He added that distribution was inefficient, relying too heavily
on pumping systems which bring water from the coast to rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
He argued that dams offered the only means to meet the
country's water needs.
</P>
<P>
"These dams would rely on gravity, causing water to flow from
the hills into valleys," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is studying the feasibility of building 15 dams
and 16 hill ponds to collect rain water during the winter for use
in the dry month of summer.
</P>
<P>
Qmeir said construction on four dams could begin in 2000. He
promised the ministry annual budget of around 40 million
U.S. dollars would cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
Other scientists argued that while increasing supply will
reduce the water deficit, an efficient water management scheme
is also needed to help meet the demand.

<HEADLINE> Service Industry Plays Key Role in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao is heavily dependent on
its service industry, which accounts for almost 85 percent of the
local gross domestic output (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Tourism and gambling play an especially important role in the
local economy. Macao is among the largest gambling places in the
world. For decades, its booming gambling industry has bolstered
the development of its tourism-related businesses. In 1996, Macao
saw a record number of 8.15 million tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the local tourism industry has
suffered from the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis.
With Macao's return to China drawing nearer, the industry has
showed signs of recovering. A total of two million inland visitors
toured Macao in the past ten years and the number of tourists from
inland provinces and cities has been increasing steadily in recent
few years.
</P>
<P>
Macao, though small in size, boasts a flourishing banking and
insurance industry, with 22 commercial banks and 21 insurance
firms.
</P>
<P>
To date, the assets of local banks have totaled more than 150
billion patacas, with nearly 10 billion patacas in remaining
deposits and over 50 billion patacas in outstanding loans. Taifung
Bank ranks among the 1,000 largest banks in the world.
</P>
<P>
Macao's post and telecoms services are well developed and
connected to all countries and regions in the world. Its postal
business is increasing by five to ten percent annually in recent
years. Also in recent years, the increasing demand of inland stamp
collectors has prompted local post authorities to print more
commemorative stamps and other postal collections.
</P>
<P>
Telephone subscribers in Macao can dial directly to 219 nations
and regions, while local mobile-phone users are provided with
roaming services while traveling in Hong Kong, Beijing, the
Chinese capital, Shanghai, the largest Chinese metropolis, Fujian
Province and the Pearl River Delta where Guangzhou and Shenzhen
cities are located.
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams are rare in this small but bustling place, though
there is one vehicle for every eight local residents here. It is
testimony to Macao's good road conditions and traffic management
that it has been a venue for Grand Prix car racing for many years.

KUWAIT CITY, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. military
transport plane carrying 96 servicemen made a crash landing at
Kuwait international airport at dawn Friday, killing three and
wounding 16 others.
</P>
<P>
Zuhair Abdul Mohsen al-Zamei, Deputy Director General of
Kuwait's Civil Aviation told Kuwait News Agency that the control
tower at Kuwait International Airport received a Mayday from the
C-130 Hercules plane after it sustained a defect in the main
landing gear.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed at 02:48 Friday (23:48 Thursday GMT),
after the airport took all necessary precautions including
spraying the runway with foam, al-Zamei said.
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers on board were killed and some others sustained
various injures and were rushed to hospital, he said, without
mentioning the damage sustained by the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown if the soldiers were brought here to
replace the U.S. troops whose term of service in Kuwait are
expiring.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy sources could not be reached for comments on the
accident as the embassy is closed on Friday in line with local
customs, according to which Thursdays and Fridays are public
holidays.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 8,000 U.S. troops stationed in
Kuwait, some of whom are taking part in routine joint
exercises with Kuwaiti troops, while others are enforcing the
two no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Fires Birtish Coach Houghton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Football
Association (CFA) sacked British coach Bobby Houghton as head
coach of the Chinese national team on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The former Nottingham Forest coach took over the Chinese senior
side with a four-year-contract following China's failure to reach
the World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
Houghton had also been in charge of the Chinese Olympic squad
which was shut out of the Sydney Olympic Games after finishing
second to arch rival South Korea late this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have formally informed Mr. Houghton that his contract and
the contract of his two British assistants will not be renewed,"
CFA said in a statement Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Chinese team led by Mr. Houghton didn't qualify
for the Sydney Games, his advanced football thinking and
techniques are set to affect positively Chinese football in the
future and we appreciate the efforts of Mr. Houghton and his
assistants," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old Houghton was the second foreigner to coach the
Chinese team. Germany's Klaus Schlappner was sacked in 1993 after
the national side failed to make the 1994 World Cup finals in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
After guiding China's national team to a bronze medal finish at
the Asian Games last December, the British coach has run out of
luck.
</P>
<P>
In the final Asian qualifying tournament for the 2000 Olympics,
China lost to South Korea and Qatar, placing second in a three-
team group whose winner goes to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Chinese football fans were greatly disheartened by China's
failure to make the Olympics, while the over-critical press has
suspected Houghton's competence.
</P>
<P>
In a recent poll conducted by www.sohu.com, less than one third
favors Houghton as head coach with two thirds against.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Football Association has not named a replacement
coach.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Won't ask oil Quota Increment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua)-- Indonesia, a member of the OPEC,
would not ask for an increment of its petroleum production quota
from the organization's countries, a senior official said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not ask yet (for the increasing of oil production
quota) as we think the current figure is enough to make oil price
in international market become stable," Minister of Mine and
Energy Soesilo Bambang Yudhoyono said.
</P>
<P>
Oil price in international market, he said, could always be up
and down.
</P>
<P>
"But the current rate which have been fluctuated between 23 U.S.
dollars to 25 U.S. dollars per barrel seems make a sense," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil production quota is 1.1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
He added that rate of the current oil price could hold out at
least until March 2000 as OPEC (Organization Petroleum Exporters
Countries) could be disciplined in maintaining their production
level.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that OPEC members in the Middle East had
agreed to maintain its quota for the next couples of time.
</P>
<P>
"I have met with them (the Middle East oil ministers) and they
have the same view with us that the current oil production level
is reasonable so that it should be defended to stabilize oil price
in international market," Yudhoyono said.
</P>
<P>
But, however, he admitted that there would be a possibility for
the increasing of oil production particularly from the OPEC
countries.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think that a such increment would be dramatic, but
slightly, very very slightly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo earlier said the
assumption of oil price in international market for the country's
state budget April-December 2000 was between 16 to 19 U.S dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figure, Yudhoyono said that 17 U.S dollars
per barrel would be reasonable.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Issue Joint Statement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin held the second informal
summit on December 9 and 10 during which they had an in-depth
exchange of views on issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders issued the following joint statement:
</P>
<P>
First, the two heads of state emphasize that the conclusions
and evaluations enshrined in the "Sino-Russian Joint Statement on
Worldwide Multi-Polarization and Establishment of New
International Order" on April 23, 1997, the "Sino-Russian Joint
Statement" on November 10, 1997, and the "Joint Statement on Sino-
Russian Relations at the Turn of the Century" and the "Joint Press
Communique on Sino-Russian Summit Results" on November 23, 1998,
are still of great practical significance.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents reiterate that China and Russia will
continue to abide by the principled stance on international issues
elaborated in the aforementioned documents.
</P>
<P>
They propose to push forward the establishment of a multi-polar
world on the basis of the principles of the United Nations Charter
and existing international laws in the 21st century, strengthen
the UN's dominant status in international affairs, and peacefully
resolve international disputes through political means.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders maintain that all members of the international
community should be treated equally, enjoy the same security,
respect each other in their choice of development paths, respect
each other's sovereignty, not interfere in each other's internal
affairs, and establish a fair, equal, and mutually beneficial
international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
The two sides call for the concerted effort of all the nations
to set up a democratic, balanced, and multi-polar world pattern to
facilitate harmonious co-existence, constructive mutual influence,
and mutual exchanges among the various cultures.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also stress that the equal status of all
sovereign states should be guaranteed.

<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- According to the "Economic
Daily", China's surplus cotton market has improved in recent
months with the price of cotton expected to rise soon.
</P>
<P>
Planting areas and the output of cotton have decreased
significantly this year while cotton consumption has increased,
said an official with the State Administration of Textile Industry.
China lifted its cotton purchasing price from 360-370 yuan per dan
(one dan equals 50 kilograms) to 400 yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
China will make efforts to improve market supplies and sales
and re-adjust cotton prices by utilizing China's cotton reserve.

<P>
Second, the two sides must point out that a negative momentum
has developed in the area of international security.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hold that establishment of a national missile
defense system by any signatory state in violation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM) treaty will have a destructive
impact upon a series of international agreements concerning
strategic stability, the reduction and non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and their carriers, and upon the
possibility for progress in these regards.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reaffirm their opposition to the violation of the
1972 ABM treaty, and emphasize that the treaty has constituted one
of the pillars of strategic stability in the past, continues to do
so at present, and should remain so in the future.
</P>
<P>
The two sides maintain that the 1972 ABM treaty should be
honored comprehensively and strictly.
</P>
<P>
The two sides point out that the resolution calling for
maintaining and abiding by the ABM treaty, which was proposed by
China, Russia, and Belarus and passed by the United Nations
Assembly, is of great importance.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also point out that the plan of some countries to
deploy a theater missiles defense system in the Asia-Pacific
region will undermine peace and stability in the region. The
Russian side supports China's position opposing the inclusion of
China's Taiwan Province in any such plan in any form by any
country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides express deep regrets over the United States'
refusal to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. (

<P>
The new website, MetalChina.com, was established by two major
share-holding companies under the Information Center of China's

that provide professional information," said Shen Guanling,
general manager of QingdaoNet Corporation, who, with a colleague,
set up the website.
</P>

<HEADLINE> A Snapshot of Macao Before Its Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A celebratory mood has added to
the charm of the usually calm Macao,ten days before it returns to
the embrace of its motherland.
</P>
<P>
Bright-colored banners carrying celebratory words on the
imminent return are strung across European-style buildings in the
city, as are small paper flags of China and the future Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR). Goods in some shops are on
sale, in a gesture to mark the landmark return of Macao to its
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Coverage on the return by the local media has increased. Some
journalists have already started to work round the clock. "We've
taken no holiday since the beginning of this year to prepare for
this historic moment," said TV journalist Victor Chan.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, tourists from Japan and southeast Asian
nations are having a good time in front of the facade of St.
Paul's and A-Ma Temple, both landmark tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Book stores are competing to introduce return-related books and
books on Macao's history. The venue for the handover ceremony has
been erected, attracting visitors to have it as a backdrop for
pictures.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Government Palace is another favored backdrop for
picture taking. The building is expected to become a historical
site after Macao's return, which marks the ending of western
colonial rule in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Gongbei Customs, the only passageway for people to enter
interior areas in China from Macao, are registering record entries
and exits before the region's return. Although people with accents
from inland areas are frequently spotted on streets in Macao,
there is no sign that their presence has brought any perceptible
changes to the life of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Macao residents are enjoying their life as usual: shops open
every morning at 10:00 a.m.;fortune-tellers continue to solicit
business in the alleys;young people are all sweat from playing
soccer; and old people are strolling in parks carrying bird cages
with them.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of Mercedes Benz limousines are parked outside Lisboa
Casino, the most famous gambling venue in Macao. Before another
entertainment venue, groups of young people are buying soccer
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
Into the midnight, neon lights brighten up the whole city.
Christmas music is played in bustling shops.
</P>
<P>
Conditions of social security are improving with the return
coming near, taxi driver Chang Hui Fong told Xinhua. "Macao people
wish to return to the motherland," she said. "I hope that the new
government will bring us a more secure life."

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Issue Joint Statement (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two countries emphasize that they share the same or
identical positions on a series of key issues, which is the major
point of departure for bilateral coordination effort designed to
maintain strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
These key issues include the prevention of an arms race in
outer space or through the use of information technology,
implementation of nuclear non-proliferation treaties and the
banning of chemical weapons, stipulations banning biological
weapons, and setting a working agenda for a disarmament
negotiations conference.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side expresses an understanding of Russia's
proposal to further reduce offensive strategic weapons on the part
of Russian and United States.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hold that full responsibility for the
consequences of any possible harm to strategic stability and
international security will be placed on any country which
undermines the disarmament framework.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also hold that it is increasingly imperative to
closely coordinate actions safeguarding global strategic stability
under the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Third, the two sides point out that negative momentum in
international relations continues to grow, and the following is
becoming more obvious:
</P>
<P>
The forcing of the international community to accept a uni-
polar world pattern and a single model of culture, value concepts
and ideology, and a weakening of the role of the United Nations
and its Security Council; the seeking of excuses to give
irresponsible explanations or amendment to the purposes and
principles of the UN Charter; the reinforcing and expanding of
military blocs; the replacing of international law with power
politics or even resorting to force; and the jeopardizing of the
sovereignty of independent states using the concepts of "human
rights are superior to sovereignty" and "humanitarian intervention.
"
</P>
<P>
The two sides agree to work together with the rest of the world
to oppose the momentum presently preventing the establishment of a
just multi-polar structure for international relations.

The two sides agree that rational and thoughtful reform of the
UN is conductive to strengthening its authority and role in the
world. Also, the two sides believe that the UN Security Council
takes prime responsibility for safeguarding international peace
and security, so that its status and function should not be
doubted or lessened under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reiterate that it is necessary to maintain the UN
Charter rights empowering the permanent member nations of the UN
Security Council for the sake of the UN's efficiency and stability.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, both China and Russia attach importance to their
accession to the World Trade Organization under conditions
ensuring equal status in the world trade system. This stance is
also in the interest of all WTO members.
</P>
<P>
Currently, negotiations on WTO accession for both China and
Russia are at a critical stage. The two sides believe that the WTO
should have more universal representation, maintain the balance of
rights and obligations, and take into consideration differing
levels of socio-economic development.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Gains Harvest From Opium-Substitute Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been implementing
an opium-substitute buckwheat project in the country's northern
Shan state since 1997 in cooperation with Japan and has gained
harvest in some cultivated areas, the New Light of Myanmar
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, buckwheat, a kind of opium-substitute
crop, was cultivated in the state's Kokang region on 1.62 hectares
of land in 1997, on 81 hectares in 1998 and on 810 hectares in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar began commercial production of Japanese buckwheat in
December 1998 in Kokang's Ta Shwe Tang area following the
successful implementation of a Japanese-proposed pilot project of
the production in the area with more than 93 hectares of the crops
harvested.
</P>
<P>
Japan has reached a memorandum of understanding with Myanmar on
buying all the buckwheat produced in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1998, the cultivation area
of poppy-substitute crops, which also include paddy, corn,
sugarcane, wheat, coffee seedlings and rubber, stood at 5,898
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Due to the expanded cultivation area of these substitute crops,
the production of drug supply is said to have dropped.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has started in 1999 implementing a three-phase plan (
1999-2014) at an estimated cost of 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, aimed
at the total eradication of drugs in the whole country in 15 years
after the successful transformation of the eastern Shan state's
Mongla region into an opium-free zone in April 1997.

<HEADLINE> Recycling Waste Materials Needs to be Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua)-- Every year China has about
three million tons of discarded iron and steel, two million tons
of used paper, two million tons of waste plastic and one million
tons of waste glass are not recycled.
</P>
<P>
The Recycling of waste materials poses a big problem in China
owing to its inadequate technology. In a 44 year-period from 1954
to 1998, China recycled a total of over 900 million tons of
discarded materials. Of the total waste collection, there was 660
million tons of unwanted iron and steel rods and scraps, 40
million tons of non-ferrous metals and 300 million tons of glass,
plastic and other light industrial goods and chemical materials.
</P>
<P>
China currently has some 2,800 companies engaged in collecting
waste materials. There are more than 1,500 processing factories
all over the country employing nearly one million people.

<P>
YANGON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC) reformed its Myanmar Investment
Commission (MIC) Friday with all the key members of the commission
replaced, state-run Radio Myanmar reported, quoting an
announcement of the SPDC.
</P>
<P>
The reformation came less than two months after Myanmar
reshuffled its government on October 29.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, former chairman of the MIC Vice-
Admiral Maung Maung Khin, who is also deputy prime minister, was
replaced by U Thaung, the current minister of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Former vice-chairman of the MIC Lieutenant-General Tin Tun, who
is also deputy prime minister, was replaced by Major-General Tin
Htut, now the minister of electric power.
</P>
<P>
The post of former secretary of the MIC Brigadier-General Maung
Maung, who was once minister at the SPDC chairman's office and was
allowed to retire last month, was taken over by the present deputy
minister of electric power Brigadier-General Maung Maung,
identical in name to the one who was replaced.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military government formed the MIC soon after it
took over the power of the state in late 1988. The MIC was aimed
at opening the country to local and foreign investment in line
with the market-oriented economic policy.
</P>
<P>
According to official Statistics, Myanmar had drawn a total of
7.101 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment as of the end of
July this year since it opened to foreign investment in late 1988.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marine Helicopter Crashes off California Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter with 18 people aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean
off the coast of California and quickly sank Thursday, authorities
said, adding that 11 of those aboard were rescued.
</P>
<P>
A dozen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships and six helicopters
were searching for seven people still missing. The search will go
on through the night if necessary, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 plucked from the sea, nine were in stable condition
aboard the "USS Bon Homme Richard," an amphibious assault ship.
Two were in unknown condition at Balboa Naval Hospital in San
Diego, said Marine Lieutenant Joshua Smith.
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knight crashed at about 1:16 p.m., 40 kilometers
southwest of San Diego. The helicopter crashed after taking off
from the "Bon Homme Richard" en route to the "USS Pecos," a Navy
oiler that provides fuel to ships at sea, Marine Lieutenant
Patricia Restrepo said.
</P>
<P>
All those aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary
Unit at Camp Pendleton, about 35 miles north of San Diego, and
were on a training mission to prepare for a six-month deployment
in the Pacific, said Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine CH-46 was first introduced in 1964 and is a
workhorse of the Marine Corps and Navy. It can carry a maximum of
14 troops in addition to the crew of four.

<HEADLINE> China's Reunification Still More Pressing:President Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said
here today that China's reunification has become "still more
pressing" after his country resumes the exercise of its
sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in the second session of the informal
summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse this morning.
</P>
<P>
Macao will return to the motherland in a just couple of days.
Jiang said, describing the event as "another big step forward" for
China's great cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the settlement of the Taiwan issue
and the task of accomplishing China's eventual reunification has
become still more pressing, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin reiterated the Russian government's
consistent adherence to its principled stance on the Taiwan issue
and its support to China's great reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not accept the absurdity that the cross-strait
relationships are the "state-to-state relations," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang expressed his thanks to the Russian side for
its support to the great cause of China's reunification.

international institute for trade negotiation training, aimed at
helping develop trade negotiation skills for personnel of
developing countries so that they would have more experiences and
bargaining power against their counterparts from developed
countries, the report said.

and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, it said.

The priority would be given to executives or representatives
from the private sector, with provided intensive training courses

<P>
YANGON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has already cleared off
the Y2K problem, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Friday,
quoting an announcement of the country's National Committee for
Supervising Y2K Problem.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of Japanese experts and the respective
ministries, the committee and its three subordinate bodies have
solved all the Y2K problems and declared it was "ready for Y2K,"
the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry as
well as some foreign organizations have been offering to help
Myanmar for the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar Minister of Communications, Posts and
Telegraphs Brigadier-General Win Tin, who is also the committee's
chairman, Myanmar has no large computer network to speak of and
taking the precautionary measure for Y2K is not difficult.
</P>
<P>
The National Committee for Supervising Y2K Problem was set up
in January this year and three sub-committees on Y2K awareness,
problem identification and problem solving were further formed to
deal with the issue.

<HEADLINE> Electricity Price Hike Affects Nepal's Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali entrepreneurs are
complaining that the recent hike in the electricity price has
severely affected the competitiveness of export-oriented
manufacturing firms in the foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government recently increased the electricity price
by 25 percent for the industrial sector and by 30 percent for the
domestic sector.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the domestic industries are already sick. The hike in
the electricity tariff adds salt to the injury," said Babu Lal
Chachan, president of Birgunj Chamber of Commerce (BCC). Birgunj
is an industrial and trade city bordering India.
</P>
<P>
"Some 24 manufacturing industries in the area which export
their products to India and other countries are facing tough
competition in the foreign markets. The Tariff hike has weakened
their competitive capacity." said Chachan.
</P>
<P>
Products which are exported to India and other countries from
Nepal include carpets, garments, leather, iron and plastic pipes,
plywood and ghee.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the production cost of these merchandise in the
wake of the electricity hike has made it difficult to compete in
the foreign market, according to some entrepreneurs who talked to
the Kathmandu Post.
</P>
<P>
General secretary of BCC Birendra Shanghai said the production
cost of ghee per km rose by 0.35 rupees (0.005 U.S. dollars) after
the electricity hike.
</P>
<P>
Other commodities such as pipes, plastic goods and leather,
which consume more electricity compared to ghee, are much more
affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the industrial foundation of the country is
weakening, the hike in the electricity tariff will further hinder
the growth of export to a considerable extent, said the
entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry into WTO to Boost Macao Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao's business sector is greatly encouraged by the prospects of
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying that they will embrace international
competition despite pressures.
</P>
<P>
China will open its market wider to overseas after its entry into the WTO. And Macao, well
familiar with the inland market, will play a more important intermediary role.
</P>
<P>
However, Macao has to adapt to the new situation and look for new development space as its
investment in the inland areas is to face a more acute competition, sector insiders said.
</P>
<P>
Most of Macao's enterprises have shown great concern for the motherland's entry into the WTO. And
 the local textile industry, which accounts for more than 80 percent of local exports, will be
little affected by the entry, said Lo Ioi Weng, deputy director of the Macao Department of Economy.
</P>
<P>
Lionel Vai Tac Leong, president of Macao-based Seng San Enterprises Ltd. and Macao's largest
textiles exporter, is confident of Macao's foreign trade. "My enterprise has so far imported more
than 100 million patacas of textiles, and more important, I have had overseas orders for the first
nine months of next year, a guarantee for my business to have a possible increase of 100 percent
next year."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ieong Wan Chong of the University of Macao said that the entry of the inland areas into the
WTO will serve as a powerful backup force for Macao, because China will certainly try to protect
Macao's rights and interests when participating in setting news rules for the organization.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that Macao should speed up economic restructuring and technological upgrading in
its light and textile industries, as the entry will more or less influence these sectors.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to gradually open the financial and services sectors to
overseas, thus providing more opportunities for Macao, and it is especially the case when China
joins the WTO, said An Min, China's assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Macao Special Administrative Region will retain the existing economic and
trade system, and will independently formulate its own economic and foreign trade policies after the
 handover as it enjoys high-degree autonomous administrative and legislative rights, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Macao is a typical export-oriented economy, with its products going to more than 100 countries
and regions. And its 70 to 90 percent of imports come from the inland areas, Hong Kong, and Japan.
So, foreign trade serves as Macao's lifeline and barometer.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Declaration of the
Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of
the Republic of Portugal on the Question of Macao is a key
document on the complete resolution of the Macao issue and a
guiding document on the smooth transfer of power and smooth
transition of Macao. It is also an example of documents on the
successful resolution of nation-to-nation problems left over from
history.
</P>
<P>
The governments of China and Portugal officially signed the
Joint Declaration in Beijing on April 13, 1987. The two
governments exchanged instruments of ratification on the Joint
Declaration in Beijing on January 15, 1988, formally putting into
effect the Joint Declaration. On that date, Macao entered the
transitional period before the handover.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration includes one main document, namely, the
Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of
China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the
Question of Macao, and two annexes, Elaboration by the Government
of the People's Republic of China of Its Basic Policies Regarding
Macao and Arrangements for the Transitional Period.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration explicitly stipulates that the Chinese
government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao from
December 20, 1999. It also elaborates the policies of the Chinese
government that Macao will enjoy high degree of autonomy after
handover and that Macao's current social and economic systems as
well as its way of life will remain unchanged for 50 years. The
laws currently in force in Macao will also remain basically
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
These policies have been written into the Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) which was adopted at the
first session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration came out after a long
process. As early as in February, 1979, the governments of China
and Portugal reached understanding on the issue of Macao as they
established formal diplomatic relations. In May, 1986, the
governments of the two countries issued a press communique on
holding discussions on the issue of Macao. In June of the same
year, the two sides held their first round of talks in Beijing.
After holding four rounds of discussions, the delegations of the
two sides signed a draft joint declaration on March 26, 1987.

<HEADLINE> Seaside Land Reclamation Key to Macao Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao, a 23.5-sq.-km. tiny area,
is carrying on seaside land reclamation projects to prepare land
resources for expected economic boom following its upcoming return
to China on December 20, this year.
</P>
<P>
The islet of Macao has grown into the world's 21st economy in
terms of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) according to the
World Bank, and an important factor behind the local economic
success is, official statistics show, the seaside land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, more than half the island came from land
reclamation efforts. Macao was just an isle of no more than 10
square kilometers before the first land reclamation project was
launched in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
Ever since then, land reclamation has become increasingly
important to promoting local economy and improving environment.
</P>
<P>
The largest scale of land reclamation started in the 1920s and
1930s, expanding Macao's area to 15.52 square kilometers, a rise
of more than 40 percent. However, a large amount of reclaimed land
was left idle due to slow-growing economy in the ensuing 30 years,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The prime time for Macao's development was the 1960s and 1970s,
and continued into the early 1990s. The boom has helped the use of
the idle reclaimed land, where tall office and residential
apartment buildings have been mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
And on December 20, the day of the founding of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR), some 10 billion Patacas worth
of land fund will be handed over to the Macao SAR government, a
guarantee for the smooth operations of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of Annex II to the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Declaration, all incomes obtained by the Portuguese Macao
government from granting new land leases and renewing land leases
shall be shared equally between the Portuguese Macao government
and the upcoming Macao SAR government. And reclaimed land is
everything to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up drive in the inland areas pushed
Macao's land reclamation move in the early 1980s. And in 1983,
Macao began to reclaim 27 hectares of seaside land near the New
Port area, where the imminent handover ceremony will be held.
</P>
<P>
The Macao International Airport, which was put into use in 1995,
stands on 1.9 square kilometers of reclaimed land, with a 3,360-
meter runway stretching into the sea.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Homecoming Allows Local People to Become Their Own Masters( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao's return to China on Dec.
20 will bring the humiliating history of the Chinese people to an
end, and no part of Asia will be under European rule for the first
time in half a millennium.
</P>
<P>
And from that date on Macao people will become their own
masters, ending Portugal's 155-year rule over the region.
</P>
<P>
In the era of Portuguese rule in Macao, Chinese inhabitants in
the region have had no right to participate in political decision
making, and only a very small portion of the local civil servants
were Chinese before the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration was
signed in 1987.
</P>
<P>
However, under the principle of "one country, two systems" and
the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR),
Macao will have a new political system after its return to China,
which is different from that in inland areas of China or that in
western countries. It is a system that ensures that Macao people
shall administer Macao and that the region shall have a high
degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Under Portuguese colonial rule, the Macao governor is appointed
by the Portuguese government without asking for the opinion of the
Macao people, let alone being elected by the local people.
</P>
<P>
As Macao's return to China draws near, things have begun to
change. The over 400,000 Macao inhabitants have selected their own
chief executive for the future MSAR, and more than 90 percent of
the future Macao SAR government officials are local residents,
including the chief executive designate, Edmund Ho Hau Wah, and
other eight principal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) has held a total
of 37 plenary sessions and 56 rounds of talks between the chief
representatives of the two sides since January 15 1988, when the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration took effect. Under the joint
efforts from both sides, the three issues -- localization of civil
servants, localization of laws and the status of the Chinese
language -- have been basically resolved.
</P>
<P>
Properly solving the three issues left over from history is the
key to realizing a smooth transition and transfer of government in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Of the three issues, localization of the civil servants is the
first priority. So far, all medium- and low-level civil servants
in Macao are local residents, and the proportion of local
residents among high-level civil servants has already exceeded 50
percent and is still on the rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Return of Macao to its motherland is driving all civil
servants to work hard, because of the pride they feel as masters
of their own land," said Florinda da Rosa Silva Chan, secretary
for administration and justice in the future MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee for the First MSAR Government has
elected Edmund Ho Hau Wah first chief executive of the future MSAR
last May, under the principle of "Macao people administering Macao.
"
</P>
<P>
"Macao compatriots support the MSAR Basic Law and have full
confidence in Macao's future," Edmund Ho said."Macao will
undoubtedly have a better future after it is freed of the colonial
rule and returns to its motherland."
</P>
<P>
Nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the Chinese
central government, the five secretaries of Chinese origin will
fill key decision-making positions of the MSAR government as they
are sworn into office on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The successful selection of the president of the Court of Final
Appeal and Procurator-General, both Chinese in origin, signaled
the end of choosing principal officials for the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The destiny of Macao is closely connected with a successful
implementation of the concept of "one country, two systems,"
Edmund Ho said, pledging that the MSAR government is determined to
build Macao into a prosperous and developed region.
</P>
<P>
Directly under the jurisdiction of the central government, the
MSAR government will achieve a high degree of autonomy: while the
central government is responsible for affairs related with
sovereignty and national interests, the MSAR government enjoys
executive, legislative and independent judicial powers, including
the power of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Macao coming near, the secretaries of the
future MSAR government have come into regular contact with Macao-
Portuguese officials to prepare for a smooth transition and
transfer of government.
</P>
<P>
Chinese, established as an official language in Macao, is
gaining increasing popularity among the Macao people. Macao-born
Portuguese and Macao-Portuguese officials are also showing
enthusiasm for learning Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to its motherland signals an end to the history
of foreigners occupying and ruling part of the Chinese territory.
Macao people, in their eager anticipation for an early return to
the motherland, see their feelings echoed in a poem by Wen Yiduo,
a well-known poet of the 1940s: "Mother, it has been too long
since I left you ... call me by my infant name Aomen. Mother, I
want to come back."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia Policy Not Changed Despite Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that its Russia policy has not changed despite the
strained relations between the two countries caused by the spying
charges against each other and disputes over Russia's military
operation in its republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Mike Hammer, spokesman for the White House National Security
Council, told reporters at the White House that the U.S. "policy
of engagement with Russia has not changed."
</P>
<P>
"We have a broad range of shared interests in the U.S.-Russia
relationship and we intend to continue to pursue them," Hammer
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced Thursday that it is expelling a Russian
diplomat, accusing him of eavesdropping the State Department.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat, Stanislav Borisovic Gusev, who was first
identified as a second secretary and later as an attache in the
Russian embassy, was ordered to leave the country within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Citing the arrest of Gusev by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) outside the State Department on Wednesday,
Hammer said: "This incident demonstrates how seriously we take
counterintelligence and our technical countermeasures program."
</P>
<P>
"We must remain vigilant of threats posed by foreign
intelligence services, regardless of the state of bilateral
relations with a particular country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate briefing at the State Department,
Assistant Secretary of State David Carpenter said that
counterintelligence agents of the FBI and the State Department's
Diplomatic Security Service "have worked jointly to neutralize
this intelligence-gathering effort."
</P>
<P>
"This episode should be a stark reminder to all of us at
government that despite the thawing of tensions between competing
nations, government facilities and personnel remain a desirable
target for foreign intelligence services," Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
"This matter reinforces the department's belief that its
counterintelligence program must remain a cornerstone of its
overall security posture," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same briefing, FBI Assistant Director Neil
Gallagher said the incident was "a very important story of Russian
intelligence activity within the United States."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said that a U.S. surveillance team made an
observation that Gusev was standing in the vicinity of State
Department, and "it took them as a little bit odd."
</P>
<P>
"Over a period of some time, what they identified was that on
a rather frequent basis, each week, Mr. Gusev would show up in the
vicinity of State Department, literally just walking around the
surrounding street," Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
The team also noticed that Gusev's manner in parking his car
and the way that he located -- where he parked his car -- was a
little bit unusual, and it suggested to them that this may take on
some more significance, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials said eavesdropping devices were put into
sensitive areas of the State Department, but no such device was
found in Secretary Madeleine Albright's office.
</P>
<P>
Gusev was arrested Wednesday on a bench outside the State
Department, where President Bill Clinton was holding a press
conference, and later turned over to the Russian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was kept informed of the case over the course of
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian authorities ordered the expulsion of a U.S.
diplomat in Moscow, charging that the diplomat, identified as
Cheri Leberknight, has tried to steal Russia's secret military
information.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. law enforcement said that the U.S. move
should not be seen as a retaliation measure. Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder said the arrest of Gusev was not "a question
of any retaliation" for Russia's action, adding, "They are
separate matters."

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Spending on Web advertising
in the United States is expected to slow down although total
dollar figures will continue to increase through 2003, according
to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Online advertising spending will grow from 3.1 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999 to 4.82 billion in 2000 and 13.3 billion by 2003,
said the report from eMarketer, a U.S. firm specializing in online
business.
</P>
<P>
"The year-to-year increases that occurred in 1997 and 1998 are
not sustainable," said the report. "As the base gets bigger, the
rate of growth in online advertising will slow during the next
five years."
</P>
<P>
Online advertising spending in 2003 will represent 4.7 percent
of total advertising expenditures in the United States, which are
expected to top 285 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
New media content properties and computer-related products and
services are buying the largest portion of Web ads in the United
States, accounting for 48 percent of the total online ad spending,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Computer hardware and software advertisers are also spending
heavily on the Internet as they are a natural fit for the Web
audience. Consumer package goods marketers are now beginning to
divert more of their massive ad budgets toward online advertising.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed that while the Internet is
experiencing rapid growth, it will never totally supplant
advertising in traditional forms of media.
</P>
<P>
"Online marketers will still rely on other, off-line media to
create awareness, build and promote their brands, and drive
traffic to their Web sites," the report said. "The Net is merely
one tool, with specific strengths and weaknesses, in the overall
advertising mix."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Assembly Major Factions Agree to Maintain Unitary State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The five major factions of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
decision-making body, agreed to maintain the Unitary State of
Republic Indonesia, according to national newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting chaired by deputy chairman of the MPR Working
Committee I Slamet Effendi Yusuf on Thursday, the major factions
said they had decided to maintain their stance in order to keep
Indonesia intact.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the
Nation Awakening Party, the United Development Party and the
Crescent Star Party agreed to maintain the Unitary State of
Republic Indonesia and the presidential system.
</P>
<P>
The MPR Working Committee I resumed its meeting to amend the
1945 Constitution amid daily protests demanding larger autonomy
for several resource-rich regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Following the August 30 United Nations-led ballot on East Timor,
which saw the territory vote to separate from Indonesia, the
province of Aceh has stepped up campaigns for a referendum to
decide on its own future.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Aceh, the provinces of Riau, Irian Jaya and
South Sulawesi have demanded a larger share of the country's
natural wealth.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR) Akbar Tandjung
has repeatedly said that the parliament would oppose any policy
that places the nation's unity in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Akbar has warned that another breakup will trigger further
breakaways.
</P>
<P>
During a consultative meeting with the DPR on Wednesday,
President Abdurrahman Wahid reiterated that his government would
not tolerate any province attempting to secede from the republic.
</P>
<P>
The government has refused to give the Acehnese an option for
independence in the planned referendum.
</P>
<P>
"Aceh will remain part of Indonesia," Wahid stressed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the policy set by the president, Indonesian
Military (TNI) Commander Adm. Widodo Adisucipto said TNI is
constantly alert in anticipating the worst possible threat to the
country's integrity.
</P>
<P>
"TNI is ready at all times. But we will take measures in
accordance with the law because we are part of the law enforcers,"
Widodo said.
</P>
<P>
The Aceh issue would be solved through reconciliatory dialogues,
and to hold such dialogues a conducive situation was needed, he
said, adding that this could be achieved only if security
conditions were stable.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sports Council Gets Money For Olympics Preparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Gelora Senayan Management
Board (BPGS) has pledged to provide 2 billion rupiah (2.8 million
U.S.dollars) to Indonesia's National Sports Council (KONI) to
stage its long-term training program for the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Gelora Senayan Executive Directors Yasidi
Hambali said KONI had officially requested 5 billion rupiah to
stage the training.
</P>
<P>
"I have urged the BPGS chairman, State Secretary Ali Rahman, to
disburse the money at the latest by January to enable KONI to
stage its Olympic training programs," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI has said it will need 6.9 billion rupiah for its Olympic
preparations. It has submitted its budget proposal to the National
Development Planning Board, however the board is yet to respond.
</P>
<P>
KONI secretary-general Rudolf Warouw said earlier that he hoped
BPGS would disburse the 2 billion rupiah fund before the training
center opened in February.
</P>
<P>
"If there are no more funds, then we will prioritize the most
likely medal winners to compete at the Olympics. If there are
sports organizations who have athletes which have qualified for
the Olympics, and they want to finance their athletes' preparation,
then we won't have any problems in sending them all," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic
 of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the Question of Macao is a key document
on the complete resolution of the Macao issue and a guiding document on the smooth transfer of power
 and smooth transition of Macao. It is also an example of documents on the successful resolution of
nation-to-nation problems left over from history.
</P>
<P>
The governments of China and Portugal officially signed the Joint Declaration in Beijing on April
 13, 1987. The two governments exchanged instruments of ratification on the Joint Declaration in
Beijing on January 15, 1988, formally putting into effect the Joint Declaration. On that date, Macao
 entered the transitional period before the handover.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration includes one main document, namely, the Joint Declaration of the
Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the
Question of Macao, and two annexes, Elaboration by the Government of the People's Republic of China
of Its Basic Policies Regarding Macao and Arrangements for the Transitional Period.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration explicitly stipulates that the Chinese government will resume the exercise
of sovereignty over Macao from December 20, 1999. It also elaborates the policies of the Chinese
government that Macao will enjoy high degree of autonomy after handover and that Macao's current
social and economic systems as well as its way of life will remain unchanged for 50 years. The laws
currently in force in Macao will also remain basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
These policies have been written into the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR) which was adopted at the first session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) on March
 31.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration came out after a long process. As early as in February,
1979, the governments of China and Portugal reached understanding on the issue of Macao as they
established formal diplomatic relations. In May, 1986, the governments of the two countries issued a
 press communique on holding discussions on the issue of Macao. In June of the same year, the two
sides held their first round of talks in Beijing. After holding four rounds of discussions, the
delegations of the two sides signed a draft joint declaration on March 26, 1987.

<HEADLINE> Seaside Land Reclamation Key to Macao Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao, a 23.5-sq.-km. tiny area, is carrying on seaside land
reclamation projects to prepare land resources for expected economic boom following its upcoming
return to China on December 20, this year.
</P>
<P>
The islet of Macao has grown into the world's 21st economy in terms of per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) according to the World Bank, and an important factor behind the local economic success
 is, official statistics show, the seaside land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, more than half the island came from land reclamation efforts. Macao was just
 an isle of no more than 10 square kilometers before the first land reclamation project was launched
 in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
Ever since then, land reclamation has become increasingly important to promoting local economy
and improving environment.
</P>
<P>
The largest scale of land reclamation started in the 1920s and 1930s, expanding Macao's area to
15.52 square kilometers, a rise of more than 40 percent. However, a large amount of reclaimed land
was left idle due to slow-growing economy in the ensuing 30 years, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The prime time for Macao's development was the 1960s and 1970s, and continued into the early
1990s. The boom has helped the use of the idle reclaimed land, where tall office and residential
apartment buildings have been mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
And on December 20, the day of the founding of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR),
some 10 billion Patacas worth of land fund will be handed over to the Macao SAR government, a
guarantee for the smooth operations of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of Annex II to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, all incomes
obtained by the Portuguese Macao government from granting new land leases and renewing land leases
shall be shared equally between the Portuguese Macao government and the upcoming Macao SAR
government. And reclaimed land is everything to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up drive in the inland areas pushed Macao's land reclamation move in the
early 1980s. And in 1983, Macao began to reclaim 27 hectares of seaside land near the New Port area,
 where the imminent handover ceremony will be held.
</P>
<P>
The Macao International Airport, which was put into use in 1995, stands on 1.9 square kilometers
of reclaimed land, with a 3,360-meter runway stretching into the sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has promised that there are plans for a massive
development drive before the island country votes in the December
21 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election rally Thursday night at Mahiyangana in
central Sri Lanka, Kumaratunga outlined the plan to take the
island country into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga is seeking another term and her main rival is Ranil
Wickremesinghe of the main opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
She told the rally that the plan will include 10 industrial
zones and 50 large-scale projects which will be carried out to
generate 300,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Additionally two hydro electricity projects at the Gin Ganga
and Kalu Ganga and eight other power stations will be initiated.
</P>
<P>
The Bandaranaike International Airport and the Colombo harbor
will be developed to make Colombo a financial hub in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president said infrastructure will be accelerated. Water,
telephones and electricity will reach every corner of the country
and the economy will be further strengthened, she said.
</P>
<P>
Educational reforms have already been launched and the
electorate will have fully equipped schools, said Kumaratunga,
adding that the health sector will be further developed.
</P>
<P>
Business sources said President Kumaratunga is also expected to
meet the country's business community on Saturday to unveil new
plans for the private sector in a bid to woo their votes in the
presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Homecoming Allows Local People to Become Their Own Masters (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao's return to China on Dec. 20 will bring the humiliating
history of the Chinese people to an end, and no part of Asia will be under European rule for the
first time in half a millennium.
</P>
<P>
And from that date on Macao people will become their own masters, ending Portugal's 155-year rule
 over the region.
</P>
<P>
In the era of Portuguese rule in Macao, Chinese inhabitants in the region have had no right to
participate in political decision making, and only a very small portion of the local civil servants
were Chinese before the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration was signed in 1987.
</P>
<P>
However, under the principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law of the Macao Special
 Administrative Region (MSAR), Macao will have a new political system after its return to China,
which is different from that in inland areas of China or that in western countries. It is a system
that ensures that Macao people shall administer Macao and that the region shall have a high degree
of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Under Portuguese colonial rule, the Macao governor is appointed by the Portuguese government
without asking for the opinion of the Macao people, let alone being elected by the local people.
</P>
<P>
As Macao's return to China draws near, things have begun to change. The over 400,000 Macao
inhabitants have selected their own chief executive for the future MSAR, and more than 90 percent of
 the future Macao SAR government officials are local residents, including the chief executive
designate, Edmund Ho Hau Wah, and other eight principal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) has held a total of 37 plenary sessions and 56
rounds of talks between the chief representatives of the two sides since January 15 1988, when the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration took effect. Under the joint efforts from both sides, the three
issues -- localization of civil servants, localization of laws and the status of the Chinese
language -- have been basically resolved.
</P>
<P>
Properly solving the three issues left over from history is the key to realizing a smooth
transition and transfer of government in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Of the three issues, localization of the civil servants is the first priority. So far, all
medium- and low-level civil servants in Macao are local residents, and the proportion of local
residents among high-level civil servants has already exceeded 50 percent and is still on the rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Return of Macao to its motherland is driving all civil servants to work hard, because of the
pride they feel as masters of their own land," said Florinda da Rosa Silva Chan, secretary for
administration and justice in the future MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee for the First MSAR Government has elected Edmund Ho Hau Wah first chief
executive of the future MSAR last May, under the principle of "Macao people administering Macao."
</P>
<P>
"Macao compatriots support the MSAR Basic Law and have full confidence in Macao's future," Edmund
 Ho said."Macao will undoubtedly have a better future after it is freed of the colonial rule and
returns to its motherland."
</P>
<P>
Nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the Chinese central government, the five
secretaries of Chinese origin will fill key decision-making positions of the MSAR government as they
 are sworn into office on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The successful selection of the president of the Court of Final Appeal and Procurator-General,
both Chinese in origin, signaled the end of choosing principal officials for the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The destiny of Macao is closely connected with a successful implementation of the concept of "one
 country, two systems," Edmund Ho said, pledging that the MSAR government is determined to build
Macao into a prosperous and developed region.
</P>
<P>
Directly under the jurisdiction of the central government, the MSAR government will achieve a
high degree of autonomy: while the central government is responsible for affairs related with
sovereignty and national interests, the MSAR government enjoys executive, legislative and
independent judicial powers, including the power of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Macao coming near, the secretaries of the future MSAR government have come
into regular contact with Macao-Portuguese officials to prepare for a smooth transition and
transfer of government.
</P>
<P>
Chinese, established as an official language in Macao, is gaining increasing popularity among the
 Macao people. Macao-born Portuguese and Macao-Portuguese officials are also showing enthusiasm for
learning Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to its motherland signals an end to the history of foreigners occupying and ruling
 part of the Chinese territory. Macao people, in their eager anticipation for an early return to the
 motherland, see their feelings echoed in a poem by Wen Yiduo, a well-known poet of the 1940s:
"Mother, it has been too long since I left you ... call me by my infant name Aomen. Mother, I want
to come back."

BEIJING, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Motorola,a U.S.-based telecom
world giant, recently set up a "Motorola Town" in Chengdu to
deepen its roots in that capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
It is another important investment of the transnational company
in west China following its establishment of a research center at
a cost of 100 million yuan (some 12 million U.S. dollars) in
Chengdu this October.
</P>
<P>
"No transnational company will overlook the large market and
profits in west China," said P. Y. Lai, senior vice-president of
Motorola and president of the Motorola (China) Electronics Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Besides Motorola, 40 other transnational corporations like P&AMP;G,
Siemens, Nokia and Toyota have invested in Sichuan, where there
are over 5,000 overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Covering ten provinces, autonomous regions and a municipality
including Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Chongqing, west
China has been seeking international cooperation to speed up its
economic development since 1978, when China started reforms and
opening up.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, more than 15,000 overseas-funded
enterprises had entered the region with a total investment of some
70 billion U.S. dollars, according to the latest figures from the
National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Chinese central government is brewing a development
strategy to spur the landlocked region's economic growth, keeping
in mind that the influx of overseas capital is vital for local
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
China will put high on its agenda infrastructural projects
involving highways, railways, airports in the west region, said
Zeng Peiyan, minister of the State Development Planning Commission,
adding that the capital construction is to be accelerated at an
unprecedented rate.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some provinces and regions in the west are formulating more
preferential measures for overseas investors so that the
infrastructural construction is put on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has opened sectors of finance, insurance and
telecommunications to overseas investors, as well as several other
formerly strictly-controlled sectors in west China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local governments now encourage overseas
enterprises to invest in agricultural, water conservancy,
transportation, energy, raw materials and environmental protection
projects. Foreign banks are also welcomed to set up branches there.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jingyan, deputy director of the department of foreign
investment administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, said that the industrial catalog of overseas
investment, along with a series of tax-reduction policies, is
being drafted now.
</P>
<P>
The west China region covers some 56 percent of China's
territory and accounts for about 50 percent of verified mineral
deposits. With a population of nearly 300 million, it also has
abundant human resources and a large market that contains numerous
business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, large-sized
infrastructural projects involving energy, communications and
telecommunications expect to absorb investment of 180 billion yuan
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are also large numbers of talented scientists
in some capital cities in the region such as Chengdu, Xi'an and
Lanzhou. The proportion of highly-educated people in west China
exceeds the national average.
</P>
<P>
At the third international investment and trade fair in Fujian,
State Councilor Wu Yi encouraged overseas investors to invest as
boldly in west China as they did in the coastal southeast.
</P>
<P>
She said that as long as they take full advantage of the
resources and preferential policies in west China, overseas
investors are certain to make profits.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Year, New Hopes, New Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Asians are celebrating the
coming of the new year with new hopes for stronger growth in a
post-crisis Asia, but the recovery now underway will not run
easily in the year 2000 due to new economic risks to the regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Asia's economic performance in 1999 is a pleasant
surprise to many people, and even the World Bank and the Asian
Development Banks (ADB) had to revise their forecasts for the
region several times during the year.
</P>
<P>
In its latest outlook in November, the ADB projected a 5.7
percent GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate for Asia in 1999,
and a same rate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Such a projection is identical with that of many economists,
who predicted that Asia is likely to see steady growth in the new
year after a faster-than-expected recovery in 1999 from a two-year-
old regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Asia's performance this year is really remarkable,
compared with a 2.3 percent increase a year ago, when some East
and Southeast Asian economies fell into a severe recession.
</P>
<P>
But economists said that despite the rebound, the next year
will present struggling nations with new risks.
</P>
<P>
"A weak U.S. dollar and lack of credit growth are the two key
risks to Asia's economic recovery next year," said Chi Lo, senior
economist for HSBC Economics &AMP; Investment Strategy.
</P>
<P>
Other economists also cited fragile consumer and business
confidence, and renewed weakness of the Japanese economy as new
risks to the Asian economy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Within the region, the lack of credit growth remains a major
risk to economic recovery. In 2000, Asian banks will go through a
post-crisis transformation, but their huge non-performing loans,
which are as high as 10 percent to 60 percent of the total, could
hardly make them lend to sustain GDP growth when credit demand
revives.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, high levels of non-performing loans cast doubt on
the strength of the recovery in 2000, as banks will focus on
repairing balance sheets instead of seeking out new lending
opportunities, economists said.
</P>
<P>
While the situation is changing in some economies, such as
Malaysia, where new loan approvals almost doubled in the first
nine months of this year, a thorough turnaround still needs time
in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Another risk to the economy is the weak consumer and business
confidence. In 1999, recovery in the crisis countries was fueled
by government deficit spending, but next year governments will
have to ease back fiscal stimulus, because such a move has
increased their current account deficit by 5-6 percent of their
GDP in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Although consumers are starting to spend after two years of
belt-tightening, the lower employment and lower wages in the
crisis-hit economies will prevent high consumption in the new year.
</P>
<P>
As for the external environment, the uncertain recovery trend
in Japan is not good news for Asia. In the third quarter of this
year, the Japanese economy shrank at a 3.8 percent annual pace.
</P>
<P>
"The assumption that there's a modest upswing in the Japanese)
economy is likely to be severely questioned," said Robert Feldman,
chief economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd.
</P>
<P>
As Asian economies' major trade partner and creditor, Japan's
slow recovery process will affect the region's exports and
investment, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the U.S. economic situation, including a potential sharp
fall of the dollar, is one of the risks to the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that while this year's main concern was whether
the U.S. economic growth will slow down, a growing worry in 2000
will be whether the U.S. financial economy cracks.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. dollar or stock market crash will bring volatility to
world financial markets, and cause instability in Asian markets,
which have just returned to normal this year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Asia, which is full of hopes for a better economic situation in
2000, must be very cautious toward the new risks, economists said.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry into WTO to Boost Macao Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao's business sector is greatly encouraged by the prospects of
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying that they will embrace international
competition despite pressures.
</P>
<P>
China will open its market wider to overseas after its entry into the WTO. And Macao, well
familiar with the inland market, will play a more important intermediary role.
</P>
<P>
However, Macao has to adapt to the new situation and look for new development space as its
investment in the inland areas is to face a more acute competition, sector insiders said.
</P>
<P>
Most of Macao's enterprises have shown great concern for the motherland's entry into the WTO. And
 the local textile industry, which accounts for more than 80 percent of local exports, will be
little affected by the entry, said Lo Ioi Weng, deputy director of the Macao Department of Economy.
</P>
<P>
Lionel Vai Tac Leong, president of Macao-based Seng San Enterprises Ltd. and Macao's largest
textiles exporter, is confident of Macao's foreign trade. "My enterprise has so far imported more
than 100 million patacas of textiles, and more important, I have had overseas orders for the first
nine months of next year, a guarantee for my business to have a possible increase of 100 percent
next year."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ieong Wan Chong of the University of Macao said that the entry of the inland areas into the
WTO will serve as a powerful backup force for Macao, because China will certainly try to protect
Macao's rights and interests when participating in setting news rules for the organization.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that Macao should speed up economic restructuring and technological upgrading in
its light and textile industries, as the entry will more or less influence these sectors.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to gradually open the financial and services sectors to
overseas, thus providing more opportunities for Macao, and it is especially the case when China
joins the WTO, said An Min, China's assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Macao Special Administrative Region will retain the existing economic and
trade system, and will independently formulate its own economic and foreign trade policies after the
 handover as it enjoys high-degree autonomous administrative and legislative rights, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Macao is a typical export-oriented economy, with its products going to more than 100 countries
and regions. And its 70 to 90 percent of imports come from the inland areas, Hong Kong, and Japan.
So, foreign trade serves as Macao's lifeline and barometer.

<HEADLINE> First Laboratory-Grown Corneas Created in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have
created the first laboratory-grown human corneas, media reports
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Leading researcher May Griffith of the University of Ottawa
said the human cells they had chosen from all three main layers of
the cornea grew into "corneal equivalents."
</P>
<P>
"They show the same function as a real human cornea," she
concluded after witnessing successful end results of a two-week
human cornea growth in a lab.
</P>
<P>
Griffith and her colleagues also conducted chemical, genetic
and physiological tests to prove that the lab grown corneas
function like real corneas.
</P>
<P>
The artificial corneas, when exposed to irritating soap,
produce defense chemicals ranging from interleukin-1 to IL-6.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that "the corneal equivalents had an active
response to different grades of injury, an important functional
characteristic of human corneas," said the Canadian researchers in
a report in Friday's issue of Science journal.
</P>
<P>
The immediate uses for the artificial corneas are in testing
drugs and chemicals, or in biomedical research involving "wound
healing and cell-matrix interactions," according to the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
They are yet to improve the artificial corneas, which are not
as strong as real corneas in so far as protecting the eye is
concerned. The additional research may take years before another
breakthrough is claimed for eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian researchers tried growing corneas from human eye
cells but there has been a lack of donated corneas for their
research.
</P>
<P>
An average 40,000 corneal transplants are performed each year
with donated corneas, which are also in short supply.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Satisfied Being Grouped With China in 2002 World Cup Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of the
Indonesian Soccer Federation (PSSI) expressed his satisfaction
over the results of the recent draw for the Asian Zone qualifying
competition for the 2002 World Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is grouped with China, the Maldives and Cambodia in
Group 9.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad we are in the same group as China, we have never met
them in an international event before. In the past, (South) Korea
was the constant obstacle for us," M. Zein, PSSI director, was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that PSSI was well aware of the probability
of having one Asian giant in the group, because of their dominance
of the sport, even before the draw began.
</P>
<P>
In the recent draw, which took place in Japan, PSSI was seeded
in the second line, so it was widely anticipated that PSSI would
be drawn in the same group as one of the first seeded Asian teams
such as Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and China.
</P>
<P>
According to Zein, being in the same group as China, Indonesia
would at least gain experience given China's long and formidable
soccer career.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we can benefit plenty from China. Despite being
considered as having only an outside chance of winning against
China, I am not really pessimistic about our chances. In soccer,
anything can happen. Even an underdog can often give trouble to a
superior opponent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, regarding preparations for the bid -- the first
match kicks off in the year 2001 -- Zein revealed that there will
be no special preparation, but it will be a continuation of PSSI's
agenda in the 2000 Asia Cup.
</P>
<P>
The team which will be announced for the World Cup qualifiers
is likely to be the same squad which is currently preparing for
the 2000 Asia Cup.
</P>
<P>
Asian Zone comprises 40 teams which are divided into 10 groups.
The winning team from each group will advance to the second round,
which is split into two groups.
</P>
<P>
The top teams from each of these two groups will go through to
the Finals cohosted by Japan and South Korea while the runners-up
will play each other with the victor securing a berth in the play-
off against a European team.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the play-off will qualify for the 2002 Finals.

<HEADLINE> Life-Line to Macao Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A road stretching over a
dozen miles linking Zhuhai, a port city in south China's Guangdong
Province, with Macao is so vital to ensuring meat and fruit for
the dinner tables in Macao that the road is called a "life-line."
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the sole land link to Macao from the interior has
been continuous since China's economic reform began in the late
1970s. Everyday, nearly 100 trucks carrying vegetables, livestock,
raw materials, and machinery products, set off from the Gongbei
Customs in Zhuhai to neighboring Macao that will return to the
motherland on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Macao is without drinkable water resources and suffers a
serious shortage of arable farmland. Since the early 1980s, Zhuhai
has been supplying most of Macao's fruits and vegetables, and has
further expanded the cultivation of vegetable fields and orchards
by 40 hectares this year for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The city did 540 million U.S. dollars worth of trade with Macao
last year, accounting for 62.6 percent of its trade with the
interior area.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been rewarded in form of direct investment by
Macao's entrepreneurs, with related investments occupying one
third of the city's total overseas funding volume.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Benhui, deputy mayor of Zhuhai, said that investment from
Macao has sped up the economic growth of his city, which has
turned from a small, secluded fishing village into a bustling
bonded zone in the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: EU Makes Big Strides in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Europeans may well count
1999 as one of the most fruitful years in their integration
process, with the European Union launching a single currency,
quickening its enlargement, initializing judicial cooperation and
preparing to forge a common foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
The moves demonstrate the 15-nation bloc's strong desire to
become one power polar in the future multi-polar world despite
serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
The euro was successfully launched on January 1, 30 years after
a plan for the single currency was put first forward in 1969. The
emergence of the euro as a major currency on the world market has
been regarded as "the beginning of a new era in Europe" and a "
catalyst" for achieving political integration with the concept of
"politics follows economy," which was advocated by European
politicians in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The new currency has since played a vital role in ensuring
coordinated economic development and overall economic growth in
the 11-member euro zone.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the EU has made remarkable progress in its
eastward expansion process.
</P>
<P>
Overcoming disagreement among EU governments over the timetable
of the accession, the bloc made a strategic decision for a "united
Europe as a whole" by accepting 10 Central and East European
countries plus Cyprus and Malta as its would-be new members.
</P>
<P>
The group started "substantial" accession talks last year with
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus,
the so-called "first wave candidates."
</P>
<P>
"The second wave" candidate countries are Romania, Slovak,
Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia and Malta, which are undertaking
domestic reforms in order to meet EU criteria.
</P>
<P>
Last year some EU countries insisted that the first wave
candidates should not be accepted until the year 2006. But after
heated debates, they agreed this summer to shorten the process.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Romano Prodi placed the eastward
expansion as the priority of the EU executive institution after he
took office in September. He said it is not enough to have only
15 members to keep a stable and wealthy Europe.
</P>
<P>
In October, EU members agreed that negotiations with the second
wave candidates will start early next year, hoping the first group
of six candidates are to join the organization in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the integration process has set off in the fields of
justice and defense.
</P>
<P>
The EU governments are working more closely together on justice
and home affairs, which is relatively an independent domain in EU
countries as legal systems EU-wide are different.
</P>
<P>
During their October summit meeting in Tempere, Finland, EU
leaders unanimously agreed to launch judicial cooperation within
the bloc in order to unify EU members' immigration and asylum
policy, fight against cross-border crimes and set up a "common
justice area."
</P>
<P>
With its members stressing more on state sovereignty than on a
common decision-making mechanism, the 15-nation block, the world's
largest economic group, has so far failed to exert much political
and security influence in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
When a security crisis took place in Europe, the group could do
nothing but invite the United States to intervene through the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The war in Kosovo earlier this year spurred the group to
rethink about the political and security realities in the region
and to finally make up their mind to speak in "a single voice" on
diplomatic issues and achieve the so-called "European security and
defense identity" so as to win military independence from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the European allies have taken a spate of measures
to promote their political and security strength since the latter
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Former NATO Secretary General Javier Solana was appointed EU
high representative for foreign and security policy, a position
seen as the EU minister of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
EU member states decided to integrate the Western European
Union, a long established defense organization in Europe, into the
European Union as its "military arm" with missions for
peacekeeping and humanitarian rescue actions in the future.
</P>
<P>
On November 15, EU foreign and defense ministers discussed at a
meeting in Brussels a proposal on forming a rapid reaction force
under the control of the EU, signaling Europe's resolve to settle
its security crises independently. The big powers in the EU, like
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, have reached concerted
stance in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe however that Europe has a long way to go
toward a real common defense policy, since how to deal with
relations with NATO and the United States has always been a very
sensitive issue for the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are obviously uneasy about the moves taken by the
Europeans following the Kosovo crisis and have warned that the EU
is not allowed to split ties with NATO by trying to set up its own
defense house.
</P>
<P>
In the foreseeable future, several obstacles loom large on the
EU's integration path.
</P>
<P>
To form a genuine economic power, the economic and monetary
union will have to attract the remaining four members -- Britain,
Greece, Sweden and Denmark -- to enter the euro zone. The four
nations, who chose not to get on the euro train tentatively, have
so far withheld from giving timetables to enter the zone.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic organization will also have to conduct
institutional reforms to streamline its administration at all
levels in order to adapt itself to future changes, especially when
the 15 would-be new members join the group over the next two or
three decades.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect of the European history, the unity process has
been firmly dominated by economic integration. With the single
currency now established, the European nations are seen moving to
shift the focus to political oneness, a goal originally set forth
by the EU founding fathers to end "centuries and centuries of
bloody conflict and social upheaval" across the continent.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Hails Nicaragua's Appeal to The Hague on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government on
Thursday expressed its satisfaction with the appeal made by
Nicaragua to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for
the definition of the maritime border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran government said in a communique that it is
awaiting the decision of the international court on Nicaragua's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Honduran-Nicaraguan relations were strained after the Honduran
Congress ratified an agreement on maritime limits with Colombia
which Managua said deprives it of 130,000 square kilometers of sea
in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran government said it recognizes the right of all
states to request the implementation of the international judicial
resources and is satisfied with Nicaragua's resorting to an
international jurisdictional solution.
</P>
<P>
Managua said it is confident that Nicaragua "will renounce the
adoption of de facto measures, unilaterally, that cloud the
harmony between the states of the isthmus and their process of
economic integration."
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua has applied a 35 percent tariff to Honduran products
and restricted the transit of the neighboring country's personnel
and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in 1986 between Honduras and Colombia,
establishes parallel 15th as the border between Honduras and
Nicaragua and acknowledges Colombia's sovereignty over the San
Andres archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua claims the possession of the archipelago and says its
border with Honduras is parallel 17th.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Asks Nullity of Honduras-Colombia Maritime Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua on Thursday requested
the Central American Court of Justice (CCJ) to nullify the
maritime treaty between Honduras and Colombia, and punish Honduras
for its "rebellious act" to the Central American community, said a
communique from the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran congress ratified on November 30 the treaty of
maritime limits signed with Colombia in 1986, which, according to
Managua, deprives Nicaragua of 130,000 square kilometers of its
territorial waters in the Caribbean sea.
</P>
<P>
The CCJ asked Honduras last week to suspend the ratification
procedure of the questioned treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry charged that the Honduras-
Colombia Treaty deprives the Central America community of a large
maritime space, and benefits a third country outside the regional
integration process.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry also requested the CCJ to determine the
international responsibility Honduras might have to shoulder and
the reparations to make to Nicaragua and the other member states
of the Regional Integration System.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Nicaragua presented a law suit against Honduras
before the International Court of Justice of The Hague, requesting
the international body to determine the limits of Honduras and
Nicaragua in maritime waters in the Caribbean sea.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France Still Row On Beef At EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain and France still keep
their tension Thursday over the French ban on British beef before
the European Union (EU) Summit on Friday and Saturday in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
President of the European Parliament Nicole Fontaine said here
during a European Socialist Summit meeting that the French beef
ban is not fair to the British farmers. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin also attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
France's announcement late Wednesday that its ban would stay
because of insufficient guarantees that British beef was free of
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The European commission, the EU's executive branch, also warned
in Brussels to step up the legal action against France, saying it
expected the next step to be launched next Tuesday, when the
French government would be given five days to come into line or
face quick court action.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Britain had exhausted diplomatic efforts to resolve
the dispute and it was now up to the courts to make France respect
an EU decision to lift pan European ban.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried the gentler way of persuasion and France has
wrongly decided they can't lift the beef ban. They have defied the
law and science. There's now nothing that can hold up legal action,
" Blair told BBC on arrival in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
"France must obey the law. This is about the principle that the
EU is founded on the rule of law and they can't pick and choose
this way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin has said he was not worried about the row between Paris
and London. "I am first and foremost accountable to French people
for what I do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the beef row is not in agenda of the EU summit, the two
ministers are expected to discuss the matter during the summit,
which is the final one in this century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Returns Hijacked Yacht to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban boat hijacked December 6
by six persons with the purpose of illegally emigrating to the
United States was returned Thursday to the island authorities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard Service returned the craft with the six
hijackers and two workers of the yacht taken hostage to the Cuban
border safeguarding troops in the port of Orozco in the Bay of
Cabanas in the Pinar del Rio province.
</P>
<P>
The six kidnappers, all of them from the western province of
Matanzas, were identified as Juan Junior Padron Sanchez, 21 years
of age, Alexis Borges Silva (26), Misael Mena Hernandez 19), Leivy
Herrera Garcia (18), Leonardo Milian Rodriguez (18), Juana Maria
Nieves Mena (21).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities decided Wednesday to return the boat with
the six hijackers and the two kidnapped crew members, an action
called positive by Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The migratory theme has flared again between the two countries
in the last days, because two cases of illegal emigration of
Cubans toward the United States have occurred in less than two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the United States will start Monday a new round of
talks to examine the compliance with the Migratory Agreements
signed in 1994, which foresee the issue of 20,000 visas of
entrance for Cubans to the United States every year.

better assessment of the impact of sanctions; use of targeted

There are still problems over who should be eligible to vote,
including a large number of appeals against exclusion from the
election rolls, Annan said.

"Under the circumstances, the prospect of holding the
referendum within a reasonable period of time, instead of becoming
closer, has become even more distant," he said.

TEHRAN -- Former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has
announced to run for the 6th Majlis (parliament) elections slated
for February 18, 2000, the English daily Iran News reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was currently chairman of the powerful advisory
State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believed that the decision would help the
moderates and reformists in their efforts to win the sensitive
parliamentary polling, which would create a new balance of power
in the conservative-dominated Majlis.

<HEADLINE> Official: U.S. Mulls to Drive Oil Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson warned on Thursday that the Clinton administration is
prepared to act to drive down oil prices if they continue to rise,
saying world prices are "drifting into dangerously high levels."
</P>
<P>
Richardson refused to say what actions the government might
take, but said he was prepared to recommend "whatever steps are
necessary to protect the American consumer and the American
economy," according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have soared in recent months in large part because
of a coordinated decision last March by the oil producing nations
to limit production and Iraq's recent decision to halt exports.
Prices have gone from about 10 U.S. dollars a barrel a year ago to
nearly 27 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
"Prices are drifting into what I see as dangerously high levels,
" said Richardson in remarks to reporters after he addressed a
conference on energy security.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said while the American economy is "in excellent
shape," higher oil prices could cause problems.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to keep the American economy strong and I don
't want inordinately high oil prices to adversely affect this
administration's successful economic policy," said Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Among the options would be to release some oil from emergency
stocks held in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But those stocks
are supposed to be used for emergency supply interruptions not to
manipulate prices, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
More likely Richardson will step up efforts to get some
producing nations -- particularly Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi
Arabia-- to increase production if prices continue to spiral
upward.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said oil prices were among the subjects he planned
to discuss with Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naimi, also attending the conference sponsored by the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, said Wednesday night that
Saudi Arabia had no plans to increase production between now and
March when producing countries were planning to reexamine their
production policies.

<HEADLINE> 1,600 Liberian Refugees Returning Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,600 Liberian refugees
began returning home Thursday by land from the town of Danane in
Cote d'Ivoire as the December 31 deadline for organized voluntary
repatriation draws nearer.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has
set the deadline for Liberian refugees in the west African
sub-region owing to the level of security obtaining in Liberia two
years after democratic elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
The returnees from Danane were scheduled to travel in convoys
on December 9, 14 and 16, the Pan-African News Agency Thursday
quoted a Liberian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
James Yanquoi, who is in charge of the government-run refugee
repatriation and resettlement agency of Liberia, said that the
returnees will settle in their pre-war localities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that they had already been provided resettlement
packages including tarpaulin, mats, axes, hoes, cutlasses and
cooking utensils.
</P>
<P>
Some 330 refugees are expected to return home from neighboring
Sierra Leone by air on December 10, 11 and 12, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Yanquoi pointed out that Liberians in asylum countries who fail
to utilize the voluntary repatriation before the deadline would
have to regularize their status by seeking citizenship or
residence permit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 15,000 internally-displaced persons sheltering
in some 35 camps in and around capital Monrovia have been given a
similar deadline to vacate and return home.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls for Calm Nazi Labor Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said here on Thursday the lawyers and
German companies negotiating compensation for Nazi-era forced
laborers should be flexible and remain calm.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal after lawyers for the Nazi-era forced
laborers turned down an offer of 4.2 billion U.S. dollars by the
German government and companies. The lawyers said an offer of
exceeding 5.2 billion will be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
"This is the time for all sides to be flexible, to remain calm
and to stay with this process, which offers the best chance of
providing prompt justice to surviving slave and forced laborers
and legal peace for German companies in the U.S." he said in a
brief statement.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that it would be a tragedy for this initiative to
collapse now when the parties are closer than they have ever been
to a settlement amount," said Eizenstat, who is the main U.S.
mediator in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat also said that he had a "constructive discussion with
Otto Lambsdorff, the German envoy to the talks earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Nazi labor survivors' lawyers were holding "intensive
meetings" this week and that he hoped to be in touch with
Lambsdorff again by early next week.

GAZA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The ninth session of the

began Thursday morning in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Ramallah said the session will only center

</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation was led by Yasser Abed Rabbo and the

</P>
<P>
Eran is due to expound the decision made by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak two days ago to stop issuing new tenders for
settlement constructions.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeine, advisor of Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat, told the Voice of Palestine radio Thursday that the
Palestinian stance is firm and clear, asserting that the Israeli
side ought to adhere to and implement the transition agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the radio said Arafat has received two phone calls,
one from Barak and the other from United States President Bill
Clinton with whom he exchanged views on the peace process
developments in the light of the announced resumption of
Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asserted in his meeting Wednesday evening with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that all efforts will be
made to overcome the differences over Israel's withdrawal from 5
percent of the West Bank and to pursue the final-status talks
which hit a snag due to continued settlement activity.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel's Resuming Talks May Make 2000 Year </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Thursday that the planned resumption of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks will make 2000 a year of peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright wrapped up a four-day Mideast tour with a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el

track and the latest problems in the talks for a final peace
agreement between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Before Egypt, she has visited Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East is "at a historic crossroad" and "I believe
that we can seize the moment and help make the year 2000 a year of
peace" in the region, Albright told a news conference held with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in Washington on
Wednesday that Syria and Israel have agreed to resume their peace
talks in the U.S. capital next week after a gap of nearly four
year due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Moussa stressed that the new Syrian-Israeli talks
did not mean the Palestinian-Israeli track would slow down and
that there was no competition between the two tracks.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she and Mubarak agreed that the multilateral
talks should resume as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral talks, which cover issues including water,
disarmament, environment and Arab-Israeli economic cooperation,
began in 1992 but stalled since 1996 when hardline former Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has said the Arabs would not resume those talks with
Israel until the Jewish state restarts negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon. With the movement on the Syrian-Israeli track, Egypt has
apparently dropped its objection.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Official Assures World of Secure Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Petroleum
and Mineral Resources Ali al-N'aimi has said that sufficient
global oil reserves and a surplus production capacity would secure
a stable oil supply, playing down doubts of many people who were
concerned of insecure crude delivery.
</P>
<P>
Naimi was addressing the "Energy Policies for the 21st
Century" conference in Washington Wednesday night, official Saudi
Press Agency monitored here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Naimi said the increase of global oil reserve, stocks and the
presence of a surplus in the production capacity are among the
factors which erase the worry over the security of crude supply.
</P>
<P>
He said total global oil reserve was estimated at over 1
trillion barrels this year, almost doubling the amount in 1970.
Of the total, about 25 percent is controlled by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Naimi said the world is producing an estimated
surplus of 6 million barrels per day (bpd), which equals 8 percent
of the global demand and can be used in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled his country's key role during Iraq's invasion
and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991, when Saudi Arabia used its
surplus capacity to avoid global shortage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Saudi oil minister had reaffirmed at a
Saudi-U.S. businessmen council dinner in Washington earlier
Wednesday that his country was committed to contributing to a
stable oil market.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer with an output
of 8 million bpd, has spearheaded oil production cuts that has
rescued prices from below 10 U.S. dollars a barrel at the turn of
the year. The crude is now sold at about 25 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Naimi, who is attending the two-day conference sponsored by
the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the
Financial Times, is also expected to meet U.S. officials,
including Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, on Saudi-U.S.
cooperation in the fields of energy and oil.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz, during a visit in Washington last year, invited
U.S. oil companies to invest in the Gulf kingdom's oil and gas
sectors. The call has attracted immediate attention of many
world's oil giants, including U.S. oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Chief executives of more than a dozen oil majors have visited
Riyadh, hoping to secure a share of its lucrative energy
development pie. The Saudi government is studying the investment
plans offered by these companies, but a decision has yet to be
made.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Presidential Candidates Tie in Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chile's top two presidential
runners tied in the recent polling to be next president on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Future Foundation polling firm considered a 45 percent tie
in the voters preferences of the center-left Concertation
coalition candidate Ricardo Lagos, and his right-wing rival, the
Aliance for Chile's candidate Joaquin Lavin, according to the poll
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the last poll taken by the MORI firm published
Thursday show that Lagos would get 48.6 percent in a first round
at national level in the presidential election of December 12,
while Lavin would obtain a 42.1 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Lagos is narrowly ahead of Lavin in most polls, but both are
short of the 50 percent support needed to win in Sunday's vote,
making the likely outcome a second run-off between the two favored
presidential hopefuls on January 16.
</P>
<P>
The new president will take over from President Eduardo Frei,
who steps down in March after his six-year term. Eenditem

BRASILIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Central Bank
President Arminio Fraga said Thursday that Brazilian economy will
close the year with a one percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Fraga, who is attending a businessmen and economists meeting in
Sao Paulo, said that instead of the initial estimates of recession
of around four percent, Brazil will register this year a one
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will have a rate of
growth of four percent, against the World Bank projections of 2.5
percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Fraga said that the internal effort and the favorable climate
abroad have permitted the government to think a growth rate of
around five to six percent per year in a near future.
</P>
<P>
He said that other important factors for the Brazilian economy
are the end of the dependence on short term capitals and the
increase of direct foreign investments in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Fraga attributed the balancing budget this year to Finance
Ministry's instrument for checking inflation, saying it will be
also the main task for the Central Bank next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Vote on Iraqi Resolution Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
on Thursday that it expected shortly the formal introduction of a
draft resolution on U.N. comprehensive policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Peter Burleigh made the
remarks after the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, namely China, Russia, France, Britain and the
United States held another meeting on Iraq this morning.
</P>
<P>
Burleigh said he expected a revised version of the draft
resolution to be distributed for the full members of the Council
late today.
</P>
<P>
"It goes into blue either tonight or tomorrow and then we have
the vote on Saturday. If you want to have the vote Saturday, you
have to take these steps," he said.
</P>
<P>
"we are still discussing the resolution. Discussions are going
to continue for the next day or so. But we're heading for a vote
Saturday," Burleigh said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been deadlocked on a new comprehensive
policy towards Iraq since the U.S.-led military strikes against
Iraq last December.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, proposed by the United states, tries to
create a new weapons inspection regime in Iraq which has been
suspended for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, the draft resolution would allow
Iraq to sell as much oil as it can rather than put a 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars ceiling on oil sales every six months as soon as it
is adopted. But it would continue to place controls on how oil
revenues are spent.

<HEADLINE> Rare Books from China on Display in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bone relics, rubbings, manuscripts, maps, printed books and
works by minority cultures living in China trace the evolution of
the written and printed word in China against the vivid backdrop
of Chinese society and history.
</P>
<P>
"It is exiting and gratifying to be exhibiting these treasures
in our public libraries, where Western culture traditionally
expresses its reverence for the written word," said Queens Borough
Public Library Director Gari Strong.
</P>
<P>
"This is truly a momentous occasion for Asian scholars and
appreciators of fine art, to view ancient objects that are seldom
seen, even in China," added Strong who visited China in 1997 and
signed an agreement for exchange between his library and the
National Library of China.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1909, the Chinese library is a major collector
of rare books and ancient literature. It is Asia's largest library
in terms of the volume of books.
</P>
<P>
The Queens Library has the highest circulation of any library
system in the United States as it caters for some 2 million people
with a circulation of 17.5 million items in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will stay at the Queens Library Gallery from
December 10 to March 15, 2000 and then the Los Angeles Public
Library will host it from April 15 to June 25 next year, sources
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will launch a
scientific satellite with its own rocket on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Space Agency (AEB) said Thursday the launching of
the satellite vehicle (VLS) will put in orbit the Scientific-2
Satellite of Scientific Application (Saci-2) December 11.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Brazilian scientists are doing the
last preparations for the launching, foreseen for 16:00 hours
local time of December 11, in the Alcantara launching center, in
the northern state of Maranaho.
</P>
<P>
The operation is the second attempt of the South American
country to use a completely national set of space activities,
which are part of the Full Space Mission of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The first effort to put the VLS and the Satellite Data
Collecting (SDC-2A) failed at the end of 1997, when the launcher
exploded some seconds after its launching.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Mandela on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will meet former South African President Nelson Mandela on
Saturday for talks mainly on the Middle East peace process, White
House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting to be held at Orlando, Florida, was requested by
Mandela, who said in Cape Town on Monday that he wanted to discuss
his Middle East peace initiative with Clinton and he was trying to
arrange an Israel-Syria summit.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has called for a three-pronged strategy to help push
along the Middle East peace process -- Israeli withdrawal from
territories occupied during the 1967 war, unconditional
recognition of Israel by its Arab neighbors and creation of an
international commission to monitor progress.
</P>
<P>
Chitre said Clinton and Mandela will discuss a number of issues
in their meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton and former President Mandela have developed
a strong friendship over the years and have remained in touch
since President Mandela stepped down," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect they will discuss a number of issues including the
president's strong support for President Mandela's recent decision
to take over the leadership of the Burundi peace process," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his efforts to play a major role in Middle East
peace, Mandela was asked last week to lead new peace moves in
Burundi, where some 200,000 people have been killed in six years
of ethnic fighting.
