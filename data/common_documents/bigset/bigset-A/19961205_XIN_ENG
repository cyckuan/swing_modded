<HEADLINE> Iranian Chemical War Victims Sue Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Iranian
chemically wounded war veterans have filed complaints against
Germany and about 80 German chemical companies which helped Iraq
build chemical weapons during the 1980-88 war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Hossein Zarif-Manesh, acting
head of the Oppressed and Disabled Foundation, here today,
according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision to file law suits against Germany
goes back to several years and now their decision has been
translated into action.
</P>
<P>
Zarf-Manesh said that over 1,000 war veterans, disabled as a
result of Iraqi chemical weapons supplied by the German companies,
have referred their case to a special branch established at the
Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In view of the establishment of the new branch at the Justice
Ministry, thousands more complaints are expected to be filed with
the branch in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have recently accused 84 German companies,
including Toysen, Zigma and Hebergerbau, of supplying chemical
weapons to Iraq during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that it has collected a considerable volume of
information regarding Germany in connection with chemical weapon
supplies to Iraq during the eight-year war.
</P>
<P>
It said that some 25,000 Iranians were killed and 65,000
Iranian veterans were injured in the war as victims of chemical
bombs.
</P>
<P>
The recent crisis in the Bonn-Tehran relations came after the
German Federal Prosecutor charged the Islamic government,
including Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, president as well as
information minister and foreign minister, accountable for the
Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
Former leader of Iran's outlawed Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) Sadeq Sharafkandi and three of his companions were
assassinated at the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on September 17,
1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which was accused by Germany of being behind the case,
denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Iranian students marched on the street and
staged several anti-German demonstrations, throwing tomatoes, eggs
and rocks at the German Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Iranian parliament members signed a letter and
urged the Foreign Ministry to reduce the diplomatic ties and
economic relations with Germany, its No. 1 trade partner, as a
protest against the German accusation.
</P>
<P>
German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Iranian President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani have already exchanged their messages in
a bid to prevent the crisis in the bilateral relations.

<P>
KATHMANDU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today met Nepalese King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev
at the king's palace.
</P>
<P>
Jiang congratulated the king on his 25th anniversary of
enthroning and thanked Nepal's support for China's stand on the

support and genuine cooperation".
</P>
<P>
King Birendra, who has visited China for a total of nine times
since 1966, said that Nepalese-Chinese friendship has a long
tradition and he fully agreed with Jiang when he said the older
generation should pass down the friendship to younger generation
in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The king spoke highly of the friendly and mutually-beneficial
cooperation between the two countries. He hoped that both sides
will exert more efforts to further the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The king appreciated the role China has played in the
international arena and congratulated Jiang on his three-country
visit in South Asia. The Chinese president also visited India and
Pakistan before arriving in Kathmandu earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese visitor briefed King Birendra that China's
conception of establishing a 21st-century-oriented long-term,
stable good neighborliness and friendship have struck consensus in
all the three countries he went to.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Nepalese Crown Prince Dipendra.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president and the Nepalese king later attended a

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to resume negotiations with Palestinians to find a peaceful
solution to the decades of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made the call when he met visiting Palestinian Social
Welfare Minister Al Najjab. The Zimbabwean president noted that
negotiations are the only solution to the current Palestinian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Najjab, who is chief negotiator in the peace process and a
member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation Central
Committee, said his country needed all the international support
to break the current impasse between his government and the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists after meeting Mugabe, Najjab said the
Zimbabwean president had reassured him of Zimbabwe's and other
southern African countries' commitment in assisting Palestine in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Najjab said that at the meeting with him, Mugabe has stressed
the need for the Israeli government to respect and honour the
agreements signed with the palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe noted the attempt by the Israelis not to commit
themselves to these agreements is "dangerous because it will not
help the progress in the peace process,'' Najjab said.

<HEADLINE> Troops Deployed in Paris in Man-Hunt Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A massive man-hunt got underway
today for the terrorists who blew up a Paris train Tuesday
evening, killing two people and seriously injuring 21.
</P>
<P>
Eight hundred French troops were deployed in Paris this morning
as security measures swung into action and the government
reactivated an emergency anti-terrorist plan known as Vigipirate,
devised in the wake of last year's bomb attacks but eased in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
The elite anti-riot police of la Compagnie Republicaine de
Securite (CRS), accompanied by military dogs, were patrolling the
metro (subway) stations, railway stations, tourist sites and
all other vulnerable places in the capital.
</P>
<P>
All border crossing check points have been greatly reinforced
with troops and police.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's explosion, which occurred in the evening rush hour at
the Port Royale station on the express metro line leading south
from the city center, killed two people and seriously injured 21.
</P>
<P>
The blast jolted the capital as it geared up for Christmas
in a gloomy atmosphere of economic recession and high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on television, President Jacques Chirac condemned what
he called a "barbarous" attack on innocent people, and pledged
that no effort would be spared to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. But suspicion
has fallen on Islamic extremists of Algerian origin, as the bomb, a
13-kilogram gas bottle stuffed with explosives, was similar to
those used by the group last year.
</P>
<P>
All French newspapers today expressed shock and dismay over the
attack, which they said signaled the return of terrorism to France
after 13 months of relative tranquility.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, eight people were killed and 159 wounded in a wave of
attacks in Paris and other French cities by the Algerian Islamic
militants. The Paris subway was one of the targets.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Attorney General has opened two telephone hotlines for
those shocked or traumatized by the attack and to provide
information about compensation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Globalization Means More Opportunities and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The global economy has been
marching toward an integration ever increasingly over the past
decades, bringing about more opportunities and challenges to the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization is nothing new to the world. As early as
the 1920s, the world's economic giants, such as Britain, France
and Germany, actively expanded their overseas markets in order to
export their fast accumulated goods in exchange for much needed
resources. The ratio of trade to the world's gross domestic
product (GDP) was 13 to 100 in 1914, close to the 1993 level of
14.5 to 100.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the General Agreement for Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) after World War II marked the beginning of global
economic integration, which was further enhanced by new trade
accords in the Uruguay Round about two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
For the past decades, the advancement of science and technology
and drastic structural reforms in the economy of developing
countries have forcefully pushed global economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization has greatly expanded spaces for economic
activities. It has speeded up the flow of commodities and funds,
and brought about more job opportunities, enabling different
countries to open their markets and establish fresh trade
relations. Countries also find new channels for resources,
including capital and labor, in addition to new information and
technology. And for consumers, globalization means a wider range
of much better products and services.
</P>
<P>
The ever intense market competition could also promote the
establishment of a worldwide market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, China, India and other populous states
with a weak economic foundation in particular, have extensively
participated in global integration by actively improving their
investment environment, lowering tariffs and opening markets.
</P>
<P>
However, not all countries have benefited from such
opportunities so far.
</P>
<P>
The irrational world economic order is an important factor for
widening the gap between the North and South. Some developed
countries have erected trade barriers and held on to
protectionism. This has further widened the gap of "prosperity"
between the developed and developing countries. Some countries in
the West, in the pretext of "protecting human rights," interfered
in the internal affairs of other countries and raised more harsh
terms on official assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual report of the World Bank, foreign direct
investment (FDI) into developed countries reached 203 billion U.S.
dollars in 1995, while that for developing countries, whose
combined population accounted for 80 percent of the world's total,
stood only 100 billion U.S. dollars. The African continent only
absorbed 5 billion U.S. dollars of FDI.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Soften Opposition to Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian Parliament, today softened its opposition to
President Boris Yeltsin's decree to withdraw all Russian troops
from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, the Duma advised President Boris Yeltsin to
"consider, once again, the expediency of a complete withdrawal of
troops" from the breakaway Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also asked the Federation Council, the upper house of
the Russian parliament, to "urgently consider problems caused by
measures being taken by the president and the chairman of the
government (Chernomyrdin) with regard to the situation in
Chechnya, taking into account earlier Federation Council
resolutions on the unity and territorial integrity of the Russian
Federation."
</P>
<P>
The lower chamber urged the government to "take measures to
ensure state security and the rights and freedoms of citizens, to
protect property and maintain public order in the North Caucasian
region of the Russian Federation, while making it possible to
create additional anti-terrorist centers in the region and step
up security on the state border in southern Russia."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Duma passed a draft resolution urging the
Yeltsin to cancel his decree on a complete withdrawal of
Russian troops from Chechnya, noting that such a move could only
help the rebel republic break away from the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin persisted and some 20,000 Russian troops remaining
in Chechnya have begun to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin signed the pullout decree some ten days ago, when Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a peace agreement with Chechen
government head Aslan Maskhadov. Under the accord, all Russian
troops should leave Chechnya before general elections up security
on the state border in southern Russia."
</P>
<P>
Chechnya declared independence from Russia in 1991 and fighting
broke out in December 1994, when Yeltsin ordered the army to enter
the rebel republic to crush the independence movement. More than
40,000 people were killed during the 21 months of bloodshed which
ended in August after a ceasefire was agreed between the then head
of the Russian Security Council Alexander Lebed and the Chechen
rebels.

<HEADLINE> SADC Electoral Commissioners Meet in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Electoral commissioners from
the 12 Southern African Development Community (SADC ) countries
met here today to discuss ways of strengthening cooperation in an
attempt to build a viable democracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will focus on cooperative relations
between the SADC countries to build a sustainable and viable
regional democracy.
</P>
<P>
Convened by the Electoral Institute of South Africa (EISA) and
hosted by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, the round-table
conference will discuss issues pertinent to the Organisation of
Democratic Elections and the benefits that accrue to regional
development.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners, who are responsible for the Organisation of
National Elections in their countries, will also discuss
constitutional and legislative provisions for impartial and
independent electoral commissions and their place within
government.
</P>
<P>
In his address, EISA Director Dren Nupen said, ''Regional
cooperation to strengthen democracy and promote greater
self-reliance in running elections is a logical and desirable
step emerging from the extension of democracy throughout the
southern African region.''
</P>
<P>
Through cooperation, regional electoral institutions can
identify areas of interest in the development of electoral
management capacity, establish means to carry out joint
activities and identify sources of international support and
involvement, Nupen said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Secretary
Yunus Omerjee noted that an electoral machinery is an essential
part of the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
He said the legitimacy of government depended on the
acceptability of the electoral process.

<HEADLINE> BHP Spends 230 Million US Dollars on Zimbabwe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- BHP Minerals, Zimbabwe's single
largest mining investor, said today it has invested over 230
million US Dollars on the surface construction work at the giant
Hartley Platinum Mine in Chegutu, 80 km southwest of Harare,
since the work commenced two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Globalization Means More Opportunities and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is also a great disparity for receiving FDI among the
developing countries. Eight countries drew two-thirds of the FDI
flown to developing nations from 1990 to 1993, while almost half
of them received practically none of foreign capital. It is
particularly the case in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The uneven advancement toward globalization is also shown in
the participation of foreign trade. During the past decade, 44
countries among 93 developing countries saw their ratio of exports
to GDP fall into negative territories.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some developing countries excessively rely on
external assistance and fail to explore their export-oriented
economy, having intensified poverty and worsened the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
Global integration has also set a new demand on the governments
of developing countries, who are required to respond quickly to
the fast changing markets and to adjust their policies
accordingly. The governments also need to set up highly efficient
infrastructure, offer a sound investment environment and open
their markets further.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the World Bank, during the next 10
years, the global economic integration will speed up, with the
world trade volume increasing at a pace of 6 percent annually. The
decade will likely see an acceleration in the pace of
international integration. There will be marked changes in the
trading structure, and a higher share of services.
</P>
<P>
Products of telecommunications and high technology, such as
computer programs and information will find their way easily into
the world market. Fund raising channels will be widened, and the
world economic environment tends to be stablized. All this will
help developing countries to take on "outward-oriented" reforms.
</P>
<P>
Currently, services account for roughly one-third of the world
trade, according to the World Bank. Some economists say that
strong integrators will concentrate more on the service sector
which mainly targets on domestic customers. They believe developed
countries will pay more attention to domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that developing countries should hold on the
opportunities and strive to explore their overseas markets,
attracting foreign investment with their advantages of labor,
natural resources and ever improving investment environment.
</P>
<P>
For the African continent, it is also essential to rely on the
restoration and boost of economy to resolve political crises and
prevent regional conflicts. There is the horizon for Africa being
merged into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, developing countries should voice more loudly
for protecting their legitimate rights in international trade in
the United Nations and other international organizations. The
ultimate goal is to establish a sound and new order for the
international economy.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Hints at Involvement of Algerian Islamists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
hinted today that Algerian Islamic extremists could be involved in
Tuesday's bomb attack on a Paris train, as it was very similar to
an attack last year on a Paris subway train claimed by the
extremists.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said at the National Assembly that there exist "great
similarities" between the attack on the RER underground train
Tuesday evening and "those of the summer of 1995," when the
Islamists launched a wave of terrorist attacks in Paris.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister said that up to the present stage of
investigation, no evidence has been found to "prioritize an
Algerian trail."
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that all the means will be put to work to
identify and punish the guilty," said Juppe, who also said that
France must face the challenge with cold headedness.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and many wounded in Tuesday's bomb
attack on a train of the express rail network serving Paris and
its suburbs, the RER.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted well-informed sources as
saying today that the French secret service was tipped off about
possible new attacks to be launched by Algerian Islamists in
November.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a commando of eight extremists trained in
an Islamic country were preparing to launch attacks in France from
Italy last month.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the extremist Armed Islamic Group of Algeria said in
the latest issue of its publication that the group would continue
to launch attacks in France.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Stresses Role of Mobutu in Solving Zaire Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations envoy for the
Great Lakes region Raymond Chretien said today that Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko should still play a role in solving the
on-going crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"He is the only one capable of dealing with the situation, and
all think so. He himself also hopes to go back to Zaire," said
Chretien after holding a meeting with Mobutu in the latter's
private villa in southeast France.
</P>
<P>
Chretien has just made a month-long fact-collecting tour in
several central African countries concerned with the crisis in the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the Ugandan-Zairean border said that
fierce fighting is going on between Ugandan troops and a group of
Ugandan rebels based in Zaire, who infiltrated into Ugandan
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse quoted the Ugandan official newspaper
of New Vision as saying that the rebels belonging to the Allied
Democratic Front entered the Bwera region, about three kilometers
from the Zairean border.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of Uganda into the ethnic war in the region
could further complicate the political situation there.
</P>
<P>
The crisis of the Great Lakes region is expected to become the
dominant issue at the Franco-African summit which opened today in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels of Zaire, who are backed by
Rwanda, have been controlling the Kivu region in eastern Zaire for
more than one month, while the international community is still
divided over ways to help hundreds of thousands of Rwandan
refugees in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon today again called on
the international community to send a ground force to eastern
Zaire to rescue the refugees, who he said are living in a
disastrous humanitarian situation.

<HEADLINE> International Conference on Bosnia Opens in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Peace Implementation
Conference on Bosnia opened here this morning with representatives
from 56 countries and international organizations expected to work
out a new program for implementing the Bosnian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, British Prime Minister John
Major said that marked achievements had been made in the year past
with the warring parties of Bosnia being disengaged and economic
reconstruction beginning to gather momentum.
</P>
<P>
On possible difficulties on the way to Bosnia reconstruction,
Major said, "None of us at this conference underestimates the task
you face. You are rebuilding a nation, only a few months after a
bitter war, with the wounds and divisions not yet healed."
</P>
<P>
Major stressed that although the international community would
continue to provide support, "there has to be a real commitment to
peace and reconciliation within Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
"It is most important that next year, Bosnia should accept the
primary responsibility for your own economic development by
establishing effective institutions and sound, market-based
economic policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Bosnian refugees, Major said, "There were
hundreds of thousands more refugees in neighboring states or
further field, who want to return but are unable to do so. We must
address their fears and problems."
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference, all the delegates are expected
to discuss the progress on implementing the peace agreement,
future economic construction, international police force, arms
control and other humanitarian issues.

PRETORIA, South Africa, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South African
President Nelson Mandela reiterated here today that his country has
decided to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish
full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with visiting Taiwanese "foreign minister"
John Chang, Mandela told reporters that his country has become an
active participant within the ambit of the Organization of African
Unity and the Non-aligned movement, as well as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Continuing diplomatic relations with Taiwan was "inconsistent"
with South Africa's role in international affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
he noted that a bilateral committee would be set up to discuss the
future relations between South Africa and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
John Chang arrived here on Tuesday for a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Mandela announced at a press conference in
Johannesburg that his government would cut off diplomatic ties
with Taiwan and formalize relations with the People's Republic of
China.

<HEADLINE> EU Member States Reject Ban on Beef, Sheep Tissues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's Standing
Veterinary Committee today voted to reject a draft proposal by
the European Commission (EC) to exclude tissue which could be
infected with BSE from human and animal food chains.
</P>
<P>
The proposal intended to exclude those tissues include the
skull containing brain, the eyes and spinal cord of cattle, sheep
and goats over 12 months of age, and the spleen of sheep and goats
of any age, according to a press release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
EC Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said the vote was
unacceptable since the EC's proposal was soundly based on the
opinions of the EU's Scientific Veterinary Committee and the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Given the public concern over BSE, or "mad cow" disease,
Fischler censured some EU member states for refusing to apply all
necessary precautions to protect human health and to restore
consumer confidence in beef and sheep meat.
</P>
<P>
Fischler added that he would request the issue be put on the
agenda of the Council of Ministers meeting later this month.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: United Nations Needs Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Since the opening of the
51st session of the U.N. General Assembly, representatives from an
overwhelming majority of member states have repeatedly called for
the restructuring of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the United Nations must reform because of
the following changes:
</P>
<P>
First, a marked increase of member states. The United Nations
comprised 51 member states when it was founded in 1945. The member
states now number 185. Most of them are states which have got rid
of colonialism and declared independence since 1945. The new
composition of the membership should be reflected in the United
Nations's structure, priority of its mandate and arrangement of
its projects.
</P>
<P>
Second, a sharp change of the international situation. Since
the end of the Cold War, the bipolar system disappeared overnight
and a multi-polar system has evolved gradually. While the major
powers are readjusting their relations in recent years, most
developing countries are pushing forward the establishment of a
new international political order based on peace, justice,
equality and democracy. During the process, the United Nations
should enhance its own transparency, increase its
representativeness and become more democratic in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Third, more and more priority to economy. As the electronic and
communications technology has made headway, transnational flow of
fund, commodity and information increased rapidly and
globalization of the world economy achieved marked progress, all
countries have attached more importance to economic development
than ever before. However, the existing irrational international
economic order has become a barrier for economic growth of
developing countries: while the developed countries, with their
advantages in economy, technology, legal professionals and trade
experience, have expanded market share in the developing
countries, the latter often found growing difficulties to
penetrate the market of the developed ones. The United Nations has
a historic mission in promoting establishment of a new
international economic order.
</P>
<P>
According to statements delivered at the current session of the
General Assembly, most representatives of member states have put
forward proposals on reform in the following fields.
</P>
<P>
First, strengthening the function and authority of the General
Assembly. When the assembly discussed strengthening the UN system
in late November, 19 of 23 speakers stressed that the assembly
should play a greater role.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti said that reforms in
the UN system must be undertaken with the full concurrence and
participation of the developing countries, which constituted a
majority of the membership.
</P>
<P>
"It was of pivotal importance that the General Assembly, the
highest deliberative and decision-making organ, should function
effectively, focusing especially on major issues of political
significance. The strengthening of the role of the assembly was a
basic premise of the process of revitalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clara Ines de Losada of Colombia focused on the need to
re-establish the political authority of the assembly in different
areas.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Ambassador Machivenyika Mapuranga stressed that any
reform which did not strengthen the role of the General Assembly
was bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
Second, enhancing representation of the Security Council. The
Security Council consisted of 11 members when the United Nations
was founded 51 years ago. The membership of the council increased
to 15 in August 1965 when the United Nations had 115 member
states. Now, member states number 185 while the Security Council
remains the same size 31 years ago. Algeria, Argentina, India and
seven other states raised the issue on expansion of the Security
Council in 1979. The General Assembly adopted a resolution on
reform of the Security Council in December 1992. Since then, the
General Assembly has considered the item at each session.
</P>
<P>
When representatives discussed reform of the Security Council
at the current session of the assembly from October 29 to November
1, the majority of 68 speakers agreed to increase the non-permanent
members.
</P>
<P>
Though they have not reached consensus on the number of new
members, most speakers considered increase of 6-10 members. They
also stressed the principle of regional equitable distribution and
more representatives of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, there remains a large difference on increase of
permanent members of the council. US representative Edward Gnehm
said that the United States would not accept any enlargement of
the permanent membership of the Security Council that did not
include Germany and Japan. The total council membership should not
exceed approximately 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Pakistan, Mexico, Egypt, Russia and several
other countries strongly opposed increasing only two developed
countries as permanent members and called the formula of
increasing only two developed countries as "most discriminative
proposal" since the developing countries are represented by only
one of the five existing permanent members.
</P>
<P>
As some countries overstressed economic capacity and financial
contributions to the UN in selecting permanent members, Chinese
Ambassador Wang Xuexian said, "The council is not a club of the
rich, still less a board of directors." What is the most important
rests with the fact that the country should have a correct
understanding of war and peace both from historical and current
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
Third, properly restructuring of the Secretariat and Economic
and Social Council. The United Nations has carried out a number of
institutional reforms and achieved remarkable progress in recent
years. However, a small number of Western countries, in the name
of reform, overstressed peacekeeping, human rights, control of
drug abuse at the expenses of industrial development, trade and
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries stressed that the reform in the social
and economic fields should increase effectiveness and efficiency,
be mission-oriented rather than cutting cost only.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Contribute More Troops to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced today that it
would contribute about 1,200 troops to the proposed follow-on
force of the peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a 1,000-member Canadian Forces contingent is serving

Organization (NATO). Canadian Forces personnel have served in the
former Yugoslavia since 1991.

"Canada's involvement in NATO activities there has been
successful. We have helped to separate the warring factions and to
provide a stable environment for national elections," said
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, more work must be done before a durable peace
can take hold," he said. "Our continued commitment will allow us
to advance peace-building activities, such as the repatriation and
reintegration of refugees, and put in place tools to assist in the
arrest of war criminals."
</P>
<P>
"Canada's commitment to achieving a lasting peace in the
Balkans remains strong," said Canadian Minister of National
Defense Douglas Young.
</P>
<P>
The changing size and role of the international military
presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina mean that the contribution Canada
will make will also change, the two ministers noted.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the new Canadian contingent reflects the
different role that Canada expects to undertake in the force,
including assuming more front-line responsibilities and a larger
area of operations.
</P>
<P>
The larger troop contribution will ensure better protection and
strengthen the Canadian Forces' ability to safely and effectively
carry out their duties, particularly those in support of civilian
reconstruction efforts, they said.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy will discuss Canada's contribution to the follow-on
IFOR, and other peace and security issues, at the North Atlantic
Council meeting in Brussels next week.

<HEADLINE> France Suspends Electronics Giant's Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
suspended the privatization of the debt-burdened electronics giant
Thomson SA due to opposition from the Privatization Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Alain Juppe said that the government
has not given up its plan to privatize the group, which was
initiated by President Jacques Chirac himself.
</P>
<P>
Following the government announcement this morning, the value
of stocks of the Lagardere group, which was chosen by the
government in October to take over Thomson, fell by 10 percent on
the Paris Bourse.
</P>
<P>
The key to the dispute over the sell-off centers around the
decision by Jean-Luc Lagardere, boss of the Lagardere group, to
sell the civilian part of Thomson, Thomson Multimedia (TMM), to
South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Commission said that it could not approve the
ways in which the TMM would be sold to Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
But the Minister of Economy and Finance, Jean Arthuis, said
that the commission does not want the Koreans to take control of
Thomson's technology which it said was developed using state
funds.
</P>
<P>
The sale of Thomson for a symbolic one france was announced by
the prime minister in February. But it has been bitterly opposed
by the unions, the group's 28,000 employees and left-wing forces,
who viewed the disposal as a "sell-out".
</P>
<P>
The President of Daewoo Electronics, Yang Jae-Yol, said today
in Seoul that he was shocked by the French decision, while the
Lagardere group said that it would continue to try to take over
Thomson.
</P>
<P>
The French government is apparently embarrassed by its failure
to sell the electronics group, a plan it said would turn the group
into one of the biggest and most modern defense industrial
enterprises in the world by merging its defense arm with the
Matra Espace Defense group owned by Lagardere.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission was previously expected to issue its
decision today on whether to support the privatization.
</P>
<P>
The premier planned to pour 11 billion francs (2.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in state aid into Thomson during its privatization
process, as the enterprise is burdened with debts of 25 billion
francs (5 billion dollars).

BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today proposed the launch of a voluntary service program to allow
European young people to show solidarity by taking part in
activities in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, comes after a pilot project this year which gave
2,500 young people the chance to take part in a wide range of
social programs including environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The European Youth Voluntary Service Program, put forward by EC
Commissioner for Training, Education and Youth Edith Cresson, will
run from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
For the initial stage from 1998 to 1999, the EC will earmark a
budget of 60 million Ecus (about 80 million U.S. dollars), pending
a new European Union budget, which will determine the level of
resources available for the remainder of the program.

</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Athens News Agency today,
applicants must have completed their national service in Greece
while the age limit for university graduates is 32 years of age.

<P>
Successful applicants will also enjoy other benefits such as
the right to purchase a duty-free car in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time for the Cyprus government to recruit
military volunteers in Greece in a year. In 1995, it recruited 400
Greeks to serve as volunteers in the island republic's National
Guard for a period of five years.

BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A strategy to promote new
space applications is urgently needed if Europe is not to be left
behind in these potentially huge markets, the European Union (EU)
said in a communique today.
</P>
<P>
The communique, based on a proposal by Edith Cresson, Martin

telecommunications and transport, calls for effective coordination
between the European Union, its member states, the European Space
Agency, national space agencies, other related organizations and

</P>
<P>
The growth of the European space industry has slowed down since
1992 mainly because of cuts in government funding, a press release
issued by the EU said here today.
</P>
<P>
But the trend is likely to be rapidly reversed over the next
few years with the expected development of new space applications,
in particular, satellite telecommunications, satellite navigation
and positioning, and various applications arising from earth
observation from space, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Health Official Arrested on Bribery Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police today arrested a
former top health bureaucrat on charges of taking 60 million yen
(530,000 U.S. dollars) and two cars in bribes from a nursing home
developer in a widening healthcare corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
Vice Health and Welfare Minister Nobuharu Okamitsu, 57, was
accused of taking the cash and cars from Hiroshi Koyama, head of
the Aya Welfare Group which runs homes for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
In return for Koyama's cash and gifts, police claim Okamitsu
helped the group obtain 360 million yen (3.18 million
U.S. dollars) in government subsidies to build special nursing
homes for the elderly run by the company.
</P>
<P>
Okamitsu is the first former vice minister to be arrested since
1989 when two former vice ministers were arrested in connection
with the stocks-for-favors scandal involving a real estate unit of
Recruit Co.
</P>
<P>
Okamitsu resigned from his job on November 19 as the top career
bureaucrat in the Health Ministry after admitting he took the cars
from the firm. But he denied taking cash.
</P>
<P>
Koyama was first arrested last month on suspicion of having
paid more than 1 million yen (9,100 dollars) in bribes to Shigeru
Chatani, 39, a former section chief at the ministry. He was
re-arrested Wednesday over his ties to Okamitsu, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chatani was also arrested last month on charges of bribe
taking.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Reverses Fall in Foreign Exchange Holdings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves rose in November for the first time in four months, but
is still well down on the record high of 36.56 billion
U.S. dollars reach in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea said today that reserves stood at 32.32
billion dollars at the end of November, up 90 million dollars from
October's 32.23 billion dollars, but still down 4 billion dollars
on June's 36.56 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reversal has been attributed to a fall in the country's
current account deficit and a rise in the net inflow of capital, a
bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The increase leaves South Korea's foreign reserves just at the
level recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of
covering a country's imports over a three month period.
</P>
<P>
Given that South Korea's imports range from 11 to 12 billion
U.S. dollars per month, the present holdings are not too low to
warrant great concern, the bank official said.

STOCKHOLM, December 4 (Xinhua)-- Sweden's economy will be
growing at a faster pace during the next few years, fueled partly
by increased private consumption, the Swedish Retail and Wholesale

economy will grow at a rate of 1.8 percent this year, compared to
1995.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to remain low, at around 2 percent. The
unemployment rate is likely to remain high although visible
unemployment is estimated to drop to 7.2 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief on New International Peace Force to Bosnia </HEADLINE>

LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said here today that the alliance was ready to send a new
peacekeeping force to Bosnia but the size of the 30,000-strong
contingent would be scaled down during its 18-month mission.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-Led new Stabilization Force is due later this month to
take over the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia from the current
Implementation Force.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going Peace Implementation Conference on
Bosnia in London earlier today, Solana said that NATO allies have
planned to review the size of the new international force at
intervals next year.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning for an 18-month mission, to be reviewed at six
and 12 months, with a view to progressively reducing the forces,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the peace implementation tasks in 1997, the NATO chief said,
"The political and civil aspects of peace implementation must take
a more prominent role over the military aspects."
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to commit our soldiers and our resources for
another 18 months," he said, adding that Bosnia should commit
itself "in deeds as well as words" to making the peace endure.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Regains Top Slot in Politicians' League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin has
regained his top position among Russia's 100 most influential
politicians following his recovery from heart surgery in early
November, the Moscow Tribune newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited a monthly opinion poll by Russia's leading
political analysts as placing Yeltsin first on the list of
Russia's 100 leading politicians with 7.56 points on the Vox
Populi think-tank's 10-point scale. He was only third on the list
in October with 7.67 points.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's comeback moved Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who had been in first place since August, to second place with
7.54 points. Presidential Chief of Staff, Anatoly Chubais,
was third with 7.32 points, compared with 7.83 in October.
</P>
<P>
Both Chernomyrdin and in particular, Chubais, took on a great
part of the president's powers on the eve of Yeltsin's heart
by-pass operation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's absence from the center of Russia's political stage
created rumors of power struggles and of the president's inability
to rule the country.
</P>
<P>
A survey of Muscovites carried out last month by the Mnenie
Polling Service showed that 56 percent of the respondents believed
"other people" were governing the state, mainly referring to
Chubais.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of Vox Populi political expert Alexander
Kinsbursky, the changes within the "top trio" reflected the
results of the president's surgery.
</P>
<P>
"These three leaders will be dominating Russia's political
landscape," Kinsbursky said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is still convalescing at the Barvikha spa near
Moscow, is expected to move to the Kremlin before the end of the
year, according to sources close to the presidential
administration.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Yeltsin would resume his duties at the end of
this month, but the exact date of his return to work has yet to be
given.
</P>
<P>
The "top trio" was followed by powerful Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov with 6.63 points on the scale. He has maintained his
position in the top 10 for several months and is seen here as one
of the presidential hopefuls for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chubais' slip from second place on the list was apparently
caused by recent allegations of a major financial cover-up during
Yeltsin's re-election campaign earlier this year, with two Kremlin
campaign aides arrested carrying 538,000 U.S. dollars in cash from
the government building.
</P>
<P>
In November, Russia's public prosecutor ordered an inquiry into
the alleged financial fraud, promising to interrogate Chubais and
First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Ilyushin along with other
incumbent and former Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
Chubais has also been under fire for backing the appointment of
a controversial business tycoon Boris Berezovsky to the post of
deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky, who stormed into Russia's top 10 most influential
politicians in October, saw the most spectacular progress moving
from 10th place in October with 5.20 points to fifth in November
with 5.76.
</P>
<P>
His rise was especially surprising since his chief, Secretary
of the Security Council Ivan Rybkin, currently holds the rather
modest 12th position with 5.04 points.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky was followed by his key colleague in the
Russian-Chechen talks -- Chechnya's coalition government head,
Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the so-called "Chubais' squad," Yeltsin's
daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, who was reportedly behind recent key
Kremlin promotions, moved from 14th to 10th place, just ahead of
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation Council, the upper house
of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who was Yeltsin's main
rival in July's presidential election, and State Duma (lower house
of parliament) speaker Gennady Seleznyov held their positions in
Vox Populi's top 10. Zyuganov was seventh with 5.34 points, while
Seleznyov was eighth with 5.31.
</P>
<P>
Former national security chief Alexander Lebed, who was
replaced by Rybkin as a result of Kremlin power struggles on the
eve of Yeltsin's operation, experienced the most serious slide,
moving from the prestigious fourth place with 6.93 points to the
25th with 3.92.
</P>
<P>
"The survey reflected the two main tendencies which dominate
Russia's political summit," said Kinsbursky.
</P>
<P>
"First, the executive branch holds an advantage over the other
two branches in the top 10. Second, Moscow's political
establishment is still more influential than regional leaders," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Strike in Greece Cripples Docks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece's harbors remained out of
order for the seventh day running today, due to strikes by
dockyard workers.
</P>
<P>
Scores of ships are riding at anchor outside Piraeus harbor, as
striking harbor workers will not allow loading or unloading of
cargo, repairs, or even re-victualing of incoming vessels. This
has led many captains to sail for foreign ports, and an estimated
7,000 containers of goods originally destined for Greece have
already been unloaded at other Mediterranean harbors.
</P>
<P>
The port of Salonika, another major port of the country, has
also been badly affected by the strike, with only supplies for
army units and medical consignments being let through.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, port employees said today that they would block
Piraeus' passenger port after what they described as fruitless
talks with Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis over the
demands they put forward.
</P>
<P>
In a relevant development, the country's Sailors' Union has
also threatened to go on strike from December 13-16, unless the
government complies with their demands.

JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's proposed
final constitution, passed by the Constitutional Assembly (CA) in
October, was formally certified by the Constitutional Court (CC)
today.
</P>
<P>
Handing down the judgement in Johannesburg, CC President
Arthur Chaskalson said all the 11 judges concurred on the ruling,
which ordered the constitution of South Africa (1996) to be
certified.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development Minister
Valli Moosa said after the court judgement that President Nelson
Mandela will sign the document into law on December 10.
</P>
<P>
The final constitution, adopted by the CA on May 8 this year,
was rejected by the CC in September and referred back to the CA
for revision.
</P>
<P>
The CA, however, finalized its amendments in October and
resubmitted its revised version to the CC for certification in
November.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in Johannesburg, Mandela said the certification
of the final constitution by the CC was the end of a chapter, the
conclusion of a process begun under the most trying times in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the final constitution's certification by the CC,
opposition National Party Secretary-General Roelf Meyer said his
party was overjoyed that the constitutional process has now been
completed.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Secretary-General Ziba Jiyane said
in Cape Town that his party will abide by the new constitution
despite the fact that the IFP was not a participant in the
constitution-making process.

initiated by President Jacques Chirac himself.
</P>
<P>
The value of stocks of the Lagardere group, which was chosen in
October by the government to take over Thomson, fell by 10 percent
at the Paris Bourse this morning, after the announcement of the
news by the government.
</P>
<P>
The key to the dispute over the privatization of Thomson is the
decision by Jean-Luc Lagardere, boss of the Lagardere group, to
sell the civilian part of Thomson, Thomson Multimedia (TMM), to
South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Commission said that it could not approve the
ways in which the TMM would be sold to Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
But Minister of Economy and Finances Jean Arthuis said that the
commission does not want the Koreans to obtain the technologies of
Thomson, which it said were built on the state fund of France.
</P>
<P>
The plan to sell Thomson with a symbolic franc, made in
February by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, was strongly rejected by
the unions, the 28,000 employees of the enterprise, and leftwing
forces, who regard it as a "sell-out."
</P>
<P>
President of Daewoo Electronics Yang Jae-Yol said today in
Seoul that he was greatly shocked by the French decision, while
the Lagardere group said that it would pursue the efforts to take
over Thomson.
</P>
<P>
The French government is apparently embarrassed by its failure
to sell the electronics group, a plan it painted as for building
the group into one of the biggest and most modern defense
industrial enterprises in the world, through a combination of
Thomson with the Matra Espace Defense group, owned by Lagardere.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission was previously expected to issue its
decision on whether to support or not the privatization of Thomson
by the French government today.
</P>
<P>
Juppe planned to pour 11 billion francs (2.2 billion U.S.
dollars) of state aid to Thomson during its privatization process,
as the enterprise is burdened with an appalling deficit of 25
billion franc (5 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Food Poisoning Crisis Claims 7th Life in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A 74-year-old man has become the
seventh victim in the food poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire,
Scotland, while the families of seven children who suffered from
the E coli bacteria have decided to sue the British government.
</P>
<P>
BBC television quoted local health authorities as announcing
earlier today the death of the old man, who was from Wishaw, the
town at the center of the E coli crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 people in Scotland have reported food poisoning
symptoms in the outbreak and local police have launched an
emergency probe into allegations that a local butcher sent meat to
a party after he had been told to suspend sales.
</P>
<P>
It was reported E coli is a common gut bacteria, which is
normally harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be
passed to humans via manure or improper slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the families of seven children, who are in hospital
undergoing kidney dialysis after being poisoned by the bacteria,
have been given legal aid to sue the government.
</P>
<P>
Their lawyers say that they are suing because the government
should have warned about the risks.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, China Should Coop in All Fields: Moi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi
today said Kenya and China are "close friends" and should
cooperate in all fields to benefit peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader stressed that "we want to work very closely
with China in all areas," adding that "we shall enhance our
cooperation in political, social, cultural and all other fields."
</P>
<P>
President Moi made the remarks here this afternoon when he met
the Chinese military goodwill delegation led by General Liu
Jingsong, commander of the Chinese Lanzhow Military Command.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that Kenya has always been a "close friend" of the
People's Republic of China since it attained independence in
1963.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries have been strengthened
through his three visits to China and the recent visit to Kenya
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, he noted
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see frequent mutual visits taking place in
the coming years," the Kenyan head of state emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In the present world, President Moi noted, "it is only China
which will be able to work closely with the people of the
(African) continent" to enhance the economy of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader asked General Liu to convey his best wishes
to President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, General Liu said the relations between
China and Kenya have been pushed to a new high in recent years
through the mutual visits by the heads of state of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our visit to Kenya is aimed at enhancing mutual
understanding, strengthening friendship and promoting cooperation
between the two countries and armies," the Chinese delegation
leader noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation of the persistence of the "one
China policy" by the Kenyan government and sharing same or
similar viewpoints by the two sides over a number of
international issues such as human rights.
</P>
<P>
Also present on the occasion were Kenyan Foreign Minister K.
Musyoka and Chinese Ambassador to Kenya An Yongyu, Political
Counsellor of the Chinese embassy Bao Shusheng, and all other
members of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
During its visit to Kenya, the delegation held talks with

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Experts to Work Hard for Curing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Omar Ali Juma today challenged experts to continue working hard
in search of a cure for AIDS in the country, pledging the
government's support to their research.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the occasion to mark the World AIDS Day here, Juma
said, the government will not hesitate to use part of its income
to bring into the country vaccine or medicines proved by the
World Health Organization (WHO) to treat or prevent spread of the
HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned in his speech read on his behalf by
Health Minister Zakia Meghji that if available the medication
would be very expensive, far above many Tanzanians' reach.
</P>
<P>
"The only reliable solution for us is to avoid contracting the
disease by following safety measures recommended by health
experts," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-president, as of last year, 1.2 million
people are believed to have HIV viruses while there are about
200,000 orphans in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Research has indicated that the most productive group of
between 15 and 45 years old are the most affected. Everyone
should take charge of himself's health," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also appealed to donors to continue
supporting Tanzania in the crusade against AIDS, particularly in
education, counseling, testing of the disease and treatment of
the sexually transmitted diseases.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cabinet Discusses Farmer's Protest Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Greek cabinet discussed
today the farmers' protest actions and said the government was
unable to satisfy farmer's demands in their entirety because this
would require about 1 trillion drachams (about 4.35 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said after the meeting,
chaired by Prime Minister Costas Simitis, that to give in to all
the farmers' demands would cost the state 1 trillion drachams.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, there were European Union and legal
"commitments and obstacles" which would prevent this anyway.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the country's Agriculture Minister Stephanos
Tzoumakas announced a number of measures to partly satisfy
farmers' demands, which include a 40 drachma (0.17 dollar)
increase for per kilogram of cotton, favorable terms for
settlement of outstanding debts and a freezing of current debts.
But his measures were rejected by the protesting farmers.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stressed that there was no margin for further
concessions from the government. He said that the cost of the
announced measures to assist farmers would run into hundreds of
billions of drachmas.
</P>
<P>
The farmers began their action last Thursday to demand higher
produce prices and more subsidies, lower fertilizer prices and a
reduction of value added taxes. They also want a settlement
of about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars debts they have with the State
Agricultural Bank, which finances most of their activities.
</P>
<P>
The protest escalated in the past two days as major roadblocks
set up by farmers grew to 62. All of the country's main highways
and main rail links were closed to traffic, while major towns in
central, northern and southern Greece were circled with an army of
tractors. Farmers also blocked access to Salonika's Macedonia
Airport and effectively closed off Greece's borders with Bulgaria
and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Eurostar Services Resume in Channel Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Eurostar high-speed passenger
train services through the fire-damaged Channel Tunnel resumed
today and the first passenger train to use the Channel Tunnel
since the fire two weeks ago has arrived in Paris, a BBC TV report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The move was made after the Anglo-French safety authority said
Tuesday night that it was satisfied with new evacuation
arrangements following the freight fire on November 18.
</P>
<P>
However, the car shuttle services, run by Eurotunnel, the
tunnel operator, will not restart until next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first passenger train left Waterloo Station on time early
this morning, and arrived only 15 minutes later than normal, but
with just four passengers occupying its 800 seats.
</P>
<P>
Six trains are to run in each direction every hour, using the
undamaged northern rail tunnel. Journeys are expected to take some
30 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
However, passenger levels on the return journey from Paris were
reaching up to 50 by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of services was condemned by the leader of the
British Fire Brigades Union, which claimed that profit was being
put before safety and called the situation an "absolute disgrace."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- After a week of
consultations, the Security Council today reached an agreement on
the extension of the U.N. Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which will be approved by the council in
the form of a resolution Thursday, the UNSMIH will be extended for
another six months with 300 civilian police personnel and 500
troops. There is a reduction of current force level by 100 troops.
</P>
<P>
Also if the U.N. secretary-general reports by 31 March 1997
that the force can make further contribution to the consolidation
of democracy and revitalization of Haiti's system of justice, it
can be further extended for the final time until 31 July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun told reporters that the peacekeeping task in Haiti has been
fulfilled and the main task facing the country now is economic
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has always been supportive of Haiti's peace
process and out of this specific consideration, China deals the
extension as a special case, understanding and supporting the
request for extending the mission by President Rene Preval of
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that the United States, Russia and
China had been undergoing serious negotiations on the issue in a
constructive and cooperative attitude, which finally led to the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Public Security Minister Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Public
Security Avigdor Kahalani met with Palestinian Police Commander
Nasser Yussuf here this afternoon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the first between
the two men since the Israeli new government came to power in
June, both Kahalani and Yussuf described the meeting as
"friendly and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
They discussed continuous cooperation of the police forces
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, former senior official of the Labor Party, joined
the Likud-led coalition in the capacity of The Third Way Party
which he formed before the May 29 elections. He is widely
regarded as a dove in the current rightwing Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had received assurances from Yussuf that the
Palestinian police would not shoot Israeli soldiers as in
September, Kahalani replied: "I don't think all of us can
promise each other that anybody in the area will never shoot
each other, but this is the goal."
</P>
<P>
"We will work together and convince most of the forces on both
sides not to use their rifles any more, and let the people sit
around table to discuss it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani promised that the cooperation between the two forces
against criminals will continue.
</P>
<P>
The two men also exchanged views on the long-delayed partial
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron. Yussuf
demanded that, after the Israeli troop redeployment, Palestinian
police forces in the city be armed with the same weapons as
Israeli forces there.

TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today called for a more updated cultural policy while
introducing new members of the Supreme Cultural Council (SCC).
</P>
<P>
"The new formation of the SCC needs knowledge and expertise
of university professors and experts ... and should become more
energetic and updated," Khamenei was quoted as saying by the
state-run television.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has attached great importance to the
battle against the western culture invasion and launched a
nationwide program to Islamize universities and schools while
banning western satellite programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the TV report, the council will be headed again
by moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and include other
moderate officials such as First Vice-President Hassan Habibi
and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Among the new members are renowned leftists Mir Hossein
Mussavi and Mohammad Khatami, who have always called for more
cultural freedom.
</P>
<P>
But also in the new formation is Ayatollah Ali Jannati, who
is widely regarded as the religious and hardline mentor of
radical Islamists in the country.
</P>
<P>
The SCC is the main body for adopting policies in the
cultural sphere which is currently under domestic fire for

CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The battle between Pelephone and Cellcom, Israel's
two cellular phone providers, intensifies as the two firms have
been trying to capture the ever-growing cellular phone market.
</P>
<P>
One million Israelis already own cellular phones, representing
a figure of one out of every five citizens in this country of 5.5
million, said a local newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
This number of cellular phone owners is expected to double
in the coming year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The new ID call service provided by Cellcom is due to start
today.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Some 3,200 ground employees of Lebanon's state-owned
Middle East Airlines (MEA) will stage a three-hour strike Thursday
to protest against the company's new medical insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage will paralyze air activity to and from Beirut
International Airport and will delay four scheduled incoming MEA
flights and one outgoing flight.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said
that Turkey is making efforts to pull down the public sector
borrowing by creating new resources for the state.

Erbakan said the budget of 48 billion U.S. dollars prepared by
the previous government was "impossible," with a deficit of 16
billion dollars and 18 billion dollars allocated for interests and
principal payments, in the country of 70 million.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the devaluation of the Turkish currency. Now
over 100,000 Turkish Liras equal one dollar.

7.5 percent over the past three months and will be possible to see
a 10 percent growth rate by the end of 1996.

ADDIS ABABA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The loss of young adults
in their most productive years of life as a result of the
alarmingly spreading aids would certainly affect overall economic
output, Health Minister Adem Ibrahim said today.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to the two-day national conference on
HIV/ AIDS here, Adem said AIDS can have negative impacts on the
industrial sectors since the prevalence of HIV infection is
higher in urban areas.

He said there have been 19,433 cases of AIDS reported to his
ministry since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in Ethiopia
through July 1995, adding that the true number of AIDS cases in
the country is not known.

<P>
In her opening address, Speaker of the House of Federation
Almaz Meko said among AIDS cases reported in the country, more
than 90 percent belong to productive and sexually active age
group that are mothers or fathers of very young children.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is not only a threat to the productivity of the
developing world, but also a real threat to the children of the
developing countries, she noted.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Growing Moderately, Fed Survey Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is growing
moderately with little sign of rising prices, a survey by the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) said today.
</P>
<P>
"Moderate economic growth continues to be reported in nearly
all Federal Reserve districts," the Fed said in the survey.
"Retail prices are stable in most districts."
</P>
<P>
Although most districts reported little change in overall
prices, they said labor markets remained tight. Still, they added,
"wage pressures are generally not increasing, except for some
technical occupations and skilled workers."
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was completed on November 23 and known as the
beige book because of the color of its cover, will be used by Fed
policy-makers to decide monetary policy when they meet on December
17, the last meeting of this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of U.S. analysts expect the Fed's policy-maker, the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to keep interest rates
unchanged, saying the economy has slowed sufficiently to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
On the shopping season of this year, which began after
Thanksgiving, the Fed survey said that "retailers' expectations
for sales in the upcoming holiday season are modestly optimistic."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reported last week that the economy had
grown only at a 2 percent annual rate during the July-September
quarter. That was slower than its 2.2 percent initial estimate and
less than half the 4.7 percent pace in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The FOMC, which meets eight times a year, has not changed
interest rates since January when it cut the federal funds rate to
5.25 percent from 5.5 percent after the economy showed signs of
faltering.

<HEADLINE> Banks Urged to Raise Savings Interest Rate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Bank of
Tanzania Idris Rashidi today requested commercial banks and
financial institutions in the country to raise savings interest
rate to a level equal to the inflation rate by next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Daily News, during a meeting with
chief executive officers of the institutions in Dar today, the
central bank governor said while the inflation rate is currently
standing at 18 percent, interest rate on savings is only 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is unfair deal to savers," noted the governor who
decried the loss on savings that is occasioned by the low
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed hopes that the banks will cooperate and
save the country the need to take other regulatory measures to
influence the matter.
</P>
<P>
He told the chief executive officers that the stance of the
monetary policy is to continue mopping up excess liquidity so as
to cut down inflation.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Turns Down EU Invitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Islamist Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan said today that his rejection of a
dinner invitation by the European Union (EU) leaders in Dublin
should serve as a clear warning, slamming EU's failure to
invite Turkey to the meeting properly.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the remarks on his way to the Mediterranean
resort city of Antalya to attend an environmental meeting.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Turkey would no longer accept second
class status in its dealings with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who leads the senior government partner
Welfare Party (RP), had already made clear that he would not
go to Dublin on December 14 just for attending a dinner.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the EU countries were trying to exclude
Turkey although it has carried out all its obligations for the
past 33 years.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan charged that the EU failed to live up to its own
obligations of providing aid to Turkey after the application of
the customs union agreement had created losses.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey lost five billion dollars worth of tax revenues in 11
months and we suffered a trade deficit of another five billion
dollars with the EU.," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our imports increased because of the zero customs duties
while we received nothing in return," the prime minister
complained.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan added that Turkey wants to establish solid ties
with Europe, "but this means sincerity and a balanced
relationship."
</P>
<P>
One sided actions and imbalances will never create the
friendship between Turkey and Europe, Erbakan warned.

<P>
LAGOS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG today promised that disarmed soldiers of
the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) are protected from attacks by
the other factions in the Liberian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given by ECOMOG Commander Major-general
Victor Malu during a meeting with the AFL's Chief of Staff
Abraham Kromah, according to a statement from the ECOMOG
headquarters today.
</P>
<P>
"The security of your men (AFL soldiers) is my responsibility
and if anyone attacks any part of Monrovia, including Camp
Schefflin (AFL's camp), the person is attacking ECOMOG," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malu warned that any faction which launches the attack on the
other "would be dealt with by the force which is determined to
ensure that the peace plan was not derailed."
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that the force would discharge this mandate
effectively to promote confidence in the nine-month peace plan to
install democratically elected government in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Since the three-month disarmament process began on November 22
in Liberia, more than 1,500 out of the 60,000 combatants have
turned in their weapons to the ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> Irish Prime Minister Urges New IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton said in Dublin today that Sinn Fein, the political wing the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) could attend the Northern Ireland
peace talks if the IRA called a new ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ireland's parliament, Bruton admitted that the
British and Irish governments differed on how Sinn Fein could
enter the peace talks, but he hoped to iron out the differences
during talks with his British counterpart John Major next week.
</P>
<P>
Bruton noted that if the IRA called a credible ceasefire and
Sinn Fein adhered to democratic rules governing the talks, Sinn
Fein could take part in the talks on the future of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"This means that if the IRA clearly called an unequivocal
ceasefire, in words that are believable, and provided there is an
adherence to the Mitchell principles, then Sinn Fein should be
admitted to the talks," Bruton said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Major made it clear last week that Britain would
first have to be satisfied that any new IRA ceasefire was
credible.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been banned from the all-party peace talks since
the IRA ended its 17-month ceasefire by launching a bombing
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Gauge Revising Proposed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A proposal to revise the way
inflation is measured has been put forward today in the U.S.
Congress and it could cost millions of retirees and force some
Americans to pay taxes at higher rates.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, drawn by a panel appointed by the U.S. Congress,
said that U.S. government's main inflation gauge -- the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) -- overstate inflation by 1.1 percent a year and
should be lowered by 1.1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The panel, headed by Stanford University economist and former
Bush administration adviser Michael Boskin, offered detailed
recommendations for fixing the problem in a 93-page report to the
Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt... our recommendations would greatly improve
the accuracy of the nation's price statistics," the economists
said in the report.
</P>
<P>
But some recommendations would take years to implement. Boskin
and the four other economists on the commission said that the
Congress and President Clinton must decide whether to enact
legislation to eliminate or reduce the estimated overstatement.
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, called for
action on the report in the budget which the U.S. Congress will
prepare next year. And many senators, both Democrats and
Republicans, are expressing a willingness to at least consider the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Americans' average monthly Social Security check
would be reduced if the CPI rate were calculated at 1.8 percent --
a reduction of 1.1 percentage points from present rate of 2.9
percent. And some people would be put into higher tax brackets
because of the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.S. government has sounded skeptical. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said the administration would only support
reductions in the CPI recommended by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics which is responsible for setting the CPI.

Colonel Simon Njoku, the co-ordinator of the program, said
because of the involvement of members of the Nigerian Armed

LAGOS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A team of U. S. officials is
expected to arrive in Nigeria on December 9 to discuss drug
trafficking and financial crimes in this country, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said U. S. officials from the State Department and
the Drug Enforcement Agency will meet in Abuja with the special
adviser on drug and financial crimes to Nigerian head of state
General Sani Abacha, the attorney general of the federation, the
minister of finance and the governor of the Central Bank.

The U. S. government has been accusing the Nigerian government
of failing to take measures to curb drug trafficking in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
Adamu Mohammed, special adviser to Abacha, said in a recent
forum that Nigeria's stand has always been that whoever wanted to
find out the true situation must visit Nigeria to verify the
efforts being made by the government to wipe out such crimes.
</P>
<P>
The issues of drug and financial crimes are being highly
politicized by the U. S. government and some western countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, we are doing the best we can to
steer Nigeria away from the menace of drug and financial crimes,"
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazauskas signed a decree today approving the composition of the
country's new government, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet headed by Gediminas Vagnorius was formed by a
coalition of the conservative Fatherland Union and Christian
Democratic Party that won the recent parliamentary elections held
in the Baltic state.
</P>
<P>
The Fatherland Union got 11 out of 17 seats in the Cabinet and
Christian Democrats -- three.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition offered two portfolios to the Center Union
and one to the Confederation of Lithuanian Industrialists.
</P>
<P>
The new Foreign Minister, 48-year-old biophysicist Algirdas
Saudargas, chairman of the Christian Democratic Party and a member
of parliament, previously held the post from March 1990 to
December 1992.
</P>
<P>
Part of his duties will be assigned to a newly formed Ministry
for European Affairs. Laima Andrikiene, 38, a parliament member
representing the Fatherland Union, will head the new ministry once
it is set up. For the time being she will head the Industry and
Trade Ministry due to be closed.
</P>
<P>
Ceslovas Sankevicius, 59, Christian Democrat, is the new
Defense Minister. Between March 1990 and November 1992 he was
Deputy Speaker of the parliament and headed the Lithuanian
delegation to talks with the former Soviet Union and later with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Vidmanta Ziemelis, 46, lawyer, member of parliament and the
Fatherland Union, became Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
New premier Vagnorius, also leader of the Fatherlasn Union, has
already asked the parliament to close five ministries: economics,
energy, forestry, environmental protection and industry. Instead he
intends to form the Ministry for European Affairs, the Ministry of
the Economy, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the matter is to be decided only after the new Cabinet
starts functioning. The government is expected to submit its
program to parliament on thursday.
</P>
<P>
After its approval, which is most likely next week, members of
the new Cabinet will be sworn in.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Republicans' Efforts to Boost Sino-US Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
urged US Republicans to follow in the steps of their forerunners
in the 1970s and make continuous efforts to promote Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
He made the call here this afternoon while meeting a US House
Republican delegation headed by Bill Paxon, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was glad that there has been a new momentum of
improvement in Sino-US relations. Both China and the US are major
countries, with China being the largest developing country and the
US the largest developed one, and the two nations enjoy common
interests in a broad sense, despite their differences.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, so long as the two sides respect each
other, seek common ground while reserving differences and expand
cooperation, Sino-US relations will continue on the track of healthy
development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it takes understanding, which is the basis for
mutual trust, to develop the bilateral ties. He welcomed more US
congressmen to visit China, saying that a personal visit provides
much more direct understanding than the media can.
</P>
<P>
The Premier said Chinese President Jiang Zemin and US President
Bill Clinton had, through their recent meeting in Subic of the
Philippines, decided to visit each other in the next two years,
which is a major event in bilateral relations, exerting a
far-reaching impact on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans opened the door for Sino-US relations in the
early 1970s, he noted, adding that he hoped the new generations
would make continuous efforts to promote Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
Paxon said that the members of his delegation are deeply
impressed by great changes which have taken place in
China. China's economic development has attracted foreign
entrepreneurs to invest here. He agreed that more US congressmen
should come to China to see for themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said the Republicans, like President Clinton, wish to
maintain and advance Sino-US friendly ties, assuring that US
Republican congressmen will carry on their party's tradition in
their efforts to improve bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the members of the US House of Representatives
share the same view on promoting US-China ties, although sometimes
a small number of them disagree. However, he stressed,
differences will not overwhelm the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Li Peng also briefed the guests on the
present situation of China's economic development, as well as the
Chinese government's stand on Sino-US trade relations and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The US delegation arrived in Beijing December 3 for a four-day
visit as guests of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign
Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Arab Legislators Slam Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Parliamentary
Federation today strongly denounced the expansion of Jewish
settlements in the occupied Arab lands as a flagrant violation of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government's policy contravenes the
U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 in particular, said a statement
issued by the federation here today.
</P>
<P>
The expansion schemes, which imply expansionism defying the
will of the international community in an attempt to convert
occupation into a fait accompli, is likely to bring about tension
and war, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Israel of planning to evade the peace
requirements embodied in the agreements, concluded by the former
Labor government with the Arab sides, and to skip the negotiations
with all parties concerned in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The federation called on Arab governments to adopt a firm and
unified stand, appealing to Russia and the U.S., the co-sponsors
of the peace process, the European Union members and all
peace-loving nations to resist Israel's policy of settlement
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The federation also appealed to parliamentarians across the
world to denounce Israel's expansionist policy and urge their
governments to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
In separate developments, the world community has stepped up its
pressure on the Israeli government regarding its encroachment upon
Syria's Golan Heights, the West Bank and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the 22-member Arab League and the United Nations
Security Council voiced their opposition against the Israeli
practices, warning that the Israeli moves will bring about further
deterioration in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government has granted permits for
the construction of 700 housing units in the Jewish settlement of
Kedumim in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The building plans, which include another 1,000 units in the
same project, call for building many more homes in the future
throughout all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Jerusalem Post reported today
that U.S. officials and Arab diplomats are worried that the
Netanyahu government will announce a flurry of plans for
settlement expansion once a Hebron redeployment deal is forged.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reportedly believed that such a move, aimed at
placating right-wing coalition elements opposed to the pullback,
would undercut its efforts to win support for Israel among Arab
countries after a Hebron deal is stricken.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Legislature Tightens Reins on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The municipal legislature of
the Chinese capital issued a regulation on the local budget
today, which will go into effect as of January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rule, the legislature will supervise the
financial balance of the budget, the measures of implementing the
budget, the levying of taxes, the fund use plan and major issues
relating to implementation of the budget.
</P>
<P>
In addition, without the approval of the legislature, the
budget details may not be changed.
</P>
<P>
And the legislature is authorized to declare void the municipal
government's improper decisions and orders relating to the budget.
</P>
<P>
According to Gong Shuji, director of the finance committee of
the legislature, who drafted the regulation, it is of great
importance to do a better job of supervision as regards the
budget, as the budget ensures smooth economic and social
development, and the improvement of the people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
He accused Wang Baosen, former vice mayor of Beijing who
committed suicide last year, of serious financial crimes,
including creating fake budgets, evasion of supervision, transfer
of funds outside the budget, and embezzlement and abuse of public
funds, which caused great social and economic damage to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, Gong went on, the local legislature
drew lessons from the incident and drew up the new supervision
measures in an effort to regulate the budget along legal lines.

<HEADLINE> EU criticizes Radio Closure in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
called on Serbian authorities to restore an independent Belgrade
radio station shut down over its coverage of unrest in the
Serbian capital.
</P>
<P>
Hans Van den Broek, EU commissioner for relations with
central and eastern European countries, deplored the closure,
saying it was incompatible with the need for guaranteeing
freedom of expression and free, independent, media.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Belgrade authorities to restore Radio B-92's
signal immediately, allow it to broadcast freely, and stop
exerting pressure on other media.
</P>
<P>
Radio B-92 was knocked off the air on Tuesday by authorities
trying to halt reporting of a wave of daily street demonstrations
against President Slobdan Milosevic's decision to annul the
results of local elections in which the opposition had made
significant gains.
</P>
<P>
The station had appealed for international support on
Wednesday, calling on countries attending this week's London
conference on the Bosnia peace process to push for the station's
"right to broadcast."
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, a number of independent media
organizations in Serbia have been silenced.
</P>
<P>
Before its closure, Radio B-92 was the last remaining
independent broadcasting media serving the Belgrade area with full
information on current events following irregularities in the
last month's municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
Since the Milosevic-controlled Serbian government annulled
election results in Belgrade and other major cites where the
opposition coalition appeared to have won, daily anti-Milosevic
protests have been going on for more than two weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament was
temporarily suspended this morning after fighting broke out
between left and right-wing lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The row was triggered by Communist representative Vladimir
Moiseenko who put a small red flag on his table and reminded
other representatives that December 5 was the Constitutional Day
of the former Soviet Union and used to be celebrated in Ukraine
during the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
A representative from the right-wing People's Ruh Yaroslav
Kendzor then rushed up and threw the flag onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, another right-wing representative Nikolai
Poravski from the Republican Party tore the flag into pieces,
sparking a brawl between the left and right wing parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
The confusion forced the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) Alexander Moroz to temporarily suspend the morning
session, which was resumed half an hour later.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Volkswagen Co.,
Ltd, has for the fifth consecutive year maintained its position as
the most successful overseas-funded industrial enterprise in China,
according to a report by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (Moftec) and the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen company earned 18.4 billion yuan from its sales
in 1995. It is followed by Motorola (China) Electronics, Ltd.,
Beijing Jeep Corporation, Ltd., Guangdong Nuclear Power
Corporation, Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipments Manufacturing Co.,
Ltd., Nanhai Oils &AMP; Fats Industrial (Chiwan) Ltd., Shenzhen
Konka Electronics (Group) Stock Company, Procter &AMP; Gamble
(Guangzhou) Ltd., Chongqing Qingling Automotive Stock Company and
Nanjing Jincheng Machinery Co., Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Moftec and SSB recently produced a list of top 500
foreign-funded enterprises, and nearly one-fifth of the companies
which failed to edge into the top 500 for 1994 were on the chart
for 1995.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, overseas-funded infrastructural companies
have been included in the top 500. Commercial and real estate
companies are not considered for selection.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jianhua, an official with the Foreign Investment
Department of Moftec, said that the number of overseas-funded
enterprises with a sales volume surpassing one billion yuan RMB
climbed to 89 last year from 57 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
She said that this year's top 500 chart shows that
overseas-funded enterprises in China have further expanded their
size and are performing well.
</P>
<P>
The total assets of the top 500 overseas-funded enterprises
stood at more than 350 billion yuan last year, 39 percent more
than the previous year. Nearly 90 percent of the companies were
profitable, with their profit adding up to 28.4 billion yuan last
year.

The official said that the structure of foreign investment has
further improved, with capital and technology intensive companies
taking up a bigger share.
</P>
<P>
"The top 500 are from 35 trades, with the majority converging
in electronics, machinery, food processing, textile and garments
and auto," she said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five companies in the electronics and telecommunications
equipment manufacturing sectors are in the top 500, while 65 such
companies were listed in the top 500 for 1994.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies in the textile and garment sector
dropped to 53 last year from 71 in 1994. Companies in metal
products also saw their number shrink from 31 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The official said that over half of the firms in the top 500
are companies funded by Hong Kong and Macao regions, and that the
ratio of western countries saw an apparent rise.
</P>
<P>
The top 500 come from 27 countries and regions, she said,
adding that the number of companies funded by Hong Kong and Macao
regions slipped from 280 in 1994 to 257 last year, but they still
account for 51 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese companies in the list rose from 59 in
1994 to 66 last year. Dutch companies rose from five to seven,
while American companies grew from 50 to 51.
</P>
<P>
The companies funded by Hong Kong and Macao sold 158.7 billion
yuan-worth of products last year, at an average of 617 million
yuan. The average figure was compared to 851 million yuan for
Japanese companies and 848 million yuan for American companies.
</P>
<P>
"The western transnational businesses in China are gradually
entering the production phase and will show stronger buildup in
the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
None of the overseas-funded companies from Inner Mongolia,
Anhui, Qinghai, Tibet, Yunnan and Guizhou entered the top 500
chart.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-one percent of the overseas-invested enterprises in the
list, or 456, are from the coastal regions. In 1994, 443 were
located in the coastal provinces.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong claimed the most successful overseas-funded
enterprises in the list, followed by Shanghai and nearby Jiangsu
Province. But an average overseas-funded enterprise in Shanghai
was the largest in scale among the three places, said Lu.

<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United
States will resolve their dispute over textile and garments' rule
of origin before the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial
meeting next week, a senior Philippine trade official said today.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista said that he is
confident that a compromise agreement as part of Washington's
offer to compensate losses of Filipino exporters, arising from the
U.S.-proposed new rules of origin, will soon be hammered out.
</P>
<P>
"We only need to negotiate minor points and we are expecting
those points to be given much considerations," Bautista said,
adding that the two sides will resolve their differences by the
end of next week.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the Philippines is ready to file formal
protest against the United States before the Textile Mediation
Board of the WTO should the negotiations continue to bog down next
week. WTO trade ministers will meet in Singapore next week.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule of origin, Manila said some 50 Philippine
textile firms will be adversely affected and 5,000 workers in its
garment industry will be laid off.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Garments and Textile Export Board executive director
Escolastica Segovia earlier reported that the government would
lose at least 30 million dollars in export revenue with the
implementation of the new rules.
</P>
<P>
Garments has been the country's second highest non-traditional
export earner next to electronics, with the United States as the
largest buyer.

<HEADLINE> China to Shift Site of Sino-Russian Nuclear Power Plant (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China announced today that it
will change the construction site of a two-million-kw nuclear
power plant, a Sino-Russian cooperative project to be launched
during the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The plant, originally planned for construction in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, will be built in eastern China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The new site of the plant is at Pashantou of Lianyungang City,
on the shore of the Yellow Sea, and the name of the plant will be
changed to the Lianyungang Nuclear Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a conference held for the
establishment of an office to take charge of the preparations for
the Lianyugang plant.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhaobo, vice-president of the China National Nuclear Power
Corporation, said that the major reason for the change is that
"Jiangsu has a more imperative need for nuclear power than
Liaoning in order to solve its energy problem."
</P>
<P>
On December 18, 1992, the Chinese and Russian governments
signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant at Wentuozi in
Liaoning. Under the agreement the project will use Russian
government loans and introduce Russian VVER-1000 reactors to build
two one-million-kw generating units.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, Jiangsu, a province with a
double-digit economic growth rate, has found power shortage
bottlenecking its economic development.
</P>
<P>
With limited water and coal resources, Jiangsu has to turn to
nuclear power for help.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Liaoning has built several small thermal power
plants, which have helped ease the local shortage of power supply
to some extent.

<HEADLINE> 76 Million Chinese Children Vaccinated Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical workers
delivered Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) pills to millions of children
under the age of four today, National Immunization Day.
</P>
<P>
In hospitals, kindergartens, busy traffic hubs and downtown
city areas, they will help about 76 million children take the
pills today and tomorrow, which can protect them from the deadly
polio virus.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, visited a Beijing kindergarten to deliver pills to
children personally.
</P>
<P>
"We've made remarkable achievements in eradicating polio in
recent years, and have been commended by international
organizations for this," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the medical workers to strive to maintain the current
level of success.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Peng Peiyun, Minister of Public Health Chen
Minzhang and Acting Mayor of Beijing Jia Qinglin accompanied Li to
the activity.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health, the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund have sent inspection
groups to Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, and the Guangxi
Zhuang and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions to help carry out
local vaccination programs.
</P>
<P>
Jan Kostrzewski, chairman of the Global Commission for the
Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis of the WHO, also
joined in the activity in Nanchang, capital of central China's
Jiangxi Province, today.
</P>
<P>
This national drive, and the next one scheduled for January 5,
1997, are expected to immunize 90 percent of Chinese children
under the age of four. These are some of the steps the Chinese
health authorities are taking to eliminate polio throughout the
country before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China has launched three similar activities since December,
1993, vaccinating more than 400 million children.
</P>
<P>
Polio is an infectious viral disease that attacks the central
nervous system, causing permanent paralysis of the muscles. It is
frequently fatal.
</P>
<P>
Because man is the only host of the virus, which can survive
for up to three months, mass immunization is the only way to block
the transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is still among the countries with polio
cases. A report released by the national polio surveillance
network said 168 polio cases were reported last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechnya Discuss Elections, Power-sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The joint Russian-Chechen
commission met in Grozny today to discuss elections in the
breakaway republic in late January and power-sharing between
Chechnya and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russian Security Council Secretary, Ivan Rybkin, said on
arriving that he was bringing a package of documents to be
discussed and signed as part of the settlement of the conflict in
Chechnya in accordance with the Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
decree.
</P>
<P>
They were also expected to discuss a planned complete
withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya, transformation of
joint command offices into local police stations, resumption of
air and rail traffic and rebuilding the economy.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin is accompanied by his deputies Boris Berezovsky and
Leonid Mayorov as well as Georgy Kurin, co-chairman of the joint
commission in charge of handling social and economic problems in
the Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
Representatives on the Chechen side include the First Deputy
Prime Minister of the Chechen coalition government, Modladi
Udugov, co-chairman of the joint commission Khusein Bibulatov and
Akhmed Zakayev, national security aide to Chechen separatist
leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.

<P>
At first, Russia could not understand China's new choice,
fearing that the nuclear power project might be postponed. But
Russian experts dismissed such misgivings after they had paid a
visit to the new site and heard China's explanations, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to explain that Pashantou has even better
transportation conditions than Wentuozi, on the shore of the Bohai
Sea. Although both of the sites are on the coast, Pashantou is near
the city of Lianyungang, the eastern terminal of the Euro-Asian
continental bridge.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pashantou is only 20 km away from Lianyungang,
while Wentuozi is 100 km away from the city of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Having more convenient traffic conditions, transportation of
large equipment and construction of roads, launching of the
nuclear power project will become even easier, Chen
explained.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the original feasibility study report for the nuclear
power project has not been completed. Therefore, the progress of
the project will not be much affected, Chen said, adding that a
new report is now being drafted.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the China National Nuclear Corporation, Jiangsu
International Trust and Investment Corporation, Jiangsu Provincial
Electricity Company and East China Electric Power Group Company,
signed an agreement to make joint investment, with shares of 50
percent, 20 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The office founded today will act as a temporary working organ
for the shareholders, and will perform the duty of being the legal
person of the project. Under the leadership of the shareholders,
it will carry out preliminary work for the project.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture company, the Lianyungang Nuclear Power Co. Ltd,
will be set up in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
Chen revealed that work on the plant may be launched in 1998
and be completed around the year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Former Afghan Leader Karmal Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Afghan leader Babrak
Karmal died from liver cancer in an elite Moscow hospital on
Sunday, Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
When the former Soviet Union invaded this country in December
1979, Karmal returned from exile in Czechoslovakia and was
installed by Moscow as head of the occupied state.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he was made leader of the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan (PDPA), the country's communist party, chairman of the
executive committee of the Supreme Revolutionary Council and
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He resigned all the positions in 1986 and was succeeded by
former secret police chief Mohammad Najibullah, who was executed
by the opposition Taliban movement in September this year.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, Karmal spent five years in exile in the
Soviet Union before returning to Kabul in 1991. He went to Moscow
for treatment for liver cancer in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Karmal, born in 1929, was one of the founders of the PDPA in
1965. He became deputy chairman of the Afghan Superior
Revolutionary Council in 1978 but was sent into exile by the then
president Hafizullah Amin.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said that Karmal was the last surviving member of
Afghanistan's former pro-Soviet leadership.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Economy Forecast to Grow Faster in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is expected to grow by 5.4 percent in 1997 as an
overall economic recovery boosts the domestic demand, the Hang
Seng Bank forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The figure compares with the official forecast of 4.7 percent
for 1996.
</P>
<P>
With faster economic growth, inflation is predicted to rise
moderately to seven percent in the coming year, according to the
latest issue of Hang Seng Economic Monthly. Unemployment is likely
to fall to 2.5 percent while consumer spending is expected to grow
by 4.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng also forecasts that Hong Kong's total exports would
grow at a faster pace of 9.7 percent next year, up from 5.4
percent in 1996. Exports to China and the United States would grow
by 13 and four percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Total investment would rise by 10.2 percent in 1997, slightly
higher than 9.6 percent for 1996, said Hang Seng. However,
investment in the public sector is likely to slow down as the
demand for equipment and machinery for the construction of the new
airport and other related infrastructure projects would fall in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Visitor arrivals are expected to jump by 20 percent next year
as many foreign visitors plan to come to Hong Kong to witness the
historic event around July 1, 1997, when China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.

Jakarta, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here today that the bilateral talks between Indonesia
and Malaysia on the Sipadan and Ligitan islands have come to the
point of saturation, making it difficult to reach a bilateral
settlement.
</P>
<P>
In a hearing with the House Commission on Foreign Affairs,
Information, Security and Defense, Alatas said the Foreign
Ministry has set up a special task force to prepare for the court
session on the disputed islands at the International Court of
Justice at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
In October this year, the two countries reached agreement to
bring the issue to the international court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia have overlapping sovereignty over the
two small islands between the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the
Indonesian province of East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old dispute flared in 1991 after Malaysia began
promoting the islands as a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the government has made an inventory of Indonesia's
islands and has mapped the country's boundaries with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope there would not be such a case anymore," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes To Benefit From Trade With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has expected to benefit
from Jordanian-Iraqi trade after Iraq favors to use the Jordanian
port of Aqaba as the main port for its imports.
</P>
<P>
In view of the opening of Iraq's Umm Al Qasr port, the use of
Aqaba for Iraqi imports will help Jordan benefit most among the
Gulf nations following Iraq's agreement with the United Nations on
its limited export of oil for food, an unidentified Jordanian
official was quoted by today's Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report said two Jordanian officials will head for
Baghdad soon to explore how to build up the bilateral trade, but
it did not give any details.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Commerce Minister Mohammad Mahdi Saleh will come to
Amman next week for further talks over the logistics of clearing
and transporting Iraq-bound goods from Aqaba to Iraq, according to
Jordanian Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year Jordan cut by half its exports to
Iraq against the background of increased Iraqi debts to
Jordan. Amman agreed in November to increase exports to Iraq by 35
million U.S. dollars this year, Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The step is aimed to guarantee a share in the trade benefits
expected from implementing the U.N. oil-for-food deal which
allows Baghdad to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil over six
months to buy food and medicine for humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
Local economists have noted that "Jordan is the first
beneficiary after Iraq from the implementation of the oil-for-food
agreement, just as Amman was the first to be hurt, after Iraq, by
the trade embargo" which the U.N. imposed on Baghdad after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions made Jordan lose its largest trade partner,
Iraq. The kingdom's refusal to join the U.S.-led allied coalition
in driving Iraq out of Kuwait also costed its financial support
from traditional donors, the United States and the Gulf
countries.

<HEADLINE> Reform Fruitful at Construction Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Construction Bank of China
(CBC), one of major commercial banks in the country, has made
notable achievements in its structural reforms this year,
according to sources at the bank.
</P>
<P>
This year new reform measures have been taken regarding the
managerial structure of funds and credits so as to strengthen the
ability of the bank's headquarters to utilize funds and support
key projects and state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, the CBC provided 18.87
billion yuan in loans to key projects and 10.68 billion yuan in
loans to large and medium-sized state firms, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the CBC has followed the central government's
macro-control policy, trying hard to make more efficient
use of funds. On the other hand, the bank is also playing a big
role in the public and interbank markets run by the People's Bank of
China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the reform measures have brought about
positive economic and social results, as its circulation of loans
has been speeded up and deposits have increased remarkably.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October this year the bank's deposits totalled
988.64 billion yuan, compared with 730.71 billion yuan in the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period its outstanding loans had increased to
778.93 billion yuan, from 562.21 billion yuan in October last
year, according to official figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China set up here today the
preparatory office of the Lianyungang Nuclear Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
Officials announced the plant is one of the four nuclear power
plants China will build in the coming five years. It will use two
pressurized water reactors imported from Russia, with a total
operation capacity of two million kw.
</P>
<P>
The plant will be located near Lianyungang, a port city in east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to ease power shortages in Jiangsu and
east China as a whole, a region that is experiencing rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government approved the construction of the plant
in 1995, after experts from both Russia and China had completed a
study on its technical details.
</P>
<P>
At present, the experts are working out a report about the
project's feasibility, the officials revealed.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory office is a temporary business institute which

<HEADLINE> G-15 to Unite to Face WTO Agenda Disturbers: Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 15 (G-15)
developing countries is determined to unite to face those who
intend to disturb the agenda of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
meeting in Singapore from December 9 to 13, Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said today.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 summit in Harare, Zimbabwe on November 1-5 discussed
international trade and related issues, including those which
could be raised at the upcoming WTO ministerial meeting, Alatas
told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries, including Indonesia, fear the
possible discussion of non-trade issues at the Singapore meeting
and have thus expressed opposition to the use of the WTO meeting
as a forum for such issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the G-15 considers the existing international trade
system conducive to the growth of the economies of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of developing countries are unable to take
advantage of the system while others are sidelined, he added.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries which benefit from the system continue to
forward irrelevant issues to the WTO meeting to maintain the
competitiveness of their goods in the world market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries must therefore unite to face pressures
from developed countries and oppose the inclusion of irrelevant
issues in the agenda of the forthcoming WTO meeting," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 was founded in 1989 to provide a consultative forum
where heads of state could address the problems of the developing
world and to forge cooperation among South countries.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 groups Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to tame
reckless drivers on road, Israel has announced new fines which
will go into effect as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the Transport Ministry, the
driver who passes a red light will now be fined 1,000 shekels
(some 300 U.S. dollars), while driving an overweight truck
will be fined with the same amount.
</P>
<P>
Driving while using a cellular phone -- a common scene in
Israel where one out of five citizens has a cellular phone -- the
driver will face a 750 shekels-fine (more than 200 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, failing to yield for a crosswalk, and crossing a
solid white line while overtaking another car will be fined 750
shekels respectively.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transportation Yitzhak Levy stated he hopes the
stiff fines will make the Israeli drivers think twice and
therefore be more careful so that vehicle accidents and
road deaths can be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, traffic accidents have killed
546 persons. Shmuel Meir, deputy mayor of Jerusalem was killed
Tuesday when a truck veered out of control and collided with his

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan Sign Documents to Improve Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of
Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky and his Jordanian counterpart
Ali Abu-Ragheb signed a memorandum of understanding during a
meeting at the Dead Sea Wednesday evening in an effort to boost
trade between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The main issues agreed upon include alterations in the method
of calculating customs duty, reducing duty on certain items, and
adding new products to those incorporated in the original
agreement signed in 1995, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, a list of products will become
fully exempt from customs duty, including filters for
motor-vehicles, bakery equipment, optical lenses and toys.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 items now become 50 percent exempt, such as
confectioneries, plastic piping and glasses-frames. Other items
will be subject to 70 percent duty.
</P>
<P>
Trade relations between the two countries have developed at a
slow pace although a trade agreement was signed more than one
year ago. Israeli exports average 2.5 million U.S. dollars a
month, while imports average 1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The main stumbling block appears to stem from Israel's
security fears, which led to lengthy delays in transferring
goods across the border. Jordanian trucks were unloaded before
passing the border at both the Arava and King Hussein crossing
points. Their contents were checked, then loaded onto Israeli
vehicles for delivery to their final destination.
</P>
<P>
Given this inconvenience, the Jordanians have been
particuarly vociferous in calling for adopting the "door-to-door"
method. Before the signing of the memorandum, officials from
both sides concluded an accord, under which the checks will take
place at the original vehicle loading points by joint
Israeli-Jordanian security teams.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects Inflation to Reach Targeted Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines may attain its
low inflation rate target of 8.6 percent this year with favorable
records in the past months, Central Bank Governor Cabriel Singson
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the target would be hit if the inflation rate for
December does not go beyond 6.3 percent, which is "within reach"
as the rate for November was a low 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Posting a low end-year inflation rate is not going to be very
difficult especially with the significant recovery of the country
in agricultural production this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the price index of the food, beverages and tobacco
group registered a slowdown from 3.6 percent in October to 2
percent in November, signaling that the rice crisis which fueled a
higher inflation in the Philippines last year is "really over."
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine National Statistics Office, the
average inflation rate for the year as of November was 8.7
percent, down from 9.1 percent in the first 10 months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the country's sustained prudence in monetary
management also contributed to the decline of the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Both base money and reserve money -- the measure of liquidity
in the financial system -- continued to run significantly below
the ceilings under the economic and financial program supported by
the International Monetary Fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This resulted in less pressure for prices to go up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the inflation rate in the Philippines has
been declining in the past 11 months. In September, it went down
to 4.4 percent, the lowest in the last nine years.

<HEADLINE> WHO Official Praises China's Achievements in Eradicating Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the
World Health Organization (WHO) offered high praise for China's
achievements in eradicating polio, but urged the country to
maintain its current level of success.
</P>
<P>
Jan Kostrzewski, chairman of the Global Commission for the
Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis, WHO, today
participated in a project to deliver the oral polio vaccine (OPV)
pills to children in Nanchang, the capital of central China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
As part of nationwide activities today, China's National
Immunization Day (NID), the chairman, accompanied by Jiangxi
Governor Shu Shengyou, visited two local kindergartens and
delivered OPV pills to children.
</P>
<P>
There is still work to be done to completely eliminate polio,
Shu said, adding that international cooperation in supplying the
vaccine and diagnosing symptoms should be increased.
</P>
<P>
Polio is an infectious viral disease that attacks the central
nervous system, causing permanent paralysis of the muscles. It is
frequently fatal.
</P>
<P>
Because man is the only host of the virus, which can survive
for up to three months, mass immunization is the only tool for
blocking the transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has set a goal to finally eradicate polio by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
China has launched three NID activities since December, 1993,
vaccinating more than 400 million children. About 300 million OPV
pills are produced annually in China.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination activities today and on January 5, next year,
are expected to immunize 90 percent of children under age four.

HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 middle and
primary schools in Hong Kong have opened Putonghua (mandarin
Chinese) courses, an increase of some 10 percent over last year,
according to preliminary official statistics.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Education Department said that so far this
year more than 470 schools have applied for Putonghua education
aid, of which 208 are middle schools and 263 primary schools.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that currently Putonghua has not been listed
as a core subject and schools opening this course can apply for
official aid from the Education Department to buy teaching
materials.
</P>
<P>
He said the actual number of schools with Putonghua courses
should be much bigger, because many schools have opened Putonghua
courses but did not apply for aid.
</P>
<P>
Putonghua courses will be officially opened in Hong Kong's
middle and primary schools in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Research Finds Turkey an Attractive Market for HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has become an
increasingly attractive market for Hong Kong suppliers because of
its large population, fast economic recovery and lower trade
barriers, according to a new research report released today by the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
The report says Hong Kong can also produce garments in Turkey
to take advantage of the country's free access to the European
Union and its under-utilized quotas for exporting to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the Turkish market has a number of niches
open for Hong Kong products which are competitive in terms of
price, design, workmanship and performance.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Hong Kong's total exports to Turkey surged by 105
percent to 405 million U.S. dollars. In the first seven months of
this year, exports also increased by 39 percent to 276 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's exports to Turkey mainly include telecommunications
equipment, semiconductors, watches and clocks, radios, toys and
games, textiles, miscellaneous manufactured articles and footwear.

NEW DELHI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Minister of Civil
Aviation C. M. Ibrahim said today that a committee has been set up
by his ministry to go into the entire gamut of air safety.
</P>
<P>
The committee would also find out whether the safety equipment
at the airports in the country is of international standard.
</P>
<P>
The move came after two international passenger aircraft
collided with each other over New Delhi, capital of India, on
November 12, killing all 351 people on board. Many people
complained about the poor facilities at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the lower house of parliament here that the
entire Indian air space would be covered by a secondary radar
system within a period of three years to ensure better and safe
navigation of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
There has been improvement in aviation safety in the country as
the number of aircraft accidents has progressively decreased
during the last four years. In 1993 there were 13 accidents as
against nine, six and five in 1994, 1995 and 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some international agencies were deliberately trying to malign
the Indian air safety system due to business rivalry, he said.

Radio, Film and Television, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, the project is regarded as a major
effort organized by the Chinese government to mark Hong Kong's
return.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first program in the series of celebration
events that has been completed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the symphonic poem, another 45 works were named
second and third place winners, and received honorary
mentions. These works are expected to be performed at the New
Year's concert and also at the awards ceremony for the
competition, to be held on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The competition has drawn widespread attention from various
sectors both at home and overseas since it began accepting the
musical works last February, said the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
By September 30, when the activity officially ended, organizers
had received some 4,000 pieces, including songs, symphonies, and
choral arrangements, which were from China's interior areas, Hong
Kong and Macao, the United States, Japan, Canada, Argentine,
Australia and some other foreign countries.

FREETOWN, December 5 (xinhua) -- Over 3000 people in three
displaced people's camp in the east and south of the country have
returned home since the signing of a peace accord last week
between Sierra Leone's President Tejan Kabbah and Rebel leader
Foday Sankoh in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
''They have returned with straw mattresses, buckets and other
bundles to start a new life,'' a Sierra Leone Red Cross
official monitoring the arrivals said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, many of the displaced looked ''
extremely weak and frustrated, the mothers carrying babies with
strained faces''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military public relations officer, Major John
Milton told Xinhua Thursday, ''we are no longer attacking the
bases of the RUF (rebels). We have been ordered not to do so.''
</P>
<P>
''The continous movement of the RUF fighters in search of food is
a major problem and a threat to peace. It is possible that
in their search for food, they will cause havoc'',
Major Milton added.
</P>
<P>
Information and Broadcasting Minister, Abdul Thorlu Bangura
disclosed that ''most soldiers have been removed from the warfront
to the barracks''.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China places a great deal of
emphasis on China-Belarus relations, Vice-President Rong Yiren
told Acting Belarus Prime Minister Sergei Stepanovich Ling
during a meeting in Beijing's Great Hall of the People today.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties five years
ago, bilateral friendly cooperations in political, economic and
other fields have developed greatly, Rong said, noting that China
treasures the friendship and hopes for greater development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Rong said he appreciates the outstanding efforts of Belarus'
president, Alexander Lukashenko, in advancing bilateral
relations. Chinese leaders and the Chinese government will, as
always, contribute to improving relations between the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is satisfied with the progress in bilateral relations,
Ling said, and there is no obstacle to the development of friendly
cooperative relations between the two countries and visits by
senior leaders of the two countries would benefit such relations.
</P>
<P>
Belarus and China should strengthen cooperation and support
each other in international affairs because coordination and
mutual support are important to both countries, he said. Belarus
also thanks China for its support and understanding and will
always treasure its friendship with China, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Prosecutor Demands Jail Ex-minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Supreme Public
Prosecutor's Office (SPPO) today demanded six years in jail for
former Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho for taking bribes in return
for business favors on military procurement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SPPO also asked for confiscation of the 187,000
U.S. dollars that Lee had taken in bribes.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who was defense minister until October 17, was arrested on
October 26 for receiving the bribes from Daewoo Heavy Industries
Company through middleman Kwon Byong-ho, an arms dealer, with a
request that he help Daewoo with the light combat helicopter
procurement project.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo was the chosen contractor for the helicopter project and
Kwon asked Lee to help the company secure everything necessary to
complete the project.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 59, is also charged with leaking military information to
Kwon on Combat Direction System which was under deliberation by
the Defense Ministry at the time.
</P>
<P>
The SPPO also demanded two years of imprisonment for Sok
Chin-chol and Chong Ho-shin, who were respectively the former
president and vice president of Daewoo Heavy Industries Company,
for giving the bribes to Lee.
</P>
<P>
"Lee deserves a heavy sentence considering that a government
official of his ranking let himself be snared by an arms dealer
into leaking military secrets and bribe-taking," said the SPPO.
</P>
<P>
"But because he had dedicated his life to national defense and
he himself was used as a prey by Kwon, we demand the above
sentence," it added.
</P>
<P>
Lee, admitting to the charges, said that he deeply regrets for
causing the scandal and apologizes to the people.
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is set for December 17.
</P>
<P>
Lee is the 11th South Korean defense minister since 1980 and
the sixth arrested on charges of corruption or involvement in
military rebellion.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Industrial Output Goes Up in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial output
in October grew by 1.8 percent from a year ago, thanks to its
increased output of electronic products and chemicals, the
Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the October figure was still seasonally below the
September level by a marginal 0.6 percent, said the EDB.
Cumulatively, the output in the first 10 months of 1996 grew by
4.5 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The country's electronics industry soared by 4.2 percent from
October last year, mainly due to a higher output of disk drives,
computer peripherals and other products. Demand for
semi-conductors, consumer electronics and telecommunication
equipment remained weak in the export markets, said the EDB.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of 1996, the electronics industry grew
by 9.5 percent over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The chemical industries, including petroleum, pharmaceuticals,
petrochemical and specialty chemical industries, went up by 5.3
percent, with the main contribution coming from the petrochemical
industry, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output for the chemical industries in the first
10 months increased by 5.2 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry declined by 2.8 percent due to the
shutdown of two major refineries in October. Cumulative output
growth for the first 10 months was maintained at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paints and pharmaceuticals industry decreased by 11 percent
because of reduced output of pharmaceutical intermediates, which
resulted from trimmed orders and maintenance shutdown of plants.
With this decline, cumulative output for the industry in the
January-October period of 1996 grew by 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of machinery slid by 8.7 percent with reduced
production of cranes, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and
refrigerating equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, the cumulative output of machinery for the first 10
months of the year still grew by 6.6 percent over the
corresponding period of 1995, the EDB said.

</P>
<P>
He said that currently 19 floats and 19 performing groups have

<HEADLINE> Israel to Build New Housing Units in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
granted the permits for the construction of 700 housing units
in the Jewish settlement of Kedumim in the West Bank, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Daniella Weiss, head of the Kedumim
regional council, as saying that the construction is scheduled
to begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
Weiss said that the building plans, which include another
1,000 units in the same project, call for many more homes
in the future throughout all of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the plans brought an immediate
response from Israel's left-wing groups.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Meretz Party Yossi Sarid said that Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told world leaders Wednesday that new
Jewish settlements would not be constructed.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, environment minister in the previous government, said
that the "additional building in 'existing communities' in place
of building new communities does not represent the cessation
of building."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Peace Now movement has called for stopping the
building because it jeopardizes the entire peace process with the
Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Jerusalem Post reported today
that U.S. officials and Arab diplomats are worried that the
Netanyahu government will announce a flurry of plans for
settlement expansion once a Hebron redeployment deal is struck.
</P>
<P>
The United States reportedly believes that such a move, aimed
at placating right-wing coalition elements opposed to the
pullback, would undercut its efforts to win support for Israel
among Arab countries after a Hebron deal.

<HEADLINE> HK Manufacturing Industry Receives More External Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The value of external
investment in Hong Kong's manufacturing industry reached 48
billion HK dollars (6.15 billion US dollars) at original cost in
1995, rising 10 percent over that of 1994, according to findings
of the latest official surveys.
</P>
<P>
This is a four-fold increase on the external manufacturing
investment of 11.4 billion HK dollars (1.46 billion US dollars) in
1984, when the first survey was conducted.
</P>
<P>
Francis Ho, director-general of industry, said that a continued
growth in external investment in Hong Kong's manufacturing sector
reflects the continued attractiveness of Hong Kong as a
manufacturing base.
</P>
<P>
According to the findings, Japan kept its position as the
leading source country of investment in Hong Kong's manufacturing
industry, accounting for 39 percent of the total. The US, with 28
percent, ranked the second, while China and the United Kingdom
took the third and fourth places.
</P>
<P>
Electronics, textiles and clothing, electrical products and
chemical products were industries receiving the lion's share of
the external investment, accounting for some 60 percent of the
total external investment in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a manufacturing base,
more than 80 percent of the respondents considered Hong Kong's
banking and financial facilities and infrastructure as favorable
factors, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
"The survey reaffirmed the increasing importance of Hong Kong
as a major regional business center for overseas companies," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Refuses to Be Rushed on Republic Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said today that he would not be rushed into adopting a
policy position on the issue of turning the country into a
republic although he is not trying to sideline the issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is not something that should be swept under the carpet and
I want to make it clear I don't intend to do that," Howard said in
a media release in response to criticism earlier this week by
U.S.-based expatriate Australian republican Robert Hughes who said
Howard failed to push the republic issue.
</P>
<P>
"I want the Australian people to have a say on this issue and
they will have a say under my government at the beginning, the
middle and the end, but I'm not going to have my hand forced, or
the government's view and calm consideration of the issue hastened
by advice from extraneous sources," said Howard.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would examine a proposal by opposition leader
Kim Beazley for a 1997 plebiscite on the republic issue, to be
followed by a joint parliamentary committee inquiry and a 1999
referendum.
</P>
<P>
He said his cabinet has begun considering its own policy, which
may go on for a little while yet and he probably will issue a
statement about it in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has promised to hold a people's
convention on constitutional change in 1997, with half of the
delegates directly elected. It has also promised a referendum on
the issue before the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Australian Official Urges WTO to Accept China Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Trade Tim Fischer today urged the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to admit China as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner China is in the WTO on a proper basis the better,"
he said in an interview with Australian reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he believed the Chinese leadership is serious in
its hope for joining the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
"I call for the speeding up the negotiations on China's WTO
accession which had until October been stalled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer is scheduled to fly to Singapore Sunday for the
inaugural WTO ministerial meeting, where China's accession is
expected to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
He said China could be allowed to join the WTO without fully
meeting the organization's global trading rules.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has also reportedly suggested that China be
granted WTO membership after a "down-payment" of WTO obligations,
with the full list of obligations to be accepted over an
unspecified time frame.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil production of Mobil's
joint venture in Nigeria has hit 518,000 barrels a day, accounting for
30 percent of the country's daily production of two millon barrels.
</P>
<P>
Mobil operates in Nigeria through a joint venture with the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), with the NNPC holding 60
percent of the shares and the Mobil producing Nigeria unlimited 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials said the current output represents a 15 percent
increase over last year's 450,000 barrels a day, thanks mainly to
higher production by the Ubit off-shore field in Akwa Ibom State.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Mobil's production is expected to hit 900,000
barrels a day by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Finance Minister Anthony Ani announced two months ago that
the government is seriously considering selling 57 percent of its
equities in its joint ventures with foreign oil firms, namely, Shell,
Mobil, Elf, Texaco, Overseas, Chevron and Agip.
</P>
<P>
However, NNPC officials said so far no concrete decisions have
been taken by the government and they have not received any formal
notice.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Seeks to Meet with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has said that time is right for him to meet
with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the dispute over
Hebron, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks to reporters as he flew home
Wednesday night, following his European tour which brought him to
Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the agreement on the long-delayed Israeli
army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron is complete,
and what is now needed, is a "decision on the part of the leaders
to implement it."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, while visiting Madrid, Netanyahu publicly
suggested that he and Arafat could personally resolve outstanding
issues relating to a Hebron pullback.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the outstanding issues in Hebron that
could not be resolved in one meeting between Arafat and myself,"
Netanyahu said at a joint press conference with Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal from Hebron, originally set for last
March, has been delayed due to disagreements over arrangements
to protect about some 450 Jewish settlers living there among
120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In response to Netanyahu's call for summit, Hassan Asfour,
Palestinian negotiator for the Hebron talks Thursday linked the
holding of such a meeting with making serious progress and accused
the prime minister of trying to make a public relations maneuver.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, he said, "believes the time has not come for such a
summit because there is no progress."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejected accusations of "foot-dragging" in
implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians on
Hebron. Moreover, he chafed at the depiction of his government in
the Arab world as being opposed to peace.
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you why I am concerned," he told reporters.
"Because there is no foundation for the picture that emanates
from the Arab capitals."

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Drops in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment level
stood at 6.5 percent during the first three quarters, down 0.4
percent from figures for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Central Bureau of Statistics report,
the improvement in unemployment is attributed to a reduction of
6,000 in the number of people without job for more than a year
down to 64,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of out-of-work men increased by 0.3 percent, to 5.8
percent of the men work force, while the total for women dropped
by 1.3 percent, to 7.4 percent of the women work force.
</P>
<P>
The total work force (excluding the West Bank and Gaza Strip)
averaged 2 million in the third quarter, up 3.3 percent on the
comparable figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai promised last
month to make fighting unemployment a major target for his
ministry next year.
</P>
<P>
In the longer-term the Israeli Finance Ministry predicts
unemployment will diminish over the next five years, but
expects an initial increase to a predicted 6.6 percent in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Expand Tariff-Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel have signed an
agreement to increase the number of products that enjoy
tariff-free trade between them and to reduce customs duties on
some others in an effort to strengthen flagging trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed Wednesday at a meeting between trade
ministers Ali Abu-Ragheb of Jordan and Natan Sharansky of Israel
at the Moriah Plaza Hotel on the Israeli side of the Dead Sea,
the Jordan News Agency Petra reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, pharmaceutical and construction
materials, among other products, would be given tariff-free
treatment. These products are added to a list of "A" category
products, which is part of the trade accord the two countries
signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Customs duties will be cut from 50 per cent to 30 per cent on
90 other items, including candies, plastic pipes and textiles as
well as garments. These are covered in a "B" category of
products, which is also included in the trade agreement of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed issues related to trade
between Jordan and the Palestinian territories under overall
Israeli control. They agreed that Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) officials should be directly involved in discussions on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
The focus of discussions will be two fold: eliminating
complicated Israeli procedures that curtail the flow of Jordanian
products to the Palestinian territories and amending an
Israeli-Palestinian agreement of 1994 that limits the scope of
Jordanian-Palestinian trade by specifying the items and setting
quantities the Palestinians could import from non-Israeli sources.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's agreement followed an Israeli acceptance to
replace the "back-to-back" transport of Jordanian products to
Israel with a "door-to-door" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has agreed to allow Jordan to transport cement and
oil directly to the Palestinian territories under the
"door-to-door" agreement.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expects Gas Shortage This Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel will have to import
gas for home heating to make up for an expected shortfall this
winter, unless the Israel Oil Refineries steps up its
production.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Kulitz, head of the Infrastructure Ministry's fuel
administration, reportedly told the Economics Committee of the
Knesset (Israel's parliament) at the committee's recent meetings
that the Israelis are expected to consume 40,000-45,000 tons of
gas a month this winter.
</P>
<P>
However, the Oil Refineries has committed to producing only
30,000-33,000 tons a month, which is some 20 percent less than
the company supplied last year.
</P>
<P>
"It will be possible to overcome the expected shortfall only
by means of imports, which will increase the cost per ton by
tens of dollars," Kulitz said.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Farjoun, managing director of the Oil Refineries,
said that the company could not fully meet the growing
domestic demand as its production capacity is limited.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the company does cut back on its
production when it becomes economically not worthwhile, as was
the case from August to October this year.
</P>
<P>
But representatives of gas companies charged that the
Oil Refineries was deliberately underproducing in order to
pressure the government into raising gas prices.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Economics Committee Elie Goldschmidt demanded
that Kulitz and Farjoun report back to the committee within a
week on how they plan to prevent the projected shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Farjoun said the Oil Refineries would be willing to help the
gas companies import and store the necessary quantities of gas,
as the companies said they do not have the proper facilities to
store the gas themselves.

The EO has been assisting the Sierra Leonean government troops

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urges WTO to Reject Non-Trade Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia urged today that
the first World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in
Singapore next week focus only on two matters and reject proposals
to include non-trade issues.
</P>
<P>
The conference's priority should be to review the progress in
implementing the Uruguay Round commitments, taking into account
the difficulties and concerns of particularly the developing
countries, Deputy International Trade and Industry Minister Kerk
Choo Ting said when opening a forum on business implications of
WTO issues here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference should then focus on completing unfinished
business and future work of the WTO, based on areas specified in
the built-in agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the conference should reject proposals to include
non-trade issues such as multilateral investment rules,
competition policy, labor standards, corruption and environment.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia maintains that the WTO should avoid overcrowding its
work program with initiatives that will be burdensome and inhibit
trading prospects of countries, especially those from the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and its partners in the South must ensure that
policies adopted by the WTO will not impair development or
contribute toward the process of de-industrialization and further
marginalization of developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Federation of Malaysian
Manufacturers (FMM) which organized the forum, the non-trade
issues, if imposed through the WTO on its members, will have
"serious implications" for the Malaysian industry.
</P>
<P>
The non-trade issues would impede the growth and development of
Malaysian industries and erode their competitiveness if adopted by
the WTO, FMM Vice-President Francis Huang said at the forum.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian industries would have to fend off attempts by
industrialized countries to impose the non-trade issues through
the WTO, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese External Trade
Organisation has urged Zimbabwe's textile industry to improve
quality of its products to make it more competetitive in overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on quality control on Wednesday, the
Janpanese External Trade Organization's representative in
Zimbabwe, Takemi Nakanishi said Zimbabwe's textile industry which
is fighting for survival, could not export to Japan because its
products are of low quality, as compared to China, which is
currently the main supplier of Japan's apparel.
</P>
<P>
''There is competition among countries exporting to Japan, but
i do not see Zimbabwe penetrating the market unless it meets
Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi urged Zimbabwe to learn more about overseas markets
before venturing in exports contracts.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese quality control expert, Yuichi Kaneko said locally
made clothes were overshadowed by products from other countries.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the problem to the absence of equipment for
process control system by which textiles are inspected at every
operational level.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese expert proposed that Zimbabwe should also
minimise manufacturing cos ts, increase the production volume and
improve quality.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and the U.N.High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office here will screen
refugees to ensure only genuine refugees stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
" Times of Zambia" today quoted Home Affairs Minister Chitalu
Sampa as saying that the move is aimed at preventing arms
smuggling by mercenaries from the war-torn neighboring countries
into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Sampa was reacting to reports that
the Department of Wildlife Services has in the past five months
confiscated 121 firearms including 70 ak47 assault rifles from
poachers in Mongu alone in western Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said refugees and rebels from Angola are suspectedly behind
the exchange of arms for food with poachers in most parts of
Western Province.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's border with some of its war-torn neighbours is too
wide to guarantee the maning of every inch by the defence forces,
said the minister.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Slows Pace for Financial Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has to slow down its pace for financial
services liberalization as previous talks failed to make
satisfactory progress, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN coordinating committee on services has postponed
negotiations on the process from June 30 until December 1998 after
six rounds of talks failed to maintain an earlier 18-month period
for negotiations as proposed by former Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders at the Bangkok summit in March this year agreed
to strengthen economic cooperation through liberalization of seven
service sectors with a three-year negotiation period ending in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Banharn sought to speed up the negotiation time frame by half
in three sectors - financial services, telecommunications and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on financial services reportedly cover a wide
range of issues from insurance, capital markets, finance and
banking and the committee could not complete the work on time with
the most controversial issue being how far ASEAN will liberalize
its money markets.
</P>
<P>
Each ASEAN member has been committed to different levels of
financial liberalization in the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Therefore they are arguing whether the degree of liberalization
will equal the WTO's level or whether ASEAN should establish its
own new standard of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Thailand reportedly wanted more liberalization in the financial
sector than specified in a WTO commitment while the Philippines
did not want liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Some Thai officials said that even a three-year time frame may
not be enough for negotiations in the services sector because the
issue is so complicated and each ASEAN member may have different
gains from liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The committee will meet again on December 18-20 to discuss the
issue of concluding negotiations in the telecommunication and
tourism sectors within 18 months.

LUSAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The gemstones firms on the
Copperbelt have called on the government to offer more incentives
to auctioneers to curb rampant smuggling of high quality gems to
the international market.
</P>
<P>
Low grade emeralds and other semi-precious gems are being put
on local auction while high quality ones are being smuggled to
the international market to fetch good money, Times of Zambia
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted AMC Minerals Corporation Operations
Manager David Schopper as saying that local emerald dealers do
not sell high quality gems to the government because of poor
incentives.
</P>
<P>
''Some of those gems auctioned fetch double the amount offered
by govenment on the international market,'' the manager said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Close Major VM Detention Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to close the
Whitehead Detention Center for Vietnamese migrants (VMs) on
January 3, 1997, Hong Kong Refugee Coordinator Brian Bresnihan
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, more than 61,000 VMs have been repatriated under
the voluntary and orderly repatriation program. By December 4,
some 7,700 VMs remained in Hong Kong, of whom approximately 1,700
were in Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
Bresnihan said the rate of repatriation has been successfully
accelerated over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
"In November alone, a total of 2,155 VMs were repatriated, the
highest monthly figure since repatriation began in 1989," he said,
adding that if the current rate of repatriation continues, it
should be possible to close all VM camps in Hong Kong by mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that in view of the declining VM population, the
authorities have decided to put the remaining VMs in the High
Island Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
The Whitehead Detention Center was first opened in January 1989
when the VM population in Hong Kong stood at about 11,000. When
the VM population reached its height of nearly 60,000 in October
1991, the center provided accommodation for about 25,000.

scheduled to be held on December 17 in New Delhi, its first such
delegation to India in the last 10 years, according to a local

The delegation is to be headed by caretaker Foreign Minister

</P>
<P>
No agreement was reached between the two countries at their

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Push for Farm Products Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will call for faster
liberalization of trade in farm products and textiles at the World
Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Singapore next week, according
to the Business Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first one after the WTO came into existence
on January 1 last year, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Karum Kittisataporn, director-general of the department, was
quoted today by the local press as saying full liberalization of
farm products and textiles has been scheduled for the year 2000,
following a step-by-step reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"Liberalization of these two items will be beneficial to
Thailand as both are key export categories," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will also propose an extension of the time frame for
freeing up information technology items, set for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
As this cannot be canceled, a relaxation would be sought.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on the agenda is the establishment of labor
standards.
</P>
<P>
This issue will cover worker's rights to strike, working
conditions, wages, child labor and nondiscriminatory treatment of
male and female workers.
</P>
<P>
Karum said Thailand wants these topics discussed through
International Labor Organization forums and not at the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gears up For Improved Coffee Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is
intensifying campaigns towards coffee farmers' education on the
adherence to proper husbandry practices in order to improve
coffee qualities, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Moshi in norhtern Tanzaian a few day
ago, the Managing Director of Tanzania Coffee Board (TCB), Edward
K. Sannda said that declinig coffee output and low quality was
largely occasioned by ageing coffee trees and empty spaces left
by trees which have died out of neglect of proper husbandry
practice.
</P>
<P>
He said that TCB is co-opeating with other institutions such
as Coffee Management Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Coffee Association to stem out the problem.
</P>
<P>
Sannda outlined measures, whose implementation was already
underway, as the production of videos for coffee farmers
education and external market promotion, relevant posters and
booklets covering standard husbandry processing and discipline in
condcting descent coffee business.
</P>
<P>
Maximum age for mild Arabica coffee to deliver at optimum
levels is around 40 years and 50 years. Sannda said most coffee
trees in Tanzania, particularly in Kilimanjaro area and partly in
Arusha are past that age.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the important measure taken by the TCB is
to produce seedlings for replacement and infilling. Due to
limited resources, the current annual seedling production of
500,000 plants are far below the requirement of 5 million, Sannda
said.
</P>
<P>
National annual coffee output in Tanzania has for years

<HEADLINE> China's Shipbuilding Plan Aims High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China will have a ten percent
share in the international shipbuilding market by the year 2000, a
rise from five percent in 1995, to become one of the world's
leading shipbuilding countries.
</P>
<P>
The information is included in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) for the country's shipbuilding industry, which was
formally announced during a work meeting of the China State
Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Wang Rongsheng, general manager of CSSC, said in his report
that his corporation is expected to achieve a combined industrial
output value of 30 billion yuan by the year 2000, double the
figure of last year, representing an annual increase of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
And CSSC's shipbuilding capacity and output will reach four and
three million tons, respectively, Wang notes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, ship exports will account for two
thirds of the company's annual shipbuilding output. The export
value of new ships, repaired ships, and machinery and electronic
products is expected to reach 1.2 to 1.5 billion US dollars,
making the ship industry a pillar export of the country.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts should be made by CSSC to upgrade its ability to
design and build large ships, develop high and new technology, and
produce highly-efficiency ships that are profitable, Wang said,
adding that by the year 2000, at least 80 percent of the
shipbuilding raw materials and major equipment will be supplied
domestically, not imported.
</P>
<P>
The number of unprofitable enterprises will be reduced to less
than ten percent of CSSC's total. Also in the year 2000, the
corporation's aggregate profits and taxes will amount to three
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
CSSC's shipbuilding output, export tonnage, share in the
international market, and foreign-currency earnings are expected
to have another double increase by the year 2010, above the figure
reported in 2000, Wang told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), the company's
combined shipbuilding output reached 6.76 million tons, up 24
percent on average annually, bringing its total industrial output
value to 58.8 billion yuan.

LUSAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Five Zambian agro-marketing
companies are carrying out feasibility studies at the cost of 85
million Kwacha (68,000 U.S.Dollars) to tap sisal potential in Ndola
rural of Copperbelt Province.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Sisal products will be used side by side with synthetic bags which
are produced by kabwe industrial fabrics.
</P>
<P>
The project will benefit local millers, input marketing firms and
farmers, all of whom have shown interest and support to the project.
</P>
<P>
The firms involved are engaged in export of packaging materials
and other finished local goods to the regions of the southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Offers Help to Develop Palm Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, a leading
producer and exporter of palm oil in the world, is willing to help
countries with suitable land and agro-climatic conditions to grow
their own oil palm, Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik
said today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is willing to share whatever benefits from the trade
in palm oil with consumer countries, the minister, just back from
official visits to Mexico, Ecuador and Brazil, said in a statement
issued here.
</P>
<P>
He said he took the opportunity to encourage these countries to
consider growing oil palm in view of the bright prospects for the
palm oil industry in the future.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is ready to provide the "necessary technical know-how
and expertise" in regard to managing the plantations and setting
up processing and refining facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 4 million hectares have been identified as suitable for
oil palm cultivation in Brazil, particularly in the Para and
Amazonas states, as climatic conditions there are almost similar
to Malaysia's, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the three-nation trip, in recognition of
the vast potentials of the Latin American region for palm oil
cultivation, he looked into possibilities for joint ventures in
the palm oil industry.
</P>
<P>
During the visits, the minister assured these countries that
Malaysia could be relied upon to supply quality palm oil while its
palm oil production would increase to 8 million tons by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
He said the phenomenal growth of Malaysia's palm oil played a
vital role in stabilizing prices of vegetable oil in the world
where demand for oils and fats is expected to increase from the
current 85 million tons to 116 million tons by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Convene Telecom Meeting in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States will seek a
consensus to revive the global telecommunications talks at a
special meeting in Singapore next Monday when the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference opens here.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported today that 35 trade ministers and
representatives of the WTO and the World Bank have been invited to
the closed-door meeting, which will be chaired by Acting U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on liberalizing the global basic
telecommunications market were extended to early next year after
the Geneva-based negotiators failed to forge an agreement by an
original deadline in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The special meeting in Singapore next Monday aims to help
determine whether an accord to open up the global
telecommunications market, which is estimated to be worth 550
billion U.S. dollars, could be reached by the new deadline of
February 15, 1997, said Chairman of the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission Reed Hundt.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a "watershed meeting" which the United
States saw as an opportunity for launching efforts to build a
global information highway under the WTO umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the U.S.-organized meeting seems to have the
blessings of the WTO, as it will be held on Monday afternoon when
there is no formal program on the WTO schedule.
</P>
<P>
After Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong opened the WTO
Ministerial Conference on Monday morning, the first plenary
session is to last until lunch time.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 trade ministers are expected to attend the
inaugural WTO Ministerial Conference which runs between December 9
and 13.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Vows to End Poverty by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in north
China is launching an ambitious program to eradicate poverty by
the year 2000 which relies on the development of pillar
industries, construction of infrastructures and comprehensive use
of agro-resources.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the province will elevate the per-capita
income of its 3.5 million relatively poor people to 1,680 yuan by
1999.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the provincial government will earmark more than 4.5
billion yuan in the next three years to further the
poverty-elimination drive; bank loans will also be slated for the
program.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the local government argued that Hebei has the
favorable conditions necessary to lift its poor population out of
their plight: the increased input of the central government,
support from society at large, and the buildup of the province's
economic strength in recent years.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, 3.56 million people in Hebei
Province overcame poverty, thanks to redoubled efforts from all
walks of life.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the program, the province will also seek foreign
investment in the poor areas.

<HEADLINE> NTT to Agree on Breakup Plan with Posts Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry of Japan and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT)
are expected to reach an agreement on the NTT's split soon, the
Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and the NTT are likely to decide to split the NTT
into one long-distance and two regional carriers under a holding
company in fiscal 1998, Kyodo quoted government sources as saying
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the split depends on the lifting of a holding company ban
which limits the concentration of business power.
</P>
<P>
Under the split plan, the long-distance carrier will be allowed
to enter international telecommunications service to compete with
U.S. and European companies.
</P>
<P>
While seeking to revise the antimonopoly law to lift the
holding company ban, the ministry and the NTT will also ask the
Finance Ministry to introduce a corporate tax on a consolidated
basis, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current tax system of Japan, affiliated companies pay
corporate tax separately. If taxed on consolidated income, they
would pay less tax because they offset a profit at one company
with a loss at another.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and the NTT have been at odds over the NTT's
breakup for about 15 years as the ministry insists on
reorganization of the NTT to introduce competitive principles
while NTT is opposed to the breakup.

<P>
JINAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 687 villages in east
China's Shandong Province had each achieved an annual income of
100 million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars) or more in 1995,
according to the provincial statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
The average yearly income of these rich villages, accounting
for 0.77 percent of the province's total number of villages, was
198.23 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, their per-capita net income reached 3,070.5 yuan,
much higher than the province's average.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, these villages have similar
characteristics, including strong collective economic power and
well-developed secondary and tertiary industries. Most of them are
in the province's coastal areas and have joint ventures or
enterprises solely funded by foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is one of the most developed provinces in China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Chief Rejects Immigration Probe Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno Wednesday turned down a Republican congressman's request for
an independent counsel to investigate U.S. immigration process.
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Bill Zeliff, chairman of a House
subcommittee on national security, wrote to Reno in October asking
an independent counsel be named to investigate whether a program
called Citizenship USA was improperly rushing immigrants with
criminal records through the citizenship process.
</P>
<P>
In a letter Wednesday to Zeliff, Acting Assistant Attorney
General John Keeney said Reno "has determined that the information
you provided does not provide a specific and credible basis for
concluding that there are grounds to investigate" whether an
offense had been committed.
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires Reno to ask a three-judge panel for an
independent counsel only when "specific" and "credible"
allegations are made against a top federal official.
</P>
<P>
In the closing days of the presidential election, some
Republicans charged that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) was speeding up naturalization process so that as
many new Democrats as possible could vote for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But in October the INS defended its efforts of accelerating
processing of immigrants' citizenship applications, saying it did
not lower the standards of immigrant naturalization.
</P>
<P>
The immigration agency denied media reports that about 10
percent of the immigrants had open FBI files and some had criminal
records.
</P>
<P>
The INS started a program, Citizenship USA, in August, 1995 to
"reduce a huge backlog of citizenship applications", an INS
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said through new hiring and improved management, the INS
processed up to 1.3 immigrants in the program's first year and
swore in 1.1 million new U.S. citizens without reducing the
standards.
</P>
<P>
Keeney told Zeliff that the Justice Department concluded that
"there is no specific and credible evidence" that top officials
participated in criminal activity "within the context of
Citizenship USA."
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the INS announced Wednesday it had
tightened up naturalization procedures.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the INS said that as of November 29 it would
expand efforts "to ensure that no individual is naturalized
without the verified completion of a fingerprint check by the
(FBI)."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has also hired an independent management
consulting and accounting firm to oversee an INS audit of
naturalization cases from September, 1995 through 1996, and the
INS plans a "comprehensive re-engineering" of the naturalization
program.

<P>
KATHMANDU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
left here for home today at the end of a two-day state visit to
Nepal, thus winding up his eight-day South Asia tour.
</P>
<P>
King of Nepal Birendra saw the Chinese president off at the
airport where a farewell ceremony was held with a salute of 21
guns.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Nepal at noon Wednesday after paying state
visits to India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour stay in Nepal, he held talks with King
Birendra and met with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and
opposition leader Man Mohan Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
Before his South Asia tour starting on November 28, Jiang
attended the Informal Leadership Conference of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation and paid a state visit to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He is the first Chinese head of state to visit the Philippines
and India since China established diplomatic ties with the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the three South Asia countries, Jiang
repeatedly stressed that the Chinese government and people stand
ready to join hands with their counterparts in other countries to
establish and solidify friendly cooperative relationship.
</P>
<P>
China sincerely hopes to constantly enhance cooperation on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and strives
to work together with other countries into the next century for
lasting peace and stability in the region, the Chinese president
said at a state banquet held in his honor by the Nepali king here
last night.
</P>
<P>
Bidding farewell to the Chinese president at the airport today
were also the Nepali prime minister, chief justice, parliamentary
leaders, heads of political parties, ministers and other

GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- This capital of South China's
Guangdong Province has made special efforts to protect the
interests of investors from Taiwan, ensuring healthy and stable
development in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has issued a series of regulations to
bring local administrative departments under legal control, in a
bid to prevent illegal levying of fees and guarantee the smooth
operation of Taiwan-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local officials have been trained to ensure that the
work goes smoothly, and municipal leading officials have held
regular talks with investors from the island province to get to
know their complaints.
</P>
<P>
The city government has also helped Taiwan investors to meet
higher authorities in Beijing and to get to know more about
China's policy of opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts have paid off. Up to now, some 1,000 enterprises
have been set up in Guangzhou with a total of 1.17 billion US
dollars of promised investment from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
an increasing number of large Taiwan-based companies are
entering Guangzhou, according to local officials.

Chinese mainland that features goods shipped to Taiwan is
scheduled for the Xiamen Special Economic Zone from April 6 to 10

Straits, and to promote sales of mainland products in Taiwan and
in the rest of the world, said the organizers.
</P>

The fair has the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and

discussions of improved mail, air, and shipping services.
</P>

approved by Taiwan Authorities. There are more than 4,000
export-oriented enterprises in China that have been given the
right to deal directly with overseas firms in imports or exports.

<HEADLINE> Rosenborg Beats AC Milan to Move into Last Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Arrigo Sacchi's return to coach
AC Milan didn't help the club retain the glory as the Milan
powerhouse lost 2-1 to Rosenborg in the Champions Cup soccer
tournament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milan's hope to win the Cup for four times since 1989 was
dashed at San Siro stadium Wednesday night as midfielder Vegard
Heggem headed home the winner at the 70th minute which put the
Norwegian team into the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
With nine points out of three wins and three losses in the
qualifying round, Rosenborg finished second to group winner Porto.
</P>
<P>
AC Milan, which could have qualified through a draw against the
Norwegians, finished third and was eliminated with a record of two
wins, three losses and one draw.
</P>
<P>
Sacchi, who rejoined his former club Monday after resigning as
coach of Italy's national team, said after the match he could not
produce any wonder in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Porto of Portugal handed a 2-0 defeat to Gothenburg of Sweden,
cruising into the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, Manchester United became the first English club
since 1985 to reach the Champions Cup quarter-final after scoring
a one-sided 2-0 victory over Rapid Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Goals by Ryan Giggs and Eric Cantona ensured the club's win at
the Ernst Happel stadium.
</P>
<P>
With defending champion Juventus beating Fenerbahce 2-0 in
Turin, the result in Vienna meant Manchester United climbed above
the Turks in the Group C standings to make it to a quarter-final
game against FC Porto in March.
</P>
<P>
In Auxerre, Steve Marlet scored one goal and set up another to
put the host team in the quarter-finals after beating Glasgow's
Ranger 2-1.
</P>
<P>
On the verge of elimination two weeks ago, Auxerre finished
first in Group A with a record of 4-2. Rangers were 1-5.
</P>
<P>
In the other match for Group A, Ajax of Amsterdam beat
Grasshoppers of Zurich 1-0, to qualify. Ajax ended up also 4-2.
</P>
<P>
German club Dortmund defeated Steau Bucharest 5-3 in a Group B
Wednesday to reach the last eight.
</P>
<P>
An 83rd-minute goal by Yugoslav midfielder Milinko Pantic
clinched a 1-0 victory and a quarter-final slot for Atletico de
Madrid against Poland's Widzew Lodz.
</P>
<P>
Pantic scored the goal on a free kick from 20 meters after a
balanced match.
</P>
<P>
The result left Atletico with 13 points in Group B from four
wins, a draw and one defeat.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Delhi to Sign Water-Sharing Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India will sign a
treaty on December 10, ensuring 35,000 cusecs of water from the
Ganges to Bangladesh during the dry season from January to April,
officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to leave
Dhaka on December 9 for New Delhi to hold a summit with her Indian
counterpart Deve Gowda, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The summit between heads of the two governments will be
followed by the signing of a historic accord, resolving the
nagging issue of the Ganges water sharing that has been an
irritant in relations between the two close neighbors.
</P>
<P>
They, however, declined to say whether it would be a short-term
or a long-term agreement.
</P>
<P>
The first agreement on Ganges water-sharing between the two
countries was signed in 1975 following India's decision to run the
feeder canal of the Farakka barrage, which restricts the river's
flow.
</P>
<P>
Later on, Dhaka and Delhi signed several water agreements.
Under the last agreement, which expired in 1988, Bangladesh
received 34,500 cusecs during the dry season.

<HEADLINE> NTT to Agree on Breakup Plan with Posts Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry of Japan and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT)
are expected to reach an agreement on the NTT's split soon, the
Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and the NTT are likely to decide to split the NTT
into one long-distance and two regional carriers under a holding
company in fiscal 1998, Kyodo quoted government sources as saying
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the split depends on the lifting of a holding company ban
which limits the concentration of business power.
</P>
<P>
Under the split plan, the long-distance carrier will be allowed
to enter international telecommunications service to compete with
U.S. and European companies.
</P>
<P>
While seeking to revise the antimonopoly law to lift the
holding company ban, the ministry and the NTT will also ask the
Finance Ministry to introduce a corporate tax on a consolidated
basis, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current tax system of Japan, affiliated companies pay
corporate tax separately. If taxed on consolidated income, they
would pay less tax because they offset a profit at one company
with a loss at another.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and the NTT have been at odds over the NTT's
breakup for about 15 years as the ministry insists on
reorganization of the NTT to introduce competitive principles
while NTT is opposed to the breakup.

<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists believe that
global warming, particularly higher winter temperatures, will
continue to the first half of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a key research project underway since the early 1990s,
nearly 100 scientists in China have concluded that the average
global temperature has risen about 0.5 degrees Centigrade over the
beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, led by Ye Duzheng, an aerophysicist and
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the
increase rate of gases that cause the greenhouse effect will
accelerate, so much so that the earth's warming trend will
continue in the coming dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Affected by natural changes and human activities, the average
winter temperature in northern China by the year 2030 will be 1 to
1.5 degrees Centigrade higher than the present figure, according
to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the increase rate of summer temperatures
will be lower than that in winter.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that the warming effect, especially rising
temperatures in winter, will result in a series of changes to
nature and human society. The production of wheat will rise, while
corn will yield a lower overall volume.

BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua)-- Chinese scientists have
developed a new generation of range-finders on satellites that are
able to estimate the distance of an object 20,000 kilometers away,
with an error of only two centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said that they
are using pulsar laser technology developed in the mid 1960s, to
measure distances from the earth surface to satellites or the
moon, to develop range-finding aboard satellites.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Shanghai Observatory and those from
satellite ground stations in Changchun, in the northwest, in Wuhan
in central China, in Kunming in the southwest, and in Beijing,
north China, have had some good results in monitoring earth
rotation parameters, plate movement, gravity, and sea levels.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 scientists from some 20 countries including the
United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Australia,
Russia, and China gathered at the Shanghai Observatory recently to
discuss the latest developments in satellite range-finding.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Eat More Fruit, Vegetables, Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadians have added more fruit,
vegetables and fish to their diet over the past two decades,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
The change is likely the result of concerns over health and
lifestyle and increased demand for various ethnic foods, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, each Canadian ate an average of 128 kilograms of
fruit, mostly fresh, 31 kilograms more compared with those eaten
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption of apples, the country's major fruit
crop, was 14 kilograms in 1995, about two kilograms more than the
amount two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
Canadians have also been turning to various tropical fruits
such as kiwi, guavas, mangos and papayas. Consumption of these
surpassed three kilograms per capita in the last few years, said
the federal fact-gathering agency.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, each Canadian consumed 172 kilograms of vegetables,
compared with about 150 kilograms 20 years ago. More than 40
percent of those vegetables were potatoes.
</P>
<P>
Also high among consumer preferences were carrots, lettuce,
onions and tomatoes, totaling almost 32 kilograms per person.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of broccoli, Brussels sprouts and kale, associated
with cancer prevention, has remained steady at almost three
kilograms per person after a significant surge during the 1980s,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canadians are also eating more fish. Consumption reached more
than eight kilograms per person during each of the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
This increase was due mainly to the on-going demand for
diversifying sources of low-fat protein, and the diet preferences
of a growing Asian population, it added.

OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan Foreign Minister
Eduardo Stein will pay a working visit to Canada Thursday,
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to Mr. Stein's visit so that we can strengthen
our bilateral ties and continue our discussions on developments in
the Guatemalan peace process," Axworthy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Besides talks with Axworthy, Stein will also meet Minister for
International Cooperation Don Boudria and Secretary of State for
Latin America and Africa Christine Stewart.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions will focus on the latest developments in
Guatemala and what the international community can do for it.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy visited Guatemala in September to review a plan for
the Guatemalan government and the National Revolutionary Unity
guerillas to sign a peace accord on December 29.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began negotiations in 1991 under the mediation of
the United Nations, and reached a fundamental agreement on the
future political structure on September 19. They also decided to
sign a peace accord in December.

<HEADLINE> Young Scientists Get Promotions In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), the country's main scientific institute, has promoted more
than 1,600 young researchers to full professor or associate
professor in the past 10 years to encourage outstanding young
scientists by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the academy announced promotions to full
professor for 66 more young researchers whose average age is 36,
the youngest of which is only 28.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these young professors have become the backbone of
China's basic research," an academy spokesman said. Two were
elected to membership in the CAS and one to the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, the country's highest academic honors.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six have been appointed directors or deputy-directors of
research institutes and the rest have become heads of various
research groups, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), China lost
almost a decade of trained scientists, so that most Chinese
researchers working on the frontiers of science are in their mid
to late 50s.
</P>
<P>
"Before the year 2000, the academy needs to produce at least
2,000 leading young scientists and 100 young international leaders
in science fill the vacancies left by aging and retiring
scientists," the CAS spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, under the rules of the old system, which is
still in practice in most of the country's research institutions
and universities, researchers and lecturers are not promoted to
professor until they are in their 50s.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
United Nations Boutros Boutros-Ghali decided today to suspend his
candidacy for the top U.N. post for the time being, said the
U.N. Security Council president.
</P>
<P>
Council President Francesco Paolo Fulci of Italy told reporters
that Boutros-Ghali "has indicated to me that he intends to suspend
his candidacy for the time being."
</P>
<P>
Fulci urged the African countries to propose other candidates
as soon as possible for the council to consider.
</P>
<P>
He said the council will discuss the issue Friday, but so far,
it has not received any other candidature for the post.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council submits its choice of the U.N. chief
to the U.N. General Assembly for election.
</P>
<P>
But U.N. spokesman Sylvana Foa said the suspension did not mean
Boutros-Ghali has withdrawn from seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
Foa said that Boutros-Ghali just didn't want to put up his name
for a second vote. In the first round of voting on November 19,
Boutros-Ghali got 14 votes in favor, with the United States
casting a lone veto against him in the 15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
She said Boutros-Ghali remained a candidacy for the
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief wanted the Security Council to clarify the
situation before having another vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
The failure of communication was maybe caused by language
problems, she explained.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a White House spokesman, David Johnson, said,
"We welcome his decision to suspend his candidacy because it's
going to allow the names of other well-qualified African
candidates to come forward and be considered by the Security
Council."
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said the U.S. would not be pushing the candidacies
of other people for the job.

<P>
CARACAS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Juvenile delinquency has been
increasingly troubling Venezuela's capital, which saw a seven
percent rise in juvenile arrests in the early half of 1996 over
the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,500 youngsters were arrested in Caracas in the
first six months, accounting for a quarter of the the nation's
underage crimes during that period, or seven percent up from its
18 percent proportion in 1995, the Judicial Technical Police said
lately.
</P>
<P>
The crime rate for children surged by 27 percent over the past
three years, while that of adults dropped in an equal proportion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report by a non-governmental organization, entitled
"We are news 1996", said that the principal reasons for juvenile
delinquency were collapse of family nucleus and child abuse.
</P>
<P>
School dropout, juvenile unemployment, impunity, drug addiction
and absence of adequate legislation contributed to the worsening
of adolescent crimes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Major felonies this year included theft and robbery, causing
bodily injury and drugs.
</P>
<P>
The cases of underage homicide, which represented five percent
of the total crimes, grew six percent in the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks to Tap Indian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai high-ranking officials are
considering tapping the Indian market for garment exports, the
Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai Choonhavan, the prime minister's special adviser for
economic and foreign affairs, pointed out that there is a market
of some 200 million middle-class people with a strong purchasing
power among India's population of 900 million.
</P>
<P>
The development of Thailand's southern seaboard would serve the
new market opening in the Indian Ocean region, Chaticai said.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai initiated the southern seaboard project as well as
the policy of turning the battlefields of Indochina into
marketplace when he was prime minister from 1988-1991.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn said the India project
would be a good occasion for Chatichai to apply his new mandate as
the prime minister's special adviser for economic and foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
A mission to India by the special adviser would be helpful by
its informal nature and it would not bind Thailand to any
commitments, Prachuab said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Israel to Honor Accords With Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly today adopted a resolution urging parties of the
Middle East crisis, especially Israel, to honor existing
agreements to accelerate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel voted against the resolution,
which called for a peaceful settlement of the question of
Palestine. A total of 152 countries voted in favor of it and four
countries, Costa Rica, Fiji, Marshall Islands and Micronesia,
abstained.
</P>
<P>
Achieving a final and peaceful settlement of the question of
Palestine, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, was imperative
for the attainment of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the
Middle East, said sponsors of the resolution. The sponsors
included Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia and 14 other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed the need for the realization of the
inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, primarily the right
to self-determination, the withdrawal of Israel from the
Palestinian territory occupied since the 1967 Middle East war and
the resolution of the problem of Palestine refugees.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the member states to provide economic and
technical assistance to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States also cast the only negative votes
against another four relevant resolutions. They dealt with
publications on the question of Palestine, promotion of the rights
of the Palestinian people and developing a U.N. information system
on Palestine and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution on Golan Heights, the Assembly declared that
Israel had failed to comply with Security Council Resolution 497
adopted in 1981, and called on Israel to rescind its decision on
November 11, 1981, to annex the occupied Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was adopted by 84-2 with 71 abstentions,
also demanded that Israel withdraw completely from the occupied
Golan Heights and retreat to the lines it held prior to the
outbreak of the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel cast the only negative vote on another resolution,
adopted by 148 to one, with 13 abstentions, determining that
Israel's decision in 1980 to impose its laws and jurisdiction and
administration on Jerusalem was illegal, null and void.
</P>
<P>
Differences also emerged on a resolution evaluating the Middle
East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, sponsored by Norway, Russia and the United
States, was opposed by Iran, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Samir Mouarak of Lebanon complained that, while admitting that
no progress had been made since last year, the sponsors of the
draft ignored the fact that the peace process was in danger
because of Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Abou-Hadid of Syria said it did not refer to relevant Security
Council resolutions. "Syria could not welcome a peace process
which was not based on the principle of land for peace and
international laws," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's public employees
resumed work today after a 16-day nationwide strike, following a
move by the government to start paying bonuses established by an
official decree months ago.
</P>
<P>
The government also promised to meet union leaders on labor
issues.
</P>
<P>
The president of the National Federation of Public Employees
(FEDENEP), Carlos Borges, made a call to public sector workers to
return to work, saying union leaders and government officials
would resume talks in the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
The FEDENEP and the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV),
the nation's largest union, will meet with Finance Minister Luis
Raul Matos Azocar and Chief of the Office of Planning and
Coordination for the Presidency, Teodoro Petkoff, to discuss a
collective contract for public workers.
</P>
<P>
The government has begun to pay off food and transportation
bonuses it approved in February. But it has not paid 1.3 million
public workers a total of 100 billion bolivars (about 215 million
U.S. dollars) owing.
</P>
<P>
Public employees declared an indefinite general strike on
November 19 to protest the government's failure to pay. It was the
third major public sector strike since May.
</P>
<P>
Two nationwide strikes broke out in late May and late August
when hundreds of thousands of public employees stayed off the job
to protest the government's delay in pay increases.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the government pledged a 25 percent hike in
salaries and a bonus worth eight months' pay to compensate public
workers, who were severely hurt by high inflation. But the
government has been slow to fulfil its undertaking.

<HEADLINE> China to Draw More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China will draw 49.5 billion US
dollars in actual direct foreign investment in 1997, up 15 percent
from this year, the State Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, China attracted overseas
capital of 19.64 billion US dollars, jumping 20 percent from the
same period last year. By the end of June, overseas investment
channeled into China had surpassed 154 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report of the center, quoted by today's China Daily, said
that next year direct overseas investment to China will keep
its steady growth while the investment structure will undergo some
favorable changes.
</P>
<P>
It said overseas investors will display strengthened interest
in China's underdeveloped western and central regions which are
becoming development priorities of China.
</P>
<P>
Increased capital channeled into the regions will include new
investment as well as investment transferred by a proportion of
the profit earned in existing overseas-funded enterprises in
eastern and coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
While still relatively backward in its overall infrastructure
construction, China's western and central regions feature abundant
natural resources, lucrative markets and comparatively inexpensive
labor and land-use costs.
</P>
<P>
Recently, overease investors in such regions were allowed to
sell all their products in China instead of having to export part
of their production.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed out that the overseas investment size
per project will continue to expand, considering that
multinational companies are accelerating their steps in launching
ventures in China.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Herdsmen Get Help to Live Through Harsh Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government has
decided to take measures to help the herdsmen live through the
harsh winter, which was made more difficult by this year's heavier
snowfalls and lower temperature.
</P>
<P>
The government has ordered the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
Ministry, the Finance Ministry, the State Bank and the State
Emergency Commission to work out measures to solve the problems
being faced by the herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred million tugriks (about 500,000 U.S. dollars) will
be allocated from the government budget to help transport forage
grass and feed to areas hit by heavy snowfall.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will provide about 10 million
dollars in loan to guarantee the oil and fuel supply for disaster
rescue.
</P>
<P>
Snowfalls in provinces of Hovd in the west, Sukhbaatar in the
east and Tov in the central part have been as deep as 25-70
centimeters and even one meter in some specific places, which have
held up the traffic and threatened lives of the herdsmen and their
livestock.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 household of herdsmen and nearly 2 million
domestic animals needed to be moved to safer places.

<HEADLINE> 1996 The Worst Year for Air Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- 1996 is being described as
the "darkest year" in global civil aviation -- with 2187 people
killed in 35 air crashes in the year to November.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of 1985 ranked second in the history of civil
aviation, with 1,800 killed in crashes. Third worst was 1995 with
1200 killed in 65 air crashes.
</P>
<P>
Swedish newspapers attributed the increased death toll to a few
large air crashes in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The crash of a United States TWA plane, bound for France, which
exploded in the air near New York in July killed 230 people. A
Russian passenger plane crashed over the island of Spetsbergen,
Norway in August, killing 140 people.
</P>
<P>
In November alone, A Nigerian plane crashed near the country's
capital of Lagos, killing 141 people. A Kazakhstan's plane
collided with a Saudi Arabian Boeing in the air over India,
claiming all of the 349 on board, and a hijacked Ethiopian
passenger aircraft crashed into the Indian Ocean and 125 died.
</P>
<P>
The death toll this year includes 300 killed at a Zaire ground
market by a crashing Russian airfreighter.
</P>
<P>
However, aircraft remain the safest transport per capita as the
number of passengers carried has jumped to 1.2 to 1.3 billion,
according to Swedish aviation officials.

<HEADLINE> Central America in Favor of Open Skies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Tourism officials in five
Central American countries decided here today to seek open skies
to boost tourism, in their regions.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a meeting of tourist officials from
Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Sponsor of the meeting, the Secretariat of Central American
Tourist Integration (SITCA), proposed that these countries sign
aviation agreements with the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to SITCA, tourism in Central America brought in more
than seven billion U.S. dollars between 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
It ranks fourth as a generator of hard currency in the region,
following the exports of bananas, coffee and sugar.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Tourism Minister Richard Alway said open skies,
which allows outside airlines free access, would benefit the
economy in the region since there was still a great potential for
the development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be submitted to Central American presidents
for consideration during a tourism summit scheduled for the
beginning of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Grain Output Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, a
major grain producer in China, is expected to harvest a record 27
billion kg of grain this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 500 million kg more than last year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
Anhui suffered from low temperatures and rainy weather in
February and March this year, which hampered the growth of
summer grain crops.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain in June also hindered the harvest, and floods ruined
the crops on about 410,000 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
But the efforts of farmers and local governments to combat the
disasters minimized the damage.
</P>
<P>
The spread of advanced farming techniques in the province was also
a favorable factor in the good harvest.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 new farming techniques were applied to farmland
in the province this year.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A highway connecting this
scenic city and the port city of Ningbo has opened to traffic,
as part of the east China province of Zhejiang's plan to expand
its expressway network.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway is the first main section
designated by a program worked out by the provincial authorities
at the beginning of this year, which aims at building more than
1,000 km of expressways and connecting them into a network
in eight years' time.
</P>
<P>
Other sections included in the program are those from Hangzhou
to Quzhou via Jinhua, from Hangzhou to Taizhou and from Ningbo to
Wenzhou via Taizhou.
</P>
<P>
Construction on some of these sections has already
started. Officials say Zhejiang will try to find multiple fund
sources for the project.
</P>
<P>
Located in east China's open coastal belt, Zhejiang's economic
growth ranks among the highest in the country. Rapid economic
growth has resulted in surging traffic, with a daily traffic flow
of over 10,000 motor vehicles on every major highway.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990 Zhejiang has invested more than 10 billion yuan in
renovating existing roads and building over 4,000 km of new
ones. At present, the province has a total highway length of
34,000 km, a density far exceeding the national average.

<HEADLINE> More People Escape from Poverty in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- More and more people are
leaving poverty behind in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, which has the country's biggest population of
poor people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that within the autonomous region the number of
people living under the state-set poverty line had declined to six
million by the end of 1995, down from eight million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed the remarkable shrinking of
the poor population to an aid-the-poor project implemented across the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that regional governments have encouraged local people
to grow cash crops of all sorts, adding that infrastructure
construction also plays a pivotal role in promoting the local economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the average annual income of
peasants in the autonomous region's 49 poor counties surpassed
1,000 yuan in 1995, a sharp increase from 542 yuan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the autonomous region is still poor, its
rich reserves of minerals and the country's favorable policies are
certain to help all the local people shake off poverty in the
near future.

ABU DHABI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United
Arab Emirates Wednesday played to a 1-1 draw in the opening match
of the 11th Asian Cup soccer tournament in Zayed Sports City, Abu
Dhabi today.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, one of the best Asian teams, started the match
with a dominance.
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes after kick-off, the South Koreans earned their
first goal when striker Hwang Sun-Hong, after receiving the ball
from the midfield, dribbled to the left corner of the penalty area
and shot into the net near the right pole.
</P>
<P>
The UAE players then intensified attack and Sayed Mubarak made
it 1-1 by finding the net from an acute angle 21 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Roosted for by a 30,000-strong crowd, the UAE players
constantly pressed the South Koreans in the second half but could
not convert a good chance several minutes before time.
</P>
<P>
"We worked hard throughout the match, I'm satisfied with the
result," said UAE coach Tomislav Ivic, a Croatian who had just
assumed the post last December.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will meet Indonisia Saturday while UAE will fight
Kuwait on December 7.

BONN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- American Andre Agassi failed to
end the year on a more positive note after losing to Australian
Mark Woodforde 6-3, 6-4 in the Grand Slam Cup tennis tournament in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
Agassi made a brief appearance in Wednesday, offering little
resistance in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Mark Woodforde, who had failed to
win a game in their last encounter and had never beaten Agassi in
three previous matches.
</P>
<P>
The last time Agassi played Woodforde, he beat the Australian
doubles specialist 6-0, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
While Agassi bowed out, Jakob Hlasek took a break from

</P>
<P>
Hlasek was only an alternate for the event and had already
announced his retirement. But the withdrawal of five players,
including top-ranked Pete Sampras, opened a spot for Hlasek.

<HEADLINE> Session Held to Make Beijing More Livable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Beijing has been making efforts to further improve the city's
cultural and physical environment as well as residents' adherence
to laws, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the municipal government solved a number of
knotty problems concerning urban environment and city management
to bring orderly surroundings and more convenience to citizens,
Liu Jingmin, assistant to the mayor, told an ongoing session of
the 33rd Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
For example, illegal stalls scattered near universities which
occupied roads and caused disorder have been cleared up. Some 255
main urban streets have been put under regular inspection to
maintain clean appearances and order.
</P>
<P>
With the publication and implementation of the Capital
Citizen's Civilization Joint Pledge this year, various activities
have been carried out to help citizens become more aware of
environmental protection, to care for others and to abide by laws.
</P>
<P>
There so far are more than 1,900 citizens' cultural-education
schools in the city, with more than 600,000 people having taken
courses.
</P>
<P>
Competitions to construct more livable residential quarters,
villages and units have also been carried out.
</P>
<P>
Liu disclosed that a plan on building Beijing into a more
livable city in the coming five years has been mapped out, setting
targets for improving adherence to laws by citizens and improving
the city's environment, order and service trades.
</P>
<P>
The city is also planning to accelerate its cultural
development, with more emphasis on production of quality cultural
products and facilities and the carrying out of meaningful public
cultural activities, according to Liu.

PRAGUE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles, troubled by a
nagging shoulder injury, Wednesday retired after the first set of
her debut at the Komercni Banka Open tennis tournament in Brno,
the Czech Republic.

against Katerina Habsudova of Slovakia.

But as the first set entered a tie break, she appeared to
begin to favor her left shoulder.

After being beaten in the tie break 7-3, the American informed

<HEADLINE> No Quick Solution to U.S.-French Dispute Over NATO Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States expects no
quick solution to its dispute with France over who should command
NATO's southern flank, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news
briefing that it was a "very serious disagreement" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, Burns said, was unlikely to be settled at a
meeting of the 16-nation NATO foreign ministers in Brussels next
week. "I don't expect that it will be resolved by next week
because of the serious differences that exist."
</P>
<P>
The Naples-based position has always been held by an American,
but France wants a European to hold the key post, which controls
allied forces in the Mediterranean. The French demand was refused
by Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The United States position is: the Sixth Fleet is the basis of
the command... the Sixth Fleet is an American fleet, it ought to
be commanded by an American, it's always been commanded by an
American," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the United States is going to change its
position on this issue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Maradona's Plea to Avoid Prison Sentence Refused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of
Justice in Buenos Aires on Wednesday once again denied soccer star
Diego Armando Maradona's request to do community services instead
of serving prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
The highest provincial court denied a complaint appeal filed by
the defence attorney for Maradona who was charged with shooting
rubber bullets at journalists in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Hugo Wortman Jofre, one of Maradona's lawyers, said that he
will go to the supreme court of the nation as the last resort to
prevent a jail sentence for Maradona.
</P>
<P>
Complaint appeals similar to this one filed by Maradona's
defence attorney have been denied on three previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
Journalists wounded in the air rifle attack accused Maradona of
"aggravated compulsion, threats carried out by the use of arms,
repeated minor body injury, aggression and damage."
</P>
<P>
A prison sentence of four years for Maradona has been
requested.

MANAGUA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) are holding back the 100 million
U.S. dollars assigned to Nicaragua for its structural adjustment
program.
</P>
<P>
A special WB-IMF commission which is visiting Nicaragua this
week to evaluate the economic behavior of the country met with
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's economic cabinet on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Evenor Taboada, president of Nicaraguan Central Bank,
said Chamorro's government would not receive these funds because
it did not comply with the objectives and targets set by those two
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
The noncompliances included Nicaragua's failure to reach an
appropriate level of international reserves, to solve completely
the problem of property ownership and its inability to reach an
adequate level of public savings.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the next government, which will take over on
January 10, 1997, would keep negotiating with the WB and IMF and would
have future access to this money, said sources close to the

<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The labor departments of
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have raised the
minimum wage level in line with inflation and other factors, such
as local workers' average wages, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The new minimum wage level is designed to guarantee reasonable
standards of living for employees at a time when income gaps are
widening among different groups as competition for jobs intensifies.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12 municipal and provincial governments, including
those of Beijing, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Guangdong, Shanghai,
Jiangsu and Xinjiang, have fixed new wage floors after consulting
with local financial departments, trade unions and businesses,
according to the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
The other 18 provinces, including Hebei and Zhejiang, are
considering readjusting the minimum wage level, said Li Xinwang,
an official with the Comprehensive Plan and Wages Department of
the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
In general, the minimum wage should be readjusted every year in
accordance with inflation factors and should be less than the
local average wage scale and higher than local social insurance or
unemployments payouts, Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan agreed
in October to work toward an IT agreement in Singapore. The
leaders of 18 APEC members also have called for a deal. "With this
kind of support," we are quite confident a deal can be negotiated,
but the work remains to be done", Ruggiero told Xinhua before
leaving for Singapore to chair the WTO's meeting from December 9
to 13.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said that IT issue would be the first building block
toward trading in the future", adding that the global trade in IT
products came to more than 500 billion U.S. dollars in
1995. Computer hardware, software, semi-conductors and
telecommunications equipment are produced around the world and
many exporting WTO members would benefit, he said. At the same
time, importing members would see prices fall on these products.
</P>
<P>
On the significance of the WTO biennial meeting in Singapore,
Ruggiero said the meeting was "to assess the implementation of the
Uruguay Round agreement and to lay the foundation for our future
program of negotiations and reviews that will occupy our time into
the next century and beyond".
</P>
<P>
After rounds of heated consultations in Geneva, representatives
from WTO members agreed basically on 14 of 20 paragraphs in a draft
declaration for the Singapore meeting. Developing and developed
economies are divided over issues such as labor standards,
agriculture, textiles and services. The disputed issues are left for
the Singapore meeting to deal with.

<HEADLINE> Natural-Gas Project On Stage in Shanghai Pudong New Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a natural-gas
supply project in the Pudong New Area in Shanghai has started at
the area's Beicai township recently, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to help households in the area discard
coal stoves forever and use piped natural gas for heating and
cooking in around a year.
</P>
<P>
The project includes a natural-gas processing station in
Xingang township in Nanhui County, two other gas supply and
transfer stations at Beicai and Chuansha, as well as hundreds of
kilometers of gas pipelines and dozens of gas tanks.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area is expected in 1998 to become the first
user of natural gas produced in a big oil and natural gas field in
the East China Sea, where a national utilization project was
started last month.
</P>
<P>
The Pinghu gas and oil field project, initially aiming to
supply the Shanghai region with natural gas, is expected to start
to pipe 1.2 million cubic metres of natural gas daily to Pudong in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The 240-sq-km field, off Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, is the
first of its kind to be discovered and utilized in the East China
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Pinghu project, also one of the key projects listed by the
Shanghai municipal government in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), includes establishing an offshore work platform,
drilling and laying down oil and gas pipelines under the sea, and
building a natural gas processing plant in Shanghai and a crude
oil transfer station on Daishan Island close to Ningbo in Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
A joint company has been established by the Shanghai municipal
government, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, and
the China Ocean Petroleum Corp. to tap the Pinghu field.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, U.S. Resume High-Level Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and the United States today
resumed high-level talks after a bitter standoff since the Cuban
Air Force shot down two small planes owned by U.S.-based
anti-Cuban people in February.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which focused on immigration issues, was also the
first official public contact of the two arch-rivals since
U.S. President Bill Clinton's re-election last month.
</P>
<P>
Washington has imposed economic sanctions on the Caribbean
island nation since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, designed to curb the flow of Cuban refugees to the
United States, reviewed the implementation of immigration
agreements signed by the two sides in September 1994 and May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, the U.S. ended a decades-old policy of
accepting Cuban refugees rescued at sea, and agreed to issue at
least 20,000 immigrant visas each year. Havana promised to take
measures to stop the outflow of refugees.
</P>
<P>
As a ploy to nurture anti-Havana forces, the United States had
encouraged illegal immigrants from Cuba. But it was forced to
forge the accords with Havana after the U.S. shore was flooded by
more than 30,000 Cuban rafters in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting at Havana's convention center, Cuba accused
the United States of violating the agreements by failing to return
hijackers of airplanes and ships. The U.S. side argued that the
hijackers were prosecuted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The most noted case involved Cuban Air Force Lieutenant Colonel
Jose Fernandez Pupo, who hijacked a passenger plane to the
U.S. naval base at Guantanamo in eastern Cuba in July.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban side at the meeting was headed by Ricardo Alarcon,
president of Cuba's People's Power (parliament), and the
U.S. delegation was led by John Hamilton, undersecretary of state
for Central America and the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> Ruggiero: It Only Makes Sense to Include China in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Ruggiero said, "China was
the world's 11th largest exporter in 1995, shipping nearly 150 billion
U.S. dollars in merchandise around the world. Its economic power is
substantial and growing."
</P>
<P>
"It only makes sense to include such an important country in
the WTO," Ruggiero said, adding "It is my sincere hope that
discussions in 1997 will greatly enhance the prospects of China's
admission to the organization."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ruggiero stressed, "Candidates for
accession must be willing to accept WTO rules and disciplines if
they are to become members. This is not always easy to do
politically, but it is the price for membership."
</P>
<P>
However, "China's accession should be considered on commercial,
rather than political terms," said Ruggiero.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt took advantage of the
absence of Nigeria, Africa's top ranked nation, to win the 12th
African Table Tennis titles here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's team final, Ashraf Sobhi had the toughest match,
beating Ravi Bhurtun of Mauritius 13-21, 21-19, 21-6. His
compatriots Sherif Diaa and Sherif el Saket beat Rajessen Desscann
(21-17, 21-16) and Didier Hao Thinvoon (21-9, 21-19) of Mauritius,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
This was Bhurtun's first defeat in the 11-team tournament.
Sobhi proved technically superior and displayed an all-round game
plan with delicate placings and hitting unplayable winning returns.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians women's team also took the title by beating
Ethiopia 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Sherin Elalefe, Bassint Osman and Shimaa Abdelzez proved too
good for Radia Deleteba and Nebiat Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Deleteba and Ahmed teamed up also for the doubles rubber and
although they took the first game 21-14, they were unable to repel
the powerful Egyptian duo of Shimaa Abdelazez and Bassint Osman.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has not arrived here due to flight delays.

<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Changzhou City in east China's
Jiangsu Province will list 270 new projects for foreign
investment, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new projects will focus on infrastructural construction and

economic and trade ties with the ROK.
</P>
<P>
In Weihai, business people from the ROK have signed agreements

<HEADLINE>   WTO Offers Developing Nations Equal Power, Says Ruggiero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-general Renato Ruggiero said here today that the WTO is a
unique international forum for the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On what benefits the WTO could bring to the developing countries,
Ruggiero told Xinhua that "Unlike some other organizations, there is no
weighted voting in the WTO, no inner and outer councils." He
explained, "We reach decisions by consensus and each country's vote is
given the same consideration."
</P>
<P>
Besides, "our dispute settlement mechanism permits even the
smallest country to challenge the trade practices of giant economies.
We've already seen several examples where developing countries take on
these giants and win," said Ruggiero in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua. Up to now, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism has taken 64
cases.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said, "By providing a framework of international agreed
rules and disciplines, we enable business in the developing world to
develop an export strategy with a degree of certainty that perhaps
they may not have held before."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the dispute settlement system is "the heart of the
new WTO organization". The system "now brings enforcement capacity to
the rules and disciplines that have been part of the multilateral
trading system for 50 years". He said, "Countries no longer look to
unilateral action as the favored method of responding to trade
disputes. They know that there is a reliable approach for settling
their disagreement, one which relies on the internationally agreed
rules and disciplines of the WTO."

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves $275 Mln for Highway Project in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 275
million U.S. dollar loan to Brazil's highway project.
</P>
<P>
The sources will be used to help finance the second stage of a
project to improve and widen the Fernao Dias highway connecting
the cities of Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte.
</P>
<P>
The project with a total cost estimated at some 550 million
dollars will upgrade the two-lane road to a four-lane divided
highway, reducing accidents and easing congestion. Investment and
maintenance costs will recovered by a tolling system operated by a
private sector concession.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the project to upgrade 270.7 km of the
highway was initiated in 1993 with a 267 million dollar IDB loan
and is scheduled for completion in mid-1997. The second stage is
aimed to upgrade the remaining 292.5 km highway.
</P>
<P>
This highway, connecting strong agricultural and industrial
economies and crossing two states with a total of 32 percent of
the country's population, is a strategic economic, social and
cultural link between northeastern and southern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Counterpart financing is being offered by the federal
government with 137.5 million dollars, the state of Minas Gerais
with 110.3 million dollars and the state of Sao Paulo with 27.2
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Investigation into Murders by Zairian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged rebel leaders in eastern Zaire to investigate
reports that their forces are responsible for the murders of
Rwandan refugees and Zairian government officials.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the acting
deputy chief of mission of the U.S. embassy in Kinshasa had sent
the message to rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling on the rebel leaders to act immediately to
investigate all reports of human rights abuses, to halt any
operations that would take the life or victimize the innocent
civilians who are trying to make their way back to Rwanda," he
told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States also asked the rebel leaders to
bring those responsible for the killings to justice and to open up
areas of eastern Zaire under their control to international
monitors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Richard Bogosian, the State Department's coordinator
for Rwanda and Burundi told a House of Representatives hearing
that the United States was still open to join an international
force to help refugees in the region if it has a clear mission.
</P>
<P>
"We remain open-minded to a multinational force operation
with a clearly defined mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we do not want to commit to an operation
without knowing, for example, the whereabouts of the target
population, just for the sake of 'doing something'," he added.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Supreme Court President Rejects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Acting President of the
Serbian Supreme Court Balsa Govedarica has rejected the opposition
coalition's demand to change the court ruling on the annulment of
local elections.
</P>
<P>
It was not the practice in any democratic country in the world
that a court decision is attacked by election participants in
court proceedings through the press, nor that the court publicly
defend its decisions in the same way, Govedarica said in an
interview published Thursday in the Belgrade daily Vecernje
Novosti.
</P>
<P>
The court president explained it should be kept in mind that no
one was denied anything in the court ruling in qualifying the
ruling on the annulment of local elections at certain polling
stations in Serbia because of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling to repeat local elections in some
municipalities has sparked off a two-week large-scale
demonstrations in Belgrade organized by the opposition coalition
Zajedno (Together). The opposition claimed victory in many cities
in the second round of local elections on November 17 and
boycotted the third round of local elections in most
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
"No one was denied votes, no one was given extra votes, the
court simply decided that elections should be repeated at those
places where there had been violations of the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such court rulings are not undemocratic in their nature,"
Govedarica said, adding every participant in the elections is
obliged to accept the rules of the election procedure and the
legal mechanism envisaged for resolving election conflicts and no
one can be exempt from this.
</P>
<P>
"The coalition Zajedno, as a participant in the elections,
accepted the position of a side in court proceedings and all the
obligations stemming from that status at the very moment it
addressed the Serbian Supreme Court to evaluate the legality and
annul the first-degree court ruling on the elections case in
Belgrade," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Imagine a judicial system in which a certain parties would
accept and respect only those court rulings which suit them, and
organize public protests against the court when unsuitable
decisions were made. There is no such thing in any democratic
state in the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Executions 38-Year High in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-six men were executed
in 1995 in the United States, the highest figure in 38 years,
while an additional 3,054 inmates waited on death row at year's
end, the Justice Department reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The executions in 16 states were the most since 1957 when 65
were executed, according to the department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics report. All the 1995 inmates executed had been
convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
During the 1930s annual executions always exceeded 120 and
sometimes approached 200. Since the Supreme Court upheld revised
death penalty laws in 1976, a total of 313 criminals have been
executed. Previous capital punishment laws were ruled
unconstitutional in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners executed last year had been on death row for an
average of 11 years and two months -- about a year longer than the
31 inmates executed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the 18 inmates executed in 1985 had been on death
row an average of five years and 11 months. The time between
conviction and execution has increased since capital punishment was
restored. The average wait during 1977-83 was four years and three
months.
</P>
<P>
The growing length of time condemned inmates postpone execution
by appealing convictions was cited by Congress and President Bill
Clinton when they enacted legislation earlier this year imposing
unprecedented limits on the appeals prisoners can take to federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 31, 1995, there were 2,998 men and 48 women on state
death rows and eight men under federal death sentence. All had
committed murder.
</P>
<P>
At year end, 32 states authorized lethal injection; 11,
electrocution, seven, lethal gas; four, hanging; and three, firing
squad. Thirty-seven states require an appellate review of death
sentences regardless of the defendant's wishes; Arkansas and the
federal system do not.
</P>
<P>
The states without a death penalty are: Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa,
Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode
Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- About 20.4 million tourists, an
increase of 11 percent, have been attracted to Britain so far this
year and there is a seven percent rise in spending by visitors
compared to the same period last year, the Department of National
Heritage said Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
The trend for this year is to do even better as Britain's
reputation as a center of style and culture grows, she said.
</P>
<P>
Bottomley added that the British government attaches great
importance on tourism as it is becoming increasingly vital to the
economy in terms of wealth and job creation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she stressed the importance of tapping
potentialities of the tourism industry and the need to improve
Britain's competitiveness in this market.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down Sharply on Wall Street's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all reversed Tuesday's gains and ended down sharply, undermined by
profit-taking on Wall Street and a weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London took an early knock in response to New
York's biggest overnight fall since the Presidential election,
with the FTSE 100 index closing down 16.3 points at 4,045.2.
</P>
<P>
The market sentiment was also weakened during afternoon trade
by soft government bonds.
</P>
<P>
The key feature of the Frankfurt market in Germany was
profit-taking, following overnight losses in New York and its own
record close at 2,886.98 on Tuesday. The DAX-30 index was down
20.91 points at 2,866.07 at the close of the session.
</P>
<P>
Of all the three major European markets, Paris suffered the
most losses in a day of quiet trading, with the CAC-40 index
ending down 1.7 percent, or 40.46 points at 2,308.65 after a
strong performance this week, also depressed by Wall Street's
decline.

<HEADLINE> UN Welcomes Peace Agreement on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today expressed welcome to the Peace Agreement signed by the
government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front in
Abidjan on November 30, according to a presidential statement of
the Council.
</P>
<P>
Italian Ambassador Francesco Fulci, council president for
December, said in a statement that the agreement brings to an end
a bitter conflict which has caused appalling suffering to the
people of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"The Council hopes that the Agreement will provide
encouragement to those working for peace in other parts of
Africa," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council continues to follow development in Sierra
Leone with close interest. The Peace Agreement is an essential
first step towards national reconciliation and reconstruction, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
While expressing continuous support for the development of
peace and democracy in Sierra Leone, the Council notes in
particular the need for a successful demobilization and
reintegration of former combatants and stands ready to assist this
process.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone enjoyed a considerable period of peace and
development since its independence in April 1971. But, the civil
war which broke out in 1991 claimed toll of over 10,000 lives,
displaced about a half of its 4.6 million population and destroyed
the economy of this western African country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts of Cote d'Ivoire, UN
Secretary-General's special envoy, Organization of African Unity,
the Commonwealth and the Economic Community of West African
States, the government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary
United Front signed the Peace Agreement last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Central African Summit Positive: UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. envoy considered the
Central African Summit held in Brazzaville of Congo as "positive
and successful."
</P>
<P>
Blondin Beye, U.N. special delegate to Angola, made the
remarks after attending the summit to discuss the conflict in the
Great Lake region on behalf of U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, he said, various sides showed that they
were willing to make contact with each other after having had
discussions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese and Gabonese leaders pledged that they would
continue to mediate among the rivalling sides in a bid to bring
the crisis under control.
</P>
<P>
On November 15, the U.N. Security Council decided to send a
multinational force to eastern Zaire to intervene and create a
refugees corridor so that the refugees could return to where they
had come from. They were trapped in fighting between Zairean
troops and Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda opposes the dispatch of the force along with the
rebels, saying as over 600,000 refugees have been back home, the
force will be irrelevant. But there is still fighting between
Zairean troops and Zairean rebels in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Beye said as there is a very long borderline between Angola
and Zaire, the crisis in Zaire would have negative impacts on the
situation in Angola.

LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Union leaders in Scotland are
calling a 24-hour strike by 700 ScotRail ticket staff and
conductors on Friday, according to a BBC TV report on Wednesday.

The stoppage has been called following ScotRail's refusal to
abandon disciplinary action against employees involved in earlier
industrial action.

The report said that those employees had supported a claim by
their union for productivity payments and a shorter working week.
</P>
<P>
General secretary Jimmy Knapp said the strike had been called
"reluctantly".
