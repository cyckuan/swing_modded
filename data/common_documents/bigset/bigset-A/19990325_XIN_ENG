<HEADLINE> French Lawmakers Skeptical About Result of Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Several French parliament deputies
at the National Assembly expressed Wednesday their skepticism
about and opposition to the forthcoming NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The president of the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF),
Philippe Douste-Blazy, said that the decision to launch airstrikes
was the most serious one ever taken by the NATO, because the
target is a sovereign state which does not threaten its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that Europeans have to bend under the command
of Americans in stopping what he called "ethnic cleansing and
massacres" in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Parliament deputy and French Communist Party National Secretary
Robert Hue said that no solution can be found through bombings.
</P>
<P>
"We should avoid the human losses from bombings, we should seek
negotiations until the end," he said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament group leader of the leftwing Citizen's Movement
party, Georges Sarre, said that Friday would be a sad day because
there will be the dead, the injured and massive exodus of refugees.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Western countries wait for another day to
explore the way of talks with Belgrade which, he pointed out, has
again proposed talks.
</P>
<P>
Philippe de Villiers, president of the MPF (French People's
Movement) party, said that he cannot understand the NATO decision
and questions the act of following by Europeans a high risk policy
toward Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an error. The solution which was chosen is, in
the name of the right of interference, to strike a sovereign state
which has accepted a part of the peace agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy of the rightwing Gaullist Rally for the Republic,
Patrick Devedjian, said that he regretted the warlike character of
the United States which he said is not the policeman of the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to us Europeans to solve these problems. I especially
regret that the United States appears much more intransigent in
the affair of Kosovo than what happens to the Kurds in Turkey," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another deputy of Rally for the Republic, Jacques Baumel, said
that he does not believe that airstrikes can really destabilize
Milosevic or force him to sign the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"This is a gamble which is extremely disturbing and dangerous
that the West is in the process of making on the credibility of
NATO," he said.

<HEADLINE> 89 Illegal Immigrants Head Back for Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-nine illegal immigrants
who landed in Cyprus last week from Lebanon are heading back to
the country, said Cyprus government spokesman Costas Serezis
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a daily press briefing, Serezis expressed satisfaction with
Lebanon's decision to take back the 89 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The decision "is one more practical proof of the close and
friendly ties between the two countries," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus as well as the European Union (EU) are particularly
sensitive to the issue of illegal immigrants and the EU believes
non-member states should help safeguard its borders from illegal
immigrants."
</P>
<P>
Most of the immigrants came from Iraq, others from Sierra
Leone, Somalia, Palestine, Egypt and Syria. Of them 35 are women
and children.
</P>
<P>
They had started from Tripoli, a Lebanese port, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Since they arrived in Cyprus last Thursday, consultations have
been taking place between the two countries for their return to
where they came from.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat
is scheduled to meet the press here Wednesday over the issue of
Kosovo, a Yugoslav province in the Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, is expected to give a press conference here
on 11:00 a.m. EST to air the official response to the NATO threat
of military action.
</P>
<P>
The press conference is to be held against a backdrop that NATO
warships put to sea and air siren sounded in Kosovo on Wednesday
as Europe stood at the brink of armed conflict between Yugoslavia
and the West.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the issue of Kosovo as its internal affairs, Belgrade
maintains that it is ready to enter into negotiations on Kosovo,
but rejects any imposed idea of a solution.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, have been fighting with Serbs for
independence.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Wednesday called on French President Jacques Chirac "to use his
authority to relieve the tensions caused by NATO's threats", a top
Kremlin official said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia sees a way out of this situation through continued
negotiations and intensive work among the sides drawn into the
conflict," said Sergei Prikhodko, deputy head of the presidential
office.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Chirac, Yeltsin "spoke
forcefully against a military solution imposed by the United
States", Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that Yugoslavia and Russia should
continue constant contacts over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a Kremlin spokesman cited Yeltsin as telling U.
S. President Bill Clinton in a Wednesday telephone conversation
that Russia does not intend to use military threats to keep NATO
from launching strikes against Serbia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday made a telephone call to Russian President Boris Yeltsin
in an attempt to bolster U.S.-Russian relations despite sharp
differences over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's message for Yeltsin was that "We should not allow a
dispute on a single issue to derail the important work we're doing
on a wide variety of issues," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton was briefing Yeltsin on the lack of
progress in getting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
accept a peaceful settlement and the deteriorating situation on
the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's call to Yeltsin came the day after Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov canceled a trip to Washington in protest
against expected NATO air strikes on Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
Primakov abruptly turned his plane around over the Atlantic to
return to Moscow after Vice President Al Gore told him NATO action
appeared inevitable.

<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Guangdong Hongyuan
Tigers overcame a shaky start to beat Zhejiang Cyclone 100-93 in
the 22nd round of the Chinese first division basketball league
here on Wednesday, ending the regular season with third place in
the standings.
</P>
<P>
The Cyclone surged to lead 17-10, but the Tigers made a strong
comeback, pulled it even with one minute remaining in the first
quarter before a three pointer from Tao Xiaogang gave the Tigers a
23-20 first-quarter advantage.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Cyclone, cheered by a fervent home crowd, stormed back in
the second period to complete the first half 44-42.

hosts hard before taking the eventual win.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Wu led the Cyclone with 25 points and teammate Yu Leping
grabbed a game-high 18 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
"The players are very nervous in the first half, but they
finally found their rhythm," said Zhang Yongjun, head coach of the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
Pan Jianping, head coach of the Cyclone, said they made too
many errors in the second half.
</P>

Pan said. "But everyone has tried his best."
</P>
<P>
In the other two games, Beijing Aoshen defeated Shanghai Sharks
88-80 and Jiangsu Dragons beat Jinan Army Pegasus 99-95.

<TEXT>
<P>
MILAN, Italy, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Both China and Italy have
economic strengths and trade, scientific and technological
exchanges and cooperation between the two countries are mutually
beneficial, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Milanese
businessmen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After years of effort, Jiang said, economic and trade
cooperation between China and Italy has developed smoothly and
Italy has become an important trade partner of China in West
Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese President said that there was still a
large disparity concerning the bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, compared with the potential both countries have
acquired.
</P>
<P>
"This requires both Chinese and Italian governments to push it
forward, and the efforts by businessmen of both countries as well,
" Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China's economy would maintain its rapid
development, at about seven percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang explained the measures to be taken by the Chinese
government to fulfill this year's goals of economic development.
They include increasing investment in infrastructure, raising
domestic demand and incomes of people, keeping stable the value of
the Chinese currency, improving the environment for foreign
investment and using foreign funds more efficiently.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Denounces Imminent NATO Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament Wednesday
condemned NATO's impending air strikes against Yugoslavia as "an
invasion of a sovereign nation".
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly said in a statement that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision to launch air strikes
without a U.N. mandate would result in an escalation of large-
scale armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
NATO's threat would violate not only the international law and
widely-acknowledged humanitarian norms, but also the
organization's fundamental principle, which bases its military
action solely on the protection of the security of its member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the Kosovo issue must be settled
through political negotiations in line with the norms of
international law.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament urged all parties to resume peace
talks and take steps to bring about a comprehensive settlement of
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
It also hoped that NATO leaders and the United States would
give up using force over Kosovo as the issue was purely "an
internal affair" of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The parliament urged the U.N. Security Council to immediately
review NATO's decision against Yugoslavia and called on the
international community to make every effort to stem militaristic
attempts to use force in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
As a protest against the United States and its allied NATO
countries' decision on air strikes against Yugoslavia, the
National Security and Defense Committee under the Ukrainian
National Assembly has reportedly called off a visit to the U.S.
scheduled for March 27 to April 3.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian delegation had been invited to attend a ceremony
for the destruction of wells for missile launches in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Blair Defends Release of IRA Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Wednesday defended the release of three IRA prisoners, freed despite
a legal challenge by Home Secretary Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today program, Blair said that
he would be working with "increasing urgency" over the next few days
to implement the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try and find a way of making sure that the whole of the
agreement is implemented, and prisoner releases is obviously one part
of this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of prisoners would have been out within a few
years in any event," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair also denied that his own ministers were at war over the
prisoner releases, saying the whole Cabinet was fully behind the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
IRA prisoners Thomas Quigley, Paul Kavanagh and Gerard McDonnell
walked free from the Maze prison in Belfast on Tuesday night under
the Northern Ireland peace agreement reached last April.
</P>
<P>
The three released men are the first life prisoners convicted by
the English courts of crimes committed on the mainland to be freed
under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
They were freed hours after a High Court judge in Belfast
rejected an appeal by Straw to halt their release for "judicial
clarification."

<HEADLINE> Permaculture Recommended for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The three-day regional workshop on
 permaculture which ended here in Zimbabwean capital Wednesday
said institutions servicing farmers should be transformed.
</P>
<P>
Permaculture is a permanent and self-sustaining system of
agriculture adaptable to both rural and urban centers.
</P>
<P>
Galdman Kundhlande, deputy director of the Southern Alliance for
 Indigenous Resources, said the workshop recommended that service
institutions need to consider permaculture in their programs.
</P>
<P>
Permaculture is designed to produce an efficient low
maintenance productive integration of trees, plants and animals,
natural and man-made physical features and human activities within
a specific area.
</P>
<P>
Kundhlande said the workshop had reinforced the idea that
permaculture was the ideal method of farming for Africans.
</P>
<P>
"Permaculture is not foreign to African societies. When we
planted sorghum, beans and maize on the same piece of land we were
practising permaculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Africans used to utilise all the elements of the environment
and did not concentrate on a single species as the commercial
agricultural system recommends," he said.
</P>
<P>
Permaculture also involves the use of organic matter like
cattle manure, inter-cropping in preparing the field and nurturing
the crops.
</P>
<P>
It was concluded at the workshop that permaculture was likely
to be the major contributor to the solutions of food production
faced by Africans.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was attended by delegates from Malawi, South
Africa, Rwanda, Nepal and Zimbabwe, and representatives of
non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Gap Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- UK trade continues to be hit
by the economic crisis affecting many parts of the world
as the balance of trade falls a record 2.83 billion pounds
(45.8 billion U.S. dollars) into the red.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the value of imports and exports grew
2.76 billion pounds in January compared with the previous
month, according to figures released by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The January figure was a record goods trade deficit,
the ONS said. Economists had forecast a deficit of 2.6
billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
The ONS figures also showed Britain's balance of trade
of worsening with its European Union partners. In January,
the EU trade deficit grew to 694 million pounds from 528
million pounds the month before.
</P>
<P>
The economists believe the numbers are not that far
from their expectations to warrant much of a market
reaction, but they do confirm that the trend in the trade
deficit is worsening with the worst possible combination
of import volumes increasing and export volumes dropping
off.

<HEADLINE> Romania Hopes Peaceful Settlement of Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Romania is still hoping that
the Yugoslav authorities will change their stand at the last
minute to avoid NATO attacks, Romania's Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Simona Miculescu said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Romania has been keeping a close eye on the evolution of the
Kosovo crisis after the international peace effort failed,
Miculescu said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that Romanian Ambassador to Belgrade
Alexandru Cornea was called Tuesday night to the Foreign Ministry
of Yugoslavia, along with representatives of all Yugoslavia's
neighboring countries, and was handed an official diplomatic
document on the possible political and military consequences of
any involvement of these countries in a NATO attack against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also said that Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile Wednesday received a message from NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana, which said that the NATO considered any threat to
Romania's territorial integrity, political independence and
security as "inadmissible".
</P>
<P>
Voicing the alliance's concern about Romania's security, Solana
said that the security of all NATO member countries was directly
linked to that of the alliance's partners.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Romanian president's chief military
advisor Zoe Petre said that NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia
would pose no threat to the security of Romania and Yugoslavia's
other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that according to a resolution passed by the Romanian
parliament last October, Romania would not directly get involved
in NATO military actions, but would allow NATO airplanes to enter
the Romanian air space under emergency circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Romania was willing to dispatch a multi-functional humanitarian
mobility force to Kosovo to help with medical relief, refugees
settlement and reconstruction of houses.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that Romanian opposition party leaders and
legislators had criticized NATO's threats of air strikes against
Yugoslavia, saying military operations without a U.N. mandate ran
counter to international law.
</P>
<P>
They argued that NATO's air strikes would only temporarily ease
the Kosovo crisis, but the damage brought about by such actions
was beyond measure.

HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Public Service Association

adjustment from the government is not achieved soon, the civic
servants will withdraw their labor.

PSA President Givemore Masongorera said the adjustment would be
made up of a 20-percent cost of living adjustment and five percent

<HEADLINE> Angolans Urged to Help Tuberculars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Deputy Health Minister
Jose Van- Dunem Wednesday urged the whole society to take urgent
measures to give utmost help to tuberculous patients.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when marking the World Tuberculosis Day.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the tuberculosis situation in Angola
is "fairly serious". As an underdeveloped poor country which is
constantly engaged in war, the total number of tuberculous
patients have been put at 150,000 as shown by statistics from the
health sectors. This does not include those undiscovered TB
victims.
</P>
<P>
The number is surprising taking into account the national
population of merely 10 million. The deputy minister was worried
that more people might be affected by the disease as people's
hygiene and living standard degenerated with the renewal of civil
war and influx of refugees.
</P>
<P>
A survey by local non-governmental organizations indicated that
the number of patients is increasing at a rate of 20,000 per year,
that mainly come from refugee camps and urban quarters.
</P>
<P>
Van-Dunem urged the whole society to be mobilized in addition
to seeking international assistance to curb the further spread of
the disease in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he suggested that education campaign be launched to
popularize knowledge on the prevention of the disease, besides
offering help to the victims such as medical treatment and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative of the World Health Organization, the
United Nations ruled in 1982 that every March 24 is marked as
World TB Day.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, there are currently over 20 million TB
patients in the world, 30 percent of whom live in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Japan Offers Debt Relief Grant to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
provided a debt relief grant of 3.2 billion shillings (about 4.6
million U.S. dollars) to Tanzania in an effort to mitigate the
east African country's economic constraints and promote its
structural adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
An agreement for the grant, being the third this fiscal year,
was signed at the Ministry of Finance in Tanzanian capital Dar es
Salaam Tuesday, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The grant is also aimed at further facilitating the importation
of goods and materials necessary for Tanzania's economic
development, Yuzo Ota, charge d'affairs of the Japanese embassy,
said at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Finance Daniel Yona said his country is
willing to strengthen relationship with Japan, a major donor to
Tanzania. He also promised that the grant will be used
effectively.
</P>
<P>
The external debt of Tanzania, one of the least developed
countries in the world, stands at around eight billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Having to use around 30 percent of its revenue for debt
repayment, Tanzania has seen its education and health services
declining in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced
that donors have cancelled 660 million U.S. dollars which Tanzania
is to pay the Paris Club in debt servicing this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Tanzanian government established a Multilateral
Debt Relief Fund to which a number of donor countries had promised
to contribute.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges World People to Stop Clinton from Making Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Wednesday made a televised address to the nation, urging people
around the world to stop U.S. President Bill Clinton from making
the mistake of launching air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to the whole world...to all politicians, while there
are still a few minutes left, let us convince Clinton not to take
this tragic, dramatic step," Yeltsin said forcefully.
</P>
<P>
He said he had talked by telephone with Bill Clinton and French
President Jacques Chirac, who told him that NATO would begin
bombing Yugoslavia in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
"This is the security of Europe. This is a war in Europe, and
maybe even more," he said. "I want peaceful political negotiations
with (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, (Milosevic) is a difficult negotiator. Sometimes you have
to speak to him two, three, five, 10 or 20 times. But we shouldn't
regret talking to him those 10, 20 times for the sake of the
hundreds and hundreds of people who will die in a few hours."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said that Yugoslavia is
willing to resume peace talks on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called
on Belgrade to acknowledge its responsibility in finding a
solution to the Kosovo issue and sign the political agreement
which was ironed out recently in Paris, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was a compromise to sign the agreement and the
purpose of doing so was to protect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia while respecting the rights of the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A compromise should be made to pave the way for continuing the
peace talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation process on the Kosovo issue should be continued
as the issue could only be resolved through political dialogue,
Ivanov said. The sooner the talks resumed, the faster a solution
could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Russia believed that use of force against Yugoslavia would be
counter-productive and NATO could not achieve its aim by launching
military strikes, which would result in deaths of civilians, an
exodus of refugees and a deterioration of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov added Moscow would seriously consider the possibility of
unilaterally withdrawing from the arms embargo imposed on
Yugoslavia if the NATO air strikes went ahead.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Train Crash Kills 32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan passenger train derailed
 Wednesday at 4:30 local time about 300 kilometers southeast of
Kenya's capital Nairobi, killing at least 32 people, including
five foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Police Commissioner Philemon Abongo confirmed in the
afternoon that the death toll rose to 32, adding that another 100
were injured.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident has not been established so far.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the driver of the train is not to blame and maybe
there was something wrong with the railway tracks," Saida Said, a
Kenyan admitted into the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
However, some survivors believed that the train crashed because
it was running too fast at a bend. One passenger named Peter
Mburu said he heard the driver say after the crash that the
train's brakes had failed.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said one car of the third class section was upside
down and at least four others on their sides.
</P>
<P>
"Only two carriages remained intact," said Saida Said, whose
back was seriously injured in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Dr. K.A. Muita, director of the Kenyatta National Hospital,
told reporters that his hospital, which has received 11 victims,
is prepared to offer emergency medical treatments for new
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The French embassy said 86 Frenchmen were aboard the train but
it was not sure how many were killed or injured. However, an
official source said at least one French national was dead.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said at least 23 foreigners on their way to the
Indian Ocean resort in Mombasa were critically injured, including
nine French and eight British nationals.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's police, army and National Disaster Committee were
leading the rescue operation with help from the Kenyan Red Cross.
 A Kenyan air force plane airlifted 23 critically injured
foreigners to Nairobi, where they were rushed to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Survivors said they had to break carriage windows to free other
trapped passengers because all the doors were locked and no one
knew where the keys were.
</P>
<P>
The doors and windows of the Kenyan overnight train are always
locked for the security reason.
</P>
<P>
Some survivors complained that they waited two or three hours
in the darkness for the Kenyan emergency services. It was hours
before the most critically injured were flown to hospitals in
Nairobi, 300 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The overnight train, convenient for foreign tourists travelling
from Kenyan capital Nairobi to the coastal city Mombasa, became
more popular after the El Nino rains destroyed the road linking
the two big cities in Kenya, which is under repair now.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Initial Reaction to Pinochet's Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- There are different reactions
here in Chile after hearing Britain's highest court ruling in
London on Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is
not immune from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The ruling in a 6-1 decision, said Pinochet enjoyed no immunity
from prosecution for human rights abuses during his 1973 to 1990
rule simply because he was a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the 83-year-old also appeared happy with the
ruling recognizing immunity to Pinochet for crimes of torture
committed before 1988.
</P>
<P>
At the headquarters of an association of relatives of
dissidents who disappeared during Pinochet's regime,a mostly
female audience exchanged hugs and kisses, many weeping, as it
became clear Pinochet was not coming back immediately.
</P>
<P>
However, at the Pinochet Foundation, a private organization of
Pinochet supporters, there was a similar reaction of joy as scores
of people gathered there heard the Lords had recognized limited
immunity to Pinochet. Because the ruling threw out 27 of the 30
charges for any acts alleged before 1988, when Britain signed the
International convention against Torture.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation members, waiving Chilean flags and chanting
``Pinochet, Pinochet,'' appeared to celebrate the ruling although
it did not appear clear to them that their leader was not
immediately returning to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Inspite of a government ban on public demonstrations, several
hundred people from both sides took to the streets in mostly
peaceful marches under the gaze of police.
</P>
<P>
The government said it would take a fairly long time to analyze
the ruling and politicians from different sectors appeared
cautious.
</P>
<P>
Mario Rios, Vice President of Chile's Senate said the decision
now is in hands of British Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has the
political power enabling Pinochet to return home.
</P>
<P>
Another congressman Herman Chadwick said the ruling was not
totally satisfactory because it did not fully recognize Chile's
sovereignty, paves the way to an early return of Gen. Pinochet to
his fatherland.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a spokesman of the Chilean Armed Forces said
that the Army is still worrying about the situation after the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Alfredo Ewing Pinochet said the Army will make an
effort to gain the return of Pinochet.

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday telephoned Russian President Boris Yeltsin in an attempt
to stave off a rift in U.S.-Russian relations over the impending
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton devoted much of the 35-minute conversation to
explaining recent diplomatic efforts with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, and expressing hope to Yeltsin that their
disagreement over using force in Yugoslavia would not harm their
relationship, said national security spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
"The president said he hoped they could continue to talk,"
Leavy said. But he declined to characterize Yeltsin's end of the
conversation, except to say that the Russian president repeated
his opposition to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the conversation, Clinton brought up Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's abrupt cancellation Tuesday of
his meeting this week with Vice President Al Gore but did not
discuss it in detail. "It never really came up again," said
national security spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton stressed "that
it's important that we have good relations with Russia and that we
should not allow a dispute on a single issue to derail the
important work we're doing on a wide variety of issues."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin also discussed the START II arms reduction
treaty in the context of the events in Kosovo, Leavy said. He
would not elaborate, and declined to offer specific comment on
reports that Russia would consider assisting Serbs with military
resources.
</P>
<P>
"There is an arms embargo on Yugoslavia, mandated by the United
Nations Security Council. Russians are a member of that body as we
are, and we expect all to live by those provisions," Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Reforms Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Financial and legal constraints
are holding back the land acquisition program in the country,
Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told army officers attending a joint command and staff
course in capital Harare that the ministry had only been able to
acquire 3.5 million hectares of land out of a target of 8.3
million hectares since 1980 when Zimbabwe won independence from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
"This can be attributed to the limited resources from the
government for land acquisition," he said.
</P>
<P>
The legal process of land acquisition were cumbersome and
delayed the smooth running of the program, he said, adding that it
could take up to a year to acquire a farm if the owner contested.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the government remained committed to acquiring land
to resettle the landless in spite of the constraints.
</P>
<P>
The land acquisition program, the minister said, would be
speeded up after the current rain season as commercial farmers had
shown their willingness to participate in the implementation of
the program.
</P>
<P>
Course participants have been drawn from Zambia, Botswana,
Malawi, South Africa, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Belgrade Not to Yield to Western Pressure? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of the
Kosovo peace talks on February 6, Yugoslavia has only had the
choices of "letting NATO troops enter Kosovo" or "being bombed."
Despite repeated U.S. and NATO threats of Air strikes, Belgrade
has stood firmly against the deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo.
Under mounting pressures from the U.S. and NATO, Belgrade has even
toughened its stance against the deployment of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
Why does Yugoslavia refuse to bow to such pressures from the
most powerful military bloc in the world ?
</P>
<P>
First of all, Yugoslavia has always held that Kosovo is an
integral part of the Serb territory and the Kosovo issue an
internal issue of the Serb Republic. It has insisted the Kosovo
crisis should be resolved through peaceful means and within the
legal framework of the Serb Republic. Above all, the territorial
integrity of the Yugoslav Federation and the Serb Republic should
be respected.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav leaders and Serb negotiators believed that the two
rounds of peace talks in France, which neither took into
consideration a January 9 peace plan worked out in London by the
six-nation International Contact Group nor allowed the Serb
delegation into a face-to-face discussion with ethnic Albanians,
is nothing but a trap.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan proposed by the U.S. and NATO, NATO will
send 2,800 armed troops to Kosovo, while Yugoslavia was only
allowed to leave 1,500 troops and 2,500 Serb policemen behind in
Kosovo. Belgrade believes that once NATO troops enter Kosovo, it
will completely lose its control over the province.
</P>
<P>
Another reason behind Belgrade's defiant stance is that
Yugoslavia believes the U.S.' attempts to let NATO troops enter
Kosovo is not aimed to "avoid further slaughter of civilians and
humanitarian catastrophe." The U.S. is just using the Kosovo issue
as an excuse to gain control over Kosovo and the key strategic
spot of the Balkans. As a matter of fact, because the U.S. is
partial to and sides with "Albanian terrorists," the Kosovo crisis,
instead of being eased, has been turning worse day by day.
</P>
<P>
The third reason is that ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have all
along adhered to their goal of an "independent Kosovo" and have
no interest in "wider and greater autonomy" for the region. Under
the plan of the U.S., the Albanian delegation signed the "peace
agreement" before the second round of peace talks, thus exerting
pressure on the delegation of the Serbian government, blaming it
for the failure to reach a peace deal and attempting to force it
to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavia is of the opinion that once Kosovo becomes
independent, there will be a chain reaction in other parts of the
country. It will destroy the country's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and might result in the disintegration of the federation.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Underscores Israel's Claim to All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu convened a special cabinet meeting on
Wednesday to underscore Israel's claim to all Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in Jerusalem's city hall, which is near
the traditional line dividing the city into eastern and western
parts.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet session is usually held in the Prime Minister's
office in the Jewish western side of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced at the meeting plans to invest 2 million
shekels (about 500,000 U.S. dollars) in the traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem and an unspecified amount in the city's western
side.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Jerusalem is the "indivisible" capital of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
insisted on the demand to establish an independent state with east
Jerusalem as its capital, Israel would make a strong reaction.
</P>
<P>
In response, Faisal Husseini, the top PNA official on
Jerusalem affairs, termed the Israeli cabinet meeting at
Jerusalem's city hall as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that such events would do little to change the
reality. "Jerusalem will continue to be the capital of the
Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed it. Under the peace agreements signed
between Israel and the PNA, the status of Jerusalem will be
settled in their final status talks.

<HEADLINE> Door Remains Open for Peace Talks on Kosovo, Yugoslav Envoy Say s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat
Wednesday said that the door is still open for peace talks on the
issue of Kosovo, a Yugoslav province in the Republic of Serbia,
and Belgrade will fight back if NATO launches air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told a press conference that "We are ready
to talk anywhere, at any time and we are committed to the
political solution" of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the face-to-face talk is most productive," he said.
"We are for the peaceful solution."
</P>
<P>
The former Yugoslav foreign minister made the statement
following the U.S.-led NATO impresses the world that the air
strike is imminent.
</P>
<P>
But "if NATO launches air strikes, we will fight back to defend
out country," he said, "Our potential certainly is not comparable
to the NATO, but our potential can not be underestimated."
</P>
<P>
Any NATO military action against Yugoslavia violates the
principle of the U.N. Charter, and it is very dangerous to the
existing international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that the NATO decision will not be implemented,"
he said, referring to the Tuesday move by NATO to order air
strikes on Yugoslavia. The order is not yet being carried out.
</P>
<P>
"We are peace-loving, small country in Europe, we have not pose
any threat to anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia rejects the Western offer to allow foreign military
presence in Kosovo to monitor the autonomy plan, saying that any
foreign military presence in Kosovo will be seen as an act of
aggression, which is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke in Kosovo in February last year after ethnic
Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, have been fighting with Serbs for
independence.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Transiting Arms to Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has refuted allegations that his country has been
used as a transit to supply arms to the war-torn Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Namibia, Sumaye said Tanzania, which has
declared neutrality in the DRC crisis, could not be used as a
conduit for channelling arms to the central African country, the
Dar es Salaam-based paper The African reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who was speaking Tuesday to the Tanzanian community in
Windhoek, capital of Namibia, said landlocked neighbors
traditionally used Tanzanian ports to transit their goods and "it
will be unwise to deny them access to the Tanzanian harbors."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the seven-month conflicts in DRC could only be
solved by round-table peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Resorting to war as a means of resolving conflicts is
outdated. Conflicts should be concentrated on building the
economies instead of wars," the paper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
International efforts to broker peace in DRC, where rebels
vowed to topple the government of President Laurent Kabila since
August last year, have not succeeded.
</P>
<P>
The war has dragged in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad
fighting on Kabila's side, and Uganda and Rwanda allegedly in
support of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a neutral stand, Tanzania pulled more than 600
troops who were training for DRC government soldiers out of the
central African country shortly after the war broke out.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has opposed military
intervention in the DRC crisis saying it should be resolved
through political dialogs.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Warning sirens went off again in
Kosovo's main city Pristina on Wednesday night, as NATO fighter
jets took off from Italian base on possible bomb raids against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A piercing single-toned siren rang out at 6.50 p.m. (1750 GMT),
soon after nightfall, in a city that was otherwise dead calm with
streets deserted, according to news reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many fighter jets took off from the NATO airbase at
Aviano in northeastern Italy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Italian agency ANSA quoted an Aviano spokesman as saying the
planes had taken off. It said F-16, F-18 and EA-6B aircraft were
believed to be involved. There was no immediate confirmation of
whether they were destined for bombing raids against Serbia but
the spokesman was quoted as saying they were "carrying weapons".

<HEADLINE> Jordan`s Economic Strain to Deepen in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan`s economic strain appears to
be felt more than ever by people in 1999 as the kingdom struggles
to repay record foreign debts and their servicing.
</P>
<P>
The desert kingdom which has great strategic importance is now
counting on friendly countries to deliver their promises on
financial aid, and on a relaxation in regional situation that
would lead to an economic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debts hit a record 6.8 billion U.S. dollars in
1999, and the government is obliged to repay 812 million dollars
in principals and interests, nearly 40 percent of its revenues.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, its payment for debts and servicing amounted to 500
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The massive foreign debt burden has cast a shadow over the 2
percent economic growth target projected for this year, from last
year's negative growth.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to meet with member countries of
the Paris Creditors Clubs to reschedule its debt payments, and
hopefully payment of 200 million of the 812 million dollars will
be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have promised to help alleviate the economic
pains of the kingdom after King Hussein died of cancer on
February 7, but the pledges failed to materialize so far, except
those made by the United States and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan as its staunch ally in the Arab world,
and is forging ahead with its aid package which is expected to
amount to 300 million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, a traditional ally of Jordan, has put some 150 million
dollars of long-term deposits in banks based in Amman to boost the
kingdom's foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan still is waiting for the European Union, Japan
and other donor countries to translate their financial pledges
into concrete action.
</P>
<P>
It also has to knock on the door of the Gulf countries,
traditionally a stronghold for Jordanian labors, for its labor
export, which has been one of the major foreign currency earners.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has normalized ties with Kuwait damaged since the 1990
Gulf Crisis, which saw tens of thousands of Jordanian workers
expelled from Kuwait for Amman`s sympathy with Iraq after
President Saddam Hussein's troops' invasion of the tiny Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Now dozens of Jordanians queue up every day outside the Kuwaiti
embassy here, but many were turned down by embassy officials who
said they have not received orders from home to accept Jordanians
workers in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the biggest donor to Jordan prior to the 1990
Gulf Crisis, has yet to open its market to Jordanian workers and
agricultural produce. Saudi officials were also unwilling to
confirm reports that Riyadh would write off some 160 million
dollars of debts for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Tough job also lies ahead on the domestic front for the new
government headed by Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh, who was
appointed by King Abdullah on March 4.
</P>
<P>
The Rawabdeh government is challenged by a two-digit
unemployment rate and the fact that over half of the country`s 45
million population are living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government also has to fight against rising
crimes, partly as a result of growing poverty and unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Influx of Congolese Refugees Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Recent reports from the emergency
response team of the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees' (UNHCR)
in Kaputa, Northern Zambia, indicate that the refugees fleeing the
intensified fighting in Congo (K) to the area has increased to
15,000 persons over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 11,000 people registered in Kaputa while 4,000
others are estimated to be residing in the surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
"The influx of refugees continues unabated and we are very
concerned about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC)," said UNHCR representative Oluseyi Bajulaiye in a statement
released in Lusaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In recent history this is probably the largest refugees influx
Zambia has witnessed over such a short space of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, refugees with wounds inflicted in battles
were received but their condition is said to be stable, Bajulaiye
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to extend humanitarian assistance to the affected
refugees, together with our partners, under very difficult
conditions," Bajulaiye added.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is water. "If nothing is done quickly there
will be an epidemic of major proportions," an aid worker who
recently returned from Kaputa warned.
</P>
<P>
Four water trucks are constantly ferrying drinking water within
Kaputa while refugees and Red Cross volunteers continue to dig pit
latrines around the clock, all in an effort to prevent the
outbreak of communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five clinical staff and one medical doctor were
redeployed to Kaputa, with the support of United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, some 22 refugees were admitted to Kaputa Rural
Health Clinic with various complaints, including four confirmed
cases of measles.
</P>
<P>
However, vaccines have already been provided by UNICEF and
Medicin Sans Frontiers (MSF), and a general vaccination campaign
against measles is expected to start Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is security. According to UNHCR, among the
recent arrivals, there is a group of some 800 Congolese soldiers
who fled a rebel attack in the towns of Pweto and Pepo in southern
Congo (K). But Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Paul Bupe, member
of parliament in the area, as saying that about 1,150 soldiers
have entered Kaputa Monday and that numbers were swelling daily.
</P>
<P>
Bupe has complained about the security risk arising from their
harassment of villagers.
</P>
<P>
The refugee situation in Kaputa is serious. There are only a
few policemen in that area. These men on the ground have no
capacity to handle an influx of the magnitude being experienced,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A previous group of 750 Congolese soldiers were relocated from
Kaputa only last week and have reportedly returned to Congo in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
The local government has plans to move the remaining soldiers
to other camps but the ordinary refugees now totalling 15,000
would be shifted to a new camp, which had a capacity to harbor up
to 20,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
There were some fears that firearms were exchanging hands
illegally. Local government officials were worried about the
influx of soldiers who were coming in daily in large numbers and
freely mixing with villagers. They called on UNHCR to quickly
move in and resettle the soldiers to approved centers.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has announced in Wednesday's statement it would further
increase the number of staff based in the area to ensure that all
aspects of the basic needs of the refugees were taken care of.
</P>
<P>
Since the refugee influx first started earlier this month,
UNHCR and the World Food Program (WFP) have delivered some 97 tons
of food, which includes a consignment of rice, borrowed from the
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Bajulaiye said the general humanitarian situation was
considered to be adequate although the infrastructure in Kaputa
was clearly stretched beyond its limits as the population is about
3,000 in Kaputa before the influx.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that more tents, water bowsers together with
chlorinating equipment will be sent there to ease water problems
in the town. But UNHCR officials have also expressed concern
about the road conditions in the area, saying they were causing
delays in the delivery of assistance to the refugees.

CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Uganda on Wednesday
expressed desire to promote bilateral cooperation in crop
production.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and Uganda, two members of the
Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa, stood at 2.18
million U.S. dollars. The two have expressed readiness to increase
their trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also discussed the development of the Great
Lake area, where Uganda is situated, and the fishery in the Nile
River.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Uganda are both Nile basin countries and keep close

<HEADLINE> EU Makes Final Call for Peace Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15- European Union (EU)
member states Wednesday voiced a last-ditch peace effort for the
Yugoslav leadership to make a concession over the Paris' agreement on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authority could now still stop the already decided
NATO air strikes by showing its "courage at this juncture to change
radically its own policy," the EU leaders said in a statement on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders said that it is not yet too late to accept
the international community's mediation efforts. German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fisher even told reporters that a phone call from
Milosevic would be enough.
</P>
<P>
Fisher also said the whole military process would be halted if
Milosevic would accept implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the EU leaders said the international
community's only objective is to find a political future for the
Kosovo, on the basis of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which does justice to the
concerns and aspirations of all the people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We underline that it is not our aim to keep the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia in its self-imposed isolation in Europe and the world.
On the contrary, we would like to end the isolation of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia in Europe. But for this to happen, Milosevic
must choose the path of peace in Kosovo and the path of reform and
democratization," the European leaders concluded in the statement.

 Most of the new immigrants are living in make-shift huts
built with iron sheet, bricks and sticks, with no access to tap
water and sewage systems, and many find it hard to get power
supply.
</P>
<P>
The immigrants rush, Azevedo said, is a result of the changed
economic structure, the imbalance of urban and rural development,
and the sudden growth of refugees from the long years of civil
war, the economist said.

Luanda, a city with three million population, accounts for one

facilities are still at its 1975 stage when there were only about
600,000 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of State in
charge of Animal Industry Kezimbira Muyingo has refuted
allegations that he was corrupt in the valley dam saga.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the refutation when presenting his defense to
Parliament Wednesday afternoon, Radio Uganda reported in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that he should be politically responsible for the
missing of 3.4 billion shillings (3.4 million U.S. dollars) in the
construction of the 15 valley dams because his suggestions had
been ignored by his seniors in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He claimed to be a clean man in the defense.
</P>
<P>
He is one of the three ministers named in the report of the
parliamentary select committee as having been responsible for the
dam construction.
</P>
<P>
The other two, including Vice President and Minister of
Agriculture Specioza Kazibwe and State Minister for Fisheries Fred
Mukisa, will defend themselves before Parliament Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, President Yoweri Museveni had reaffirmed
 government's commitment to fight against corruption and hailed
the select committee for the work it has done. The select
committee, formed late last year, is responsible for investigating
this dam scandal.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health of
Ethiopia Wednesday urged health institutions and governmental
agencies to make an integrated effort to prevent and control the
spread of Tuberculosis (TB).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here to observe this year's World TB Day
which falls on March 24, 1999 today, the ministry said public
involvement is mandatory for the prevention and eradication of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that TB can only be eliminated if the
people in the country join hands to eradicate poverty and
illiteracy and improve standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims of TB are found in developing countries
such as Ethiopia, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, TB patients in Ethiopia are
estimated to be 250,000. About 100,000 people in the country are
infected with TB annually while 40,000 of them die of the disease.
Most of the patients are reported to be within the age from 15 to
49.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million Pilgrims to Visit Mina Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 2 million pilgrims from
across the Muslim world will begin an 11-kilometer trip to Mina,
Saudi Arabia Thursday, following their first rite of Hajj by
walking around the holy Kaaba in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The ritual in Mina is called the Day of Al-Tarwiya, a word used
in the days for stocking enough water for the journey to Mount
Arafat and the Valley of Mozdalifa.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims, some 1.4 million of whom are from outside Saudi
Arabia, will start on Friday to climb Mount Arafat, site of the
Prophet Mohammad's last sermon 14 centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
The mass recitation of prayers at Mount Arafat marks the
climax of the Hajj pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, the pilgrims will head back to Mina after a
series of rituals in the Valley of Mozdalifa.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Saudi authorities have
announced that all necessary preparations had been made for the
rituals in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Public Works and Housing Prince Moutib bin
Abdel-Aziz said that some 16,500 tents have been set up for about
1 million pilgrims in Mina.
</P>
<P>
The tents were fitted with water sprinklers to avert a repeat
of a fire which raged two years ago through the tent camps,
claiming 350 lives and burning 70,000 tents, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Saudi Health Ministry sources, water, food
telephone services and health centers are available to the
pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
The health condition of the pilgrims was "excellent" and no
epidemics were reported so far, the sources added.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in a written statement on Wednesday that NATO had
begun air strikes against military targets in Yugoslavia,
according to news reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
"I have been informed by SACEUR (the Supreme Commander Europe),
General Clark, that at this moment NATO air operations against
targets in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have commenced,"
Solana was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
The international community had spared no efforts to achieve a
negotiated settlement in Kosovo but this had not been possible, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Clear responsibility for the air strikes lies with (Yugoslav)
President (Slobodan) Milosevic who has refused to stop his violent
action in Kosovo and has refused to negotiate in good faith," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is not waging war against Yugoslavia. We have no quarrel
with the people of Yugoslavia who for too long have been isolated
in Europe because of the policies of their government. Our actions
are directed against the repressive policy of the Yugoslav
leadership," the alliance chief proclaimed.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At least two huge explosions
rocked the region around Kosovo's main city Pristina on Wednesday
night after NATO confirmed it had begun air strikes against
Yugoslavia, according to news reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The explosions, which began at about 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) and
interrupted a dead calm with the streets deserted, sent great red
flashes across the clear night sky.
</P>
<P>
Small-arms fire broke out moments afterwards followed by
heavy-calibre bursts which could have been anti-aircraft batteries
opening up on possible targets.

<P>
Minutes before, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana had
announced in Brussels that NATO had begun air strikes against
military targets in Yugoslavia.

At 8.10 p.m. (1910 GMT), witnesses reported two great orange

KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
Wednesday reaffirmed his government's commitment to the policy of
privatization as the most viable way of ensuring increased
production.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made this statement when officially opening a cotton
company in eastern Uganda, a press release from the President's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
It said Museveni was happy to see that since the policy was
launched, many new private factories have come up throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoga Cotton Company Limited in Soroti Town is a new
component of the many investment concerns of the House of Dawda.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the House of Dawda for investing in the cotton
industry in Soroti District, adding that the people of the
district and the whole region will benefit from the venture.
</P>
<P>
Cotton farmers were urged to adopt improved methods of cotton
production and increase their yields.
</P>
<P>
Privatization started in Uganda in 1991 when the Public
Enterprise Reform and Divestiture Secretariat was formed.
</P>
<P>
Its mandate was to restructure the parastatal sector either
through reform or divestiture. In 1995, it was replaced by the
Privatization Unit.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 85 public enterprises have been privatized in
the country and a total of 2,326 projects have been licensed since
July 1991. The country's GDP has grown at the rate of 6.5 percent
since 1990.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo capital Pristina was
plunged into darkness on Wednesday evening after enormous
explosions were heard and NATO announced its air strikes against
Yugoslavia had begun, according to news reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
But it was not immediately clear whether the blackout had been
ordered by authorities or was the result of damage to power
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Many residents were sheltering in their houses and had already
turned their lights off, and few people were on the streets except
for police patrols around the city of 200,000, witnesses were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least five huge explosions rocked the region around Pristina
a short time earlier.
</P>
<P>
Air raid sirens were sounded in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade,
300 km (200 miles) to the north, soon after two orange flashes
were seen in the night sky not far from the city.
</P>
<P>
The flashes near the Serbian capital came shortly after two
huge explosions rocked Pristina, the provincial capital of the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Sirens also were heard in the southern industrial city of Nis,
shortly after planes were heard flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
But in Belgrade, pedestrial traffic in the centre of the city
continued as usual, despite the sirens and the evidence of the
NATO attack not far from the city, according to a Reuters report.

</P>
<P>
EU commissioner for Africa, Joao de Deus Pinheiro announced

Spain and other southern European countries have given way and

<P>
The countries had previously insisted that South Africa stop

exclusive rights to the names of the fortified wines.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that the EU might still communicate the
successful conclusion of the agreement to South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will see almost 95 percent of the South

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- As U.S.-led airstrikes against
Serbian targets in Yugoslavia began Wednesday, President Clinton
said, "Only firmness now can prevent greater catastrophe later."
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo's crisis is now full-blown and if we do not act clearly
it will get even worse,'' Clinton said in a preview of an address
he said he will deliver to the nation Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic has rejected
diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in Kosovo, and has instead
intensified his attacks there.
</P>
<P>
He said, "If we do not act, it will get even worse."
</P>
<P>
Clinton went to the White House briefing room to announce that
U.S. forces, "acting with our NATO allies," had begun air raids on
Serbian military targets.
</P>
<P>
He said the action was taken only after extensive and repeated
efforts at a peace settlement, and after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic violated earlier cease-fire commitments "to
stop the brutal repression in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States and its NATO allies have three
goals:
</P>
<P>
-- To show their determination to gain peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
-- To make Milosevic pay a price for violence against ethnic
</P>
<P>
 Albanians in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- To diminish the Serbs' ability to wage war on the Kosovars.

<HEADLINE> FEATURE Belgraders Brace for NATO Airstrike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- For the dozen of youngsters
playing soccer in the cement court of a quiet neighborhood in the
older part of Belgrade, worries over imminent NATO airstrike are
for the adults.
</P>
<P>
As the sun goes down and the street lamps light up, they
continue their favorite sport, in the fragrance of early spring
brought by the blossoming winter jasmines, peach flowers and the
budding willow trees.
</P>
<P>
All this serenity may soon be gone, if NATO goes ahead with its
threatened bombing on Yugoslav targets, which would be the first
time for the military bloc to attack a sovereign state since it
was born half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Already, their president Slobodan Milosevic has appeared on
national television, urging his fellow Yugoslavians to "take all
measures" to defend their fatherland.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening now concerns the freedom of a whole state.
Kosovo would be only the beginning of the attempted invasion (of
Yugoslavia) by foreign troops," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Yugoslav parliament's Tuesday resolution on
rejection of foreign troops in Kosovo as "the only correct
decision to make."
</P>
<P>
As the authorities inform the population on how to interpret
sirens -- a 60-second one would warn the coming of air raids while
a longer one would mean clearance of the warning -- the residents
are busy stocking food and other daily necessities while cars
clogged streets near gas stations.
</P>
<P>
In the newer part of Belgrade, many firms remains open until
late afternoon, but some choose to close earlier.
</P>
<P>
Inside the Rad computer store, everything appears normal as
staffers going around serving customers.
</P>
<P>
But once in a while, they would steal an eye on a television
screen, which was showing CNN, the Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
"How is business?"
</P>
<P>
"Well, the CNN says bombs will start to fall in about four
hours," said a young salesman, ducking the question.
</P>
<P>
However, in Imtel, another computer store several blocks away,
only several guards were left.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the intensification of the situation, we've rescheduled
our office hours and they have gone home earlier today," a guard
said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo may be some distance away, but news that warplanes have
taken off form NATO bases in Britain and Italy is too heavy for
the Belgraders to ignore.
</P>
<P>
Stars are blinking in the spring sky against a crescent moon,
which is bringing people here closer to a warmer summer, but under
looming NATO air strikes, it will be another chilly, anxious night
for city's residents and peace-loving people all over the world.

<HEADLINE> It is Open For Yugoslavia to Change Course: Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) - Prime Minister Tony Blair said on
Wednesday it was still open for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to change course and return to "civilized conduct".
</P>
<P>
"It is open to him at any time to do that," he said in a
televised statement to reporters in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The NATO military strikes were aimed at securing justice for
the people of Kosovo, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that British forces, including a nuclear
submarine equipped with cruise missiles, were in action against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He warned Belgrade that there would be a swift and severe
response if it attempted retaliation against NATO troops based
elsewhere in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair said the attacking forces included United
States B-52 bombers which took off from Britain, B-2 bombers from
the U.S. and the British submarine HMS Splendid, armed with
Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
British Harrier GR7 bombers based in Italy also took part
alongside forces from the United States, France, Spain, Canada,
Germany and Italy in a first wave of attacks on Yugoslav air
defense systems, local reports in London said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Delinquency Rate Rises in Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The delinquency rate on
consumer loans and credit cards jumped during the final quarter of
1998 as U.S. confidence in the economy and appetite for borrowing
increased.
</P>
<P>
The American Bankers Association said Wednesday that the
seasonally adjusted percentage of credit-card accounts 30 or more
days past due rose to a 15-month high of 3.45 percent in the
October-December quarter, from 3.28 percent in the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
A composite rate for other types of consumer loans, including
auto loans and closed-end home equity loans, increased to 2.35
percent in the fourth quarter, from 2.29 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
Economists said delinquencies tend to rise when debt levels
rise. Consumers took on slightly more debt at the end of last
year, partly due to a good job market, confidence in the economy
and a rise in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The banking industry, which earned a record 61.9 billion
dollar profit last year, is well positioned to handle the modest
increase in delinquencies.
</P>
<P>
Both delinquency rates remained below their peaks for the
decade -- 3.72 percent for credit cards during the last three
months of 1996 and 2.74 percent for other consumer loans during
July-September 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is expected to convene an urgent session on Kosovo, a Serbian
province, Wednesday afternoon, U.N. officials announced.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to hold the meeting, which will most
probably start at 4:00 p.m. EST, at the request of the Russian
Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to make a
statement and speak to the press at about 4:00 p.m. EST Wednesday,
said the officials. Earlier, they said that Annan would meet the
press at 3:00 p.m. EST. The statement will be the first of its
kind by the U.N. chief after NATO launched air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, asked for the urgent council meeting, and he is expected
to tell a closed-door session of the Security Council that his
government favors a political solution, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov is also expected to say at the Security Council that
Russia is firmly against any military action against Yugoslavia,
and such an action, without the authorization of the 15-member
Security Council, violates the principle of the U.N. Charter and
is detrimental to the multilateral cooperation in the world, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva
told a press conference that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is
expected to make a statement on Kosovo, the first of its kind
after NATO Tuesday ordered air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that the United Nations has
reduced the presence of humanitarian staff in Kosovo, but he did
not say how many have been pulled out of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the
Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, told a hour-long press
conference here that his government is ready to enter into
face-to-face talks, but Belgrade will fight back if NATO starts
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February last year in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's 2
million people, have been fighting Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> China Presents Computers to Ghana News Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Accra
Wednesday presented computers and accessories worth 25,000 U.S.
dollars to the state- owned Ghana News Agency (GNA) in the
Ghanaian capital as emergency relief.
</P>
<P>
The equipment is made up of six computers, five printers, two
UPS (uninterruptable power supplies), five air conditioners and
five television sets, according to the GNA .
</P>
<P>
The computer system of the GNA, the first news media to be
computerized in the country, broke down in November 1997 making
its operations very slow and cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Adotey, a Deputy Minister of Communications, in her
first public assignment since her appointment this month,
received the equipment on behalf of the agency, from Li Zupei,
the Chinese Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Adotey thanked the Chinese for their timely intervention and
said government will continue to assist the agency to maintain
its pinnacle role as the nation's leading news gatherer and
disseminator.
</P>
<P>
She described the Chinese assistance as "enlightened
philanthropism" which will go a long way to bring the GNA back on
its course of accurate and impartial news reporting and restore
its speed.
</P>
<P>
Li said Ghana and China have enjoyed a long tradition of
friendship in politics, economics, culture and now in news and
information.
</P>
<P>
He noted that last year the GNA and Xinhua news agency of
China signed a news exchange agreement and said this cooperation
will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Li said the donation "is to show the friendly sentiment from
the people of China to the GNA."
</P>
<P>
Sam Quaicoe, General Manager, GNA, said the donation marks
another milestone in the bid to rescue GNA from collapse.
</P>
<P>
The equipment will help to accelerate work at the agency by
curbing delays caused by reporters and sub-editors queuing for
work stations. "Our operations will go up by a substantial
margin," he said.

According to a statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the U.

time) and caused severe damages and casulties.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the international community and all
relevant parties to make concerted efforts for a prompt ease of
the tension and a solution to the crisis, as well as an early
restoration of peace in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo issue is the internal affairs of Yugoslavia," the
statement said, adding that it should be solved by the parties
involved.
</P>
<P>
All nations should respect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It also indicated that relevant parties have recently made
active efforts for the political settlement of the crisis, and the
Kosovo peace negotiations witnessed certain progress for a while.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated that the Chinese government has
consistently advocated to peacefully resolve the disputes through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
China has always opposed the use of force or the threat of the
use of force in international affairs, opposed interference in
other nation's internal affairs no matter what the excuse or by
what means, and particularly opposed any random action that
circumvents the U.N., the statement said.
</P>
<P>
China advocates to respect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all countries and the rights to choose their own
development road, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Last Model Of Famous Chinese Camera Produced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Today was the final day of
production of the venerable old Chinese DF-1 camera, the "Seagull",
which recorded many important moments in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The last version of the camera left the production line in
Shanghai. The camera was developed in 1963, when only a few
countries could produce similar cameras. There were more than 2
million of the cameras produced by the Shanghai Seagull Camera Co.
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xili, the general manager of the company, says that they
still sold 80,000 of the DF-1s last year, but that they decided to
stop production to pay more attention to digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
The company's products sell both in China and on the
international market. Its new model, the DC-33 digital camera,
will go on the market in June. By then, the company will be able
to produce 700 such cameras daily.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Economy to Grow 6 to 7 Percent in Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Wednesday set the targets of a high annual economic growth so
as to reach a level of development similar to its Southeast Asian
neighbors within two to three decades.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen announced the targets in his speech at the close of the
National Bank of Cambodia's annual conference, according to Bayon
Television Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister set the target of 6 to 7 percent annual
economic growth over the next two to three decades. "Without high,
sustainable economic growth, Cambodia cannot hope to alleviate the
poverty of its populace," Hun Sen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said Cambodia has the ability and opportunity to
achieve these ambitious goals but initially Cambodia's short- and
medium-term economic growth would be dependent on its ability to
attract foreign aid and investment.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his optimism was based on the recent
achievement of peace and political stability, the dismantling of
the political and military organization of the Khmer Rouge and a
new coalition government committed to political and economic
reform and to making the economy its first priority.
</P>
<P>
But Hun Sen pointed out that although foreign aid is crucial to
the economy in the short- and medium-term, a long-term strategy
must depend on the development of Cambodia's own economic
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "Cambodia cannot forever rely on
foreign capital. Therefore, endeavors should be geared toward
increasing domestic savings and taking action to implement budget
and fiscal reforms as well as to ensure a stable and secure
investment climate."
</P>
<P>
"I want to see Cambodia developed to the level of neighboring
advanced economies in the region and the Cambodian people
attaining a proper and decent living standard and enjoying
progress, prosperity and happiness," Hun Sen said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that given the favorable political climate and
security situation as well as the success of the reform programs
achieved since the new government was formed, Cambodia's GDP will
grow by 4 percent in 1999 and gradually increase to 7-8 percent
annually after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He also believed that the inflation rate will be contained at 5
percent, the exchange rate remain stable and the revenue increase
from 8-9 percent of GDP in 1998 to 13-14 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen said Cambodia should draw lessons from the
experiences of its neighbors, particularly lessons from the Asian
financial turmoil, in developing a sound and efficient financial
and banking sector.

<HEADLINE> None of British Planes Hit Kosovo Targets: General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) - Britain on Thursday admitted that
none of its warplanes hit their designated targets in Kosovo,
although it said a British submarine had successfully launched
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Defense Staff Charles Guthrie told a news
conference that six British ground-attack Harrier jets armed with
laser-guided bombs had been sent to attack an ammunition bunker
outside the Kosovo regional capital, Pristina, on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"The Harriers formed the third wave of a very concentrated
attack on that target. Because of explosions, fire and smoke
caused by the first two waves, our Harriers had difficulty in
seeing and maintaining lock on their targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Bombs from our first aircraft lost lock once they were in
flight and fell short of the target on open ground. As a result,
the following Harriers aborted their attack and returned to base
with their weapons," said Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
"This restraint and discipline underlines our determination to
avoid collateral damage and civilian casualties," he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched air strikes against a number of military targets
in Yugoslavia on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie said British submarine HMS Splendid had successfully
launched U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles against a radar
station near Pristina's airfield, but added that it was too soon
to give details of the damage inflicted.

<HEADLINE> German Party Against NATO Air Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn March 25 (Xinhua) -- German's Democratic Socialist Party (
PDS) Thursday spoke as a lone voice among Germany's main parties
opposing NATO air raids against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Gregor Gysi, parliamentary chief of the PDS, said that NATO
strikes should "end at once".
</P>
<P>
"They always say the war is directed against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic," Gysi said. "But who will be the dead?"
</P>
<P>
Bombs, he added, would not prevent a humanitarian catastrophe,
but worsen it.
</P>
<P>
The PDS, formerly the communist party of East Germany, holds 36
seats in lower parliamentary chamber, the Bundestag, and enjoys
wide support in eastern states.
</P>
<P>
The PDS on Thursday filed charges in the Karlsruhe-based German
Federal Constitution Court against the German government's
participation in NATO air raids, and called anti-war rallies in
Berlin and Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
Other German parties, including ruling Social Democrats (SPD)
and Greens, the main opposition Christian Democrats and their
Bavarian allies the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the Free
Democrats (FDP) all said the raids were "unavoidable".
</P>
<P>
"We can only hope that the Serbian side relents and signs the
Kosovo agreement," said Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who
the previous day had called on his countrymen to support what was
the first direct military action by Germans since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping called on the Belgrade
government "to silence the weapons", adding, "No one gives this
government the right to continue the murdering in Kosovo."

Thursday that a seasonally adjusted 289,000 people applied for
unemployment benefits last week, down 10,000 from the week before.
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth consecutive week of claims below the 300,000
mark, the longest such stretch and lowest sustained level since
1973. It demonstrated the strong demand for labor in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey, it shows factories have cut 337,000 jobs
since March 1998, but apparently laid-off workers are finding jobs
in service industries, which have been hurt less by international
conditions than export-dependent manufacturing companies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Call for Peace Prevails in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Soon after the U.S.-led NATO air
raids against Yugoslavia started early this morning (Bejing time),
China called for an immediate halt of the military actions, ease
of the tension, and restoration of peace in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin pointed out that China has always
stood for a political solution of the Kosovo issue. He stressed
that military actions can by no means resolve a country's internal
issues like the Kosovo crisis, and can only make it more
complicated and plunge the region into deeper turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
State Councilor and minister of national defense, said the Chinese
Government is opposed to any military settlement of the Kosovo
issue. He stressed that the issue should be brought back onto the
track of political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement soon after the
air strikes began in Yugoslavia, expressing China's "deep worries"
for the deterioration in the Balkan situation and strongly
demanding an "immediate halt" to the NATO's air raids against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterates that China has always been opposed to
the use of force or the threat of the use of force in
international affairs, opposed to the interference in other
nation's internal affairs no matter what the excuse or by what
means, and particularly opposed to any random action that avoids
the agreement by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
China advocates to respect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all countries and the rights to choose their own path
for development, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Hopes for Peaceful Solution to Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand hopes for a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis after the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) launched air strikes against Yugoslavia, the
Foreign Ministry said in an announcement here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Thailand opposes the use of force in solving
border, ethnic and religious problems.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the country calls for political negotiations to solve
the problems in that region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry also offered backing to the United
Nations, which it said should play a role in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow the United Nations' line, but if the
international community decides this is the best way to solve the
problem it should be that way," Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that negotiations are the best way because
air strikes may cause loss of life and have other bad
side-effects.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has given qualified support
to the strikes but criticized NATO for not seeking U.N. Security
Council backing.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Thai Commerce Ministry said the air strikes
will have limited impact on Thailand's exports, since the
country's trade with Yugoslavia is slim.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials also said there are no diplomatic
institutions or Thai citizens in the inflicted region.

Although Yugoslavia has suffered a great deal, "we are
determined to safeguard our nation and the freedom, independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador highly valued the just principled stand of China,
Russia and some other nations on the Kosovo issue. He said that as
it goes on, the war will destroy peace in Yugoslavia, the Balkan
region and even other areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
Some experts on international affairs here said that NATO's
explanation for its military actions is "farfetched and feeble,"
and that such actions openly trampling on international laws are "
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Yan Xuetong, a professor with the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations, pointed out that the
unilateral military actions the NATO launched without UN
authorization has severely undermined the decisive role of the UN
Security Council in peace-keeping. They will also make far-
reaching negative impact on international relations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO'open support of splittist forces, in particular, he
said, has set an abominable example in international relations.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo turned out a hot topic for ordinary Chinese today.
Hundreds of letters or phone calls reached the Yugoslav Embassy
here today to convey their sympathy, according to the Yugoslav
ambassador.

NICOSIA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said on Thursday that Cyprus supports a peaceful resolution of the
Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
In statements after a parade on the occasion of Greek
Independence Day, Clerides expressed the view that "Kosovo should
remain within Yugoslav boarders, with some form of autonomy for

turned down a peace proposal on the Kosovo issue.

Noting that "the Cyprus government supports a peaceful

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Many Asian countries Thursday
condemned or regretted NATO's military attacks Wednesday night
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with some urging an
immediate end to the hostility.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its serious concern over NATO's airstrikes which
started at 19:00 GMT Wednesday, India said, "Such unilateral moves
seriously undermine the authority of the entire United Nations
system."
</P>
<P>
India's External Affairs Ministry said in a statement that the
strikes, launched after negotiations and diplomatic efforts to
seek a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis failed, were in
violation of the U.N. Charter and amounted to interfering in the
internal affairs of a country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam also demanded an immediate end to the military attack
against Yugoslavia, saying NATO's action seriously violated the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia,
which is a member of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
NATO's military attack against Yugoslavia has triggered great
indignation in international community, including the Vietnamese
people and government, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government said it opposes the use of force
against Yugoslavia, stressing that the integrity and sovereignty
of Yugoslavia should be respected.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Indonesian
government regretted NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on NATO's airstrikes, Nepali Foreign Ministry
spokesman Narayan S. Thapa said, "The use of force will not lead
to solution of any issue."
</P>
<P>
"The parties involved in this issue should take immediate steps
to resume dialogue in finding a durable solution to the problem,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also called for political negotiations to solve
the problem in the region and offered backing to the

Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters that the
airstrikes are "an unavoidable step to prevent the number of
victims from further rising, which would be an atrocious event
against humanity."
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said, "History has told
us that you pay a much higher price if you do nothing."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon
said NATO's intervention in Kosovo is a "grave step but justified
and inevitable" in the circumstances.

<HEADLINE> No Better Ties With India Until Kashmir Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan reiterated Thursday
that its relations with India could not improve until the
long-standing Kashmir dispute is settled.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is of the view that until the core issue of Kashmir
is resolved in a mutually agreed manner, there could be no headway
in improving bilateral relations," said Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz while speaking at the closing ceremony of a special
diplomatic course here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan supports the legitimate struggle for
self-determination of the Kashmiri people, Aziz said, adding that
Pakistan will continue to extend political, diplomatic and moral
support to the Kashmiri people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the international community has also expressed
its concern over the Kashmir dispute, particularly since Kashmir
has become a nuclear flash-point after respective nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Afghan issue, Aziz said the spill-over
effects of war-torn Afghanistan have compelled Pakistan to take
continuing interest in the restoration of durable peace and
stability in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan maintains that peace can only be achieved
through an indigenous process and has endeavored to promote the
intra-Afghan peace process in support of the efforts of the United
Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that Pakistan has made efforts to cooperate with
Iran in restoring peace to Afghanistan. The return of about 1.5
million Afghan refugees in Pakistan to their homeland hinges on
the success of these quests for peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also supported Afghanistan, which has suffered
from the ravages of war for more than 20 years, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting Pakistan's foreign policy, Aziz said the strategic
thrust of Pakistan's policy has been to enhance trade and economic
relations, develop infrastructure for transportation and
communication links and to provide access to sea-port facilities
in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, also played an active role in human resource
development.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was one of the first countries to recognize the
independence of the Central Asian republics following the breakup
of the former Soviet Union, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It has since cemented its relations with these countries by
establishing resident missions in all the five Central Asian
republics and Azerbaijan and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan has a deep and abiding interest in the
progress and prosperity of the Central Asian region. It has also
been extending full moral, diplomatic, material and political
support to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the preservation of its
independence and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Certificates were awarded to 25 diplomats from the five Central
Asian republics and Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Latvia and
Mongolia, who participated in the special diplomatic course
conducted by Pakistan's Foreign Service Academy.

NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environmental
Program (UNEP) Executive Director, Klaus Toepfer, said here
Thursday that only by working closer with business and private
industry can the United Nations put a human face on globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Addressing the human, social and environmental consequences of
 globalization is one of the biggest challenges facing the world
today, " said the UNEP helmsman.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to look at the ecological consequences
of our current life styles and to integrate our efforts with
those of private industry," said Toepfer, a former German
Environmental Minister before holding the U.N. post.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer made his comments when referring to a speech made by
the U. N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the the World Economic
Forum in Switzerland in 1991. Annan proposed a global compact on
human rights, labor and the environment, appealing business
leaders to join the United Nations in initiating a global
agreement of shared values and principles, which will give a human
face to global market.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the Secretary-General's comments on globalization,
Toepfer said industry can uphold environmental standards by the
way they conduct their own business.
</P>
<P>
"They can also support a precautionary approach to
environmental challenges, undertake initiatives to promote
greater environmental responsibility and encourage the
development and diffusion of environmental friendly
technologies," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Official Slams Reduction of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A South African Foreign
Ministry official Thursday slammed the United Nations' plan to
reduce its presence in Africa, saying it was "unfair" and it would
isolate Africa from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on peacekeeping in Africa in
Johannesburg, acting chief director for southern Africa, Magang
Phologane, said the United Nations should continue to fulfill its
role in Africa, taking into consideration cultural sensitivities
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the United Nations' argument that it was
encouraging the continent to take charge of its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Phologane criticized Western countries' policy of moving away
from African peacekeeping. France, Britain, the United States and
Denmark have proposed reinforcement of African peacekeeping
capabilities instead of taking part in peacekeeping activities in
the continent themselves.
</P>
<P>
Phologane said the policy was "unfair" because it did not take
into account the contribution by African countries, such as
Nigeria and Ghana, in peacekeeping operations in countries outside
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This would only serve to remove Africa from the rest of the
world," he said, adding African troops have been involved in
conflicts in Lebanon and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
His view was supported by Major General Philip Sibanda of the
Zimbabwean national defense force, who was appointed field
commander and chief military observer of peacekeeping forces in
Angola a year after the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Angola had been a
failure from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. operation in Angola "appeared to be the
beginning of a deliberate effort by the United Nations to shift
peacekeeping emphasis from Africa to other parts of the world,
particularly Europe."
</P>
<P>
The shift in policy has become the major source of failure of
the U.N. peacekeeping efforts in Africa, Sibanda said.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said the U.N.'s present stance on Africa was likely to
lead to prolonged wars and suffering of the African people, as
regional groups could not replace U.N. missions due to fund
shortage and other political and economic reasons.

and solicitor generals, chairperson of the supreme court bar
association, members of national cricket and hockey teams during

sons up to 18 years old and unmarried daughters -- of the persons
mentioned in the categories.
</P>
<P>

visits of Pakistani tourist groups to India, according to the

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- "The Learning Revolution", a book
about methods of learning, has had an unexpectedly good response

</P>
<P>
The Chinese have bought 5 million copies of the book, or about

<P>
The book has caused a stir since it appeared in China last year.
The news media have carried 1,700 stories about it and Clever has
received tens of thousands of letters from readers.
</P>
<P>
People differ in their views about whether it really is a book
that can help people change the lives of their children, as Xie
Jin, a well-known Chinese film director, claims in a TV ad for the
book.
</P>
<P>
Xie said today that it was an honor to advertise the book, but
his opinion is not shared by Wang Hongwei, an editor of another
publishing house who says, "The promotion has made people believe
it is really worthwhile to buy the book, but it isn't as good as
one might expect upon reading it."
</P>
<P>
Song Chaodi, a general manager of Clever, seems little
concerned about the opposing remarks and says that the promotion
will continue and that he is confident that they will reach their
goal of 10 million copies sold.

<HEADLINE> Russia Will Not Confront NATO: German FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia has no intention of a
confrontation with the EU and NATO after the NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fisher gave the assurance after a telephone conversation with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, according to a Germany
foreign ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The conversation with Ivanov gave Fisher the impression that
Russia had no intention of adopting an antagonistic policy towards
the EU and NATO and it still hoped to develop mutual cooperation
with NATO, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Fisher called on Russia to play a constructive role in the
Kosovo issue, just as it did during the Kosovo peace talks in
Paris, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who is attending
the EU summit in Berlin, on Thursday expressed his hope that the
Yugoslav Federation would change its stance immediately after
NATO's first round of air strikes and sign the Kosovo peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Ask Court to Decide on KPU Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
said Thursday that he will ask the Supreme Court to issue a legal
instruction regarding a decision of the General Election
Commission (KPU) to bar cabinet ministers from election
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the justice minister to give his legal opinion on
the KPU's decision, then I will submit it to the ad interim home
affairs minister. He is asking for the Supreme Court's legal
instruction," the president said here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to leaders of the 48 political parties contesting the
June 7 general election during a meeting at the Presidential
Palace, Habibie said hopefully the country's highest court will
issue a legal instruction soon.
</P>
<P>
KPU decided Wednesday to bar all cabinet ministers and
all-level government officials from taking part in the election
campaign. However, leaders of the ruling Golkar strongly opposed
the decision because most ministers are from Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said he must respect legal supremacy, vowing that the
government will respect the Supreme Court's legal instruction,
whatever it may be.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Muladi said the government move to
ask for a legal instruction from the Supreme Court reflects its
goodwill to let the law prevail.
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of the General Election Commission Rudini
said Thursday that the body's decision to bar cabinet ministers
from joining the election campaign was reached democratically and
any effort to change it would show a lack of respect for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to them, KPU does not regulate ministers, it only
regulates the implementation of the general election, including
the campaign," Rudini said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was taken in a democratic way -- through voting,
if it will be changed, it means that they are not paying the KPU
any respect," he said, adding that the government has five
representatives in the commission who could convey the
government's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the commission will impose sanctions on
ministers who will violate the KPU decision. The commission could
even freeze the party's campaign, he added.

LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George

<P>
"There is no intention to sent ground troops there," Robertson

The British defense chief said last night's attack was the

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said here Thursday that Turkey supports the air strikes
launched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that Turkey supports NATO's decision to strike
Yugoslavia because "we are within the NATO."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Daily Hurriyet reported here Thursday that four
Turkish F-16 fighter jets took off from Ghedi air Base in
Italy late Wednesday night and joined the NATO operation against
Yugoslav Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a member of the NATO, has stationed 11 F-16
fighters in the NATO bases in Italy for any involvement into
the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The only military force in the world is NATO, there is
no other force. NATO does not belong to one country, it is
a collective and generally a defense force," said the Turkish
president.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the reason of intervention in Kosovo is to
protect people who suffer from massacre."
</P>
<P>
Demirel stated that U.S. President Bill Clinton had sent a
letter to him to give information on the latest situation in
Kosovo crisis and Turkey is ready to face the first
immigration wave from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News reported here Thursday that some 500
Kosovars, most of them women, children and elderly people,
arrived in Turkey for immigration over the last several days.

Many others are still on their way to Turkey, said the

<HEADLINE> World's Smallest Cell Phone Makes China Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The world's smallest mobile phone
is now available in China, with the release of Motorola's V998
model here today.
</P>
<P>
The model is smaller than a credit card and weighs 83 grams.
</P>
<P>
Jason Chen, a vice-president of Motorola, said at today's
release ceremony that the new model is specially designed as a
luxury product for the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
It has a Chinese display on the screen and can receive short
messages in Chinese. It has conference call and Internet features
and its double-frequency makes maximum use of China's network
capacities.
</P>
<P>
Motorola is releasing it simultaneously in Shanghai, Guangzhou,
and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
The world's major mobile telecommunications companies are
trying to get more Chinese customers with newer and better mobile
phones. Finland's Nokia released a new model with a metallic
appearance and Chinese screen display earlier this year. It has
obvious improvements in signal transmission and power capacity.
</P>
<P>
More colors can be seen in Erricsson's products. In has added
orange, tiel, and bright green to its maroon, yellow, indigo, and
dark green models.
</P>
<P>
China is the third largest mobile telecommunications market in
the world, with 11 million people added to its mobile telecom
system in 1998, bringing the total number to 24 million.
</P>
<P>
But its potential is to far from being completely exploited.
China's cell phone coverage is a mere 2 percent, as compared to 40
percent in developed countries, which is why major manufacturers
are paying more attention to products that have more powerful
functions as well as uniqueness and individual taste, analysts say.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A four-day Sri Lankan Industrial
Exhibition '99 was inaugurated by Minister of Industrial
Development C.V. Gunaratna at the Bandaranaike Memorial
International Conference Hall here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, the minister said the
exhibition is an important marketing event which helps project the
achievements of Sri Lanka's growing manufacturing and trading
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the sixth in the series of exhibitions
organized by the Industrial Development Board (IDB), will provide
an opportunity to expand business by finding new markets
nationally and internationally, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said it will also help attract new investors, seize joint
venture opportunities, facilitate export promotion and serve to
transfer technology.
</P>
<P>
One hundred leading companies in Sri Lanka displayed a range of
products including tea, rubber, coconut, spices, furniture,
handicrafts, textiles and garments, gems and jewelry, office
equipment, machinery and components.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been a traditional agricultural country, relying
heavily on plantation economy. To generate employment and
alleviate poverty, the Sri Lankan government has made great
efforts in developing industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the manufacturing sector for the first time overtook
the agricultural sector in terms of contribution to the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in 1991, the IDB has successfully staged five
industrial exhibitions and it expects the Industrial Exhibition
'99 to be even more successful.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by Minister of Provincial
Councils and Local Government Alavi Moulana, other senior
government officials and diplomatic envoys in Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: NATO Airstrikes Run Counter to World Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Huai Chengbo
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO's military action against
Yugoslavia on Wednesday runs counter to the current international
trend of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO forces' large-scale military action against
Yugoslavia has ruined the peace and stability of the Balkans, and
of all of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a member of the United
Nations, is an independent and sovereign country. The sanctity and
inviolability of independence, territorial integrity and
sovereignty have become international norms after the two world
wars and national liberation movements fought this century with
much loss of life. These internationally recognized norms are
embodied in the United Nations Charter, which took effect in
October 1945.
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War has highlighted the role of United
Nations, with the U.N. Charter and the norms of international law
as the main criteria to solve international disputes.
</P>
<P>
However, it is totally unacceptable to the international
community for NATO, a large military bloc which came into being
during the Cold War, to wage war against Yugoslavia, a non-aligned
country.
</P>
<P>
Europe has been torn by two world wars this century, with the
Balkans suffering particularly badly. With the end of the Cold War,
countries in the region have a shared wish for peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Only on March 19 this year, the foreign ministers of Romania,
Bulgaria, Turkey, Macedonia and Greece issued a joint statement at
the end of an emergency meeting in Bucharest, affirming that the
Kosovo crisis should be settled through political means under the
precondition that the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the quest for a lasting and peaceful
solution to the Kosovo issue is a matter of vital interest to the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
NATO's excuse for its air raids against Yugoslavia is totally
ill-founded. Kosovo is a Yugoslav province and the Kosovo issue is
Yugoslavia's internal affair. The conflict between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo has been deep-rooted, and grows more
intricate and complicated due to historical reasons. So it will
take time, patience and restraint to settle the problem through
dialogue, consultations and talks. The international community can
only mediate to accelerate the solution, but not interfere in the
internal affairs of a sovereign state, nor impose a solution.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the Yugoslav government has always
advocated a political solution to the Kosovo issue. And it is very
dangerous for the United States and some NATO countries, motivated
by their own interests, to "pour oil on the fire" of conflict
between ethnic groups in a country. Following such a policy can
only backfire. Events this century in the Balkans, long known as "
the powder keg", have adequately proved this.
</P>
<P>
The international community and all peace-loving people are
seriously concerned about the NATO-fueled war flames. At the
request of Russia and Yugoslavia, the United Nations Security
Council is holding an emergency meeting on the situation.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that NATO will cease its military action against
Yugoslavia and ease the tension to create conditions for the
resumption of peace talks by all parties.

"The crisis in Kosovo proves again Romania's importance as a
pillar of stability in the area, given its traditional good-
neighborly relations with all the countries in the area," Radu
Vasile told visiting Deputy Secretary-General of the Council of
Europe, Hans Christian Kruger.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister reiterated Romania's stance on finding a
peaceful solution to the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kruger appreciated Romania's contribution to secure the
stability in the area and in Europe and stressed the importance of
an institution such as the Council of Europe in managing conflicts,
in association with its member states and other European bodies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the possibility of Romania becoming a mediator
for a final settlement of the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The same day, the Romanian Foreign Ministry expressed in a
communique its worries about the latest political and military
developments in the Kosovo crisis, regretting that the diplomatic
measures had come unstuck.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was concerned that the effects of the crisis might
ripple through the region.
</P>
<P>
The NATO military intervention in Yugoslavia made headlines in
Romania's leading dailies.
</P>
<P>
Romania's President Emil Constantinescu issued a statement,
which was carried by most dailies, shortly before the start of the
NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The president reaffirmed Romania's "unconditional support for
efforts to settle the crisis through political dialogue and NATO
's efforts to immediately put an end to the conflict".

<HEADLINE> First Arab Campaigns for Premiership in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) - Israel's Arab legislator Azmi
Bishara announced Thursday his candidacy for the premiership in
the May elections, becoming the first Arab seeking Israel's
highest executive office.
</P>
<P>
With his chance of being elected as next prime minister
near zero, Bishara, a philosophy professor, said at a news
conference in Tel Aviv that his move aimed at drawing
attention to issues important to Arab Israelis in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Someone has to represent the interests of the Arabs and
stand up for what concerns them, from employment opportunities
for academics to villages not recognized by the state," Bishara
said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Arabs account for about one-fifth of Israel's population,
which reached some 6.04 million at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the previous elections in 1996, Bishara's party Balad,
or the National Democratic Assembly, ran together with the
left-wing Hadash party. The joint list won five seats in the
120-seat Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Another Arab coalition slate, the United Arab List (UAL),
won four seats in that elections.
</P>
<P>
Bishara's decision came after he rejected a call to drop
his bid for prime minister from the UAL, which decided its
Knesset list Wednesday and offered him No. 3 in the slot.
</P>
<P>
Israel's election law requires that prime ministerial
candidates must be the No.1 on their party's list.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that Bishara will forge an alliance with Arab
Renewal Movement, an Arab party led by Ahmed Tibi, advisor to
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Tibi has also refused to join the UAL, which compromises
the two Arab parties ran together in the 1996 elections and
a newcomer, the United National Front, which broke away from
the Hadash-Balad alliance.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Urges End to NATO Attack on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
Thursday issued a statement, demanding that NATO put an immediate
end to its military attack against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement said NATO's military attack against Yugoslavia
triggered great indignation in the international community,
including the Vietnamese people and government.
</P>
<P>
The statement said NATO's action seriously violated the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, which is a member of the United Nations.
The NATO action also violated the U.N. Charter and international
Law and caused grave damage to ordinary people's lives.
</P>
<P>
It said the NATO attack also made the Kosovo problem more
complicated, causing tension in the Balkan region and Europe as
well as the world and set a bad precedence in international
relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that it was regrettable that the
military attack occurred at a time when negotiations on Kosovo had
made some progress and was likely to lead to a peaceful solution
that would ensure the protection of the legitimate interests of
the involved parties in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the Vietnamese government and
people demand an immediate end to the military attack against the

achieved a great deal in economic and social development since it
started its reforms and opening-up drive 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>

growth as the Chinese people, under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee with General Secretary
Jiang Zemin at the core, overcame the difficulties of the Asian
financial crisis and the severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on the amendment to China's

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia is determined to
safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence,
and freedom, Yugoslavia's Ambassador to China Slobodan Unkovic
told the Chinese press this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a meeting with Chinese press following a
meeting with Cai Wu, deputy head of the International Department
of the Communist Party Central Committee. The ambassador also met
with Vice-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi earlier.

NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia violated the UN Charter
and international law, Unkovic said, and the invasion damaged
international order.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Yugoslavia has suffered enormous losses,
it will make every effort to defend itself, and if the invasion
continues, there will be no peace in Yugoslavia and the Balkans or
in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He called on people advocating peace to help stop the
aggression and spoke highly of the principled stance of China,
Russia, and some developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Yugoslav embassy in Beijing has received
hundreds of phone calls and letters from the Chinese people
expressing their concern, sympathy, and indignation and said: "We
are grateful for this."

<HEADLINE> Singapore Spends More on R&AMP;D in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The board said in its annual report Thursday that the private
sector spent 1.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 820 million U.S.
dollars) last year, up 7 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the gross expenditure on R&AMP;D of the public sector
comprising research institutes and centers as well as tertiary
institutes reached 930 million Singapore dollars (about 547
million U.S. dollars), an 18-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the ratio of the expenditure to GDP last
year was higher than the target of 1.6 percent for 2000 set out in
the five-year national science and technology blueprint (NSTP
2000). This put Singapore on track to reach the target of 2
percent set for year 2005, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The report said a healthy inflow of 1.08 billion Singapore
dollars (about 640 million U.S. dollars) worth of R&AMP;D investment
commitment by industry continued in 1998 and it is expected to
generate an estimated 15 billion Singapore dollars (about 8.82
billion U.S. dollars) in sales revenue for the companies and
create more than 1,500 research jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that hi-tech domestic exports in Singapore
reached 60.6 billion Singapore dollars (about 35.65 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998 and the proportion of hi-tech exports in the
total non-oil domestic exports increased to 66 percent in 1998
from 65 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, companies that undertake R&AMP;D reported
that 9.61 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.65 billion U.S.
dollars) of their sales revenue in 1997 were derived from
commercialized products and processes attributable to R&AMP;D
performed in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This represents 9.6 percent of the total sales revenue of the
companies in that year, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
According to the board, Singapore has an estimated 12,180
researchers in 1998, up 13 percent from 1997 and researchers per
10,000 labor force increased to 66, higher than the target of 65
for year 2000 set forth in the NSTP 2000.

<HEADLINE> CIS Supreme Military Body Denounces NATO Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Defense Ministers
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) condemned the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's air strikes against
Yugoslavia as a threat to the universal peace and security, and
called for political and legal means for a settlement of the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The council, the CIS supreme military organ, said in a
statement that NATO bypassed the U.N. Security Council in making
the decision to launch air strikes. It had breached the norms of
international law and opened a precedent in defying the U.N.
Security Council and breaking off the peace efforts to solve the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that NATO's military intervention in Kosovo
would have a disastrous impact on security in Europe and the
international political situation.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the international community to stall
NATO's military machine as soon as possible and return to settling
the crisis through political means.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who chaired the
council's meeting, said NATO's invasion of Yugoslavia was no
longer a simple conflict, but would "certainly lead to a second
Vietnam War."

KIEV, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry
Thursday expressed worry and concern over the on-going NATO
airstrikes at Serbian military targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>

In the meanwhile, the statement also said that the airstrike
followed the failure of the last-ditch peace talks between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. Balkan envoy

and the international community to take instant actions to prevent

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Calls For Halt To NATO Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian said
here today that China strongly appeals to NATO for an immediate
halt to air raids against Yugoslavia and for a political
settlement to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are gravely worried about the situation in the Balkan
region, where NATO airstrikes resulted in heavy losses of human
life and property," Chi said during a meeting with Surinam's
Defense Minister Ramon Dwarka Panday.
</P>
<P>
"The airstrikes also made the Kosovo issue more complicated and
the situation in the Balkan region more turbulent," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has always called for a political
settlement to the Kosovo issue and is opposed to settling it by
military means. Kosovo is an internal affair of Yugoslavia and the
matter should be resolved by the parties involved, he said, and
that the international community should respect the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chi discussed China's domestic situation and military
development and said that China maintains that all countries, no
matter what their size, are equal. China has devoted itself to a
defensive policy and will definitely not form military coalitions
with foreign countries, will not set up military bases abroad, and
will not station troops abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chi went on to say that ties between China and Surinam have
made quite a lot of progress since diplomatic ties were
established over 20 years ago and he expressed his appreciation
for and thanks to Surinam's sticking to the "One-China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Surinam and China share many views and both adhere to a foreign
policy of peace, Panday said, and Surinam treasures its ties with
China and considers China a reliable and trustworthy friend.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Reaffirms Trial of KR Leaders at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Wednesday reiterated that Khmer Rouge (KR) leaders would be
tried at home.
</P>
<P>
In his second letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan which
was released here Thursday, Hun Sen stated that the investigation
and trial of Ta Mok and other KR leaders would be carried out by
Cambodian courts, if the courts were sure that they had committed
genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister reaffirmed that "according to article 33
of our constitution and the article 6 of the genocide convention,
KR leaders should be tried at home."
</P>
<P>
On March 3, Hun Sen sent his first letter to Annan in which he
stated his stance against an international tribunal for KR
leaders.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hun Sen said, in order to meet the standards
of an international trial, the royal government welcomes the
assistance of foreign legal experts in a Cambodian trial. But the
number of foreign experts should be decided by Cambodian courts,
even the government has no right to intervene, Hun Sen stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As to whether only Ta Mok or all other former KR leaders
should be tried, it would also depend on the court. The Cambodian
government would not exert its influence or intervene in it," Hun
Sen reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also asked Annan to make his letter a formal
document of the 53rd U.N. General Assembly to clear up the
misunderstanding which was harmful to Cambodia's peace, stability
and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cambodian National Assembly President Prince
Ranariddh said Thursday after meeting with U.N. human rights envoy
Thomas Hammarberg that he agreed with Hun Sen to try KR leaders at
Cambodian courts because of the prime minister's insistence, but
he hoped that the trial would be fair and independent.
</P>
<P>
Ta Mok, the recently captured last KR leader, is still detained
in Phnom Penh's Military Prosecution Department prison.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao has
praised China's first national survey on agriculture and said that
the results should be used for economic and social development
policies in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Wen told a meeting on the survey on Wednesday that the survey
has helped draw farmers closer to the Communist Party of China and
the government and that it has helped the Party and the government
better understand the real situation in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
He explained that more than 7 million people helped with the
investigation in more than 200 million rural households, more than
700,000 villages, more than 40,000 towns and townships, and 1.4
million township and village enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The respondents were asked to fill in form about cultivated
land, labor, farming conditions, and rural development.
</P>
<P>
Wen called the survey a relatively true reflection of the
country's agricultural and rural development situation. It also
shows that most of the statistical data and information of
previous years are reliable.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the survey provides a foundation for
restructuring and improving statistics gathering in rural areas.

PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the last diplomatic maneuvers failed to persuade
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the peace plan for
Kosovo, NATO launched airstrikes on Yugoslavia at 20:00 Thursday.
But if Milosevic does not yield to the bombings, it is a question
as for whether the Western countries will send ground troops to
Serbia and what political solution they will impose.
</P>
<P>
-- Many French political personalities have criticized France's
participation in the NATO air raids against Yugoslavia. At the
National Assembly, the doubt over the justification for the NATO
action is greater than it was during the Gulf War eight years ago.
The French government will organize a debate without vote starting
Friday at the National Assembly over the NATO action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A war has broken out in Europe after NATO began bombing the
Serbs Thursday evening in an operation aimed at bending Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
-- After NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia, it has
stepped over the dangerous line between deterrence and military
action and the whole system of group security of Western countries
is shaking in an unknown destiny.

<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have
agreed to establish an ASEAN regional economic surveillance
process, the ASEAN Secretariat said in a press release here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under a technical cooperation agreement signed by the two sides
Wednesday, the ADB will provide a grant amounting to 707,000 U.S.
dollars to finance technical training of an ASEAN Technical
Support Unit (ATSU) to be based in the ADB headquarters in Manila
over a period of two years.
</P>
<P>
The ATSU will provide support for the ASEAN Surveillance
Coordinating Unit, which has been established in the ASEAN
Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia. ASEAN will provide a
counterpart support equivalent to about 200,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN finance ministers agreed in October 1998 to establish an
economic surveillance process in response to the regional economic
and financial crisis. The surveillance process will keep track of
macroeconomic indicators and short-term capital flows as an early
warning system to help prevent the recurrence of the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN surveillance process aims to fill the gap between
national and global surveillance processes led by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Since July 1997, some of the ASEAN countries have been
suffering from a prolonged economic crisis.

<P>
Although it has been several years since a Chinese leader
visited his country, he said, exchanges of visits and cooperation
at various levels between the two countries have maintained strong
momentum.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred Chinese enterprises have offices in the
Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
China and Bangladesh have maintained excellent relations that
have never weakened, Farooq said, explaining that the reason they
can keep this satisfying development lies in the fact that they
share similar views on international affairs. Bangladesh strongly
supports China's peaceful reunification cause and stance on Taiwan,
Tibet, and human rights and China has always extended a helping
hand to Bangladesh in many ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
Even though China is a large country it advocates equality for
all countries no matter what their size, he said, and it has won
the Bangladeshi people over as a friendly and reliable neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Farooq praised China's current foreign policy of peace and said
that it has, as the world's largest developing country,
steadfastly pursued equal rights for all developing countries,
including Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
All developing countries look to China, which has an image of a

<HEADLINE> Japan Selected as Open Tourist Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan will soon become the 10th
open destination country for Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Outbound travel for Chinese tourists traveling at their own
expenses is arranged subject to certain limitations stipulated in
existing government policies, with the government designating
destination countries and regions, as well as travel agencies
approved to handle related tours.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, New
Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Macao are currently
open destinations. The State Council recently approved Japan as a
new destination, and tourism industries in the two countries are
engaged in negotiations covering tour arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's selection as a tourist destination will be conducive
to further development of the nation's tourism industry and the
promotion of exchanges between the people of the two countries,"
according to Toshinobu Ikubo, director of the Beijing Branch of
the Japan National Tourist Organization, which opened earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Ikubo expressed his belief that China will provide a huge
potential market and predicted that the number of Chinese tourists
visiting Japan will hit several hundred thousand over the next few
years. He also noted the possibility that China will become
Japan's major source market within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said his office plans to conduct a survey in April to
determine the interests of Chinese tourists. "Japanese travel
agencies will be able to use the results to create tour
itineraries and programs desired by Chinese tourists," Ikubo said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that prices for travel to Japan are higher than for
various Asian countries, but are almost the same as those for
Europe and North America. "China continues to enjoy economic
stability and we expect that a constantly increasing number of
Chinese citizens will be able to afford trips to Japan, especially
affluent people living in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai
and Guangzhou," said Ikubo.

MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny

(NATO) stop its military actions against Yugoslavia, which started
1900 GMT Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said at a government meeting that the NATO airstrike
is a grave threat to stability and the international order formed
after World War II and the Cold War and NATO's aggression against
a sovereign country is a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter.

<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Minister George
Robertson said on Thursday NATO would not put ground forces into
Kosovo but would keep up its bombing of Yugoslavia until Belgrade
agreed to a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, speaking on GMTV a day after air attacks started on
Yugoslavia, said NATO was confident it could damage the country's
military capability solely through bombing.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the war would be escalated by using ground forces,
Robertson said: "We are not going to fight our way into Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must realize after
Wednesday night's bomb attacks that NATO "means business", he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope he will think again about his obstinacy," Robertson
said. "We have got the stomach to carry this through."
</P>
<P>
But in Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev claimed
Thursday that Russia had intelligence showing NATO was preparing
for a ground operation in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russian news agencies quoted him as saying some 22,000 NATO
ground troops were being readied.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Investors Cashing In On Hi-Tech Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Hu Fengwu, a retired clothing
designer in Shanghai, may be busy getting lunch ready in the
kitchen, but she still takes time to go into the living room to
get a quick glimpse of the TV where figures from the local stock
exchange are being shown.
</P>
<P>
"I paid 800 yuan for a decoder from Shanghai Cable TV Station,"
Hu says, explaining how she can follow the market, something that
was nothing but a dream for would-be investors in the '80s, when
the stock exchange re-opened after lying dormant for decades.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, there was no computer, no monitoring screen -
nothing at all," recalls "Millionaire Yang", a well-known local
pioneer and legendary success whose real name, Yang Huading, is
less well-known.
</P>
<P>
Investors had to stay at a stock office during trading hours,
he recalls, and first agreed on a price orally, then wrote it down
on a blackboard, and then went through a complicated and slow
procedure of everything from registering to paying.
</P>
<P>
The Computer Age hit China's securities business in 1991, when
the exchanges opened in Shanghai and Shenzhen, a special economic
zone in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
A number of specialized newspapers and magazines also began to
appear, but people who wanted to get simultaneous information
about market fluctuations still had to sit in front of screens at
trading outlets.
</P>
<P>
Then, more recently, as the stock market boomed, the fast-
developing hi-tech industry began providing investors with
sophisticated equipment like personal stock monitoring systems for
use in the home. Investors also began to spend more money for the
most advanced equipment to make money quicker, one local observer
says.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, about 30 million Chinese trade
on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and a similar number on the
Shenzhen Exchange. But, because many of them trade on the two
exchanges simultaneously, it is hard to get exact figures.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 800 companies have gone public in China,
and, as a greater number of large, better-performing state
companies join in, the stock business just keeps booming.

PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the last diplomatic maneuvers failed to persuade
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the peace plan for
Kosovo, NATO launched airstrikes on Yugoslavia at 1900 GMT
Wednesday. But if Milosevic does not yield to the bombings, it is
a question as for whether the Western countries will send ground
troops to Serbia and what political solution they will impose.
</P>
<P>
-- Many French political personalities have criticized France's
participation in NATO air raids against Yugoslavia. At the
National Assembly, the doubt over the justification for the NATO
action is greater than it was during the Gulf War eight years ago.
The French government will organize a debate without vote from
Friday at the National Assembly over the NATO action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A war has broken out in Europe after NATO began bombing
Serbian targets Thursday evening in an operation aimed at bending
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
-- After NATO launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia, it has
stepped over the dangerous line between deterrence and military
action and the whole system of group security of Western countries
is shaking in an unknown destiny.

<HEADLINE> India Expresses Serious Concern Over NATO Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday expressed its
serious concern over NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia Wednesday
night, saying such unilateral moves seriously undermine the
authority of the entire United Nations system.
</P>
<P>
The External Affairs Ministry said in a statement that the
strikes were in violation of the U.N. charter and amounted to
interfering in the internal affairs of a country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Indian government reiterated that the
Kosovo crisis could only be resolved through peaceful means and a
solution found within the framework of the national sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed India's concern about the
possibility of the spread of the conflict, adding that this
demonstration of NATO's "extra territorial engagement" is a
development that could only cause anxiety.
</P>
<P>
It urged that all military actions be brought to a halt, that
peace be given a chance and that Yugoslavia be enabled to resolve
its internal issues internally.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the strikes, the External Affairs Ministry issued a
statement Wednesday evening, urging the parties concerned to
resolve the Kosovo crisis "through peaceful means, through
consultation and dialogue, and not through either confrontation or
any military action, unilateral or otherwise."

MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines got 4.5 billion
U.S. dollar in Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) pledges for
1999 at the World Bank Consultative Group Meeting for the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Affairs Analysts Criticize NATO Air Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese military analysts today
criticized the United States and NATO for their air strikes
against Yugoslavia and warned that the air raid could escalate
into something worse and even become a disaster of the mankind at
the turn of the century if it is not halted immediately.
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO have violated the international law
and the United Nations Charter, Chen Bojiang, a research fellow of
international strategies of the Chinese Academy of Military
Sciences, said, adding that they have infringed upon a sovereign
state and interfered in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Balkan situation could deteriorate and called
the action "premeditated."
</P>
<P>
Russia which has close ties with Yugoslavia quickly responded,
saying that it will provide Yugoslavia with powerful weapons and
technical aid, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes could further escalate into a disaster for both
Yugoslavia and the rest of the world if the United States and NATO
continue to disregard the strong opposition from the world
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang Yuliang of China's National Defense University
called the air strikes "typical naked aggression of the weak by
the strong."
</P>
<P>
He said that he is confident that Yugoslavia would win world-
wide support in the fight to protect its sovereignty and dignity
because, as a Chinese proverb goes, "a just cause gains great
support, while an unjust one gains little".
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO will have to pay heavily for what
they are doing as the Yugoslav people are known for their
tradition of resisting foreign aggression.

<HEADLINE> ITTF Likely to Split Table Tennis Worlds, President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF) President Xu Yinsheng said Thursday night the
World Table Tennis Championships (WTTC) might be split into two
events.
</P>
<P>
Xu said ITTF would discuss over the suggestion that the
individual and team events be held separately in an aim to reduce
the size and length of the championships.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF Executive Committee held a tele-conference Thursday
night Beijing time, which decided to move the Table Tennis Worlds
out of the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
The championships was previously scheduled to take place for
April 26-May 5.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen hours before the ITTF tele-conference, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began its airstrike at Serbian
targets across Yugoslavia late last night.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February last year between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the
province's population of 2 million and have been fighting for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Attending the tele-conference were six ITTF Executive Committee
members including President Xu Yinsheng, Deputy President and CEO
Adham Sharara, Executive Vice Presidents Hans Giesecke, George
Segun and Yapo Yong Yih.
</P>
<P>
ITTF said in statement that they "sincerely appreciate the
great efforts made by its member, the Yugoslav Table Tennis
Association, and by the organizing committee of the 45th Table
Tennis Championships in the preparations to stage the WTTC."
</P>
<P>
"However, in light of the current situation in Yugoslavia and
to ensure a successful staging of the WTTC, the ITTF Executive
Committee, after serious consideration and consultation, has
unanimously decided to reschedule and relocate the WTTC to a later
date."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Currency Plunges Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian currency of Naira
exchange rate plunged this week at the Autonomous Foreign Exchange
Market (AFEM).
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank devalued the Naira by 4.34 percent on
Wednesday as its exchange rate plunged from 86.25 to 90 Nairas to
one U.S. dollar. Last week, Naira's value went down by 0.3
percent against the dollar for the first time of Naira devaluation
in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The This Day newspaper quoted a bank treasurer as saying
Thursday that " there is crisis in the market this morning
(Wednesday) as the Naira has depreciated beyond the expectations
of the operator."
</P>
<P>
Operators believe that the central bank's decision may have
been informed by its inability to meet the rising level of foreign
exchange demand at the market.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the central bank said the new rate was
introduced to curtail capital flight and reduce demand at the
market.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has earmarked some 4.4 billion dollars
for the funding of the foreign exchange market this year in the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
In the past six weeks, the average demand for foreign exchange
is over 100 million dollars per week, a figure considered high by
market watchers in view of the amount budgeted for the market this
year.
</P>
<P>
The rising level of demand at the market has been attributed to
the fact that foreign exchange end users, especially the
manufacturers, are accumulating forex for import of essential raw
materials for their production activities in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the devaluation, market analysts explained that
the action will result in higher prices of goods and services in
the country.
</P>
<P>
They believe that there will be increase in the price of
imported goods especially used in the production process of
manufacturing companies in the country.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details Russia "Above" U.S. in Not Using Extreme Measures: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Thursday said Russia would not take "extreme measures" in response
to NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia because Russia is "morally
above" the United States, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a meeting with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
Yeltsin denounced Wednesday's air strikes as a big mistake by U.S.
diplomacy and President Bill Clinton and said the U.S. would be
held accountable for the first violation of the U.N. Charter since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
"We have extreme measures in reserve but we have decided not to
use them. We are above that," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian Foreign Ministry has decided on due
responses under the present situation, including canceling a visit
to Washington by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, calling back
Russia's representative to NATO, scrapping planned war games and
contacts with NATO, and urging the U.N. Security Council to put an
end to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that he had a long and serious telephone
conversation with President Clinton on Wednesday night, expressing
doubt on the efforts of the two of them for the international
security and disarmament of strategic weaponry.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between Yeltsin and Ivanov, Ivanov said the
president authorized him to use all diplomatic means to stop the
aggression against Yugoslavia and launch the negotiation process.

<HEADLINE> ITTF Decides to Relocate Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF) announced on Thursday to strip Belgrade of the
right to host the 45th World Table Tennis Championships (WTTC).
</P>
<P>
ITTF Executive Committee held on a tele-conference Thursday
night Beijing time, which decided to move the Table Tennis Worlds
out of the Yugoslavian capital.
</P>
<P>
The championships was previously scheduled to take place for
April 26-May 5.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee said they would discuss over the next
days all the consequences, issues and solutions related to the
decision to relocate the WTTC.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen hours ago, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
began its airstrike at Serbian targets across Yugoslavia late last
night.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February last year between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the
province's population of 2 million and have been fighting for
independence. The armed Kosovo Albanians, with exterior assistance
in arms and money, have been staging terrorist actions in a bid to
achieve its separatist goal.
</P>
<P>
Attending the tele-conference were six ITTF Executive Committee
members including President Xu Yinsheng, Deputy President and CEO
Adham Sharara, Executive Vice Presidents Hans Giesecke, George
Segun and Yapo Yong Yih.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand Begin Joint Border Patrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian and Thai soldiers
Thursday began their joint patrol at the demarcation line between
Malaysia's Perak state and Thailand's Yala Province along their
common border, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
The launching of Thursday's joint border patrol marked the
first simultaneous and coordinated effort to maintain peace along
their 552-km long common border.
</P>
<P>
"It was proof of the success of the combined effort to boost
cooperation between the two armed forces," Malaysia's 2nd Division
Commander Maj. Gen. Khairuddin Mat Yusof told a press conference
after the launching at Pengkalan Hulu, Perak, bordering Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 soldiers from Malaysia's 303 Infantry Battalion and
another 60 from Thailand's 455 Border Patrol Police are patrolling
within a radius of one km in their respective sides.
</P>
<P>
They are moving simultaneously and officers from both forces
will monitor their progress at the headquarters sited at Pengkalan
Hulu, Khairuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, both security forces had maintained operations
unilaterally along their own respective border, he said, adding
that the new approach would contribute to better security along
the border and enhance the good relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Khairuddin, commander of the Combined Task Force, said that
through such cooperation, both countries could effectively
maintain security along the border while smuggling activities
could also be reduced.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urges Zambia to Lift Controversial Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has started talks with Zambia to urge the
latter to lift its 25 percent specific import tariff, the Times of
Zambia newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the COMESA treaty has authorized its
secretary- general to take the Zambian government to the COMESA
court over this disputable tariff, but Erastus Mwencha, the
secretary-general, has ruled out the possibility at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha was quoted as saying that "there is that possibility,
but there is no need to go that far because the Finance Ministry
(of Zambia) and COMESA have agreed on nearly all points in our
talks and we are working with them to reach a decision."
</P>
<P>
In order to check the influence of imports on the country's
industries, Zambia has imposed a 25-percent specific tariff on
those imports from both COMESA and non-COMESA member states.
</P>
<P>
As a COMESA member, Zambia has to get the green light from the
regional organization before it can impose duty for the purpose of
checking dumping by presenting proof of dumping.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Zambia has not fulfilled these conditions.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi announced the imposition
of the duty in this year's budget report. Since then, the prices
of some imported goods have gone up sharply in the country, some
increased as much as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, COMESA urged Zambia to adhere to the organization's
agreement which stipulated zero-rating of their tariff among its
member countries by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Trade Surplus in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This compared with the 919 million rand (148 million dollars)
surplus in January and the 599 million rand (97 million dollars)
surplus recorded in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Customs and excise figures released Wednesday showed a 15.7
percent decline in imports to 10.17 billion rand (1.6 billion
dollars) last month compared with January, and an 11.8 percent
drop in exports to 11.45 billion rand (1.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Compared with February a year ago, imports were 3.5 percent
lower and exports rose 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed last month's higher-than-expected surplus
to a decline in imports, which reflected weak domestic demand and
the price effects of the rand's depreciation.
</P>
<P>
They said the slowdown in exports was not a big surprise, given
weak world growth and low commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the fall in imports also underlined the effect
of high interest rates in South Africa, which spiked to 25.5
percent last August. The rates have been subsequently lowered to
the present level of 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker Denies Postponing Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council Ahmed Qureia denied on Thursday reports that
the Palestinians will postpone the declaration of an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio over telephone
from West Bank town of Ramallah, Qureia said a meeting is to be
held next month among all Palestinian institutions to discuss the
outcome of consultations held with other countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the consultations, a decision is to be adopted
regarding the issue of declaring the Palestinian state, he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has announced that he will
declare the Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year interim
self-rule period enshrined in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires
regardless of the result of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Due to Israel's opposition to the possible Palestinian step,
including a threat to annex the parts of the West Bank under its
control, many countries have advised Arafat to postpone declaring
the Palestinian state in a bid to avoid complicating the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's foreign visits are aimed at posting the world
community on the crisis in the peace process and the Palestinians'
right to self-determination, the Palestinian speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat have been consulting with world leaders on the
declaration of the Palestinian state in the recent weeks and
trying to win their support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians' possible move results from the signed peace
agreements between the Palestinians and Israel, which have defined
the transitional phase, Qureia said, stressing that the demand is
based on the international legitimacy.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Airlines to Buy Australian Ansett Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Medium Giant Rupert
Murdoch's News Ltd Thursday announced it would sell its half share
in Ansett Holdings Ltd, Australia's second biggest airlines, to
long-time suitor Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) for 317 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that this share exchange would give Anssett the
necessary financial firepower to truly compete with Qantas Airways
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval,
represents the SIA's single largest offshore investment and brings
to Ansett the capital might to wrestle market share from
Australia's dominant carrier.
</P>
<P>
"This announcement guarantees there are two strong aviation
entities in Australia," Ansett executive chairman Rod Eddington
told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Apart from meeting foreign investment laws, the sale of News
Ltd's 50 percent stake in Ansett must also pass due diligence and
Air New Zealand (Air NZ) Ltd's pre-emptive right to buy News Ltd's
holding.
</P>
<P>
Air NZ owns the other 50 percent of Ansett but is unlikely to
exercise its pre-emptive right and pursue 100 percent ownership.
</P>
<P>
"Air NZ will examine all aspects of the opportunity presented
by the sale of News Corp's shareholding in Ansett," an Air NZ
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
SIA deputy chairman and chief executive officer Cheong Choong
Kong said he was confident the Ansett deal would be bedded down
early in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cheong stressed Ansett would remain a Melbourne-based
Australian company that would benefit from the SIA's international
standing.
</P>
<P>
"Ansett is a gem. It is an opal we would like to help polish
and bring to full brilliance," Cheong said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to assist Ansett to become a stronger and more
competitive Australian and international carrier."
</P>
<P>
SIA, Ansett and Air New Zealand already have a code-sharing
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Calls Halt of Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today that China strongly appeals to the NATO to
"immediately halt" air raids against Yugoslavia and to opt for a
political settlement of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply worried about the situation in the Balkan region,
where NATO'S airstrikes had resulted in heavy losses of human
life and property for a great deal of innocent people," Chi said
during a meeting with visiting Surinamese Defense Minister Ramon
Dwarka Panday.
</P>
<P>
"The airstrikes had also made the Kosovo issue more complicated
and the situation in the Balkan region more turbulent, Chi noted.
Chi is also a Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a state councilor.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly urge the NATO to halt air raids immediately to
ease the tension as soon as possible so as to bring back the
Kosovo issue onto the track of political settlement and to effect
the restoration of peace at an earlier date in the Balkan region,"
the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has always stood for a political
settlement of the Kosovo issue and is opposed to its settlement by
military means. The Kosovo issue comes within the internal affairs
of Yugoslavia and should be resolved by parties involved
themselves, the minister said, stating that the international
community should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Yugoslavia.

NICOSIA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus House of
Representatives (parliament) on Thursday described the use of
force against Yugoslavia as an "unacceptable provocation of
the international order and the U.N. Charter".
</P>
<P>
In a statement on behalf of the parliamentary parties, House
President Spyros Kyprian said "no resolution of the Security
Council authorizes NATO or any country to sue military force
against Yugoslavia".
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said no doubt the bombardments "will not solve
the Kosovo problem".
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he said, they will increase human pain,
worsen the refuge problem and "create conditions of instability
and uncertainty in the sensitive Balkan area."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the international law advocates avoidance
of use of force.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency said all Cypriot political parties have

<HEADLINE> Iran Regrets over NATO Air Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran Thursday expressed regret and
grave concern over the air strikes launched by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) forces on Yugoslavia, stressing
military attacks will only complicate the situation in the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said
the air strikes, which were launched by NATO without consent from
the U.N. Security Council, will not help solve the Kosovo crisis,
but will spread the tension to other regions.
</P>
<P>
"Any kind of confrontation, tension and military attack will
only complicate the situation and the crisis in the Balkans," he
said, according to Tehran radio.
</P>
<P>
Asefi underlined the need to continue political efforts to
solve the Kosovo crisis, which deepened in February last year when
ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province sought independence from
the serb-led government.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Tehran's readiness to use its influence to help
the international community solve the Kosovo crisis as Iran
enjoys ancient and traditional relations with all governments,
nations and people in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces, led by the U.S. and Britain, on Wednesday
launched long-threatened air strikes on various parts of
Yugoslavia after what the NATO said political efforts were
exhausted.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Softer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar meandered
through the local session Thursday, drifting lower after a series
of failed attempts to sustain a break through the 64 U.S. cent
mark.
</P>
<P>
Steve Chater from IBJ Australia said the local currency had
traded quietly on the day with little in the way of directional
cues to guide it.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney the Australian dollar was trading at
63.60 U.S. cents from Wednesday night's close of 63.85 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Commodity and metal prices were lower Wednesday night in the
United States, impacting on the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau index closed at 188.71, 1.16
weaker than the previous finish.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar traces movements in commodity prices
because around two thirds of its exports are raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was buying 75.16 Japanese yen
from 75.02 yen and 0.5840 euro from 0.5853 euro Wednesday last.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The '99 Fortune Global Forum will

between September 27-29.
</P>
<P>
John Needham, president of the Conference Division of Fortune,
a subsidiary of U.S.-based Time Warner Inc., announced Shanghai's
selection as the host city during a Thursday press conference.
</P>
<P>
The forum, carrying the theme China: The Next 50 Years, will
focus on business opportunities and challenges, economic issues,
and practical realities related to conducting business in China
both today and in the next century, according to Needham.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "convening the last and most important Fortune
Global Forum of this century in Shanghai represents our belief
that China will occupy an important position in the international
economy in the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
Gu Yaoming, director of the International Bureau under the
State Council Information Office, said senior Chinese leaders
attach great importance to the event. He also noted that President
Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription expressing hope for a highly
successful forum.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 multinational corporations, including General
Electric, the American Insurance Group and Nokia, have confirmed
they will attend the forum.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned multinationals employ an average 41,000
workers and have average annual sales of over 13 billion US
dollars, according to Gu.
</P>
<P>
Needham said he expects the Shanghai forum to be the most
important event since initiation of the program in 1995. Previous

<HEADLINE> More Countries Pledge to Support Thai WTO Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- More countries, including Morocco
which withdrew its bid, have pledged to shift their backing to
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi in the race for
the top post of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
A senior Thai foreign ministry official said here Thursday that
the countries, most of them Muslim nations, made the pledge after
Morocco's former Trade Minister Hassan Abouyoub pulled out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also Commerce Minister, is the only candidate from
the developing world to run against New Zealand's former Prime
Minister Michael Moore for the WTO's new director-general seat.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's ambassador told me that Cairo would switch its support
to Dr. Supachai and would help lobby 21 other member states of the
Arab League to do so, while Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
also promised to back Supachai and would urge other members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council to do the same," Kobsak Chutikul,
Director-General of the Department of Economic Affairs, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the Moroccan representative in Geneva also promised
that his country would call for all developing countries to
support Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador to Bangkok William Fisher reportedly said
that he would urge South Africa to support Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, with a strong support base in Asia, was now clearly
ahead of Moore in the race that has entered its final phase,
according to reports reaching here from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Many countries in the Caribbean have also shifted their support
to Supachai after changing from the Moroccan candidate, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries, like Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands
and France, were also leaning towards Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Moore has the support from Germany, Austria, Italy and Sweden
and crucially the United States, although Washington has said it
would not object to Supachai if support for him is extensive.
</P>
<P>
The selection of a new WTO director-general has actually become
a two-man race between Supachai and Moore. Canadian High
Commissioner in London Roy Maclaren, another candidate, enjoyed
little support and had little chance of winning the post,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Morocco's candidate Hassan withdrew from the race after losing
his crucial support base in Africa amid rumors that he had
promised his support in the Middle East and Africa to Moore in
exchange for the job of deputy director-general if Moore was
selected.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and they are to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote
be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The term of outgoing Italian chief Renato Ruggiero ends on
April 30. The WTO is trying to select a new chief by the end of
this week.
</P>
<P>
The new chief will have to steer the organization to the
expected launch in December of fresh global trade organizations,
to last until 2003.

<P>
"The objective (of NATO military action) is to curb the
capacity of Milosevic's army to repress the Kosovo Albanians,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"We will carry on until we achieve that," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also insisted that "we are not prepared to contemplate
ground troops."
</P>
<P>
He said Milosevic must recognize that a peace plan already
signed by the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo offered "not only a fair
deal to Kosovo Albanians but also a fair deal to Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
He declined to say how long NATO military action, which began
on Wednesday night, might continue if Milosevic was not willing to
talk peace.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Protest NATO Strikes at U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia will soon table a draft
resolution to the U.N. Security Council condemning NATO's air
strikes against Yugoslavia and demanding an immediate end to the
military action, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov made the statement after an emergency cabinet meeting
ordered by President Boris Yeltsin, chaired by Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and attended by leaders of all power organs of
the government.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting analyzed consequences of NATO's air
strikes on Yugoslavia late Wednesday and discussed Russia's
responding alternatives under the present situation, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would not use force in solving the Kosovo issue,
neither did the cabinet meeting mention the idea of "force for
force."
</P>
<P>
On Russia's possible move to back out unilaterally from the
arms embargo on Belgrade, Ivanov said NATO has invaded Yugoslavia,
a sovereign state which has not committed an act of aggression,
therefore under the U.N. Charter, U.N. member states can provide
support to such a state.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on what form the support would be.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov called on members of the U.N. Security Council to carry
out their obligations and demand an immediate end to NATO's
military action against Yugoslavia.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese companies have
secured contracts for Peruvian bridge and dam projects, according
to the International Business Daily's Wednesday edition.
</P>
<P>
China International Water &AMP; Electric Corporation and China
Electric Power Import and Export Corp. (CEPIEC), during a Chinese
government trade mission's visit to Peru last week, signed the
agreements. China International Water &AMP; Electric Corporation beat
out other bidders for 20 bridge contracts, the first time for a
Chinese company to get a Peruvian contract through public bidding,
and CEPIEC got contracts for five dams.
</P>
<P>
China Electric also signed an agreement to rebuild an electric
power network in Peru, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some other Chinese companies are reported to be involved in
construction projects in transportation, power, and energy in Peru,
Brazil, and other Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs offices report that Sino-Latin American trade
was worth 8.31 billion U.S. dollars last year, a slight drop from
1997. Chinese exports increased 15.5 percent to 5.32 billion
dollars worth and imports were down 20 percent to some 3 billion
dollars worth.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Expects Trade Recovery in 2nd Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Barry Desker, Chief Executive
Officer of the Trading Development Board of Singapore, said
Thursday that his country's external trade recovery is likely to
take place in the second half of 1999 although it has not come out
of the wood yet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Desker said: "We remain
positively optimistic on the prospect in the coming months."
</P>
<P>
He said the 12 percent decline in total trade in January and
February was less severe than the 15 percent drop in the fourth
quarter of 1998. "The clear indications we have are that the trend
will be continuing into coming months."
</P>
<P>
The decline in Non-Domestic Export in January and February has
also moderated compared with the severe fall in the fourth quarter
of 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
Desker also said that oversupply of global semi-conductor
industry was easing in January and February.
</P>
<P>
But Desker drew attention to the likelihood of sharp correction
of U.S. stock market which he said does exist although the whole
will go soft-landing.
</P>
<P>
The correction will affect U.S. national spending severely, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the international environment, Desker said: "We do face an
international environment in which there is a tendency to
protectionism."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the formation of the GATT and the WTO has made the
international environment much more conducive to free trade,
Desker also said protection and barriers still exist and
re-emergence of protectionism remains a continuing concern.
</P>
<P>
"For example," he said, "the U.S. Congress just passed laws
which have the effect of protecting its domestic steel market,
which were described by observers as among the most protectionist
legislation in recent year."

<HEADLINE> No House Dissolution Until Crisis Defused: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said Thursday that he would not dissolve the parliament until the
economic crisis has been defused.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors that the prime minister, facing mounting
criticism for poorly handling economic affairs, would dissolve the
parliament to allow early elections.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he and his coalition government took office in late
1997 when Thailand was in its worst economic turmoil in 30 years,
indicating that problems could not be solved overnight.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work very very hard, and I believe the public
understand (the government). I've pledged to the public that the
government will do its best, but there will be no miracles," said
Chuan, quoted by Thai News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Chuan expressed his determination to accelerate the recovering
process and pull the economy out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism that the economic recovering process
in Thailand might be slower than expected, Chuan said his ruling
Democrat Party was democratic and all have the right to criticize
the performance of any cabinet member for the sake of the nation's
interest and the people's benefits.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials were optimistic that the economy
would recover in mid-1999 and register a one percent growth this
year. But the opposition said the crisis was far from over, citing
the government's "poor performance" in dealing with economic
affairs.

</P>

</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Arab League Wednesday hailed the U.N. Security Council

<HEADLINE> Public Sector Strike Intensifies in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A public sector strike in
Israel intensified Thursday as defense industry workers joining
the nationwide labor sanctions erupted over a wage dispute
with the government.
</P>
<P>
One day after some 400,000 employees in the public sector
began the widespread strike, the Histadrut, or labor federation,
and Treasury were still far apart on their positions.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut has demanded a salary hike of 14 percent
for 1998 and 1999 to offset the wage erosion by the inflation,
which stood at 8.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry insisted that it would not go
higher than a 3.85 percent increase, which it said is enough
to maintain the natural growth of wages.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the two sides met Wednesday in an effort
to bridge the major gap, but the talks broke down soon after they
started.
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides agreed to meet again Thursday, it is
believed that no real talks will take place until Saturday night,
when Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz and Finance Minister Meir
Sheetrit are scheduled to meet.
</P>
<P>
Involved in the strike are government ministries, hospitals,
post offices, state-run companies and municipal services. Garbage
piled up in streets, and national television and radio stations
remained disrupted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Gurion International Airport, however, has returned to
normal operation after closing for two hours Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assailed the strike
Wednesday, calling it an attempt to "rob the public coffers on
the eve of elections."
</P>
<P>
Peretz retorted that the government is responsible for causing
the strike, calling on Netanyahu to "shake off his political
considerations and intervene to solve the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak, prime minister candidate
in the May 17 elections, said that the strike is another sign that
Netanyahu's government "is stuck in every possible arena."
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu claims there is a renewal of growth, even though
we know there are 280,000 unemployed Israelis, and 729,000
citizens - including one out of every five children - living
under the poverty line," the local daily Jerusalem Post quoted
a statement issued by Barak as saying Thursday.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF) will hold a telephone conference starting at 11:
00 GMT on Thursday to make a final decision on the World Table
Tennis Championships which was previously scheduled to take place
in Belgrade from April 26 to May 9.
</P>
<P>
The world table tennis ruling body is expected to postpone the
Belgrade championships, an ITTF official said.
</P>
<P>
ITTF had been hesitant in moving the championships out of
Belgrade despite Kosovo crisis was getting worse.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began its
airstrike at Serbian targets across Yugoslavia late last night.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February last year between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the
province's population of 2 million and have been fighting for
independence. The armed Kosovo Albanians, with exterior assistance
in arms and money, have been staging terrorist actions in a bid to
achieve its separatist goal.
</P>
<P>
Attending the telephone conference are the ITTF Executive Board
members including President Xu Yinsheng, Deputy President and CEO
Adham Sharara, Executive Vice Presidents Hans Giesecke, George
Segun and Yapo Yong Yih.

NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
allocate 100 million shillings (about 1.6 million U.S. dollars)
for oil exploration during the current 1998-99 financial year,
said sources from the Ministry of Energy.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister of Energy Chrisantus Okemo said that the
government attaches great importance to the possibility of finding
oil and it had spent 50 million shillings for the exercise during
the previous financial year, the Kenya Times newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that survey done so far on oil exploration indicated
that more than half of the country's areas can produce oil.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration work had been going on for the last 40 years,
but the minister said that only 30 wells had been sunk so far with
little success on the ground reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in Nairobi Wednesday at a seminar
on environmental protection sponsored by the Geological Society
of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He urged stakeholders in oil exploration and local geologists
to pool efforts to ensure that areas with oil deposits are
explored for better results.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has long been depending on the imports for its oil
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Okemo said that to achieve the envisaged industrialized country
status for kenya by 2020, it is imperative for the country to make
more efforts for identification, cataloguing and exploitation of
all mineral resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- More and more people from other
states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are buying properties
and land in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), local Gulf News
newspaper said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Ministry of Finance and Industry showed
that GCC owners of properties and land in the UAE rose to 5,913 in
1998 against 4,312 in 1997 and 1,269 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the rise indicates a high interest among other
GCC members in the UAE's property market and the country's status
as the regional commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation GCC regional organization consists of Kuwait,
Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The report said Kuwaitis top the list in buying property and
land, with 3,331 in 1998, compared with 3,054 in 1997 and 521 in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Omanis took the second place with 453 last year, 349 in 1997
and 163 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Saudi owners were estimated at 393 in 1998 against 277 in 1997
and 162 in 1989. Qataris came fourth with 373 and Bahrainis fifth
with 363 last year.
</P>
<P>
The report also said currently there are 3,795 individuals from
the five other GCC states undertaking various economic activities
in the UAE, with 1,140 from Saudi Arabia, 891 from Kuwait, 765
from Oman, 660 from Bahrain and 339 from Qatar.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Rural Energy Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's plan to invest over 130
billion yuan between 1998 and 2000 in its rural power grid is
bound to provide farmers with high-quality energy high.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the development of energy resources,
including methane and both solar and wind energy, in remote rural
areas, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 61 percent of China's 860 million rural
residents depend on traditional biomass resources for cooking fuel,
with more than 60 million people currently lacking access to
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Energy shortages and low level use rates have hindered social
and economic development in rural areas, according to Deng Keyun,
secretary-general of the China Rural Energy Association.
</P>
<P>
Deng noted that providing clean high-quality energy to rural
residents will help raise income levels, improve living standards
and eventually stimulate domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
China's current economic priority centers on stimulating
domestic consumption, and the rural consumer market is crucial to
the success of the policy, she added.
</P>
<P>
Deng pointed out the related efforts will promote environmental
protection. She also noted that rural areas are facing severe
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
China has extended great efforts to promote the use of new
energy resources and energy-saving technology in rural areas. The
Ministry of Agriculture efforts to promote methane gas technology
and the use of efficient ovens have eased fuel shortages and
helped protect forest resources in the vast countryside.
</P>
<P>
China has opened rural energy service centers to improve
services for residents in 7,700 towns.

<HEADLINE> Discussion on Unifying N.Z.-Australia Currency Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Don Brash, governor of New
Zealand Reserve Bank, has lent weight to calls for a unified
currency with Australia, saying it would bring "important
benefits" to New Zealand and should be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based Newspaper, said Thursday that
Brash's comments are "a small but significant step toward official
consideration of a trans-Tasman currency," which may be called
"Anzac."
</P>
<P>
Although New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has said an
Anzac dollar is not on the agenda, government sources have
confirmed that a high-powered task force set up this year to
examine the Closer Economic Relations Agreement with Australia
could be a vehicle for looking at a common currency, if only in
the context of anticipating what some of the key issues might be,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Brash was quoted as telling the Parliament's finance and
expenditure select committee Wednesday that there are "some
important benefits in a currency union" with Australia.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying is let's discuss the pros and cons with all
the benefits and all the costs on the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, some local experts believe it would
take roughly three years of work before an Anzac currency could be
introduced.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for some political parties have also shown their
interest in the idea of a common currency.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Export Institute has come out in favor of a
single currency and the Australia-New Zealand Business Council is
also in favor of a debate.

450,000 liters, is capable of refuelling aircraft as large as
Boeing 747-400.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News newspaper Thursday quoted Amour as saying that
modernization of the airport, which operates 24 hours daily, will
attract giant and small aircraft from different parts of the world
and increase tourists arrivals to Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, part of Tanzania, lies off the east coast of the
mainland of the country. Endowed with miles of sandy beaches,
dozens of smaller islands in the Indian Ocean, coupled with
historical sites, Zanzibar fulfils all the basic requirements of a
busy tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Major airlines have been trying to operate regular tourist
flights to Zanzibar but found the airport facilities lacking.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has given priority to the development of tourism after
the prices of clove, its major cash earner, fell in the
international market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
During the commissioning ceremony, Amour said the era for
backing the ailing public companies is over, adding that every
institution should stand on its own to face stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
BP Tanzania Managing Director, Rodger Ivens, hailed the
government's decision to change the old pricing structure for fuel
and allow fuel sold at the facility to be priced based on the
international prices.
</P>
<P>
Ivens also said he believed the fuel facility would help tap
the huge tourist potential and create employment in Zanzibar.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Styrofoam Food Containers by Year-end </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) has announced that the production and use of
styrofoam food containers will be banned by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of China Township Enterprises News reported that
the styrofoam food containers have caused serious "white pollution
" in China and will be replaced by substitute products made of
paper and natural fibers such as rice husks and wheat shells.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China uses some 10 billion
styrofoam containers annually, weighing about 100,000 tons and
taking about 200 to 300 years to be decomposed and absorbed. Yet
the recycling rate of these containers stands at only 3-5 percent
at present.
</P>
<P>
The production of styrofoam food containers will be halted
immediately and of related production lines will closed. The SETC
will revoke the licenses of the manufacturers found in violation
of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The government has listed the promotion of biodegradable food
containers high on its agenda. The Ministry of Science and
Technology, State Environmental Protection Administration and
related departments have placed priority on developing
environmentally-friendly products.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Consumer Spending In Service Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to stimulate the
service sector to increase consumer spending and help easing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
A State Internal Trade Bureau (SITB) official said today that
the bureau plans to hold a series of events nationwide this year
to increase service fields and consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
They will involve cooking contests, moon-cake festivals,
cosmetology contests, traditional Chinese dish preparation, and
other programs. SITB also plans to sponsor a "kitchen program"
this year, which aims at improving the quality and variety of
meals, convenience food, snacks, and expanding chain stores and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
SITB sources say that the sector's sales hit a record high of
more than 500 billion yuan (62 billion U.S. dollars) last year, a
growth of 15 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the food sector also
continued its strong growth, with sales up 17.7 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
SITB is urging departments to increase efforts to improve
market order and service to ensure the success of these activities.

<P>
LANZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yugur, the second smallest of
China's 55 ethnic groups, have seen significant changes over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
The 10,200 Yugur live in the Yugur Autonomous County, a 466-km.
by 100-km. area in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The most significant change has been a historical shift from
their centuries-old nomadic lifestyle to settlements on permanent
grazing lands, according to Wang Jun, secretary of the Sunan
County Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The government has helped build 97 settlements where about 98
percent of the herdsmen in the county have settled down to a
relatively comfortable life. This has helped develop animal
husbandry on a large scale and to promote cultural, technological,
and educational projects, according to Ba Jiulu, a sociologist.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jian, a herdsman in Hongshiwo Township, says that his
family used to roam the vast grassland in search of pastures all
year round and all they had were a tent and a wooden box
containing cooking utensils. The six-member family now live in a
settlement center with the forests of Qilian Mountain at the back
and grasslands in front. They have seven brick and tile rooms
equipped with a solar-power heated bath, a TV set, a CD player, a
refrigerator, and a washing machine.
</P>
<P>
Guo has put up the tent he used to live in to receive tourists
in the summertime and last year earned more than 10,000 yuan by
renting out the tent and selling local snacks.

<HEADLINE> World Reaction to NATO's Air Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO's military attacks on
Wednesday against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have drawn
condemnation from many countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who is on a visit to Italy on
Wednesday, urged the United States and its NATO allies to halt
immediately the airstrikes launched against Yugoslavia just hours
ago.
</P>
<P>
External military actions cannot bring about settlement to a
country's internal issues, such as that over Kosovo; they can only
make the situation more complicated and plunging the region into
deeper turmoil, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the NATO bombing, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin said, "In Russia there is deep shock at the military
actions of NATO against sovereign Yugoslavia, which are nothing
other than naked aggression."
</P>
<P>
Only the Security Council of the United Nations has the right
to make decisions regarding measures, including military ones,
needed for supporting or establishing international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Such decisions regarding Yugoslavia, which is a member of the
United Nations, have not been make by the Security Council,
violating not only the U.N. charter, but also the Founding Act of
mutual relations, cooperation and security between Russia and NATO,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to
the United Nations, on Wednesday also expressed his country's
position over the matter, saying that "international law must be
respected, that's the essence of our position."
</P>
<P>
NATO members "do not have the right to determine the fate of
other sovereign and independent states. They should not forget
that they are not only members of their alliance, but also members
of the U.N. and are obliged to be guided by the U.N. Charter,"
said the Russian ambassador before stepping into the Security
Council chamber, where an urgent closed-door session is to begin
at 4:00 p.m. EST Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Prikhodyko, deputy director of Russia's Presidential
Office in charge of international affairs, said in Moscow on
Thursday that NATO's military action against Yugoslavia has "
seriously harmed" Russia's relationship with the United States and
NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We feel deeply disappointed at the tragic outcome of the
Kosovo issue. NATO's action against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia has seriously harmed Russia's relationship with the
United States and NATO," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Prikhodyko as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gutsiriyev, vice chairman of the State Duma (lower
house of parliament) on Wednesday also expressed the Duma's
indignation at the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Many other countries like Argentina, Peru, Cambodia and
Mongolia have also condemned or regretted over NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, which is seeking to join NATO, expressed its support
for the air strikes.

JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Second-Hand Tyres Importation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has banned the
importation of used tyres to protect local industries from stiff
competition, The Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government ordered Wednesday that all dealers
with second hand tyres in stock to dispose them of within three
months or face legal action.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Industry and Commerce Iddi Simba said while
visiting the Arusha-based General Tyre Manufacturing Factory that
the order aims at curbing imported sub-standard goods which are
sold cheaply after importers evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
Simba said that Tanzania has also given a one-month grace
period for dealers to register with his ministry in five other
categories of imports, including clothes, batteries for radios and
torches, match boxes, cooking oil and drinks.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the registration was aimed at cracking
down on sub-standard goods.
</P>
<P>
"It is inconceivable that when developed countries such as the
United States are protecting their industries from imports,
Tanzania should have its local industries such as the General Tyre
having pile-ups of its products due to sub-standard imports," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Simba said that the crackdown is to protect customers from
being sold poor quality goods. However, it is not to protect low
quality goods produced by local industries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a special department wing will be
established to enforce existing laws against sub-standard goods
importation.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 Serbians residing
in New Zealand's capital city Wellington demonstrated in front of
the Parliament building Thursday against Nato's air bombing on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They held placards in protest against Nato's military
intervention in Kosovo and were angry at the New Zealand
Government's support for the bombing. They said Nato should try
harder to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
Many lit candles for their family members living in areas under
NATO's missile and bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four Serbians in Wellington for a women's arts
festival were desperate to get a flight home because Nato forces
are bombing near their home town.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based Evening Post newspaper reported Thursday
that Dah Theater's director Dijana Milosevic and three actors are
from Belgrade, which is close to Batajnica, a place under NATO's
air attacks.
</P>
<P>
"I have my life there. We have friends, family, children in
Belgrade," the newspaper quoted Milosevic as saying.
</P>
<P>
When troupe members heard that NATO air strikes had started,
they set about finding earlier flights, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was "totally terrible" to be on the other side of the world
while U.S. warships and B-52 bombers are firing cruise missiles
against Serbia, Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
"I feel helpless and terrified. We are totally opposed to
violence in all forms," she said. "NATO is the policeman of the
world, punishing without thinking about the people that are
suffering."

<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Two NATO
warplanes plus six Tomahawk missiles were brought down overnight
during the first wave of NATO air strikes, Serbian radio said
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
One of the planes was brought down by Yugoslav air defense
system over the mountain range of Cicavica in northern Kosovo but
the radio report did not mention where the second plane was
brought down.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have denied that any allied plane was downed
during the operation.
</P>
<P>
The radio report also said that altogether 40 targets were hit
by NATO cruise missiles or bombs dropped by NATO warplanes
overnight. The air raid started around 9:00 p.m. local time
Wednesday night (1900 GMT) and ended around midnight.
</P>
<P>
But the radio did not say to what extent the targets were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
The northernmost city hit by NATO air strikes was Sombor, in
the northwestern corner of the Serbian republic, northwest of the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade and bordering Hungary.
</P>
<P>
A refugee camp of ethnic Albanians was hit by the bombings near
Batajnica, where some civilians were feared killed and wounded,
the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In between explosions of missiles and bombs, shelling and
gunshots could be heard throughout Wednesday night and Thursday
morning. But in Pristina, with a population of 300,000, it was
quite calm except for one place that was still burning Thursday
morning and sporadic gunshots.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- World champions Chen Yan and Shan
Ying will miss the Chinese squad for next week's World Shortcourse
Swimming Championships to be held in Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China during April 1-4.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, double titlist at World Championships in Perth last
year, and Shan Ying, member of Chinese women's freestyle relay who
won at the shortcourse swimming worlds in 1997, will not show up
in Hong Kong due to health problem, according to officials from
the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA).
</P>
<P>
Shi Tianshu, vice president of the CSA, said Chen was troubled
by gastroptosis and has taken a special medical treatment in
Liaoning province while Shan was still in her recovery training.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our veterans set their sights on Sydney Olympics next
year, and young potentials get as more experience as possible from
the international events before the Olympics," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese squad, consisting of 12 male and 15 female young
swimmers, will be led by men's freestyle sprinter Jiang Chengji,
breaststroker Zeng Qiliang, women's world champion Wu Yanyan, and
distance freestyler Chen Hua.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Chen Hua, triple gold medalist in the women's
400-meter, 800m freestyle and 4X200m relay at the Bangkok Asian
Games last year, had beaten world champion Claudia Poll of Costa
Rica in every world cup shortcourse encounter they met in the 400
and 800m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"Chen is a promising swimmer if she continues to accomplish
good results at the world level competitions," said Lu Yongming,
chief coach of the Chinese national team.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu insisted that they put no pressure on those young
swimmers in the shortcourse worlds.
</P>
<P>
"We just hope they can perform their own best in Hong Kong
because they have several big tests this year, including national
championships, National City Games, University Worlds and Pan
Pacific Games," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> China Finds Relics In South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wenbin, the head of China's
State Administration of Cultural Heritage, told a press conference
today that a marine archaeology team has found over 1,500 cultural
relics, some dating back 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The team focused on 13 merchant vessel wrecks from the Five
Dynasties (907-960) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) near the Xisha
Islands.
</P>
<P>
They found delicate china, ironware, and a 500-kg stone anchor.
They also found two pieces of ivory, one of them 1.2 meters long
that may have come from an African country the Chinese merchant
ships were trading with.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wei, the Director of the National Museum of Chinese
History's Underwater Archaeology Department, led the team. They
recorded the location of ruins using the global positioning system
and underwater cameras.
</P>
<P>
According to historical accounts, China started trading with
foreign countries during the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) and
had thriving trade during the Song (960-1279) and Ming dynasties (
1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
"The cultural relics we found this time in the South China Sea
proved that China first arrived in and developed the nearby the
islands," Zhang says.
</P>
<P>
The 39-day trip cost 2 million yuan (about 240,000 U.S. dollars)
and is China's first attempt of its kind.

<HEADLINE> No Remarkable Progress on Peace In Congo (K): Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma said
in Harare Wednesday night that no remarkable progress has been
made in making peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
because Uganda and Rwanda continue to defy peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is slow because the Ugandan and Rwandan
forces which are supporting the rebels are not honest," the Herald
newspaper Thursday quoted Nujoma as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, "A solution will be found, although this might take
longer than had been anticipated," the Namibian president said,
noting that there is no permanent conflict.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma came to Zimbabwe on a short visit to discuss bilateral
trade issues and situation in the DRC with Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe agreed with the Nambian president that Uganda and Rwanda
were not being responsive enough when it came to ending the
conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of responding to our calls for peace, Uganda and
Rwanda have intensified their operations and attacks," Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
"If they want war, we will give them to the finish. If they
want peace, we will give them peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe dismissed claims of victory by the rebels over allied
forces in eastern DRC as nonsensical.
</P>
<P>
"We remain exactly where we were and we have to think of a
strategy to effect on our side of the defense. We can hit them
hard," the Zimbabwean president said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent troops to assist
DRC President Laurent Kabila in its fight against rebels since the
war broke out in the country in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nujoma also criticized terrorist activities by three
 Americans who were arrested in Harare on March 7 for illegal
possession of arms of war.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma left for home later Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Church Clock Found in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A church clock, believed to be one
of the oldest and biggest in Asia, was found at the century-old
Roman catholic basilica in Tayabas, a rustic ancient town in
Philippines' Quezon province, Philippine News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Located at the church tower of the basilica, the ancient clock
measures one meter in diameter.
</P>
<P>
Its hour hand measures half a meter while the minute hand is 62
centimeters long.
</P>
<P>
A 70-kilo heavy weight runs the hour hand while a 140-kilo
heavy weight operates the whole clock.
</P>
<P>
The heavy weights stake a giant bell to announce the time at
intervals of every one and a half hour.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Avelino A. Obispo, a well-known businessman and civic
leader of the town, said the clock was erected way back in 1911.
</P>
<P>
The giant church bells with Spanish letterings date back to the
16th century and came all the way from Europe, Dr. Obispo said.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Obispo, the clock was seriously damaged during
the Second World War. For the next 30 years it was abandoned and
almost forgotten by the town's people. In 1971, a group of civic
people spent six months rehabilitating the ancient clock.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the ancient town are still puzzled as to how the
big bronze bells were brought to the belfry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Informs Turkish FM on Situation in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, march 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright telephoned Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem late
Wednesday night and informed him on the situation in Yugoslavia, a
Foreign Ministry statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Cem appraised the latest developments in the
Kosovo crisis after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
launched air raids against Yugoslav serb targets Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between serb-led Yugoslav government and ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo intensified in February 1998 when Albanians,
who account for 90 percent of the population in the Yugoslav
province, sought independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The long-threatened air strikes came after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic refused to accept a ceasefire deal proposed by
the six-nation contact group, consisting of the U.S., Russia,
Britain, Germany, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkey's Air Force Commander Ilhan Kilic
confirmed that Turkey currently has 11 F-16 fighter jets at NATO
bases in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Hikmet Sami Turk also announced that
Turkey was carrying out preparations for possible involvement in
a NATO strike.
</P>
<P>
"Our air force is on duty. One of our warship is currently in
the Adriatic. Also, the army is preparing a battalion (for a
possible ground operation), although a land operation is currently
out of the question," Turk said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Turkey's policy will secure "autonomy for the
ethnic Turkish minority in Kosovo within the borders of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said on the
same day that Turkey has played an active part in NATO
consultations and preparations for a military intervention in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Turkey nor the rest of the international community
prefers the option of using force, but unfortunately, all
peaceful initiatives have been exhausted and we have reached
this point," Atacanli added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Serena Williams bounced back
from a sloppy start to reach the semi-finals, setting up a
showdown with the world number one Martina Hingis on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Serena, who is yet to be broken in her first three matches at
Lipton tennis championship, came off a weak start as the 16th seed
was broken three times in the first set alone.
</P>
<P>
But she managed a 6-4, 6-0 triumph over South African ninth-
seed Amanda Coetzer, scoring her 15th consecutive victory,
including her first WTA tournament wins at Paris and Indian Wells.
</P>
<P>
Her win kept alive the intriguing Lipton Championships' dream
final of sister versus sister while her sister Venus, the sixth
seed, will play fourth-seed Jana Novotna of Czech Republic in the
quarter-finals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They have become the first sisters to win WTA Tour events on
the same day after Venus won the Oklahoma City final and Serena
took the Indian Wells title on March 13.
</P>
<P>
But the path to the family-feud final is not easy for Serena
needs an upset over Hingis who eased to the semi-finals after
crushing Austria's Barbara Schett 6-1, 6-1 in 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
And Venus, the defending Lipton champion, will take on the
reigning Wimbledon champion Novotna, who took a record of 3-0 in
favor of her into the last four.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Prisoners to be Freed Under Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 3,000 prisoners and
detainees will be released from jails all over Jordan under an
amnesty decree signed by King Abdullah Bin Hussein, the
semiofficial Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The release is to cover convicted prisoners and detainees in
all correctional and rehabilitation centers in the desert
kingdom, and the decree also exempts those whose crimes are
punishable by fines from paying any fees, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, prisoners and detainees to be freed under the amnesty
are belived to have committed minor crimes, and those charged
with premeditated murder, terrorist acts, espionage and drug
trafficking will not be pardoned under the amnesty due to end on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty is part of the kingdom`s efforts to mark the
40th day of of the passing away of King Hussein Ibn Talal, who
died of lymphatic cancer on February 7.
</P>
<P>
However, the amnesty met with opposition from some
parliamentarians who said the waiver of the fines alone will cost
the state treasury between 10 to 20 million Jordanian dinars (14
to 28 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police officers also said many of the men released are ``
thugs and repeat offenders'' and will bring harm to people
and society after they are freed.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The '99 China International Young
Volunteers Camp will be held in Xiandu, east China's Zhejiang
province, from April 1 to 10.
</P>
<P>
Young volunteers from a number of countries and regions,
including Japan, Germany and Britain, will attend the camp along
with Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day camp, the fourth of its kind in China, will focus on
environmental protection and cultural exchange. Volunteers will
plant trees, repair roads and provide various forms of assistance
to local communities. They will also have the opportunity to visit
scenic sites and conduct exchanges with local students.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Youth Federation (ACYF) organized three previous
camps focusing on desert afforestation, protecting cultural relics
and assisting the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The international young volunteers camp was initiated by
youngsters from Germany and France in the 1920s as part of an
effort to rehabilitate farms and pastures destroyed during the
first World War.
</P>
<P>
The ACYF expressed hope that the Xiandu camp will help
youngsters gain a greater awareness of the need for environmental
protection and promote mutual understanding and friendship between
younger generations in various countries.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Hold Workshop on Arab Sign Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will host a workshop next month on the unification of
sign language for the deaf in the Arab world, local paper
Khaleej Times reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day workshop, to start in Dubai on April 3, aims
at developing a special unified language for the deaf in all
Arab countries, the paper said, quoting Mariam Al Roumi,
undersecretary of the UAE Ministry of Social Affairs, who will
co-organize the event with the Council of Arab Ministers for
Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"There is no uniformity in sign language, the only way of
communication among the deaf in Arab countries," Mrs. Roumi
said, emphasizing the significance of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
"People with hearing problems in each country have developed
a special sign language of their own which makes it difficult
for them to interact with their counterparts in other Arab
states," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said one of the main advantages of a uniform language
would be that it would give a chance to the deaf to
understand special television programs on Arab satellite channels.
</P>
<P>
The new uniform language would be in classical Arabic, said
Roumi, underlining that the deaf in the UAE were using
the English sign language.
</P>
<P>
Around 70 experts, representatives of welfare associations
working with the deaf and representatives of ministries of
labor and social affairs of Arab countries will be attending
the workshop, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations from the workshop will be submitted to the
Council of Arab Ministers for Social Affairs at its meeting
in November.
</P>
<P>
"A unified Arab sign language will be introduced within a
year of the council's approval," Roumi said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Deplores NATO's Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian foreign ministry
Wednesday expressed deep regret over NATO's unilateral use of
force to settle the Kosovo crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release that the Peruvian
government, which has always maintained peaceful settlement to
conflicts, deplored that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO) has unilaterally taken military actions against Yugoslavia
without authorization of the U.N. Security Council, which has the
mandate to safeguard world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia Wednesday night
after two rounds of talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic failed to change Belgrade's
stance of rejecting the presence of NATO-led force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government hopes that Yugoslav civilians will be
protected in the strikes and that all parties involved will resume
negotiations as soon as possible in a bid to find a peaceful,
lasting settlement to the Kosovo issue, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry also called on Yugoslav leaders to stick
to their intent for peaceful settlement to the Kosovo problem.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Expected to Grow 8.5 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite a drop in exports and
foreign investment, China's gross domestic product is projected to
grow by 8.5 percent to 1.71 trillion yuan in the first quarter
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the State Information Center,
confidence in investment is recovering due to the rise in
corporate profits in the last quarter of 1998, and fixed-asset
investment by state-owned enterprises is expected to increase by
20 percent in the first quarter from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
With government support, the downward export trend will be
slowed to some seven percent, while imports are expected to grow
by about five percent.
</P>
<P>
The report says the retail price index and consumer price index
in the first quarter will fall 2.6 percent and one percent,
respectively, but total retail sales will surge 7.8 percent to
some 769 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Expanding domestic demand will continue to sustain rapid
industrial growth, with industrial added value expected to grow 10.
5 percent to 427 billion yuan, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The three deposit and lending interest rate cuts last year also
benefited industrial enterprises, reducing their financial
expenses by 3.1 percent from 1997, and this trend is expected to
continue this year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Reserve Drops in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The foreign currency reserve of
Bangladesh fell by 10.7 percent to 1,683.52 million U.S. dollars
as of March 11, from 1,885.53 million dollars in March last year,
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the decrease to the growing import of
food grain to meet domestic demand, which was estimated at 4.2
million tons during the current fiscal year between July 1998 and
June 1999, The Independent daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a shortage of 2.1 million tons of food grain
each year, the country had to face a shortfall of another 2.1
million tons due to a severe flood hitting the country from July
to September last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides the pressure of importing food grain, import of huge
number of tax-free computers and power generators in the private
sector also contributed to the slide in the reserve, according to
Kibria.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in the country, meanwhile, rose to 8.76
percent in January 1999 from 4.5 percent and 3.6 percent of the
last two fiscal years respectively, he said.

<HEADLINE> Letters of Complaints To Be Given Full Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A circular from China's Ministry
of Civil Affairs recently urged civil affairs departments at all
levels to give full attention to complaints from the masses.
</P>
<P>
"Officials in civil affairs departments throughout the country
should effectively handle every letter and visit from people who
want to make complaints," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
In China, civil affairs departments are in charge of such
issues as disaster rescue operations, poverty assistance, social
welfare, grass-root level elections, and marriage and funerals,
all directly and closely related to the interests of ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
Complaints from the masses on civil affairs work often reflect
some new trends and problems, and studying these new trends and
solving the problems will help maintain social stability, the
circular said.
</P>
<P>
The circular emphasized that those who fail to deal with
complaints in an effective and timely manner will face severe
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The circular also urged civil affairs departments to improve
their institutional ability and staff quality in order to solve
problems at the local level and in their embryonic stage.
</P>
<P>
In China, almost all government departments have a special
office to hear and deal with complaints. Listening to complaints
from the masses is an important channel through which the
Communist Party of China and the government can link themselves
more closely to ordinary people.

But a country can send more than four if all are ranked in the

hope of being called up.

he will certainly be in the top 16 and in Denmark's team," head
coach Kenneth Larsen said in Copenhagen.

<HEADLINE> Social Security for the Aged Draws Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A social security system for the
aged should be established and improved as soon as possible now
that China is becoming a more elderly society, said a report
released today by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the aged population, considered to be
people over 60, has reached 120 million in the country, the most
in the world, as well as one-fifth of the world's total aged
population and half of the total aged population in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The report projects that by next year this segment of the
population will reach 130 million in China, which will be over 10
percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2040, the report said, China's aged population will
reach its peak at 360 million, accounting for over 20 percent of
the country's population.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the aged population will provide both
challenges and chances for China's social and economic development.
Departments concerned should make preparations as soon as possible
to improve social security, welfare and services for the aged,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
At present, most elderly Chinese spend their remaining years
living at the homes of their children. However, the report said,
as a result of the current "one-child" family planning policy, the
average size of a family in China is getting smaller, and more and
more older people will have to be taken care of by society.
</P>
<P>
"If only three percent of all the aged in China need to be
housed in public old-people's homes, then 3.6 million beds will be
needed," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are less than one million old people in China
living in public homes for the aged.
</P>
<P>
This year is the International Year for the Aged. According to
statistics, the world's total aged population has reached nearly
550 million, and this figure is increasing by one million a month.

</P>
<P>

development.

1997 respectively. Vietnam attracted 4.8 billion U.S. dollars of
foreign investment last year.

ULAN BATOR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government has
decided to abolish the summer daylight-saving time system that has
been in place in the country for 14 years, local newspapers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government departments concerned believe it is harmful to
people's health to change time artificially though the system has
the benefit of saving energy. Furthermore, the timetables of
international trains and flights have to be changed annually in
accordance with the system, thus making unnecessary troubles to
travelers, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has carried out the summer-time system since 1985.
Clocks would be set forward for an hour from midnight of the last
Sunday of March until the last Sunday of September.

CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian Independent senator
Brian Harradine Thursday warned that airstrikes on Yugoslav Serb
military sites Kosovo could leave the region even worse off.
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid the last situation will be worse than the first,"
Senator Harradine told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious day indeed and my thoughts are with the
people who will be affected by the bombing and those who were
affected by the previous turmoil."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 200,000 strong Serb community in Australia will take
to the streets on Sunday to show their anger at NATO's decision to
order airstrikes on their countrymen in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Local Serbs said the United States is unjustly meddling in
their country's internal affairs while ignoring other world
hotspots.
</P>
<P>
CARE Australia, an independent humanitarianist organization,
warned that bombing could only further exacerbate the refugee
crisis in Kosovo which has already left thousands of people
homeless.
</P>
<P>
"Given that there are a million and a half people living in
Kosovo, about 700,000 of whom live out in the rural areas, it
could be in the hundreds of thousands," CARE's head of Yugoslav
operations Steve Pratt said on ABC TV early Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Regrets for Failure of Peaceful Means on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday regretted
for the failure of all peaceful means in finding a resolution on
conflicts in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the resolution of the dispute without
use of force in Kosovo has failed after many attempts to find a
resolution that is acceptable to both parties in the dispute,"
Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar told a press conference here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia has always supported the resolution of
conflicts through peaceful means based on deliberations and
discussions in order to achieve a resolution that satisfy all
parties.
</P>
<P>
Generally Malaysia is not in favor of use of force, but in this
particular case (Kosovo), the intention of finding a peaceful
resolution has failed, "we are in favor of using whatever means
necessary in order to prevent continued loss of lives through
genocides or mass murders and this is in order to save humanity,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to prevent further killings," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the saving of lives should be the most important factor
in whatever decision taken in Kosovo, hoping all necessary
protections are taken as a result of the decision (by NATO on
attack on Kosovo).

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday it hoped to continue its cooperation with Russia despite
disagreement over NATO air-strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia, "deeply shocked" by NATO bombing raids against
Yugoslavia on Wednesday, suspended cooperation with NATO on
Wednesday, and called a meeting of the U.N. Security Council in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suspended his visit to
Washington on Tuesday when he heard NATO attacks would not be
affected by his trip.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said it would be
difficult to manage the differences with Russia but the United
States had to do what it felt was right.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States was ready for a strong reaction
from Russia for its air-strikes against Yugoslavia but that
Washington thought it could contain the damage.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that President (Boris) Yeltsin, Prime Minister
Primakov and Foreign Minister (Igor) Ivanov see the value of
keeping the relationship on track," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would call
her counterpart Ivanov later on Wednesday for the second time in
less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said at a Pentagon news
conference that he hoped Primakov would soon set a new date for
his visit and that the tensions would dissipate.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set up National Commission on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has decided to set
up a National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) to protect and
promote human rights in the country.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the government decision at a press conference here
Thursday, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said a Bill on setting
up such a commission would be tabled in Parliament in July.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the decision to set up the NCHR was in line
with the government's desire to meet the aspirations of all
Malaysians irrespective of their racial, religious or cultural
origins.
</P>
<P>
He said among the objectives of the commission would be to
study and verify any infringement of human rights, visit places of
detention, and issue public statements on human rights, as and
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
It would assist the government in studying the various
international human rights instruments that Malaysia has yet to
ratify and recommend the measures to be taken to ratify them, as
well as promote awareness of and provide education in relation to
human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Malaysia has so far signed 6 and
ratified 5 out of 25 international conventions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the NCHR would consist of about 20 prominent
and respected members of the Malaysian society.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says NATO Raid on Yugoslavia in U.S. Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday night tried once again to justify the NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia as he stressed that a secure Europe is
important to the United States' national interests.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation regarding NATO airstrikes against
Serbia, the president said that "If America is going to be
prosperous and secure, we need a Europe that is prosperous, secure,
undivided and free."
</P>
<P>
Clinton described Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as a
dictator "who has done nothing since the Cold War ended but
started new wars and pour gasoline on the flames of ethnic and
religious division."
</P>
<P>
"Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative. It is also
important to Amercia's national interests," he stressed, noting
that although Kosovo is a small place, "but it sits on a major
fault line between Europe, Asia and the Middle East, at the
meeting place of Islam and both the western and orthodox branches
of Christianity."
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged that there are risks for Americans who
take part in the military actions against Yugoslavia, but "I am
convinced that the dangers of acting are far outweighed by the
dangers of not acting -- dangers to defenseless people and to our
national interests."
</P>
<P>
He said the mission of the allied military actions is: "To
demonstrate the seriousness of NATO's purpose so that the Serbian
leaders understand the imperative of reversing course; to deter an
even bloodier offensive against innocent civilians in Kosovo; and,
if necessary, to seriously damage the Serbian military's capacity
to harm the people of Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> New Bridge Across Gyaing River Opened in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A new bridge across Myanmar's
Gyaing River linking the country's southeastern Kayin and Mon
states was put into service Wednesday to facilitate transport in
the region, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Gyaing River Bridge, also known as the Zathabyin, is the
longest suspension bridge in the country connecting Hpa-an,
capital of Kayin state, and Mawlamyine, capital of Mon state, and
having 579.5 metros long and 7.32 metros wide capable to bear 45
tons of load.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge began in June 1996 and completed
last month at a cost of 4.96 million U.S. dollars plus 1.2 billion
kyats (4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Regional people, who had to use Hpa-an-Mawlamyine waterway
taking a four-hour journey between the two states in the past, can
now easily travel in an hour more using the bridge.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration ceremony of the bridge, Lieutenant-General
Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State peace and
Development Council, said that the government is building the
network to ease transport between states and divisions which lag
progress.
</P>
<P>
Another bridge across Gyaing River, the Kawkareik, will be
opened soon and cross border trade with Thailand will prosper
after completion of the bridge, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, three bridges across the country's Thanlwin
River have been built. These are Takaw-ek Bridge in northern Shan
state, Hpa-an Bridge in Kayin state and Tasan Bridge in
southeastern Shan state.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also implemented six other major bridge projects across
the country's Ayeyawaddy River since then. Of these, four have
been completed which are the Myaungmya, Nawahtay, Maubin and Bala
Minhtin.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan troops are closing in
on Tamil rebel strongholds in the country's northern Wanni area
following a successful weekend operation which captured 325 square
kilometers of land.
</P>
<P>
Under the operation the troops have come closer to the rebel
strongholds located in the western part of the Wanni region, a
local newspaper The Island reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In their advance since last Friday into rebel held territory,
government troops had not come across any organized resistance,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that troops now are poised both on the eastern and
western flanks threatening key rebel positions located along the
coast.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that the rebels had apparently not
expected the troops in the direction from which they advanced and
were taken unawares as they lay in ambush on the coastal belt.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that severe manpower problems may be
afflicting the rebels, thereby preventing them from engaging their
cadres in major confrontations with the military.
</P>
<P>
Military sources estimate that there are only about 1,500 rebel
cadres left and most of them are in the jungles in the north and
east of the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result of areas regained since last December, troops have
a very wide front to operate.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the Sri Lankan
government for an independent homeland in the north and east of
the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> China Tightening Checks on State Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance is to
step up its fight against malpractice in the management of State
funds, a ministry spokesman said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention is to be paid to how the proceeds of
treasury bonds issues are used, he said.
</P>
<P>
This decision has been prompted by problems revealed last year
in a nationwide inspection of local finance bureaux, and State-
funded projects and enterprises, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors uncovered 15 billion yuan (1.8 billion US dollars)
of misused State funds. To date, only 4 billion yuan of these have
been recovered, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Yushu Finance Bureau in northeast China's
Jilin Province and managers of two State-owned projects - a
reservoir project in southwest China's Yunnan Province and a water
conservancy project in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region - were found to have diverted funds raised through a 100
billion yuan special treasury bond issue last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the issue were destined for a huge government
investment plan. The bulk of the funds, to be lent to local
governments, were earmarked for infrastructure construction
projects in their areas.
</P>
<P>
But the wrongdoers lent the money to other institutions, or
used it to repay borrowings or even to cover expenses for overseas
trips. The three cases involved a total sum of 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
But senior officials and economists started to warn against
misused of funds as early as allocation began. Abuse would not
only mitigate the effects of the issue, but would also pose
problems for State finances, they said.
</P>
<P>
Spending of the money was intended to be spread over two years.
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of the funds have still to be allocated. Officials
have said the ministry will launch a similar special treasury bond
issue this year to support infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
This explains the government's plan to intensify supervision of
fund management.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the inspection also revealed illegal
activities by some financial institutions and tobacco and
petrochemical firms.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has suspended the licenses of the accountants
involved and transferred some cases to judicial and procuratorial
departments, he said.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Call For Appropriate Rise in Money Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have called
for the continued implementation of the policy of increasing the
money supply as an appropriate way to prevent deflation.
</P>
<P>
At a consultative conference on monetary policy held by the
People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, economists
noted that the development of the money market also should be
given more importance.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the central bank adjust money-supply
flexibly by resorting to monetary instruments including open
market interest rates, deposited reserves in commercial banks, and
central bank loans.
</P>
<P>
While resolving financial risks, the central bank should also
turn to restructuring troubled small- and medium-sized financial
institutions rather than simply closing them, experts said.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that this year's credit and loan policies
include using credit leverage to help enterprises improve their
operational mechanism, fueling rural economic growth and
supporting infrastructure construction, as well as extending
consumer credit.
</P>
<P>
To solve existing financial problems, the country must step up
the reform of state-owned enterprises and state banks, and develop
a sound system of enterprise management, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the implementation of policies to expand domestic
demand requires an overall balance between the budget and credit
and foreign exchange, they said, adding that the urbanization of
small towns and the development of high-tech firms should be given
special attention.
</P>
<P>
The conference was hosted by Dai Xianglong, governor of the
central bank. Vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, Cheng Siwei and Jiang Zhenghua, also
attended the conference along with several renowned economists Li
Yining, Wu Jinglian and Liu Hongru.

</P>
<P>
"I am doing everything to achieve peace in Colombia," said the
President, and "the path to peace begins when the walker begins

</P>
<P>
Recounting all the efforts made by the government to reach
peace, Pastrana noted that the dialogues, which were conducted
with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the
National Liberation Army (ELN), have made some advances.
</P>
<P>
In talks with the FARC, the parties have given their respective
agendas on what the government and the largest guerrilla movement

<P>
The President also described an agreement reached between the
ELN and the civilian society in Mainz, Germany, as a vehicle to
reach peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> President of Chilean Senate Cautiously Welcomes Pinochet's Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- President of Chile's Senate
Andres Zaldivar Wednesday expressed satisfaction with a ruling by
Britain's highest court denying Chile's ex-dictator Augusto
Pinochet immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Zaldivar said that the British Law Lords have adopted some of
the Chilean government's idea of respect for extra-territoriality.
</P>
<P>
The Law Lords voted 6-1 Wednesday to reject Pinochet's argument
that he had immunity because of his status as a former head of
state.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean senate leader also welcomed the British rule that
Pinochet was answerable only to the charges stemming from crimes
committed after 1988, when Britain incorporated the UN convention
on torture into law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling limited a bid to extradite Pinochet by
the Spanish court, who said there were at least four cases of
torture and murder after 1988 for which Pinochet would be tried in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Zaldivar called for mutual respect of justice and truth and
reconciliation in the case of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
In Chile, both backers and critics of Pinochet cheered the
ruling by the British court, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Venezuela, Columbia and Guatemala also
expressed satisfaction with the British highest court's ruling,
saying that "justice has been done in this case."
</P>
<P>
The decision of whether to extradite Pinochet is now in the
hands of British Home Secretary Jack Straw, reports said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Confederation of Production and Commerce
Walter Riesgo said trade relations between Chile and Britain have
not been affected so far by the case, and urged the Chilean
government to improve ties with Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, he said if Straw gave permission for extradition, "We
could not maintain normal relations with people who trample on our
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, has been under house arrest in Britain since last
October at the request of Spain, which wants the former dictator
on charges of human rights abuses during his 1973-1990 rule.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Scores Achievement in Curing TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Fully 92.7 percent of nearly 100,
000 tuberculosis patients in the western Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region have recovered thanks to a World Bank-financed anti-
tuberculosis program introduced in China.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has the country's highest incidence of TB and
presently has some 130,000 people suffering from the disease. TB
kills over 8,000 local people each year, five times the number of
deaths attributed to infectious and parasitic diseases.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the autonomous regional government began making
efforts to establish a TB-control program, and now Xinjiang has
100 TB-control and prevention institutions at or above the county
level which employ nearly 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Since the World Bank launched its program in Xinjiang in 1992,
more than one million people have been averted from contracting TV.
</P>
<P>
TB patients currently receive timely treatment, and 95 percent
of the infectious pulmonary TB patients diagnosed in the region
have been treated without having to be hospitalized. Also, the
rate of cure is on the rise in the region. As a result, more than
one million people in Xinjiang have avoided becoming infected with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The number of TB patients in China accounts for one-fourth of
the world's total, and the disease kills over 230,000 Chinese each
year.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis was previously curable. However, it re-emerged as
a major world health problem in recent years due to improper
treatment and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization declared TB a global health
emergency in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Injury Hits England before Eruo 2000 Qualifier </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The injury of strikers has been
the headache of the England rookie coach Kevin Keegan, forcing him
to reshape the attacking forefront just before the Wembley Euro
2000 qualifier against Poland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Keegan discovered on Wednesday that he will be without
Liverpool duo Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler as well as Blackburn
Rovers' Chris Sutton and Tottenham Hotspur winger Darren Anderton
in the first game in his charge.
</P>
<P>
That leaves Andy Cole and Alan Shearer as the squad's only
recognized strikers, although Manchester United's Paul Scholes can
also play up front.
</P>
<P>
Keegan has already lost the services of Leeds United midfielder
David Batty and Sheffield Wednesday defender Andy Hinchcliffe,
leaving him with just 16 fit outfield players for the game England
cannot afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
Keegan called up Wednesday Tottenham Hotspur Chris Armstrong to
solve his striker crisis with Dion Dublin and Les Ferdinand also
the likely candidates.
</P>
<P>
The injuries to Batty and Anderton, combined with the
suspension to Paul Ince, also means a new-look midfield with
uncapped duo Ray Parlour of Arsenal and Spurs' Tim Sherwood set
for some sort of involvement.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 24 (Xinhua)-- Air flights between Rio de
Janeiro and Paraguay were canceled on Wednesday due to Paraguay's
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's Vice-President Luis Maria Argana was shot and killed
by unidentified gunmen on Tuesday. The incident caused the
cancellation of all flights of the Brazilian Air Company Varig
from Rio to Paraguay, and another three flights from Paraguay to
Rio.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Paraguay President Raul Cubas ordered the
borders closed during the search for the killers of Argana. Brazil
and Argentina complied by also closing their borders with Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Government announced on Wednesday a continuation
of the block on the Brazilian-Paraguayan borders, and all flights
were suspended.
</P>
<P>
Around 230 inflight passengers, 130 for Rio de Janiero and 118
for Paraguay, were affected by the closure of the borders.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, another neighbor of Paraguay, also decided to close
its border with Paraguay on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assassination of Argana caused a further deterioration in
Paraguay's political crisis which was triggered last year by
President Cuba's decree to release former army chief Lono Oviedo.
The release lead to a political dispute between Cubas and Vice-
President Argana.

GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee Wednesday canceled the inauguration ceremony for a
rebuilt bomb-damaged Olympic hall because of the danger of further
bomb strikes in the region.
</P>
<P>
The committee said in Lausanne it had made the decision to put
off the ceremony in the Zetra Olympic Hall in Sarajevo in the
light of "the current political situation in the region."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Sergey Lavrov Wednesday
denounced NATO's military action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor at the Security Council meeting just hours
after NATO strikes began, the Russian envoy said that NATO members
"do not have the right to determine the fate of other sovereign
and independent states."
</P>
<P>
"They should not forget that they are not only members of their
alliance, but also members of the U.N. and are obliged to be
guided by the U.N. Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to justify NATO strikes by motives of prevention of
humanitarian catastrophe are completely groundless," he said,
adding that "it is precisely the unilateral use of force that will
result in genuinely destructive humanitarian consequences."
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to apply other standards to international law and to
ignore its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent,
fraught with drastic destabilization and chaos at regional and
global levels," Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO action is especially unacceptable when the potential
of political and diplomatic methods of the settlement is far from
exhausted, he noted, demanding an immediate termination of "the
illegal military action."

<HEADLINE> Cohen Targets Air Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Wednesday the initial targets attacked by the allied
forces were Yugoslav air defenses, command and control systems and
Serb military forces deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are striking a range of military targets, including
Yugoslavia's extensive air defense system, its command and control
system, and the military forces that Yugoslavia is using to
suppress the Albanians in the province of Kosovo," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, speaking as the air strikes continued, said there had
been some engagement between Yugoslav and NATO planes. But he said
all U.S. warplanes had returned safely after the first wave of
attacks in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"There was some air-to-air engagement that has taken place. But
I think we need more information before we can confirm what the
result of that was," he said. "Our aircraft have safely returned --
those that were in the region to date," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said it was too early to assess damages caused in
Wednesday's attacks. He declined to give numbers of sorties flown
or cruise missiles fired, saying the operation was still going on.
Cohen said Sea-launched and air-launched cruise missiles, with
backing from warplanes, spearheaded the attacks.
</P>
<P>
He said cruise missiles were fired from both U.S. and British
ships deployed in the Mediterranean. Sophisticated B-2 bombers
never used in combat before were also employed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen gave no indication when the operation would end.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO's military action
against Yugoslavia violated the United Nations Charter and
worsened the situation in the Balkan region, China stressed here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, Qin Huasun, at the open debate by the United
Nations Security Council on NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"On March 24, 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with
the United States at the lead mobilized its airborne military
forces and launched military strikes against Yugoslavia, seriously
exacerbating the situation in the Balkan region," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"This act amounts to a blatant violation of the Untied Nations
Charter, as well as the accepted norms in international law. The
Chinese Government strongly opposes such an act," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"The settlement of the Kosovo issue should be based on the
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
and guarantee of the legitimate rights and interests of all the
ethnic groups in the Kosovo area," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"We have always stood for peaceful settlement of dispute
through negotiations and are opposed to the use of or the threat
of use of force in international affairs, or power politics of the
strong bullying the weak," Qin continued.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose interference in the internal affairs of other States
under whatever pretext or in whatever form," Qin added.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: NATO Air Strikes Lead to No Where </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), a U.S.-led military alliance, on Wednesday
launched air strikes against Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent country and also a member of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
NATO went ahead with the unilateral military action without the
authorization of the U.N. Security Council, which under the U.N.
Charter has primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace
and security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the NATO move constitutes a flagrant violation of
the principles and relevant provisions of the Charter, a blatant
contempt and a grave challenge to the authority of the 185-member
United Nations and the 15-member Security Council. It is extremely
dangerous to normal international relations.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, NATO's military action against Yugoslavia
also violates its own existing Charter, which does not provide for
any military action outside the territories of its member states.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, the NATO action poses a serious threat to the peace
and security in the Balkans, long regarded as "the power kettle"
in Europe. NATO should be responsible for any consequence of
instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February last year between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the
province's population of 2 million and have been fighting for
independence. The armed Kosovo Albanians, with exterior assistance
in arms and money, have been staging terrorist actions in a bid to
achieve its separatist goal.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Government, just like any other sovereign country,
applied its legitimate power to crack down on terrorism and
separatism to safeguard the nation's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
However, Western countries, blind to the armed provocation of
the Albanian terrorist and separatist in Kosovo, have for a long
time stepped up one-sided pressure on Belgrade. They should also
be held responsible for their role in egging on terrorist and
separatist drive by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Kosovo is an internal affair of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the issue should be solved peacefully on
the basis of the respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia and equality of all ethnic groups in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the issue of Kosovo should also be solved by
parties concerned in Yugoslavia among themselves.
</P>
<P>
In short, military action can lead NATO to no where, only
political dialogue can ensure lasting peace and security in the
region. Therefore, NATO should put an end to its ongoing military
action immediately without any condition.

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's private enterprises are
getting more mature as they increase in both number and scale,
according to a report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences

<HEADLINE> Text of Yeltsin Statement after NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Following is a translation of the
text of a statement issued by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
after NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began on Wednesday and carried by
Reuters monitored here:
</P>
<P>
In Russia there is deep shock at the military actions of NATO
against sovereign Yugoslavia, which is nothing other than naked
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Only the Security Council of the United Nations has the right
to take decisions regarding measures, including military measures,
needed for the support or establishment of international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Such decisions regarding Yugoslavia have not been taken by the
Security Council. This violates not only the UN charter, but also
the Founding Act of mutual relations, cooperation and security
between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
A dangerous precedent has been set creating a policy of dictate
through force, placing in jeopardy the entire contemporary
framework of international law.
</P>
<P>
In fact, we speak of an attempt by NATO to enter the 21st
century in the uniform of a world policeman. Russia will never
agree to this.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council should consider this increasingly
troubled situation and call for an immediate halt to the military
activity of NATO.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the leadership of the Russian Federation is
reexamining its mutual relations with NATO as an organization that
displays a lack of respect for the fundamental underpinnings of
the system of the international community.
</P>
<P>
As President and Commander in Chief I have already given the
following orders:
</P>
<P>
-- Cut off the visit of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the
United States
</P>
<P>
-- Request an urgent session of the United Nations Security
Council and call for an immediate halt to NATO military activity
</P>
<P>
-- Recall to Moscow the Russian Federation's chief military
representative to NATO
</P>
<P>
-- Call a halt to our participation in the Partnership for
Peace program and the activities of the Russia-NATO partnership
program
</P>
<P>
-- Postpone negotiations on the opening of a NATO military
mission in Moscow
</P>
<P>
I have already called on U.S. President Bill Clinton, and I
call on other heads of state of NATO member countries as well, to
immediately put an end to this military adventurism which
threatens the lives of peaceful civilians and to explode the
situation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Solving the situation in Kosovo, like the resolution of other
similar problems, is possible only through negotiations. The
faster (negotiations) are begun, the more possibilities there will
be for the international community to find a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Russia is ready to further cooperate closely with other members
of the Contact Group in the name of reaching this goal.
</P>
<P>
Those who have set off on this military adventure bear complete
responsibility before their own peoples and the world community for
the grave consequences to international stability.
</P>
<P>
In the event the military conflict worsens, Russia retains the
right to take adequate measures, including military ones, to
defend itself and the overall security of Europe.

Such attacks were not authorized by the U.N. Security Council
and Yugoslavia did not invite foreign troops to enter its

Americans are making a cold war, and it will inevitably influence

<HEADLINE> Three European Soccer Qualifiers Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA ruled on Wednesday to postpone three European championship
qualifiers because of the NATO decision to launch air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The games in Belgrade between Yugoslavia and Croatia on
Saturday and Yugoslavia and Macedonia next Wednesday have been
rescheduled for August 18 and September 4 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The decision has been taken in view of the unstable political
situation in Yugoslavia," UEFA said in a statement on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UEFA later said Ireland's qualifier against Macedonia in Skopje
on Saturday had also been postponed. A new date for the match has
yet to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Irish football association (FAI) had said
the team were particularly concerned about the group eight
qualifier because the Irish government had advised citizens not to
travel to Yugoslavia, the Serb part of Bosnia or Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"It did appear as if that (the postponement) might happen," an
FAI spokesman said later, adding that the FAI was reluctant for
the Irish party to travel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation said the Davis
Cup tie between Yugoslavia and Morocco due to be hosted by
Yugoslavia from April 30 to May 2 had been switched to Morocco.
The tie is in the Euro/African zone group two.
</P>
<P>
A decision on whether to stage the world table tennis
championships in Belgrade from April 26 to May 9 is due on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> NATO Missiles, Bombs Attacking Yugoslav Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warships and B-52 bombers
on Wednesday attacked air defense targets across Yugoslavia with
cruise missiles in the first wave of a major NATO missile and
bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two batwing B-2 stealth bombers based in the United States were
also used to bomb Yugoslav military targets, Air Force officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The bombers, based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, took
part in the raids with 2,000-pound laser-guided bombs capabled of
shattering hardened command facilities, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Targets bombed included missile batteries, radars and military
communications sites in and outside of Kosovo province, including
near the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Tomakawk cruise missiles with 1,000-pound warheads were fired
from U.S. ships based in the Mediterranean and Adriatic, and more
powerful air-launched cruise missiles with 2,000-pound warheads
were unleashed from B-52 bombers flying from a base in Britain,
said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The missiles were guided by satellites and could be unleashed
in any kind of weather.
</P>
<P>
The officials said initial NATO attacks would use up to 100 or
more cruise missiles and sustained bombing raids in the coming
days were likely to hit dozens of targets.
</P>
<P>
The missile and bombing campaign is expected to include army
and air bases, troops, tanks, fuel and arms depots around Serbia,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Early strikes on Serb defenses would include night bombing by
U.S. F-117 attack jets based at Aviano, Italy, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
Once Serb air defenses are softened up, attack jets from a
force of 400 warplanes representing a dozen NATO nations are
expected to start pounding Serb bases, tanks and troops,
especially in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have stressed for a week that Serb air
defenses were well equipped and integrated and that bombing
attacks will be dangerous for allied pilots, especially with
late winter clouds ofter obscuring targets in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Washington Holds Anti-War Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An anti-war demonstration
took place at the White House at 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday with
protests holding high post to protest the illegal bombing of
Yugoslavia by U.S.-led NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were called by the International Action
Center, which was initiated by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark.
</P>
<P>
The anti-war organization issued a statement, demanding the
Clinton administration to stop the bombing raids against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Milosevic government of Yugoslavia has been demonized as
akin to Adolf Hitler. Make no mistake about it, this is simply a
pretext to justify military aggression against a sovereign
country," the statement said. "The real issue... is that the U.S.
military and economic establishment wanted to dominate these
strategic areas."
</P>
<P>
"What makes the U.S. government propaganda more absurd is that
it claims that it must bomb Yugoslavia to defend the rights of a
national minority people -- the Albanians in Kosovo. If one wants
to defend the right of national minority people from police
brutality and abuse, you don't have to go thousands of miles away.
The shooting of Amadou Diallo in NYC is just the tip of the
iceberg. African American, Latino, Native, Arab and Asian people
are routinely the victims of racism, discrimination, and police
terror inside the United States," the Statement continued.
</P>
<P>
The anti-war organization asked: "is it possible for a
government that violates the rights of its own national minority
peoples at home to pursue a policy of freedom and equality for
national minority peoples on other continents?"
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstration are taking place simultaneously in New
York City, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Claremont, and other
cities in the United States.

BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia appealed to the
United Nations (UN) Security Council late Wednesday to impose a
halt to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air strikes,
Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade wants the U.N. "to stop the NATO aggression and
condemn this act of vandalism," said Bulatovic after a state of
war was declared.
</P>
<P>
"This is the unprecedented act in the international relations,"
he said. "It runs contrary to the U.N. charter, and jeopardizes
peace and stability in the (Balkan) region and on the European
continent."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Information Ministry of Serbia -- the dominant
republic in the rump Yugoslavia -- denounced what it called "the
neo-Nazi policy" of the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's criminal, terrorist, under-handed and cowardly attack
against Serbia and Yugoslavia is evidence of the neo-Nazi policy
of the United States and its satellites," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Serbia will defend itself and defeat the aggressor and the
enemy," it said in a statement carried by the Tanjug news agency.

<HEADLINE> Nato Plane, Missiles Downed over North Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) - A NATO plane was shot down over
northern Kosovo on Wednesday as the 19-member Western alliance
unleashed air attacks across Yugoslavia, a NATO spokesman at the
Vicenza airbase in Italy said, according to news reports monitored
here.
</P>
<P>
"It happened in the northern region (of Kosovo)," the spokesman
was quoted saying. "We do not know what kind of plane or from
which base it came from."
</P>
<P>
Also, Serb anti-aircraft defense shot down three NATO missiles
during raids, Serbian television said.
</P>
<P>
The plane and the three missiles, presumably cruise missiles,
were shot down over the northern Kosovo town of Cicavica, the
television said.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 Western warplanes, including stealth bombers, F-16s and
F-18s, took off from the NATO airbase at Aviano, northeast Italy,
on Wednesday as the alliance began air strikes against Yugoslavia,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
They said 11 A117 stealth bombers took off, along with A10
ground attack planes, EA6B prowlers, C130s, CF18s, F16s, F15s and
F18s from the United States, Britain, Spain, Portugal and Canada,
according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
A witness was quoted saying that the planes had not yet
returned from their mission, which was expected to continue well
into the night.
</P>
<P>
"What we are seeing tonight is the initial part by the Aviano
airbase of operations over Kosovo," U.S. military spokesman Major
Scott Vadnais told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The specifics of what is going on cannot be released at the
moment but it's a fairly significant package that's involved," he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the planes were carrying maximum loads of
weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
The jets took off as Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from
two U.S. ships in the southern Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
Jets also took off from Vicenza, Istrana, Gioia del Colle and
other bases around Italy. NATO had threatened the strikes after
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to back an
international peace plan for the southern Kosovo region.

<HEADLINE> China Says Population and Development is Closely Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China fully supports the
view that population and development is closely linked, its
representative to a U.N. meeting said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sustainable development was set as the major strategic
policy in China's national economic and social development, the
Chinese representative Yang Kuifu said.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at the Preparatory Committee's on-going
meeting for the Special Session of the General Assembly for the
Review and Appraisal of the Cairo Conference Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
The Special Session takes place from June 10 to July 2.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Conference on Population and Development in 1994
identified a strategy to stabilize world population growth and
achieve sustainable development by addressing reproductive health
needs, rights and responsibilities of individuals.
</P>
<P>
China's population and family planning program is being carried
out in a more comprehensive way, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that rural family planning program is
integrated in China with measures taken for economic development
and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
China's population has reached 1.24 billion and the annual
population growth is about 12 million.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the stabilization of China's population
is not only critical to the Chinese nation's subsistence and
development, but also conducive to the stabilization of world
population, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, would join other countries in concerted efforts
to further implement the Program of Action and stabilize world
population.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation with regional
organizations should not result in the United Nations standing on
the sidelines of the conflicts and should not lead to a dangerous
trend of unilateral intervention, the Special Committee on
Peacekeeping Operations was told Wednesday as it began its
four-week annual session.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Special Committee, Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations Bernard Miyet said that United Nations
operations represented formal external intervention that was
unique in its legitimacy and in its ability to draw the world's
attention.
</P>
<P>
Miyet said in several zones of conflicts, regional
organizations had continued to show their capacity to intervene in
cooperation with the United Nations, and such partnerships had
bolstered the capacity of the United Nations in promoting
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
But such partnerships could not replace the Organization's
primary responsibility, and delegating that responsibility to
others should not be allowed to lead to uneven and uncoordinated
actions, which should be uniform and equal, Miyet stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with regional organizations should not become a way
for the United Nations to stand on the sidelines of conflict and
should not lead to a dangerous trend towards unilateral
interventions, he added.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia announced Wednesday
that its anti-aircraft defenses brought down a NATO plane and shot
down three missiles during NATO raids on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Serbian television said that the fighter jets and the three
missiles were shot down over the northern Kosovo town of Cicavica.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Pentagon said that it can not confirm the report
because it is an on-gong operation.
</P>

Up to now, all NATO planes have returned back to the bases, the
Pentagon said.

But Italian television and teletext also reported that a NATO

A NATO spokesman at the Vicenza airbase in Italy confirmed

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries to Justify Bombing Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-led NATO forces on
Wednesday launched the first wave of airstrikes against the
sovereign nation of Yugoslavia for its refusal to allow NATO
troops to police peace in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said minutes after the bombing started
that the NATO forces were bombing for "peace".
</P>
<P>
He said he would address the nation more fully later tonight on
why this action is necessary.
</P>
<P>
He tried to justify the NATO military action, which was
unilaterally carried out without U.N. mandate, by saying "If we do
not act, clearly it will get even worse."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the podium at the White House briefing room,
Clinton outlined three objectives of the airstrikes: To
"demonstrate... NATO's support for peace"; to "deter" President
Slobodan Milosevic from dealing with armed separatists and to
diminish Serbia's military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged the military action against Yugoslavia was
"not risk-free." But he said: "The dangers of acting now are
clearly outweighed by the risks of failing to act."
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, bombs rained on Yugoslavia, explosions rocked
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and air raid sirens filled the air
in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said two B-2 bombers from Whiteman Air Force
Base in Missouri dropped satellite-guided 2,000-pound bombs on
targets inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Separately, six B-52s dropped between three to four dozen
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
the United States considered the strikes an opening salve. "It
won't be over in one night," said a senior administration
official.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters the
bombing raids underscoring a turning point. "We have now moved
from a phase where force was serving diplomacy to a phase where
diplomacy is now serving the military option," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of ways Yugoslavia might respond to the
NATO airstrikes, Rubin said, and "NATO is formulating detailed
plans for reacting to all of these possible scenarios."

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets
finished lower Wednesday as investors remained unsettled by
another nervous and unconvincing performance on Wall Street and
Asia overnight.
</P>
<P>
Leading London shares fell sharply again with the FTSE 100
index ending down 43.8 points, or 0.7 percent, lower at 6,016.7.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the situation in Serbia, where NATO
air strikes look imminent, provided another concern for the

German leading shares finished the day well down, with the
benchmark Xetra Dax index 73.16 points lower at 4,797.33.
</P>
<P>
Trading was light, with losses registered across all sectors as
investors also remained unnerved by looming air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Car firms were among the hardest hit stocks, with Volkswagen
and DaimlerChrysler both falling as much as 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, shares staged a late recovery, closing down just 21

<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Sultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman has issued a decree
introducing amendments to the income tax law on companies and
firms owned by Omani citizens or joint ventures where Omani shares
account for 51 percent or more of the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Wednesday's reports, the amendments will treat all
companies equally without discrimination. The income tax will be
calculated on the basis of 12 percent of the net income after
exempting the sum of 30,000 rials (79,000 U.S. dollars) from that
income.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that income taxes on companies have been raised
from 7.5 percent to 12 percent in the current state budget to
compensate for the decline in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the non-discrimination among companies
will help attract foreign investments to Oman.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Mobinil, the first mobile telephone company in Egypt,
announced Tuesday the financial balance sheet for the year 1998,
covering the period from the commencement of the company
activities on May 21 to December 32, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The company's president, Naguib Sawiris, said that total
revenues last year amounted to 122 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said new subscribers during the first eight months of the
company activities are recorded at some 77,000, bringing the total
number by year-end to 157,000.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government has discussed in a debate
Wednesday three measures to meet the 1999 state budget.
</P>
<P>
The prospective sources include levying taxes on benzine,
taxing 1 percent on the revenues of treasury bonds, and increasing
the fare of mobile calls by 22 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
The 2.2-billion-dollar-deficit draft budget includes an article
allowing the Lebanese government to borrow 2 billion dollars to
restructure the country's debts.

<HEADLINE> NATO Began First Wave of Air Raids on Serbian Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) began its airstrike at Serbian targets across
Yugoslavia despite strong opposition from Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana have confirmed the start of NATO airstrikes code-named "
Operation of Noble Angel" by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cruise missiles were fired at and NATO fighter jets bombed
Serbian military targets from Pristina, capital of the southern
Serbian province of Kosovo, to Belgrade, capital of Yugoslavia,
and the northern city of Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
Deafening explosions were also heard near the main airport in
the coastal republic of Montenegro, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Pristina plunged into darkness after several loud explosions,
which began 8 p.m. local time (1900 GMT), went off in the
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported that the attacks have
killed a unspecified number of people including the family members
of the Yugoslav soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade residents appeared calm despite two wailing sirens and
bombings in nearby Nove Cad, where flashes could be seen from high-
rises in downtown.
</P>
<P>
Cars are rushing along the streets and people are waiting for
buses as many food, drink and cigarette kiosks continue to open.
</P>
<P>
However, most other shops are closed as usual.
</P>
<P>
People are strolling in city center, but fewer people and cars
can be seen along the Tito Avenue.
</P>
<P>
The official Radio Serbia aired an announcement from the
General Chiefs of Staff, saying more than 20 targets were hit in
Kosovo and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The message was followed by solemn music, but the usual fold
music resumed soon after.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state television showed instructions on sirens and
telephone numbers for emergency situations.
</P>
<P>
In Pristina, many residents are sheltering in their houses and
have already turned their lights off, and few people are on the
streets except for police patrols around the city of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that the military action
by the NATO is a "right thing" to do and is aimed at stopping what
he called Serbia's repression on Kosovo ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the crisis in the Serbian
province is now "full blown" and "our strikes have three
objectives. The first is to demonstrate the seriousness of NATO's
opposition against repression. Second is to deter President
Milosevic from continuing escalating his attack on ethnic
civilians by imposing a price for those attacks. And third, if
necessary, to damage Serbian capacity to wage war against Kosovo
in the future."
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has always been opposed to the use of force
against Yugoslavia, protested the NATO military operation by
recalling its ambassador to the Western military alliance and
closing down its representative office.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin condemned the airstrike as an
invasion against a sovereign state and called on the U.N. Security
Council to convene a special session on the Kosovo issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text
of the first statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Wednesday on Kosovo, the Serbian province, the first of its kind
after NATO launches air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I speak to you at a grave moment for the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the last year, I have appealed on many occasions to
the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo Albanians to seek peace
over war, compromise over conflict. I deeply regret that, in spite
of all the efforts made by the international community, the
Yugoslav authorities have persisted in their rejection of a
political settlement, which would have halted the bloodshed in
Kosovo and secured an equitable peace for the population there. It
is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times
when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
In helping maintain international peace and security, Chapter
VIII of the United Nations Charter assigns an important role to
regional organizations. But as Secretary-General I have many times
pointed out, not just in relation to Kosovo, that under the
Charter the Security Council has primary responsibility for
maintaining international peace and security -- and this is
explicitly acknowledged in the North Atlantic Treaty. Therefore
the Council should be involved in any decision to resort to the
use of force." End Text
