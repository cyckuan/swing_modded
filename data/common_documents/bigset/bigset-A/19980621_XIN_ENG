<HEADLINE> Beijing Burying Stone Tablets With Buddhist Scriptures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A large collection of stone
tablets with Buddhist scriptures carved on them a thousand years
ago will be buried at a Buddhist temple in suburban Beijing to
give them better protection.
</P>
<P>
The 8,000 tablets, out of a total of 10,082, will be put into
underground storage vaults near Yunju Temple, where they were
unearthed 41 years ago, by September 9, 1999, according to Beijing
cultural relics protection officials.
</P>
<P>
The action, the first ever taken in China, aims to protect the
priceless tablets, some of which have already been damaged by air
pollution and inadequate protection methods.
</P>
<P>
The tablets' inscriptions were first made by a senior monk at
Yunju Temple in 605 A.D., and for the next thousand years monks at
the temple continued the work, ultimately transferring 1,122 books
of scriptures onto 1,4278 stone tablets, enough to stretch 12.5
kilometers if they were put end to end.
</P>
<P>
The tablets were buried by the monks in nine caves near the
temple, until they were excavated in 1957.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that the tablets have great historical, political,
economic, and cultural significance, and for the study of the
development of calligraphy and carving. They are also an important
reference source for collating Buddhist scriptures.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 of the tablets will be put on display at the
temple and the rest will be buried under proper temperature,
ventilation, and moisture controls thanks to new technology in the
underground storage vaults.

<HEADLINE> Georgian-Abkhazian Talks Achieve  Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian-Abkhazian talks have
achieved certain progress, the Interfax news agency reported from
Tibilisi, capital of Georgia, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and Abkhazian leader
Vladislav Ardzinba will meet in the near future and sign documents
on a settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, Executive
Secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Boris
Berezovsky said Friday in Tibilisi.
</P>
<P>
According to Berezovsky, he and Russian First Deputy Foreign
Minister Boris Pastukhov held a meeting with Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the draft documents to be signed by the the

The Friday talks focused on return of refugees to the Gali
district of Abkhazia and economic problems facing the breakaway
Georgian province, Berezovsky said.

At the meeting Shevardnadze's letter to Chairman of the Council
of CIS Heads of State, Russian President Boris Yeltsin calling for

Abkhazian sides' positions appeared to be closer than before, some
issues remain unsettled. "Work in this direction will be continued
in the next few days," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Abkhazia's economy problems, the Georgian envoy said that
"Abkhazia is an integral part of Georgia and restoration of its
economy is necessary." The region's economic revival should go
hand in hand with return of refugees, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Sandal Trees Losing Quickly in C. Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Sandal trees in a central
Tanzania district are losing quickly because they are highly
demanded for perfume production.
</P>
<P>
The cutting down of sandal trees has increased greatly due to
high demand of its roots in Europe and Arabic countries, Shihata
news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The roots of the trees in the Kondoa District in central
Tanzania's Dodoma Region are used as raw materials for production
of various perfumes, the news agency quoted Justina Mangao, a
local environmental networking officer, as saying. But it did
not say when Mangao made her remarks.
</P>
<P>
Mangao said the trees have been chopped down for a long time
at Gubali, Choka, Polisa and Hachwi villages in Kondoa district
and are sold at high prices.
</P>
<P>
Felling of sandal trees has posed threats to environment in
the district, the official said recently.
</P>
<P>
She said trucks are used to transport the trees and its roots
to the border areas for exports.
</P>
<P>
However, Mangao didn't mention how per ton much the trees and
their roots are sold.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accepts U.N Spare Parts Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced on Saturday that it
accepts a recent resolution of the United Nations Security Council
on buying spare parts for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Foreign Ministry told the official Iraqi
News Agency that "Iraq will deal with the Security Council
resolution No. 1175 of 1998" as a program of action for a period
of 120 days.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution which was passed on Friday, Iraq is
allowed to spend 300 million U.S. dollars of the oil-for-food
program revenues to buy spare parts badly needed in its oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the resolution should be carried
out on the basis of the 1996 Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program, under
which Iraq is permitted to sell a limited amount of oil every six
months to import food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exception of the crippling economic sanctions
the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused the United States and Britain of trying
to change the temporary and exceptional character of the program
and turning it into a permanent arrangement in an attempt to
prolong the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of some Security Council members, including
Russia, France, China and Brazil for their efforts to eliminate
the political elements that the U.S. and Britain tried to put in
the draft resolution.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Cut Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Saturday that it will cut
oil output by 20,000 barrels per day as of July 1 in a bid to help
stabilize the world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi Ali Abdel Wahab Al-Banbi said that
his country will reduce the output to 830,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Though Egypt is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the planned cut is aimed at supporting
the efforts made by OPEC members, Al-Banbi said.
</P>
<P>
A number of OPEC members have decided to slash their oil output
to help shore up the world oil prices. And the OPEC is to hold a
session on Wednesday to look into the oil price plunge in the past
months due to overproduction of the oil producers.
</P>
<P>
The income of the oil and gas sector accounts for about
one-fourth of Egypt's revenues.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Donation to Help Rwanda's Balance of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government has
donated to Bujumbura about one million Belgian Francs to help it
import farming inputs from Belgium backing its balance of
payment.
</P>
<P>
"The fund is specifically for importing agricultural inputs
and equipment manufactured by Belgium industries," the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) Saturday quoted Jean Sayinzoga, the chairman of
the national task force for the project, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But the government of Rwanda has to prepare its demand
priorities," Sayinzoga said. The time and place of his remarks
was not given by RNA.
</P>
<P>
However, in the execution, as Sayinzoga said, the local
businessmen will act as middle men of selling inputs to the
farmers and the returns will be reimbursed to the Central Bank of
Rwanda (BNR) to be used by the government for other development
commitments.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen will purchase the said inputs and sell them at
market prices, but the government will subsidize at 50 percent
for the farmers, RNA said in a dispatch to Xinhua based here.
</P>
<P>
The project is within the bilateral cooperation between Rwanda
and Belgium and the discussion on the fund started in late 1990,
modified in 1993 and the bilateral agreement was reached at the
end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The national task force for the management of the project
involves the ministry of commerce, industry and cooperatives (as
the responsible ministry), ministry of agriculture, ministry of
foreign affairs, ministry of finance and economic planning,
chamber of Commerce and Belgian chief of the cooperation mission
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Is that a strategy by the Belgium government to clear its
stocks?" asked one Rwandan businessman who preferred to remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
But an official in the ministry of agriculture praised the
project as "a support toward the government initiative to improve
agricultural production."
</P>
<P>
Already for 1998 budget, the government of Rwanda has
allocated one billion Rwanda Francs (about 3.4 million U.S.
Dollars) for importing fertilizers and other agricultural inputs
to be sold to the farmers at subsidized prices.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Force Belgium to 2-2 Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BORDEAUX, France, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexico forced a 2-2 tie with
Belgium on a booming goal from Cuauhtemoc Blanco in group E of the
World Cup finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After trailing 2-1, Blanco equalized in the 62th minute when the
Necaxa striker netted with a left-foot volley on a Ramon Ramirez pass
from left.
</P>
<P>
Marc Wilmots gave Belgium a 1-0 first-half lead in the 43th minute
when he deflected home a Luis Oliveira corner kick with his waist,
taking the men advantage over the 10-men Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Pardo had been sent off the field in the 28th minute by
referee Hugh Dallas.
</P>
<P>
Schalke 04 midfielder Wilmots found the net again five minutes into
the second half, making a lone run into the box before chipping the
ball past Mexican keeper Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
But the Mexicans reduced the margin in the 56th minute when Alberto
Garcia Aspe converted a penalty kick awarded after Belgian substitute
Gert Verheyen made a foul in the area.
</P>
<P>
The two sides then played on a level ground as Verheyen was sent
off for the foul but the Danes gradually waned in the scorching
Bordeaux sun at Stade Lescure.
</P>
<P>
The Central Americans turned the tide to dominate the rest of the
game after the Blanco gaol, but the Belgians managed to hold out.
</P>
<P>
Mexico now lead the group with four points from one win and one
draw, followed by Belgium at two points from two draws.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, which will play against winless South Korea in
their second match later Saturday, have one point.

<HEADLINE> Long Way to Go for Angolan Peace: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos said here Saturday that there is a long way to go for
final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the government is making active efforts to put the peace
process onto the right track again, Dos Santos told reporters at
the Luanda International Airport before leaving for a 48-hour
visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president asserted that people will soon see
encouraging development of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process hit snags when the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) refused to turn the
four central "sensitive areas" over to the governance of the
government.
</P>
<P>
If UNITA does not take concrete measures to change this
situation, the new sanctions against it adopted on June 12 by the
U.N. Security Council will be in effect on June 25.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he made the trip after the crisis facing Angola's
peace process has been resolved, Dos Santos said tension remains,
but his government, together with the U.N. observers, and even
the opposition UNITA movement, are trying hard to put the peace
process in the right direction again.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president will begin his visit to Russia on June
22, at the head of a delegation which includes chief officials
from the ministries of foreign affairs, defense, mineral
resources and interior.
</P>
<P>
During his trip in Russia, Dos Santos will sign with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin a declaration on bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also sign accords on promotion and
protection of investment and the exemption of visa processing for
diplomatic and service passports as well as pacts on the joint
exploration of diamonds and on the economic and trade
cooperation.

PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people were injured, three
of them seriously, during a brief clash Saturday afternoon between
demonstrators protesting the recognition by France of the 1915
genocide of Armenians by Turkey and those who staged a
counter-demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Police said that one man was stabbed in his belly during the
clash which took place in front of the Invalides military museum
in central Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Union of Turkish Associations in France had called for a
demonstration to protest the recognition by the French National
Assembly last month of the genocide of Armenians, which Turkey
denies.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 demonstrators gathering before the OInvalides clashed
with 60 to 80 people staging a counter-demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Police questioned 34 people as suspects or witnesses when most
of those who staged a counter-demonstration descended into the
subway station nearby.
</P>
<P>
Paris shelters the second biggest Armenian community in France
after Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly has formally recognized that from
one million to 1.3 million Armenians were massacred by Turkish
troops in 1915 when they were forcibly removed from their homes
from Turkey to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey says only 300,000 Armenians died when they were
resettled in Syria under the Young Turkey government during World
War I.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused the Armenians of supporting Russia, which fought
Turkey in the war.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urged to Undertake Initiative on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
has urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to intervene
personally to reduce military tensions in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, a copy of which obtained here Saturday,
Clerides asked him to "undertake a personal initiative" in line
with a U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Security Council resolution 1146 of 1997 calls upon all
concerned to contribute to a defense spending cut and the
reduction of foreign troops on the island as a way to restore
confidence between the rival Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
after a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The president said the resolution "offers a sufficient
framework" for a discussion on the security of the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides urged everybody to "consider how implementation of the
resolution 1146 may be achieved."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated in his letter his "commitment to reconsider the
issue of non-importation on new weapons systems to Cyprus" if
progress is made towards the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high on the island since January last
year when Cyprus ordered the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles and greatly angered the Turkish Cypriot side and Ankara.
Cyprus said the deal can only be reconsidered with a progress
regarding the demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
The president recalls his letter of December 1993 to the then
U.N. chief which outlined a detailed proposal for the total
demilitarization of Cyprus, a proposal which Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriot side have turned down.
</P>
<P>
That proposal calls for the disbandment of Greek Cypriot
National Guard and Turkish Cypriot armed forces, as well as the
withdrawal of Turkish forces from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that "I have continuously called for a
substantive discussion with the Turkish side along these lines."
</P>
<P>
Clerides' letter to Annan came following a week-long
tit-for-tat show of force between Greece and Turkey, the strong
supporters of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots respectively.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, four Greek F-16 fighters and two C-130 military
transport planes landed at the newly-completed Paphos military
air base in Cyprus, which was constructed under a joint defense
pact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent six F-16 fighters Thursday to the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern Cyprus in retaliation, and five
Turkish navy warships also visited Wednesday the ports of Kyrenia
and Famagusta in the north.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have long been at odds
over this strategic island,

Acosta said:"Chilean teams used to play poorly in Europe, now the
opposite is true. We really feel that we can do something."

<HEADLINE> Belgium Coach Blames Team for Early Relaxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BORDEAUX, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Belgian coach George Leekens said the
2-2 draw with Mexico was mainly due to the early relaxation of the
team after leading 2-0 in the game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We were 2-0 up and we perhaps counted too much on our lead. Our
attitude changed and we lost two points," Leekens said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We deserved a better result after leading 2-0. With our
experience I believed we should have coasted through. But a match is
never finished until the whistle."
</P>
<P>
"The players lost four kilos out there. It was very hard to play
football. Some signalled after only 10 minutes that they were
exhausted, they wanted to come off," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said with only two points from two games, the team must win
their last group match against South Korea next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"For the next match we must win. That is our job. In the meantime
we must drink a lot and recover our weight," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mexian coach Manuel Lapuente said, "It was a hard-fought match. It
was very tough with the sending off that meant we had to play ten men
against 11."
</P>
<P>
"We suffered a lot and then it got a bit more balanced. We took a
point away. Of oucrse we would have preferred three," he added.
</P>
<P>
Belgian midfielder Enzo Scifo said, "Conditions were unbelievable.
We led 2-0 and I found the Mexicans seemed down and out. We were right
in the match and we just could not lose it."
</P>
<P>
Scifo added after Gert Verheyen made the foul in the 55 minute to
draw a sending off and a penalty for Mexico, things all changed.
</P>
<P>
"We could have gone 3-0 up. Instead, we let in a goal and lost a
man. After that it got very difficult. With the heat I suffered a lot
in the last 20 minutes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The temperature on the pitch in the Stade Lescure was apparently
above the forcasted 37 degrees centigrade and the Belgians gradually
waned after 10 minutes into the second half.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Finance Hikmat
Mizdan Ibrahim Saturday called for efforts to open the country's
free trade zone early, hoping it will help revive its economy
badly crippled by the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in his address before the first meeting of
board of the proposed zone which includes representatives of the
ministries of trade, industry, minerals, oil, transport, and
communication as well as the Central Bank of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Ibrahim highlighted the need of exerting more
efforts to finalize the phase of the final work systems of the
free trade zone in Khor Azzobair, south Iraq, and working out the
final shape of the rates of rent allowances, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister pointed out the necessity of preparing the
areas allocated for buildings and facilities in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The INA report said the board of the free trade zone has
received offers from Asian and Arab countries for investment in
the zone.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided last year to open Khor Azzobair, Basra province
overlooking the Persian Gulf, for foreign trade in an attempt to
revive its economy which suffers great difficulties due to the
UN-imposed economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> EU Recalls Ambassadors to Belarus in Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany and other four European Union
countries have decided to recall its ambassadors to Belarus after
a row with the Belarus government over a diplomatic compound in
the capital city of Minsk, German press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Ministry confirmed Saturday that Germany's
ambassador to Belarus, Horst Winkelmann, had been recalled from
his post. Meanwhile, Bonn had also asked Belarus Ambassador Pyotr
Belyayev to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
The German news agency DPA quoted British diplomatic sources in
Minsk as saying that the envoys of Britain, France, Germany,
Greece and Italy would leave Belarus on Monday for an indefinite
period of time.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already withdrawn its ambassador to
Belarus due to the same dispute which arose after Belarus'
government last week ordered the diplomats to leave the compound
in the Drozdy Park of Minsk so that plumbing repairs could be
carried out.
</P>
<P>
German press reports said that in a bid to evict the diplomats
from the compound, ambassadors' cars going to their private
residences in the compound were stopped by Belarus police for
passport checks. Meanwhile, roads to the compound were also
blocked by repair works.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Bonn on Saturday, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel called Minsk's action "unprecedented in the
history of diplomacy" and warned that it would turn the country
further into diplomatic isolation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Blow to Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- "Tremendous blow to peace."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stuck the label on the
current efforts of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to
upgrade its status at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
But this very remark can be the most proper to describe
Netanyahu's Jerusalem expansion plan which was endorsed last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Israel will construct a road around East
Jerusalem, build a tunnel under Mount Scopus to connect with
Maaleh Adumim, one of the biggest Jewish settlements in the city
and take steps to attract more Jews to it.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu termed the plan as "a basic change in Jerusalem's
status which will be remembered as a turning point."
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we are doing is to link Greater Jerusalem.
The second thing is strengthing the Jewish majority in Jerusalem,"
he said, claiming the city as the sovereign capital of Israel, and
only of Israel.
</P>
<P>
These remarks run against nothing but the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
According the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem's status, along with
other thorny issues, should be negotiated in the final status
talks between the Palestinians and Israel. Each side should
refrain from any unilateral actions leading to the change of the
legal status, demographic composition or character of the city
before the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The greater Jerusalem plan also coincides with increasing
Jewish settlement activities in the city, holy to Muslims,
Christians and Jews, and intensified Israeli efforts to demolish
Palestinian houses.
</P>
<P>
As for the settlement activities, Palestinian officials have
said the Israelis are trying to create a fait accompli in an
attempt to predetermine the status of Jerusalem before the final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the key mediator for the Palestinian-Israeli
peace process, condemned Israel's acts.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone call with Netanyahu Friday, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright expressed displeasure with the plan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin dismissed the plan
as "extremely provocative," saying it could inflame violence in
the region.
</P>
<P>
It is "hard to understand" why Israel has taken such a step at
"a sensitive time" in negotiations with the Palestinians, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the Israeli troop pullback are stalling
over Israel's refusal to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to
the Palestinians as suggested by Washington. There are also
reports of signs that Netanyahu might accept the proposal.

SANAA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
Saturday reiterated support for all efforts aimed at stopping the
armed conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Yemeni News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Libyan Secretary of Arab Unity Gomaa
al-Mahdi al Fazani, Saleh called on Eritrea and Ethiopia to solve
their border disputes through peaceful means to avoid the dangers
and miseries caused by war.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan official arrived here on Friday for a two-day
visit. During the meeting, he briefed Saleh on the initiative
offered by Libya on behalf of the Saharan countries to solve the
conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopian.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni leader said that a peaceful solution to the disputes
between the two neighbors of the Horn of Africa would serve the
regional peace and stability and secure international navigation
in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Ever since
then, the two countries have been in border disputes over at least
six areas. Early last month, armed clashes broke out between the
two sides for a 400-square-kilometer land, reportedly leaving
hundreds killed.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Hails EU's Support for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid Saturday expressed welcome to European Union's
stance on the Arab and Palestinian cause in the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"I consider this stance is very supportive of the Arab and
Palestinian stance," Abdel-Meguid said in an interview with
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on a statement issued by the EU at the end of
a summit in Britain, which voiced "very grave concern" over the
stalemate in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The EU, the biggest donor to the Palestinians, called on Israel
"to recognize the right of the Palestinians to exercise
self-determination, without excluding the option of a state."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid, who has just returned from a week-long visit to
Britain, said that during his stay in London, he held talks with
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"I told British officials that recent Israeli government
decisions (related to the Mideast) adversely affect the entire
peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The whole Mideast region will be gripped by tension and
plagued by violence if Israel sustains its (intransigent) policy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said London has assured him it will continue its
efforts to seek ways to advance the peace process after it hands
over the rotating EU presidency to Austria on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief said that during his visit in Britain, he
also met with Jim Swire, representative of the families of the
British victims in the Pan Am flight explosion over Lockerbie,
Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyans are suspected of masterminding the blast.
</P>
<P>
He discussed with Swire ways and means of breaking the freeze
shrouding the West-Libya crisis over the blast.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain insist that the two Libyan
suspects be tried in either of the two countries. Libya, fearing
that its nationals can not receive fair trial, insist that they be
tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The families of the British victims have reportedly inclined to
agree to the Libyan proposal.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Refuses to Open Trade With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has refused to open
trade with India and called for settling the core issue of Kashmir
between the two countries first.
</P>
<P>
India had repeatedly requested the Pakistani government for a
free trade between the two countries, while pledging all other
disputes will be taken up afterwards, diplomatic sources was
quoted as saying by the independent News Network International
(NNI) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, through the
Foreign Office, had conveyed it to India that it will give
priority to the amicable settlement of rifts including Kashmir
prior to opening trade, NNI said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Commerce Ministry told NNI that free trade
between Pakistan and India was not feasible, saying that Indian
industries enjoy subsidies and incentives which are not available
to Pakistan's.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our government's priority is to resolve other major
differences with India and in the presence of issues like Kashmir
we cannot think for a free trade."
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Foreign Office has issued clear
instructions to relevant authorities not to expand trade and sign
investment treaty with India as long as long-standing issues are
not resolved.
</P>
<P>
According to NNI, a number of Indian firms tried to start joint
industrial ventures here, but the Board of Investment did not
encourage them due to the government policy.
</P>
<P>
Trade figures show that Pakistan maintained 244 million U.S.
dollars deficit in trade with India in the past three financial
years, NNI said.

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Defectors Appeal for National Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Five senior Khmer Rouge
technocrats who defected to the Cambodian Royal Government earlier
this month appealed Sunday for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held at Royal Phnom Penh Hotel,
the defectors said that the past should be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
The five men, including Chan Youran, Mak Ben, In Sopheap, Kor
Bun Heng and Thiounn Thieounn, arrived in Phnom Penh on Saturday
after spending years in the jungle since 1994.
</P>
<P>
They have met with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and First
Prime Minister Ung Huot since Saturday, but details of their
meetings were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the defection, Chan said, is to bring peace to
Cambodia. "No more war in Cambodia. We want national
reconciliation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the defectors do not know the whereabouts of the
remaining three senior Khmer Rouge leaders -- Ta Mok, Noun Chea
and Khieu Samphan -- since they left them two months ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chan said: "We think Khieu Samphan is a moderate
leader. Many people believe he could defect to the government."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has said on Thursday that his government would welcome
Khieu Samphan if he handed over Ta Mok and Noun Chea to Phnom
Penh.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Jerusalem Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite U.S. criticism and
protests, the Israeli cabinet Sunday approved a controversial plan
to expand Jerusalem's municipal authority over eight Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was approved after a five-hour debate in the
cabinet, would create an "umbrella authority" over West Bank
settlements surrounding Jerusalem to the north, south and east.
</P>
<P>
It intends to put the settlements under the city's authority
mainly for construction and planning.
</P>
<P>
Any construction in settlements normally should be approved by
the Israeli Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
have strongly condemned the plan. U.S. officials have described it
as "extremely provocative," saying it could inflame violence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has said that Israel was unilaterally annexing West
Bank land, changing the status of Jerusalem and altering the
geographical structure of the city.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel,
issues about Jerusalem should be negotiated in the final status
talks for a final peace agreement. Before that, the two sides
should refrain from any unilateral actions to change its status,
demographic composition and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said the expansion will allow Israel to swallow 18
percent of the West Bank land. It has officially filed a complaint
with the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, has said it would not change the status of
Jerusalem and has no intention to annex Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the U.S.
and PNA criticism as "ridiculous." He said the U.S. was
"misreading reports in the news media."
</P>
<P>
The plan will also extend Jerusalem's boundaries westward into
Israel itself, annexing several suburbs in a bid to expand the
city's economic base. This has also caused much controversy among
residents in the west of the city.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated at Mevasseret Zion, a
community in the west of Jerusalem, protesting the proposed
annexation of their suburbs, which they said would raise their
taxes.

<TEXT>
<P>
LENS, France, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany rallied from two goals
down to tie Yugoslavia 2-2 in group F of the soccer World Cup finals
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade Red Star's teenager midfielder Dejan Stankovic opened the
scoring for Yugoslavia in the 13th minute, when he deflected the ball
with a stretching leg past outgoing German keeper Andreas Kopke after
Predrag Mijatovic floated a pass into the area from left.
</P>
<P>
German Jens Jeremies wanted to block the shot but the ball bounced
off his chest, hit the post before entering the bottom of the net.
</P>
<P>
Andy Moller almost equalized for Germany when his free kick in the
21st minute hit the right-hand post.
</P>
<P>
Captain Dragan Stojkovic, also from Red Star, made it 2-0 for
Yugoslavia by scoring in the 54th minute.
</P>
<P>
Kopke saved a shot from Darko Kovacevic but the ball slipped out of
his hand for the advancing Stojkovic to net.
</P>
<P>
Germany pulled one back in the 74th minute when substitute Michael
Tarnat converted a free kick.
</P>
<P>
The European champion equalized only ten minutes from time through
Oliver Bierhoff, the Udinese forward who scored his first goal in the
tournament on a pass from midfield Olaf Thon.
</P>
<P>
Both Germany and Yugoslavia now have four points, followed by
winless United States and Iran who will face each other in their
second group game in Lyon later Sunday.

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Progress in Economic Aid to Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China's policy of mobilizing inland
provinces and municipalities to support economic development in
the Tibet Autonomous Region has achieved remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the Tibet Autonomous Region has
carried out 62 capital construction projects funded by 33
departments of the Chinese Central Government and 15 provinces and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Total investments in the projects reached 3.67 billion yuan, up
dramatically on the 2.38 billion yuan outlined in the original
plan.
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging projects involved agriculture, water
conservancy, energy, communications and telecommunications,
industry, social welfare and municipal engineering.
</P>
<P>
The 60 completed projects are not only having a positive
effect on improving the investment environment and local
infrastructure, but also on improving the living standards of
local people.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the aforementioned 62 key projects, central
government departments and 15 cities and municipalities are
undertaking 600 projects with contracted investments of well over
800 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The region has attracted more than 600 engineers and
technicians from the industrial, agricultural, medical and
educational sectors in other provinces and municipalities across
the country over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Various provinces have also helped train some 1,870 Tibetan
technicians.
</P>
<P>
The extensive effort has enabled Tibet to achieve rapid growth
over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The region's 1997 gross domestic product hit 7.7 billion yuan,
with the region's annual economic growth rate for the past three
years surpassing the national rate.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 farmers and herdsmen have escaped poverty,
with the per capita income of urban residents rising by 60 percent
and rural residents by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has gained an extensive self-development capacity and is
rapidly establishing basic conditions for introducing the
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the central government has provided Tibet
with investments and financial aid totalling 40 billion yuan since
the 1950s, with more than 18 billion yuan provided since 1987
alone.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Boris Berezovsky said
Sunday that struggle against separatism is very acute at the
present time.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky made the remark in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, his
last leg of a three-nation tour, which already took him to Georgia,
Armenia.
</P>
<P>
All the heads of states of the 12 CIS member nations should
"firmly say 'no' to separatism," Berezovsky was quoted by a report
of the Itar-Tass news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Separatism is the root to all conflicts in CIS member states,
Berezovsky said, adding that concrete measures are needed to
straighten cooperation among CIS members.
</P>
<P>
For CIS, the strategic basis is economy, but the implementation
of economic cooperation require peace and political stability, the
executive secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian president's instruction, Berezovsky, along with
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, visited
Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan from June 19 to mediate

<HEADLINE> AL Welcomes U.S. Stance on Israeli Plan on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Sunday hailed
Washington's criticism of an Israeli plan to extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and urged stern actions from the key mediator of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department Sunday called the plan, which aimed
to tighten Israel's clamp on Jerusalem, a "provocative" step
adopted at a sensitive time when efforts are exerted to revive the
long-stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency,
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid termed the U.S. reaction
as "strong, decisive and positive," but he added that the Arabs
are "not accustomed to" such U.S. position and open criticism of
the Israeli conduct.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S., which has long been criticized by the Arab
world as leaning toward the Jewish state in the Mideast
peace-making, to adopt further such stances regarding the Israeli
practices.
</P>
<P>
"Such Israeli acts provoke both the Arab world and the
international community raising concerns over the future of the
Mideast peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid appealed to the U.S., in its capacity as a sponsor
of the peace drive, to commit to such stances which are greatly
welcomed by the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defending Israel's
plan as an effort to strengthen the Jewish majority in Jerusalem,
said Sunday U.S. criticism of the Israeli plan was "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
After a five-hour debate, the Israeli cabinet approved Sunday
the plan unveiled by Netanyahu Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli plan would create an "umbrella authority" over the
West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem to the north, south
and east. It intends to put the settlements under the city's
authority mainly for building and planning.
</P>
<P>
Any construction in settlements normally should be approved by
the Israeli Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The plan will also extend Jerusalem's boundaries westward into
Israel itself, annexing several suburbs in a bid to expand the
city's economic base. This has also caused much controversy among
residents in the west of the city.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in
a move that has failed to win international recognition. The
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future
state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked for 15
months over Israel's settlement building in East Jerusalem and
long-delayed withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel has rejected a
U.S. initiative on further redeployment, which has been accepted
by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Anwar Reiterates Support for Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) deputy president Anwar Ibrahim Sunday
reiterated his full support for the leadership of party president
and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there was no truth in allegations that their
views differ in handling the nation's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is deputy prime minister and finance minister, said
that all decisions in whatever discussions including those on
economic issues were made jointly.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a difference in opinion, there is still one
leader...one captain, that is Mahathir Mohamad and I fully support
his stand," he said when winding up the debate on the last day of
the UMNO general assembly here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that UMNO should continue to be united and send a
clear signal to all that the party is solidly united behind
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also took the opportunity to clarify the misconception
over statements said to be contradicting, made by him and Mahathir
on several occasions like at the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund meetings in Hong Kong in September last year.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes my statements are interpreted in different ways...I
have to say that I have never, in my speeches, wish to dispute the
integrity of the party leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that what was important now was for UMNO and the
government to concentrate on the unity and culture of the party
and to revive the nation's economy.

<HEADLINE> NPC Official Calls for Ocean Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic development in coastal
areas should not be achieved at the cost of the ocean environment,
and the ocean must not be treated as a dumping ground for waste,
according to Bai Qingcai, a member of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Bai is heading an NPC fact-finding team on a nine-day tour of
east China's Shandong Province to determine the province's success
in implementing the Law on Protecting the Ocean Environment.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the development of environment-friendly
technology-intensive industries and called for the strictly
controlling and, if need be, closing enterprises creating
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, which has approximately one sixth of the nation's
coastline, initiated extensive development of coastal areas in
early 1991 and has since continued expanding its marine economy.
</P>
<P>
Yet The rapid development of marine-related industries has been
accompanied by rising pollution. The 20-odd incidents of marine
pollution in 1997 alone caused direct economic losses of over 20
million yuan (2.4 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts stress that the lack of any sense of urgency for
treating ocean pollution on the part of some local leaders and the
general public, as well as the inadequate implementation of
related laws on marine pollution are the main factors for
increased ocean pollution in the province.

<HEADLINE> Barren Land Turned into Green Fields in China's Dry Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Green vegetation is emerging in
the most arid and impoverished areas in northwest China's Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Dingxi area, which has long been known as a place lacking
the basic conditions for human subsistence, has suffered a
deteriorating ecology and frequent natural disasters. A survey
conducted in the mid-1980s showed that the area had 80 million
tons of eroded soil annually, accounting for 17 percent of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
The local government developed a comprehensive plan to tackle
the problem by planting trees and building terraced fields in some
small valleys of 5-to-50 square kilometers in the early 1980s. The
area has successfully rehabilitated 110 small rivers and lakes,
and has listed another 280 for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The air quality has improved, say local farmers, who also
expressed satisfaction with cash crops that once could not be
planted in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party secretary of the Hongxian Village Branch
said that turning hillsides to terraced fields makes it possible
to increase per-hectare wheat output by 3,000 kilograms. And, as a
result, the villagers' annual per-capita income reached more than
900 yuan, a three-fold increase over 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Livestock farming has become the area's key industry with the
recovery of the vegetation, contributing 35 percent to local
economic growth.

<P>
BEIRUT, June 21 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Special Envoy
to the Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos is expected to visit
Lebanon Wednesday in new efforts to revive the peace negotiations
on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy will hold talks with Lebanese leaders over the
latest developments in the region, especially on the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks in the peace process with Israel, the Orient radio
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and Syria and Lebanon were
broken off after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to
power in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu refused to hand back to Syria the strategic Golan
Heights which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and
asked to restart the talks from the scratch.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, who says Israel's former Labor government agreed
to hand back the Golan Heights, wants to resume the talks from
where they were left off.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel formally endorsed in April the 20-year-old
U.N. Resolution 425 which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, it conditioned the withdrawal
on security guarantees from the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria have rejected the offer and demanded
again that Israel restart negotiations simultaneously with Syria
and Lebanon from where they suspended. Syria now has some 40,000
troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Moratinos will present fresh ideas to
Lebanese leaders in a bid to revive the peace talks in the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He is now in Damascus where he held talks with Syrian leaders
over his ideas.
</P>
<P>
He will also go to Tel Aviv following his visit to Beirut and
discuss his proposals, which have not been disclosed, with Israeli
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
settlements from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attack.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) team edged Guangzhou team from China's
mainland 12-11 to win the inaugural Asia-Pacific Water Polo
International Invitational Tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With players knowing one another very well due to their
frequent previous exchange of visits, the two teams tied on scores
 five times in the match.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the start of the title-deciding match, the younger
Guangzhou players began suffering from the loopholes in their
defense. And they failed to convert on quite a few scoring
chances, especially in the third period.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which ranked top in their respective group
competitions on the event's opening day on Saturday, tied 11-11
when there were only one minute 16 seconds left for the match.
</P>
<P>
A well-schemed offense and one more goal scored by the hosts 25
seconds from time marked the difference.
</P>
<P>
Guam took the third place by beating India 9-8 on Sunday. India
finished fourth, followed by Malaysia and Chinese Taipei for the
fifth and sixth places.
</P>
<P>
India had offered to host the second Asia-Pacific Water Polo
Invitational, with date and venue to be finalized.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Establish Solar Energy Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Solar Energy Industries
Association of Zimbabwe (SEIAZ) is setting up a renewable energy
funding conjunction with the government and other agencies under
which companies and end-users would access funds for solar
projects.
</P>
<P>
SEIAZ Chairman Bulukani Masola said in an interview Saturday
the sector faced scepticism from some financial institutions
about its potential, hence the need for a fund, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our financial institutions don't really understand
the importance of this sector and we believe it will take a long
time before most people realise that this is the energy of the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The association, he said, needed about 100 Zimbabwean Dollars
(5.5 million U.S. Dollars) for capacity building and end user
financing.
</P>
<P>
There would also be a component that renewable energy be used
for commercially viable projects in agriculture, specifically in
irrigation, refrigeration of vegetables, poultry and fisheries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The rising cost of electricity, he said, was a boon for the
industry and the end user would benefit from a cheaper source of
power.
</P>
<P>
Support for the renewable energy sector is increasing with
over 40 companies now involved in the manufacture, distribution
and installation of solar equipment, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
The photovoltaic equipment, a non-polluting energy technology
which converts sunlight into electricity, is used for lighting,
solar water heating and wind-base generators.

<HEADLINE> Rearing Fur-Bearing Animals Becomes Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Rearing fur-bearing animals has
become one of the main businesses for Chinese farmers to earn
extra money.
</P>
<P>
Information from a recent national symposium on development
strategy for fur-bearing animals disclosed that about one million
minks are reared in China, while the foxes and racoon dogs bred
amount to 1.5 million head.
</P>
<P>
Researcher Yang Fuhe, who is also secretary-general of the China
Special Products Society, said, "Comparing to North Europe and
North America, China is late in starting to rear fur-bearing
animals. But It has become the largest market of fur-related
products in the wake of economic development and improvement in
Chinese people's living standards, which has brought forth
opportunities for rearing such animals in the country."
</P>
<P>
Artificially-reared fur-bearing animals in China mainly include
minks, foxes and racoon dogs, which are mostly grown under cold
weather. They provide 90 percent of the raw materials needed by
the world's fur processing industry.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 million pieces of mink furs and 14 million pieces
of fox furs are consumed globally each year.
</P>
<P>
The rearing of fur-bearing animals was on an adequate scale in
China in the 1950s, and by the mid-1980s China had formed a
capacity of exporting five million pieces of mink furs annually.
But the rearing of such animals slumped in the early 1990s as
export fell.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, domestic demand for fur-related products
has been increasing, so the rearing of fur-bearing animals has
again recovered. Moreover, China has become a major importer of
fur raw materials and products in the world since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium urged more efforts to improve the
quality of the breeding stock, furs, and the fur processing
technology in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has entrusted the Special
Products Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
to build a center for monitoring and testing breeding stock
varieties of special economic animals.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Parliament Impeaches Interior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
Majlis (parliament) on Sunday impeached Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri by refusing to give him a vote of confidence, dealing a
serious blow to the moderate government of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the Majlis open session on Nouri's impeachment
motion raised by 31 conservative Majlis deputies, 137 voted for
the motion, 117 against and 11 abstention.
</P>
<P>
Nouri's failure to win a vote of confidence indicated the
continued control of the conservatives on the Iranian Majlis,
hinting more difficulties facing the open-minded Khatami's
government in the future.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was accused of creating tensions in the society, issuing
provocative statements and using inexperienced persons for the
managerial posts at the Interior Ministry. He was also blamed for
his open support for Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who
has been under open trial since June 7 on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Khatami and his moderate supporters strongly supported Nouri,
even warning that Nouri's absence from the cabinet would be
detrimental to the government of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives said that the continuation of
Nour's service as interior minister would be dangerous to the
tranquility and stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami would be forced to choose a new interior minister to
replace Nouri. Some moderates have hinted that former Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi would be Khatami's choice.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seeking Business With Iraq Under Oil-for-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian firms are seeking big
business with Iraq under the framework of the United Nations
oil-for-food program, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During a visit by an Egyptian economic delegation to Baghdad
last week, Egyptian firms offered to participate in schemes to
renovate Iraq's dilapidated oil facilities and prospect for new
fields. Iraq and Egypt also clinched several deals to increase
Egyptian food and medical exports to Iraq, which is suffering
under the U.N. sanctions, the MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation was headed by Egyptian Trade and Supply
Minister Ahmed Gowaili, who held talks with Iraqi Oil Minister
Amir Rashid.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Iraqi side asked Egypt to provide its
factories with necessary spare parts, raw materials and Egyptian
expertise to upgrade their productivity.
</P>
<P>
Rashid welcomed the Egyptian private sector's participation in
Iraq's oil sector's overhaul, adding that 300 million U.S. dollars
had been earmarked out of the oil-for-food program revenues to buy
badly needed spare parts to develop this industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program struck in 1996, Iraq
is permitted to sell a limited amount of oil every six months to
import food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exception to the crippling economic sanctions
the U.N. Security Council has imposed on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Egyptian Holding Company of Pharmaceutical
Industries Galal Ghorab told MENA Sunday that Egypt will export to
Iraq 3.5 million pounds (1.03 million dollars) worth of medicines
in July within the fourth stage of the oil-for-food deal according
to the memo of understanding signed by the two ministers in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has already exported medicine and medical equipment worth
45 million Egyptian pounds (13.2 million dollars) to Iraq through
the previous three deals since the inception of the oil-for-food
deal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the recent deal signed in Baghdad, Iraq agreed to import
150 million dollars worth of foodstuffs from Egypt in the later
half of this year, the food import will increase to 250 million at
the end of next year, Sunday's Egyptian Gazette reported.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian delegation representing a large group of heads of
pharmaceutical companies will leave for Baghdad next week for
talks with Iraqi Health Ministry officials on the government's
programs to rehabilitate hospitals and dispensaries.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Increasing Efforts to Promote Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The government of Guangdong
Province, China's economic powerhouse, has issued a notice
recently calling for stronger support to foreign trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Local financial departments should be responsible for the 20
percent of export tax refunds turned in to the central government,
the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will set up a low-interest fund for exports, make new
efforts to establish state-owned holding companies in the
foreign trade sector, and give priority to them in terms of
being listed on stock exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to promote businesses engaged in processing
materials supplied by overseas customers, and exempt state- and
province-approved such foreign trade firms of value added tax. It
will offer some preferential taxation policies to foreign-funded
ventures that are engaged in processing overseas-supplied
materials.
</P>
<P>
The province is working out policies to encourage the private
sector to do foreign trade, providing that private businesses will
enjoy the same rights as the state sector in using overseas
investments in terms of export licenses and quotas.
</P>
<P>
Being China's largest experter, Guangdong registered more than
130 billion US dollars worth of imports and exports last year,
accounting for 40 percent of the nation's total. It used 14.2
billion US dollars worth of foreign investment in the same year,
making up 22 percent of the national total.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Malaysia's Economy Can Recover in 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Sunday Malaysia can pull itself out from the
economic crisis within three months if the country is allowed to
determine its course without the intervention of outside factors.
</P>
<P>
"If I am in full control, I can assure that within three
months, we can recover," Mahathir, who is also the United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) president, told a news conference at
the end of the party's three-day general assembly here.
</P>
<P>
However, with outside forces fiddling around with the currency
and selling of shares, it was difficult to make the economy
recover, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the case of the Japanese yen which went down recently.
But after the intervention by the United States, the value of the
Japanese currency strengthened against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said that if the interest rates in neighboring
countries could be brought down, Malaysia's economy would be able
to make a speedy recovery.
</P>
<P>
"If the interest rate goes up, a lot of money will flow out of
this country," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
On market forces, he said they were not infallible.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned, market forces are motivated entirely
by profit concern. They don't care if it destroys the economy of a
whole nation or region. Market forces only care for making money,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said currency movement had nothing to do
with a country's economic performance or the actions initiated by
the government.

<HEADLINE> Young Chinese Being Encouraged to Fully Tap Potential (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yumei, a young rural woman
from east China's Shandong Province, quit her job at a hostel
owned by the county government in 1991 much to the chagrin of
fellow villagers who thought she had lost a "golden opportunity".
</P>
<P>
However, Wang, 25, is now the president of a rabbit breeding
company with total capital of 56 million yuan (6.7 million US
dollars) and annual profits of close to seven million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"I earned a pretty good income at the hostel seven years ago,
but was convinced that raising rabbit was a good way to make more
money and help my fellow villagers escape poverty," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government advocates that all Chinese young people
emulate Wang's pioneering spirit and unwillingness to be
content with the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Hu Jintao spoke at last Friday's opening session
of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Youth League of
China (CYLC) and urged young people to maintain a pioneering
spirit and exhibit creativity while making painstaking efforts
to adapt to economic and social changes.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the congress pointed to Wang's success as
an inspiration to a large number of young workers laid-off from
state-owned enterprises in cities.
</P>
<P>
Young people under the age of 35 account for some 35 percent of
China's nearly 10 million laid-off workers, with the rate for
state-owned enterprises approaching 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese people had cradle-to-grave jobs under the former
planned economic system, and many young workers with great
potential were relegated to posts requiring minimal expertise,"
according to Xi Zhenhui, a CYLC official with the Beijing Textile
Holding Company.
</P>
<P>
"Young laid-off workers are temporarily without jobs, but at the same
time have an excellent opportunity to exhibit their potential," said
Xie.

<P>
Many companies in China's slumping textile industry have be
forced to reduce staff and destroy spindles to cut losses. Some
50,000 textile workers in Beijing have lost their jobs over the
past five years, according to Xie.
</P>
<P>
He said the traditional function of youth league organizations
in enterprises centers on uniting and guiding young people to make
more contributions to their enterprises and the country.
</P>
<P>
"However, as part of ongoing economic restructuring, the work
of the CYLC should focus on encouraging laid-off young workers to
be independent and self-supporting, while at the same time helping
them tap their potential and start anew," said Xie.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang, member of the Secretariat of the 13th CYLC Central
Committee, noted that the major tasks of the CYLC organizations at
all levels are to help young people develop new concepts of
employment suited to the market economy, and to both search for
and create posts which give full play to the many advantages
offered by young people.
</P>
<P>
The CYLC Central Committee recently launched a program to train
highly capable young workers with pioneering awareness and provide
assistance enabling them to establish small- to medium-size
enterprises to provide employment for other laid-off
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
The committee has raised over 10 million yuan for a fund that
helps young people launch new undertakings.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Saudi Arabia Call on Israel to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister of Saudi
Arabia Prince Sultan Ibin Abdul-Aziz Sunday urged Israel to submit
to the requirements of peace in order to advance the stranded
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Aziz, who is also Second Prime Minister and Inspector
General, made his remarks after talks with visiting Lebanese
Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The prince was quoted by Saudi Press Agency Sunday as saying
that the current crisis in Arab world were caused by Israel's
reluctance to comply with the requirements and principles of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi defense minister said his talks with Dalloul were
characterized by the spirit of fraternity and cordiality which
marks the Lebanese-Saudi relations.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Dalloul said Lebanon had no problem in signing a
peace treaty with Israel if it was a just and comprehensive one.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel wants peace and security, then we (Lebanon) and
Syria are ready to sign a peace accord within three months
provided it is based on the principles of justice as stipulated by
the Madrid peace conference," Dalloul said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States was interested in this approach
because Washington was aware of the dangers which could result
from the collapse of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to the United States, Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri had announced the readiness of both Lebanon
and Syria to sign "a just and comprehensive peace accord" with
Israel within three months.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul, who arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday for talks on
ways to enhance bilateral ties, also reiterated Lebanon's
appreciation for the Saudi support to Lebanon and the efforts to
restore peace and stability to Lebanon.

emerged as a major force in promoting nationwide studies of Deng
Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Deng, the late Chinese leader who passed away in February 1997,
developed the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and was honored "the chief architect of China's
reform and opening-up".
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over three million students attending more
than 1,000 Chinese universities and colleges are currently
studying Deng Xiaoping Theory. The over 2,000 Deng Xiaoping campus
study societies formed by the students have attracted several
hundred thousand members.
</P>
<P>
The first Deng Xiaoping Theory Study Society was established in
late 1993 at prestigious Beijing University which celebrated its
100th anniversary last month. China's Marxism study was also
initiated at the university in the late 1910s.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping Theory is not only Marxism for modern China, but
also Marxism for the 21st century," according to one Beijing
University student.

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping Theory Fascinates Chinese University Students (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cai Zhong, a teacher at East China Normal University in
Shanghai, said the keen interests university students have in
studying Deng Xiaoping Theory is derived from the same traditional
sense of responsibility for their nation and motherland shared by
Chinese intellectuals as a whole.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, according to Cai, students have realized that
a clear understanding of Deng Xiaoping theory will be extremely
"helpful" in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Mastering Deng Xiaoping Theory will not only provide young
students with a clear understanding of China's domestic situation
and the Party's principles and policies, but will also provide
a 'golden key' for analyzing the complicated society," said Cai.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Youth League of China (CYLC), the world's largest
youth organization with 68.5 million members, has attached great
importance to promoting studies of Deng Xiaoping Theory amongst
China's 320 million young people.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory will build a "powerful spiritual pillar"
for the country's younger generation, according to a senior
official with the CYLC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders also regard the introduction of Deng Xiaoping
Theory to Chinese youngsters as the most effective guarantee for
ensuring China's reform and opening-up efforts which Deng
initiated over two decades ago will continue to develop well into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Our cause will be carried forward from one generation to
another and will enjoy great prosperity so long as the younger
generation unswervingly holds high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping theory," said Vice-President Hu Jintao, who also serves
as a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Grape Producer Expects Good Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Heavily laden grapevines indicate
the sixteenth consecutive good grape harvest for Turpan
Prefecture, China's leading grape producer located in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"The vineyard is my bank, and my savings deposit will surely
grow this year," said Rozi Niyaz, a Uygur farmer in Lianmuqin
Township, Shanshan County.
</P>
<P>
Rozi's half hectare of grapevines are once again thriving, and
his family earned more than 60,000 yuan last year on the same
tract of land. Grape farmers in the township earn an annual per
capita income of 2,100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Turpan will harvest over 400,000 tons of fresh grapes this year
on 16,000 ha, and will process 80,000 tons of raisins, according
to local grape expert Li Zhichao.
</P>
<P>
Turpan, a popular tourism venue famous for its seedless grapes,
has a history of 2,000 years of grape cultivation. Farmers in the
cities harvested 1,700 kg of grapes per hectare in 1997, compared
with a mere 200 kg in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Calls for Boosting Libya-Egypt Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Sunday received a message from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
calling for closer bilateral relations and constant high-level
contacts on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered to Mubarak by Gomaa al Fazani,
secretary of Arab unity of the Libyan General People's Committee,
who arrived here Saturday night on a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan official told reporters after the meeting with
Mubarak that the message focused on two key topics: the prospects
for developing relations between "the two brotherly peoples" in
all fields, and the constant consultations between the two leaders
on the developments concerning the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Al Fazani said he felt during his meeting with Mubarak that the
Egyptian leader was satisfied with the current progress in
boosting bilateral economic, social and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi canceled a scheduled week-long visit to Egypt early
this month, without giving reasons. But Mubarak told reporters
Sunday that Gaddafi had a mild tonsil problem and is expected to
reschedule the trip in 10 to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
Both Egyptian and Libyan officials have denied a press report
that Gaddafi postponed the visit because of a failed assassination
attempt against him.
</P>
<P>
The official Libyan news agency JANA last week denounced the
report on the alleged assassination attempt as "lies and vile
allegation."

JINAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Rizhao in east China's Shandong
Province enjoyed a total import and export volume of 63.3 million
US dollars for the four months of 1998, in additon to attracting
close to 40 million US dollars in foreign investment during the
period.
</P>
<P>
The city's timely adjustments to the export market and
optimization of product mix have led to the steady development of
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The coastal city has established economic and trade ties with a
number of southeast Asian nations, with emphasis on electronics,
machine-building, cement, clothing, chemical and food processing
industries.
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's large enterprises have responded to the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia by adjusting their export
market and shifted the focus of exports to markets in Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Local enterprises have avoided manufacturing products offered
by southeast Asian nations and are instead focusing on high
technology and high value-added products with wider markets.
</P>
<P>
Plans have been drawn up for enterprises engaged in foreign
trade to increase investments to improve levels of scientific
management.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Majlis Speaker Says Impeachment Nothing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Nateq Nouri Sunday rejected the accusations by the moderates that
the hardliners wanted to capitalize on the impeachment of Interior
Minister to weaken the government.
</P>
<P>
At the open session of the Majlis to debate over impeaching
Abdollah Nouri, the speaker said that the impeachment did not mean
contradiction and confrontation between the legislative and
executive departments, nor did it imply any attempt to undermine
the government led by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The request for impeachment is part of the rights of parliament
members and such motions were also seen before, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing unity, the speaker also said that the government and
parliament have one outlook and "I have recommended my colleagues
to act like before to demonstrate their maturity in a healthy and
clam atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Nouri appeared at open session Sunday to defend his
performance, refuting the accusations leveled against him by 31
hardline lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
At the session, the lawmakers once again accused him of
creating tensions in the society, giving provocative statements
and appointing inexperienced people to managerial posts in his
ministry.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the continuation of Nouri's service as the
interior minister is detrimental to tranquillity and stability in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Majlis regulation, lawmakers will cast the
no-confidence vote against Nouri at the end of the debate in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment of the moderate Nouri came at a time when
relations between moderate government and hardliners in judiciary
and parliament became tense since the arrest and trial of Tehran
mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who was also a loyalist of the
president.
</P>
<P>
The moderates have termed the moves launched by the hardliners
as attempts aimed at weakening Khatami's government.

<P>
MAPUTO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Filomena Chisondzo, head of the
Mozambique Refugee Support Center has revealed that the country
is now home to about 400 refugees, who take shelter in Massaca-2
refugee center in Boane county near the capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Filomena made the disclosure Saturday on an occasion marking
the African Refugee Day, the Domingo newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that refugees scattered about in refugee centers in
Tete and Niassa provinces in the north are all transferred to
Boane for the benefit of management.
</P>
<P>
The refugees in Mozambique are mostly from Rwanda, Burundi,
Somalia and Angola, said Filomena.
</P>
<P>
Some refugees have already been expatriated. However, she
stressed, none of them are expelled or forced back.
</P>
<P>
Refugees have similar rights and obligations as foreigners
residing in Mozambique, they must abide by the laws in the
country, Filomena noted.
</P>
<P>
According to her, due to their limited number, the refugees
have not posed any problems to the country, neither are they
found involved in any crimes or subversive activities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Refugee Support Center in Boane is carrying out
several programs especially agricultural programs to help
refugees gain self-sufficiency, the official added.

<HEADLINE> French Govt Confident of HK's Future: Envoy (1) By Feng Xiuju </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
confidence in the future of Hong Kong, said a French envoy here as
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is greeting its
first anniversary on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"The way the Chinese government has adhered to the
implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems' and
adopted a policy of non-interference in Hong Kong's affairs since
the handover is indeed a factor increasing France's confidence,"
said French Consul General in Hong Kong Thierry Dana in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that the future of Hong Kong, both in terms of
prosperity and of continuing freedom, has always been of special
interest to France, its people and its authorities.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the days when the handover was still a long term
perspective, Dana said that France was very attentive to the
factors which would eventually make the transition as smooth as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, the French people were very happy to see that Hong
Kong was returning to China peacefully and in full respect of its
identity," he said.
</P>
<P>
This deep attachment of France to Hong Kong is of course
enhanced by the importance of the economic ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the present economic ties between France and Hong
Kong are very developed, Dana said that trade with Hong Kong
provides France with its largest surplus outside the Organization
for the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), placing Hong
Kong immediately after Britain, Switzerland and Spain in terms of
trade surplus.

<P>
Trade between France and Hong Kong remains steady year after
year, at a level of around 20 billion French franc (3.3 billion
U.S. dollars) of French exports, mainly involving aircraft,
consumer goods, wine and electronics, one third of which are
re-exported.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the visit last March to France by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa, Dana said it was remarkable in many
respects. Tung was received at the highest levels, both by French
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The visit gave the chief executive a unique opportunity to
explain in detail how Hong Kong had developed after the handover,
especially in terms of the respect for the principle of a high
degree of autonomy written down in the Basic Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a special occasion for the highest authorities in
France to understand how well those principles had been respected
in reality," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dana noted that the most significant feature of the relations
between France and Hong Kong has been steady development of
France's presence here over the years.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 French people are currently living in Hong
Kong. It is France's second largest community in Asia after Japan.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 French companies are operating in Hong Kong, and
some of the biggest have set up regional headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
A specific proof of the confidence of the French government
in the future of Hong Kong is also the extension of the French
International School whose capacity should reach 1,600 places
around year 2001 compared with 1,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of France in Hong Kong both as a tourist
destination and as a place to invest in is, of course, one of our
main objectives," Dana said.

"In my opinion," he said, "such a goal is better attained
through enriching cultural ties between France and Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the launching of French May
Festival in Hong Kong every year since 1993 and the selection of
Hong Kong as the first place in Asia by French organizers to hold
the Wines and Spirits Exhibition are the "clear indication of the
great importance that France attaches to this city, not only as a
gateway to China but also as a regional hub".
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the ties between France and China as a
whole, Dana said that such a relationship has experienced a
tremendous development over the years, not only in the economic
sphere, but even more fundamentally in the political one.
</P>
<P>
France and China went through a more difficult period a few
years ago, in connection to certain weapon-related contracts
between France and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the China visit by the French president in
Spring last year marked the launch of a new era between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, numerous high-ranking visits from both countries
have taken place, the most important one being the visit of
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to France last April.
</P>
<P>
Dana revealed that French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is due
to visit China in September, adding that "this is a concrete
evidence of the French government's wish to strengthen its ties
with China."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries now share very similar views in
the political and economic fields, ranging from the fight against
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to the control
of the effects of the economic globalization by the government.
</P>
<P>
The French authorities pay tribute to the stabilizing role
played by China in the current economic turmoil in Asia,
particularly in relation with the efforts undertaken by the
Chinese authorities towards the modernization of the economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the fact that China has resisted the pressure
to devaluate its currency Renminbi is particularly remarkable, he
added.

through a circular.
</P>
<P>
The authorized dealers will no longer be required to surrender
the foreign currencies to the State Bank.

And the State Bank will not provide exchange risk guarantee.
The banks and depositors will be free to use the funds as they
please and banks will decide the rate of return that they will

<HEADLINE> Museveni Angry over Bad Defense Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
is extremely angry over senior army officers' purchase of
out-of-date military equipment from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
A Sunday Monitor report said the second-hand MI24 helicopter
gunships bought from Belarus, a former Soviet Union republic,
were in such bad conditions that military pilots refused to fly
them, sending the president hitting the roof with anger.
</P>
<P>
The military is also reported to have bought five pieces of
100 mm anti-aircraft guns from the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea which have also been found not to be up to scratch.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government had released 12.2 million U.S.
Dollars for the purchase of helicopters while the actual money
spent on the same gunships by the purchasers was only 5.4 million
Dollars, leaving the rest as the purchasers' commission, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Pinto, a member of parliament from Kakuto, told
parliament Thursday that these officers should be charged with
treason, because they had undermined the national security.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has appointed a commission led by Major Noble
Mayombo, the deputy director of military intelligence, including
experts from the air force, Civil Aviation Authority and a female
officer from the Ministry of Justice to investigate the status of
the gunships.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters, the report said, should have been overhauled
or refurbished before delivery as agreed.
</P>
<P>
The two helicopters already delivered were said to be not air
worthy because the specifications on the logbooks are different
from those on the engines.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The annual revenue of the
Ethiopian Airlines reached 1.6 billion Birr (about 228.6 million
U.S. Dollars) last year, compared with only 563 million Birr
(80.4 million Dollars) in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Government newspaper Ethiopian Herald Sunday quoted Yoseph
Yohannes, manager of the airlines' sales department, as saying
that the profit of the airlines now stands at 44 million Birr
(6.29 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The manager attributed the boosting of annual income to the
reform measures taken especially by reducing service charges,
adjusting flight hours so as to avoid delays, and the opening of
new flight routes.
</P>
<P>
Yoseph said the airlines at present has 44 international
flight routes as well as 29 domestic routes and accommodates a

<HEADLINE> Couple to Marry on World Cup Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Ever think of holding your wedding on
the World Cup pitch?
</P>
<P>
When the question comes to Norway's Oivind Ekeland and his
Brazilian fiancee Rosangela de Souza, the answer is more than
affirmative.
</P>
<P>
They want their ceremony to be staged on the very pitch and very
day that their home countries clash in a group A game in Marseille on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With permission from the international soccer governing body FIFA,
Ekeland, a 28-year-old from Stavanger, will marry 29-year-old Souza at
Stade Velodrome one hour before the kick-off.
</P>
<P>
"It is unique," said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He added the couple, both Catholic, will be blessed by a priest
after their lawyers have arranged with the local civil and church
services.
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the couple, who originally wanted it to be held at the
break during the match, contacted the French World Cup Organizing
Committee weeks ago but had been refused.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA's World Cup Organizing Committee President Lennart
Johansson and former FIFA President Joao Havelange gave the green
light on the other day.
</P>
<P>
Cooper explained the image of two people being bonded together on
pitch is in line with the theme of "football bringing people together,
love, and faternity."

<HEADLINE> Fujian Records Rising Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
continued to enjoy substantial rises in exports despite the
effects of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province exported products valued at 4.45 billion
U.S. dollars during the January-May period, up 3.43 percent
on the previous year's period, according to customs figures.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Putian recorded
double-digit growth in exports ranging from 11.67 percent to 13.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Provincial government officials attributed increased exports to
efforts to readjust Fujian's sales strategy abroad and exerting
greater effort in the American and European markets, as well as to
expanded guidance and assistance for export companies.

<HEADLINE> HK Airport Railway Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Mass Transit Railway (MTR)
Corporation celebrated here Sunday the completion of the Airport
Railway project, which will carry passengers between Central, Hong
Kong Island, and the new airport in just 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 34-kilometer Airport Railway will provide two separate
services, the Airport Express and the Tung Chung Line. The Airport
Express is the first purpose-built railway in the world serving an
airport with in-town check-in facilities at major stations. The
Tung Chung Line will offer a fast and convenient transport link
for commuters to the Tung Chung new town, Tsing Yi Island, and
West Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Tung Chee Hwa officiated at the completion ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Completed in four years, the Airport Railway has proved yet
again that Hong Kong remains a fast moving city with a well-proven
track record of fulfilling our promises," he said. "Few cities in
the world can top our record in delivering major works project so
quickly and so well."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the completion of the Airport Railway also turns
over a new leaf in Hong Kong's railway development history. "This
is the first new railway line which we have built after the
completion of the MTR network in the urban area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the railway system as part of the backbone of Hong
Kong's efficient transport system, Tung added that three railway
projects will be built in the next five years at a cost of about
110 billion HK dollars (14.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Jack C. K. So, chairman of MTR Corporation, also praised the
project as a great engineering achievement, saying it will again
demonstrate to the world Hong Kong's standard of excellence and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 113 kilometers of tracks and 900 kilometers of
overhead cables were laid and some 3 million tons of concrete was
poured in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Tung Chung Line will go into service on Monday while the
Airport Express will start service on July 6 together with the
opening of the new airport.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Business Develops Rapidly in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The mobile phone sector is now one
of the fastest growing sectors in Bangladesh, said The Bangladesh
Observer weekly reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 50,000 Bangladeshis are using mobile phones,
according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
Mobile phone made its first formal entry in this South Asian
country in 1989 when the Citycell company was given license for
cellular phones by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Citycell monopolized the business for several years and
kept the price quite high, which only a few people could afford.
</P>
<P>
That monopoly ended in late 1996 when the government permitted
three more companies -- Aktel, Grameen Phone and Sheba Telcom --
into the business. From then on, the number of cellphone users has
kept increasing owing to the lower price.
</P>
<P>
Besides, this has also put pressure on the state-owned
Telegraph &AMP; Telephone (T&AMP;T), which had until then the monopoly
over the telephone service.
</P>
<P>
The T&AMP;T has currently nearly 500,000 subscribers, up from
65,000 in 1971, the year of Bangladesh's independence.
</P>
<P>
Yet the T&AMP;T is swamped with hundreds of thousands of
applications seeking telephone lines. Those who can afford up to
15,000 taka (about 326 U.S. dollars) are now opting for mobile
phones instead of waiting for phones from the T&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
Even some of the rural poor have now access to mobile phones
thanks to the Grameen Phone company run by the Grameen Bank, which
has earned international reputation for providing small loans to
the poor women in villages.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Interviewed by Chinese Reporters-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said that his upcoming visit to China will help deepen the mutual
understanding and expand the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope in a roundtable discussion here on Friday
with a group of U.S.-based Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "I hope that through my trip both I and the
people of the United States will learn more about China -- about
the rich history, about the exciting events going on today, about
the incredible potential for the future of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that through his trip "the leaders and the people
of China will learn more about the United States".
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can expand the areas of cooperation between our
governments and our peoples," the president, who begins his China
tour next Thursday, told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
As home to one-fourth of the world's people and with a rapidly
growing economy, he said, China has enormous contributions to make
to the world of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said China and the United States should be partners for
stability and security in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China recently led the five-party talks on the
situation in South Asia and played a positive role in preventing a
nuclear race in that region.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his vision on the constructive partnership between
China and the United States in the 21st century, Clinton indicated
that the partnership also includes that on preventing arms
proliferation, on the fight against crimes, on energy and
environment, on science and technology, on economy and on
promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He added that developing and improving this cooperation will
not only benefit the people of the two countries but also help
stabilize the world.
</P>
<P>
Talking about U.S. critics of his China policy, Clinton said
that most Americans support his engagement policy because they
want a constructive partnership with the government and the people
of China.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say in this case, I think my critics are wrong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe most Americans understand that we have differences
now and 100 years from now we will have some differences, because
we are different people with different cultures and different
systems and different backgrounds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I think the important thing for the Congress is to
recognize that over the long run we must choose engagement with
China, not isolation from China, not estrangement from China."
</P>
<P>
"Once you make that decision," Clinton went on, "then the
question is how can you expand the areas of cooperation where we
can agree, how shall we manage our disagreements, and how can we
learn from one another so that we can build a more peaceful, more
prosperous, more open world."
</P>
<P>
"Even my harshest critics would have to admit that President
Jiang and I have had wonderful, stimulating and very honest
discussions about our differences."
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the idea that we should have less contact
with China, with the Chinese government and with the Chinese
people, is just wrong," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said he will continue to stick up to his China policy and do
his best to defeat any legislation in the Congress that would
undermine the ability of his government to pursue the interests of
the U.S. and the interests of the American people in developing a
partnership with China and the Chinese people.

Asked about the U.S. policy toward Taiwan, Clinton said he will
reaffirm to the Chinese leaders during his visit the commitments
the U.S. side has made to the Chinese side. In particular, he
said, he will reaffirm that the United States will stick to its
"One China" policy and will abide by the principles embodied in
the three communiques signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the financial crisis in Asia, President Clinton said the
cooperation between the United States and China is more important
than ever before, as indicated in the economic situations and
challenges now facing Indonesia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The president also praised the 20-year cooperation on science
and technology between the United States and China as having a
"remarkable record" in biodiversity preservation, earthquake
forecast and child health care.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should further strengthen their
cooperation in these areas because the potential benefits to their
peoples and to other people around the world are enormous.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also noted that the leaders of the two countries have
talked about the prospect of having a long and cooperative project
on the rule of law and hoped that the cooperation will keep on.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of arms non-proliferation, Clinton said that China
and the United States "have a good way of working together" and
could keep on the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also praised China as having the oldest and richest
culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President said: "The United States many times in our
country's past has felt a special affinity to China. And we have
had many Americans who have lived in China, ...We have been allies
in war."
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a greater feeling for the Chinese people in
the hearts of Americans than perhaps many Chinese realize," he
said. "And I hope this trip will help us to continue to go forward
in a new and better way."
</P>
<P>
"The American people wish the Chinese people well. We want to
know more about the China of today and the China of yesterday, and
we want to be a big part of the China of tomorrow," Clinton said.

<P>
PARIS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Dutch coach Guus Hiddink predicted
that his team would have a more complicated game against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands trounced South Korea 5-0 in a match on Saturday
to top the group which also includes Mexico and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted because of the result, although in the first 25
minutes we didn't make the pace we are used to, partly because of
the field," said Hiddink.
</P>
<P>
Hiddink said"It's always good not to depend on one player who
can make a goal. I was very happy that the first goal was made by
Philip Cocu, he had my full confidence."
</P>
<P>
"Our next match with Mexico will be totally different," said
Hiddink, "I think the game will be more complicated than this one,
because I consider Mexico as a very experienced team."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Opens Impeachment Debate on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian parliament, the Majlis,
opened the debate Sunday over impeaching Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri, a representative of the moderate movement who is
under strong fire from the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Nouri appeared at the Majlis open session to defend his
performance, refuting the accusations leveled against him by 31
conservative parliamentaries, who have tabled the no-confidence
vote against him.
</P>
<P>
At the Majlis open session, broadcast live by Tehran Radio,
conservative lawmakers once again blasted Nouri for creating
tensions in the society, giving provocative interviews and
speeches in different provinces and appointing inexperienced
people to managerial posts at the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the continuation of Nouri's service as the
interior minister is detrimental to tranquillity and stability in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis' session was adjourned at noon and will continue in
the afternoon. According the regulations, the Majlis will cast the
no-confidence vote against Nouri at the end of the debate.
</P>
<P>
To close their ranks for Sunday's showdown, Majlis deputies of
the two rival camps held separate meetings Saturday to coordinate
their stance.
</P>
<P>
The moderate daily Iran News reported Sunday that this was an
indication that the conservative lawmakers have no intention to
back down from their impeachment offensive against Nouri.
</P>
<P>
But the daily predicted a victory for Nouri in the
no-confidence vote, citing that he is enjoying the solid support
of the moderate president Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Nouri's fate is relying on the vote of independent Majlis
deputies, because there is a balance of power between the moderate
and conservative camps with each having around 100 seats in the
270-seat Majlis.

</P>
<P>
Sampaio scored the goal in the match between Scotland and Brazil

DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian airline,
Precision Air, will introduce flights to Njombe, Mbeya, Mafia and
Pemba in Tanzania in a bid to boost tourism industry and solve

<HEADLINE> China to Invest Heavily in Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China will pour an investment of
160 billion yuan (about 19.28 billion US dollars) to build
highways this year, 40 billion yuan more than original allocation
of 120 billion yuan (about 14.46 billion US dollars) or up 33.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
And the combined investment for highway construction will reach
500 billion yuan (about 60.24 billion US dollars) by the year
2000, Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong told a national
conference on highway construction called in Fuzhou Saturday.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the pace of highway construction is an important
decision made by the State Council, China's highest governing
body, as part of the efforts to meet the domestic demand and ensure
the economic growth this year, Huang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Building of key highway projects will cost 90 billion yuan
(about 10.84 billion US dollars) this year. Upgrading of road
network and construction of major highway hubs will cost 50
billion yuan (about 6.02 billion US dollars). Another 20 billion
yuan (about 2.41 billion US dollars) will be used to build county
and township roads and highways.
</P>
<P>
The country will add more than 24,000 km of highways in 1998,
including 1,117 km of expressways, Huang said, adding that the
highway building will provide 3.25 million job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
From 1998 to the year 2000, China will build 74,000 km of
highways, including more than 3,200 km of expressways. By the end
of this century, the country will have more than 1.3 million km of
highways and more than 8,000 km of expressways.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the country will give priority to the
construction of "two vertical, two horizontal, and three important
highways", which refer to Beijing-Zhuhai, Tongjiang-Sanya,
Lianyungang-Horgas, Shanghai-Chengdu, Beijing-Shenyang,
Beijing-Shanghai, and Chongqing-Beihai highways, respectively, in
the coming three years.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Play Tunisia Without Asprilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MONTPELLIER, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombian captain Carlos
Valderrama insisted that the absence of striker Faustino Asprilla
will not affect the team's performance.
</P>
<P>
Colombia will take on Tunisia here on Monday. Both teams lost
their first match in Group G.
</P>
<P>
Valderrama says the match is win or bust,"If we lose on Monday,
it's all over for us."
</P>
<P>
Colombia will probably play Anthony De Avila in Asprilla's place
in the match against Tunisia and Adolfo Valencia takes the other
striking role ahead of Victor Aristizabal.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisians think they had the chance of beating Colombia
after the team's recent distractions. Tunisian coach Henri
Kasperczak said:"The Colombians were a dangerous proposition, it
remanis to be see whether they still are."
</P>
<P>
Tunisian playmaker Skander Souayah said:"Colombia have some very
classy players, they can cause problems to any side. But we can
play very well together."
</P>
<P>
The match between the two teams is expected to be tense and
tough as both teams want to get three points to keep their
qualifying hopes alive.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Interviewed by Chinese Reporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said that his upcoming visit to China will help deepen the mutual
understanding and expand the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope in a roundtable discussion here on Friday
with a group of U.S.-based Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "I hope that through my trip both I and the
people of the United States will learn more about China -- about
the rich history, about the exciting events going on today, about
the incredible potential for the future of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that through his trip "the leaders and the people
of China will learn more about the United States".
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can expand the areas of cooperation between our
governments and our peoples," the president, who begins his China
tour next Thursday, told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
As home to one-fourth of the world's people and with a rapidly
growing economy, he said, China has enormous contributions to make
to the world of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said China and the United States should be partners for
stability and security in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China recently led the five-party talks on the
situation in South Asia and played a positive role in preventing a
nuclear race in that region.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his vision on the constructive partnership between
China and the United States in the 21st century, Clinton indicated
that the partnership also includes that on preventing arms
proliferation, on the fight against crimes, on energy and
environment, on science and technology, on economy and on
promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He added that developing and improving this cooperation will
not only benefit the people of the two countries but also help
stabilize the world.
</P>
<P>
Talking about U.S. critics of his China policy, Clinton said
that most Americans support his engagement policy because they
want a constructive partnership with the government and the people
of China.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say in this case, I think my critics are wrong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe most Americans understand that we have differences
now and 100 years from now we will have some differences, because
we are different people with different cultures and different
systems and different backgrounds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I think the important thing for the Congress is to
recognize that over the long run we must choose engagement with
China, not isolation from China, not estrangement from China."
</P>
<P>
"Once you make that decision," Clinton went on, "then the
question is how can you expand the areas of cooperation where we
can agree, how shall we manage our disagreements, and how can we
learn from one another so that we can build a more peaceful, more
prosperous, more open world."
</P>
<P>
"Even my harshest critics would have to admit that President
Jiang and I have had wonderful, stimulating and very honest
discussions about our differences."
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the idea that we should have less contact
with China, with the Chinese government and with the Chinese
people, is just wrong," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said he will continue to stick up to his China policy and do
his best to defeat any legislation in the Congress that would
undermine the ability of his government to pursue the interests of
the U.S. and the interests of the American people in developing a
partnership with China and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the U.S. policy toward Taiwan, Clinton said he will
reaffirm to the Chinese leaders during his visit the commitments
the U.S. side has made to the Chinese side. In particular, he
said, he will reaffirm that the United States will stick to its
"One China" policy and will abide by the principles embodied in
the three communiques signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the financial crisis in Asia, President Clinton said the
cooperation between the United States and China is more important
than ever before, as indicated in the economic situations and
challenges now facing Indonesia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The president also praised the 20-year cooperation on science
and technology between the United States and China as having a
"remarkable record" in biodiversity preservation, earthquake
forecast and child health care.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should further strengthen their
cooperation in these areas because the potential benefits to their
peoples and to other people around the world are enormous.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also noted that the leaders of the two countries have
talked about the prospect of having a long and cooperative project
on the rule of law and hoped that the cooperation will keep on.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of arms non-proliferation, Clinton said that China
and the United States "have a good way of working together" and
could keep on the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also praised China as having the oldest and richest
culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President said: "The United States many times in our
country's past has felt a special affinity to China. And we have
had many Americans who have lived in China, ...We have been allies
in war."
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a greater feeling for the Chinese people in
the hearts of Americans than perhaps many Chinese realize," he
said. "And I hope this trip will help us to continue to go forward
in a new and better way."
</P>
<P>
"The American people wish the Chinese people well. We want to
know more about the China of today and the China of yesterday, and
we want to be a big part of the China of tomorrow," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Hoodle Says England Underdogs to Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOULOUSE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoodle
insisted that his team would be underdogs to Romania when the two
teams clash at Toulouse on Monday.
</P>
<P>
England beat Tunisia 2-0 while Romania edged Colombia 1-0 thanks
to a superb goal from Adrian Llie in their respective first group match.
</P>
<P>
Llie said he had no doubts about his ability to score goals with
the help from Dan Petrescu, Gica Popescu and Viorel Moldovan who all
had the experiences in English Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"Dan in particular knows the English game and his information is
invaluable," Llie said.
</P>
<P>
Petrescu, who plays for Chelsea, said:"If we win I'm not sure what
sort of welcome I'll get when I return to Stamford Bridge next
season."
</P>
<P>
But the player that England fear most is the ageing Romanian
playmaker Georghe Hagi. "He is a dangerman and still the chief of
the Romanian team. If he fancies a free kick he'll be there taking
it and he is someone we've got to beware of." said England Under-21
coach Peter Taylor.
</P>
<P>
England manager Glenn Hoodle said the Romanian team have more
international experiences than his team as none of the England
player have ever played a World Cup match before France'98.
</P>
<P>
"We are underdogs to them but we have the chance to win out."
said Hoodle earlier in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reaffirms Commitment to Advancing Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has assured the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of its commitment to
advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Israel Radio
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed the
message in a letter to PNA President Yasser Arafat delivered by
U.S. Consul-General John Herbst of Jerusalem during their meeting
Saturday night in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Albright said that the U.S. will not give up its
efforts in achieving a resolution from Israel on the second
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Herbst reviewed the latest status in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and proposals by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has proposed to combine the second and the third
phases of the pullback from West Bank into one with a total scope
of 15 percent. Palestinians have rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted PNA sources as saying that the message came
amid increasing doubts among Palestinian leaders over
Washington's commitment to pressing Israel to accept a U.S.
initiative aimed at breaking the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal, which has been accepted by the PNA,
reportedly calls on Israel to hand over 13.1 percent more of the
West Bank to the Palestinians during its second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March last year when Israel started to construct
Jewish settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
And the talks were deeply stranded due to Israel's
intransigence over its troops redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria: 14 Feared Killed in Fresh Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 14 persons were
feared dead with 24 others wounded following a riot Saturday
sparked off allegedly by extortion by a soldier in Ibadan, the
largest city in western Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six policemen alleged to have shot the spare parts
traders have been arrested, press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eye witnesses were quoted as saying that the trouble started
when one of the team of soldiers and mobile policemen guarding
the Agodi prison went to a nearby spare parts selling point where
he picked quarrel with a trader over a commission of about 22
cents.
</P>
<P>
The solider, said to be ostensibly offended by the trader's
refusal, got into a fit of anger and fired the man in the hip,
leaving him in a pool of blood while firing sporadically into the
air to ward off a mob that had gathered.
</P>
<P>
While other traders arrived at the scene, intending to carry
the victim to hospital, other "trigger-happy" soldiers went into
shooting spree, gunning down more than eight persons on the spot,
the Sunday Punch reported.
</P>
<P>
Infuriated by this action, militant youths stormed the Agodi
police station and made a bonfire of old tyres preventing access
to the building.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 persons were picked up dead, while 24 others had
gunshot wounds, with 20 placed on danger list.
</P>
<P>
The police that has confirmed "disturbances" in that area and
is investigating the incident has appealed to the traders to be
calm, promising that all the policemen involved would be dealt
with accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Zambia No Sanctuary for Refugee Criminals: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Home Minister Peter
Machungwa has warned that his country will not tolerate the use
of refugee settlements for the perpetration of crimes or wars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during Africa Refugee Day celebrations here Saturday,
Machungwa said Zambia will never allow refugee settlements to
become safe havens for killers, criminals and perpetrators of
genocide, Zambia Daily Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that criminals pretending to be refugees neither
deserve nor qualify for international protection.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said the Zambian government pursues a
magnanimous open door asylum policy towards all deserving asylum
seekers who establish a valid claim to asylum regardless of race,
religion or political opinion.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zambia is hosting tens of thousands of refugees
from countries such as Somalia, Angola, Burundi, Rwanda,
Zimbabwe, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
He also deplored the manner in which refugees are moving from
one country to another within the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) region without convincing reasons, saying that
the move is bound to jeopardise security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa urged the SADC members to device a way in which
refugees must be screened before they are admitted in any country
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the international community to continue
assisting countries which host refugees by providing material
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Major Headway in China's Institutional Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Premier Zhu Rongji told
the second plenary session of the State Council on Friday that
major headway has been made in China's institutional restructuring
drive.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring program has been approved by the State
Council, China's highest governing body, and the government needs
to make its utmost effort to do a good work in job assignments and
in providing proper arrangements for redundant personnel, Zhu told
participants at the meeting which was called on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following the principle set forth by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin that the restructuring should be done in an active but
prudent manner, all of the government departments have worked out
programs to determine their functions, structure, and authorized
size, meaning important progress in the institutional structural
reform drive, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new program, more than 200 kinds of functions
that used to belong to various government departments will be
transferred to enterprises, organizations, and local governments,
while more than 100 other such functions will be divided among State
Council departments, 200 lower-level departments, a quarter of the
total, will be cut, and the State Council has been down-sized 47.5
percent.

<P>
Assignments and providing redundant personnel with proper
arrangements are difficult but important tasks facing the reform
drive, and are mainly aimed at making best use of the public
servants and improving them overall, he said.
</P>
<P>
The work should also be combined with the reform of personnel
system so as to increase administrative efficiency, and with the
increased rule of law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations should be made for some leading officials leaving
their posts with professional training, and redundant leading
officials should get suitable arrangements within three years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the work of converting corporations with
administrative functions into enterprise groups should be
completed by the end of year, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying that, although there are arduous tasks
in the reforms, the goal set forth earlier this year is attainable
as long as the government adheres to the principles and
requirements set by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Killing of Religious Leader in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lodged a strong protest to
Iraq against the assassination of a Shiite religious leader in
southern Iraq, Tehran radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned Iraqi Charge d'Affaires Saleh
Noori Samarmad in Tehran on Saturday night and expressed the
protest.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Director General for Persian Gulf affairs Ali
Aghsar Hojji was quoted as saying the Iraqi government has the
responsibility to ensure the security of life and properties of
Iranian citizens in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He urged Baghdad to take necessary measures to punish those
responsible for the killing of Ayatollah Sheikh Mirza Ali Gharavi
and his relatives in Najaf area.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Gharavi, one of his sons, son-in-law and driver were
shot by unidentified gunmen Thursday night on the way to Najaf
from Karbala after the pilgrimage at the holy shrine of the Shiite
third Imam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, another well-known Shiite religious leader
Ayatollah Boroujerdi was also gunned down in the Shiite holy city
of Najaf.
</P>
<P>
Hojji warned that the repetition of such incidents would damage
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Samarmad expressed regret over Thursday's killing, saying that
he would inform the Iraqi government of Iran's stance and give
relevant answer to Iran.
</P>
<P>
An Iran-based Iraqi Shiite opposition group Saturday accused
Baghdad of being behind the murder, alleging that Iraq's
intelligence service opened fire at Ayatollah Gharavi and his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Assembly of Islamic Revolution, Iraq's biggest
Shiite opposition group, claimed the Iraqi government agents
buried Ayatollah Gharavi in Najaf secretly right after the
incident with an aim to prevent any possible protesting
demonstration, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Condemns Assassination of Shiite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei strongly condemned the assassination of a Shiite
religious leader in southern Iraq, warning that Iran can not
remain indifferent toward such crimes, Tehran Radio reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Khamenei as saying that the assassination of
two prominent Shiite scholars, Ayatollah Gharavi and Ayatollah
Sheikh Morteza Boroujerdi, within two months indicated the
"malicious plots of enemies" against the Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei issued the statement after Gharavi, along with his
driver, one of his sons and his son-in-law, was killed by
unidentified gunmen Thursday night in Najaf, a Shiite Muslim holy
place in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Gharavi was the second Shiite leader murdered in Najaf in the
past two months following the April 22 killing of Ayatollah
Boroujerdi.
</P>
<P>
"The great Iranian nation and the whole world of Shiite
Muslims can not show indifference towards such crimes," Khamenei
said, describing Gharavi as one of the top Shiite religious
scholars.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader called on the Iraqi government to seriously
deal with the two assassinations and to carry out its
"international and human duties" in order to allay concerns of the
Iranian nation and Shiite Muslims worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Director General for Persian Gulf
Affairs Ali Aghsar Hojji Saturday night summoned Iraqi charge
d'affaires in Tehran Saleh Noori Samarmad to lodge a strong
protest against the killings.
</P>
<P>
Hojji stressed that the Iraqi government has the responsibility
to safeguard the security of life and properties of Iranian
citizens in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He called on Baghdad to take necessary measures to punish those
responsible for the assassinations, warning that a repetition of
such incidents would have negative impact on the relations between
the two former enemies.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war between 1980 and 1988 that
was triggered by territorial and religious dispute. Iraq is a
Sunni Muslim-dominated country, while Iran is largely a Shiite
Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy expressed regret over the incident and its
negative impact on the Iraqi-Iranian relations, saying he would
inform the Iraqi government of Iran's stance and would give a
relevant answer to Iran.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Pledges Support to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has said that his government is committed to fighting the
HIV/AIDS pandemic and that he will personally contribute to the
prevention and mitigation efforts of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said this in a speech read on his behalf by
Vice-President Christon Tembo on Friday night in Lusaka during
the launching of fund-raising campaign for Zambia's hosting of
the 11th International Conference on AIDS in Africa in September,
1999, according to Zambia Daily Mail published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has relentlessly fought to control the spread of AIDS
since 1986, said Chiluba, adding that his government will put in
its best in this regard.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the government's early responses to the
epidemic are predominantly bio-medical and health-focused in
approach.
</P>
<P>
"To a large extent, the social, cultural, political, economic
and other factors governing the spread of the epidemic were only
taken into account to a minimal extent in those early responses,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
This has compelled the government to pursue a multi-sectoral
approach to the pandemic, which includes the prevention and
control of HIV/AIDS in the civil service program under the
multi-sectoral approach program launched in 1994, added Chiluba.

<HEADLINE> Great Potential for Sino-US Health Care Cooperation: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States have
had "effective and satisfactory cooperation" in medical science,
technology and public health work since 1979 when the two sides
signed the first agreement in this regard right after the two
countries forged diplomatic relations, top Chinese health official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Zhang Wenkang, Chinese Minister of
Health, said: "The renewal of the agreement, which coincides with
President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to China, shows that the
governments of the two countries support and value the
cooperation between the two sides in this regard and this will
surely open greater prospects for such cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years and more, medical sectors of the two
countries have had cooperation in the fields ranging from
infectious and parasitic diseases, cancers to cardiovascular
diseases, public health, and medical services.
</P>
<P>
Through cooperation, the Chinese side has trained a large
number of highly competent medical workers along with the import
of capital, advanced technology, and management
expertise. Meanwhile, the US side has got valuable statistics and
analyses reports on related diseases, which are of important
reference value to them in formulating preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
With the advancement of Sino-US relations, medical sectors of
both countries should further familiarize themselves with each
other's development strategy, policies and targets in this field
so as to better cooperate in specific areas, Zhang said, adding
such mutual understanding is still not adequate so far.

<HEADLINE> Great Potential for Sino-US Health Care Cooperation: Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China and the U.S., respectively the world's largest developing
country and the world's largest developed country, possess immense
cooperative potentials in the medical and health care fields.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when the 21st century is approaching, we hope that
on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and share of successes,
both sides should push Sino-U.S. cooperation in this sector to a
new phase, which will be more compatible to the status of the two
countries," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Medical science can not be advanced without the development of
medical education and health care technology. Therefore, both
sides should put their cooperation focus on the high and new
technologies, medical education, basic medical research, applied
studies, bio-medical engineering, and health work management.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a coordinating mechanism be set up for
personnel exchange programs in the medical science and technology,
in addition to frequent exchanges of visits of medical experts and
academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the US side would grant Chinese medical
professionals access to its research funds and projects, and
relevant US institutions would timely provide them with necessary
reports for possible cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
"With the past experience in our cooperation, we are fully
convinced that the medical sectors of the two countries would
seize the Sino-U.S. summit as an opportunity to further their
cooperation and achieve more satisfactory successes," the Chinese
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Collect Airport Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)
will start collecting airport taxes from airlines from September,
in a bid to curb the mounting national budget deficit which
accounts 2.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The move follows an amendment to the Air Passenger Service
Charge Act in the Finance Bill, said a report from the Daily
Nation newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Finance Bill, passengers on external journeys will
be required to pay 20 U.S. Dollars or the equivalent in Kenyan
Shillings to the airlines. Passengers on internal flights will
pay 100 Shillings (1.67 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
KRA Chairman Hilary Ng'weno revealed the news at the Indian
Ocean port of Mombasa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he vowed to make efforts to improve the authority's
management and combat corruption.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Urged to Cut Visa Charges to Revamp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is urged to
abolish visa fees for 12 months or reduce charges to 10 U.S.
Dollars to revamp the collapsing tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa and Coast Tourist Association (MCTA) is also
asking the government to suspend duty on jet fuel to encourage
more tourists to use chartered flights as the country's roads are
"in a deplorable state," local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
MCTA Chairman Najib Balala, also the Mayor of Mombasa which is
Kenya's commercial hub bordering the Indian Ocean, called on the
government to give landing rights to international flights to
Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Balala suggested the upgrading of the Malindi Airport at the
coast so that it can receive chartered-flight tourists.
</P>
<P>
Mombasa hoteliers called on the government last week to stop
protecting Kenya Airways from competition by barring
international flights into Mombasa as the airline is a private
firm.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tourism industry went into free-fall in August last
year when killings and clashes erupted in Likoni area of Mombasa
and then spread to many parts of the coast region. Mombasa sees
more than 70 percent of tourists visiting Kenya every year.
</P>
<P>
"The government should set up a fund from which hotel and
restaurant owners can borrow during this difficult time," he
suggested, adding that the fund should be able to disburse soft
loans with an adequate repayment grace period.
</P>
<P>
He warned that many hotels are closing down with the excuse
that they are carrying out renovations, "but the underlying
factor is that they are experiencing low occupancy levels."

<HEADLINE> Loyalists Support Marcos' Burial at Heroes' Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of loyalists gathered
here Sunday to voice their support for the burial of former
President Ferdinand Marcos at the heroes' cemetery in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The supporters, converging Sunday afternoon on the back
entrance of the Philippine International Conference Center,
expressed their solid support for President-Elect Joseph Estrada's
plan to bury Marcos.
</P>
<P>
They displayed millions of signatures they have already
collected in support of Estrada's decision.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who would assume the presidency on June 30, stood firm
on his decision of interring Marcos' remains at the cemetery
despite protests from the opponents.
</P>
<P>
He said Marcos should be buried at the cemetery which is
usually for war heroes and deceased presidents for his role in
fighting the Japanese invaders during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
However, his plan drew protests from 28 groups including the
church, human rights victims and the business sector.
</P>
<P>
The opponents, led by former President Corazon Aquino, accused
Marcos of oppressing thousands of Filipinos and looting billions
of dollars' wealth from the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
The Marcos loyalists have finally decided to come out in the
open in face of the unrelenting attacks on the later president and
on the integrity of incoming President Estrada, the loyalists said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"Majority of Filipinos are in favor of this burial. We may not
have prominent personalities because we are mostly ordinary
Filipino citizens, but there are millions of us all over the
country. This debate might just provoke the rest of us to come out
publicly and express our sentiment," said Cherry Cobarrubias,
national chairman and spokesperson of the 4.5-million-strong
Marcos Loyalist Movement.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was ousted in a bloodless popular revolt in February
1986. He fled to Hawaii, the United States, where he died three
years later. His successor, Corazon Aquino, refused to allow the
return of his body to the country. In 1993, President Fidel Ramos
allowed the return, but refused to have him buried at the heroes'
cemetery with state honors.
</P>
<P>
Marcos' corpse is now inside a crystal sarcophagus in a crypt
at his hometown in the northern Philippines. He is expected to be
buried on July 11 this year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Striving to Resume Role of Far East Financial Center (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 21 (Xinhua) - Shanghai, known as "the Asia's Wall
Street" 60 years ago, is striving today to resume its role as a
financial, commercial and trade center in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
In internationalizing its finance sector, the Shanghai "Bund",
a tiny downtown area with no more than 1 square kilometers but used to
be home to 113 financial buildings, is again the focus of
attention of the world's financial industry.
</P>
<P>
Today, there are 51 overseas financial institutions, 163
representative offices of other such institutions, and their
combined assets reach 17.51 billion U.S. dollars, and they have
provided a total of 13.35 billion U.S. dollars of loans,
according to the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China,
the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
That's a sharp increase from eight years ago, when there were
only four overseas banks in the city.
</P>
<P>
The CitiBank of the United States moved its China headquarters
from Hongkong to Shanghai in November 1994, indicating its
intention to expand business in China. It was soon followed by
other major banks of the world, including the British Standard
Charter Bank, the Shanghai and Hongkong Banking Corp.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, a pilot program was launched in Shanghai
allowing foreign banks to do the Chinese currency yuan-based
business. Nine overseas banks have so far been approved to do
the Renminbi-based business.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials in Shanghai said that this program has been
going on "smoothly" so far. And despite some rigorous restrictions
imposed on the Renminbi-based business, it marks the beginning of
China's internationalization process of its financial market.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials also disclosed that the authorities are
considering the new applications by other overseas banks for doing
such business.

<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange, the largest stock market in China,
has become a mature institution dealing treasury bonds, stocks and
investment funds. Its clout in the Chinese economy is being
further reinforced.
</P>
<P>
The other side of the Bund across the Yangtze River is now a
new financial center of this city, the Lujiazui Financial and
Trade Development District. In 1.7-square-km area, 20 high-rise
office buildings have just been erected, and other 10 are expected
to be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
To build this city into a world economic, financial and trade
hub was the wish of the Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, and
a strategic policy-decision of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official from the People's Bank of China
Shanghai Branch said that Shanghai is going to follow
international norms in managing its financial institutions,
bringing in more overseas financial bodies. China is also planning
to set up a duty-free financial market in Shanghai, officials
disclosed.

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- An open rift between Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat and his chief representative in Jerusalem,
Faisal Husseini, stems from divergent views about the city's
future status and not only from a dispute over allegedly missing
funds, sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They said that Arafat is wishing to replace Husseini with
someone who will support the formula worked out by Arafat's deputy
Mahmoud Abbas and Member of Israeli Knesset (parliament) Yossi
Beilin which designates Jerusalem's outlying Abu Dis district as
the Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. is displeasured and deeply concerned about Israeli
statements last week about expanding Jerusalem's municipal
boundaries, including the annexation of parts of the West Bank,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Aides close to Labor Leader Ehud Barak said Barak is
considering to invite outgoing Chief of Staff Lt. -Gen. Amnon

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Privatizes Two More Train Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Railway (BR)
authority will hand over operational management of two more train
services to private companies, as part of its privatization plan,
press reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The operational management of the two services -- Karnaphuli
Express and Balaka Express running on the Dhaka-Chittagong and the
Dhaka-Mymensingh routes respectively -- would be turned over to
two private companies which are scheduled to conduct commercial
operations from the first week of next month.
</P>
<P>
The two private agencies have already got work orders from the
BR, a senior BR official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The BR would supply fuel for the trains and appoint drivers and
guards after the services are transferred to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The lease holders would sell tickets and perform management
work with its own staff.
</P>
<P>
By so doing, the BR could earn on average 800,000 taka (about
17,400 U.S. dollars) per month from each of the two services,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Due to mismanagement, the Bangladesh's state-owned railway
sector has been suffering heavy losses in recent years. The
government has decided to allow the private sector to participate
in the operational management work in order to make railway
services profitable.
</P>
<P>
The service management of another railway express running on
the Dhaka-Chittagong route was handed over to a private company
early this year.

<HEADLINE> Jones Sweeps Double Win in 100m and Long Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- World sprint queen Marion Jones
displayed a brilliant show Saturday night by sweeping the women's
100 meters and long jump titles at the U.S. Athletics
Championships in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old basketballer-turned-athlete, aiming to finish a
100m, 200m and long jump sweep, done only by Stella Walsh in 1948,
opened her race with a fabulous 10.72 second run in the 100
meters, and went on to take the long jump with a wind-aided 7.21
meters.
</P>
<P>
She wound up the day by finishing first in the 200m semifinal
with a time of 22.46. She needs to win the 200m final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"She is one of the greatest female athletes ever to walk on
this planet," Jones' coach Trevor Graham said. "She is very
competitive, eager to learn and to understand her sport more. She
is going to be great in all three events in the next couple of
years."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jones had promised to win as many as five gold medals
at the 2000 Olympic Games after she clocked the year's fastest
time 10.71 last month in China's Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited with the time, but I thought I would run a
little faster," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Jones only needed two jumps to seal the long jump title. She
got her winner in the opening round, and then fouled and passed
her final four leaps before racing to victory in the 200m heat.
</P>
<P>
The men's 100 meters final was marred by the withdrawl of
Maurice Greene, who said he suffered from stomach and leg cramps.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sad and disappointed. I had big plans for this
championship met. I misjudged the heat and my body's dehydrated
and keeps cramping up. I've depleted my body of all its
minerals. It wouldn't help the sport if I got out there and quit,"
said Greene, who hoped to beat the world record of 9.84 seconds
before the race.
</P>
<P>
1992 Olympic bronze medallist Dennis Mitchell also pulled out
the final due to a leg cramp. Tim Harden won the race with a
wind-aided 9.88, with Brian Lewis second at 9.98, and Tim
Montgomery third at 9.99.
</P>
<P>
The wind was 4.9 meters per second, well over the allowable 2.0
meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Mary Slaney pulled up with two laps remaining in the 5,000 with
a tendon injury to her lower right leg. The 39-year-old said:"I
head something pop. I can't put any weight on it."
</P>
<P>
Chris Huffins produced the best decathlon mark in the world
this year with a personal best 8,694 points. Bryan Bronson also
ran the fastest time in the world this year in the 400m hurdles
with a 47.81 in a semifinal heat.
</P>
<P>
Another world best this year came from the triple jump produced
by LaMark Carter, who bounced a 17.44 meters.

Students account for 24 percent of the 22,064 addicts who have
been treated at 284 rehabilitation centers since last October, the
ministry was quoted by Sunday's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The number of youths being treated for heroin addiction was
higher than that for amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
A report by the ministry said that between October 1996 and
September 1997, 18.5 percent of the 38,895 addicts receiving
treatment are youths of an average age of 19.
</P>
<P>
Among them, amphetamine addiction was recorded at 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
From October last year to May this year, however, heroin
addiction among youngsters treated at the centers accounted for
64.8 percent, followed by amphetamine addiction, 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though appreciating cooperation from schools in testing the
urine of pupils, the Health Ministry urged schools to put emphasis
on "strengthening the spirit" of the students to resist drug use.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will conduct a nationwide campaign on June 27 and
28, focusing on the involvement of communities and families in
preventing drug use in children.

<HEADLINE> Power Failure Plunges Bangladesh into Darkness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh was plunged into darkness
for several hours as the national power grid broke down Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The national grid failed at 7:10 p.m. local time due to a
technical fault at a power plant which forced automatic shutdown
in all the major power generating unites in the country, official
sources were quoted Sunday by press reports here as saying.
</P>
<P>
All the country, including the capital city of Dhaka and the
southeastern port city of Chittagong, was immediately enveloped by
darkness.
</P>
<P>
At about 9 p.m., power generation was restored at some power
plants and power supply was partially resumed in the capital city,
but most parts of the country remained without power until
midnight.
</P>
<P>
This was the second national grid failure within three months
plunging the entire country into darkness for hours. Each time the
authorities concerned formed an inquiry committee to ascertain the
cause of the failure but so far no report of the committee has
been made public.
</P>
<P>
Life was made miserable on a hot and humid night without power,
and thousands of soccer fans demonstrated in different places of
the country as the power failure made it impossible for them to
watch the World Cup football matches on television, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina directed all the officials
concerned to get the power supply resumed at the earliest possible
time and State Minister for Energy Rafiqul Islam and senior
officials of the Power Development Board rushed to the load
dispatch center to monitor the repair work, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Hasina took over the Energy Ministry earlier this year,
removing former Energy Minister Nooruddin Khan reportedly for his
failure to ensure normal power supply in the country.
</P>
<P>
The daily demand for power in Bangladesh is 2,200 megawatts
against a supply of 1,700 megawatts.

<HEADLINE> Thai Hospitals Asked to Reduce HIV Transmission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has asked
community hospitals to improve counseling services and treatment
for HIV-positive pregnant women in order to reduce perinatal
transmission from mothers to newborn babies.
</P>
<P>
Viput Poolcharoen, director of Thailand's Aids Division, said
the current counseling process provided in state hospitals needs
to be improved, according to Sunday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the most common problem observed is that
many counselors unwittingly informed husbands of pregnant women
that their wives are HIV-positive, without the women's will.
</P>
<P>
HIV is a virus which can cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, it has also been observed that pregnant women
are HIV-positive while their husbands are free from the infection,
Viput noted.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted in the past two years by the Health
Department showed that the rate of HIV infection among pregnant
women whose husbands' HIV status was not known was as high as 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the counselors informing the husbands of pregnant
women, Viput said, it would be best for them to ask the women to
convince their husbands to get themselves tested.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing appropriate counseling, it is also
important for hospitals to provide anti-infection drugs to reduce
possible infection of HIV among the newborns, Viput said.
</P>
<P>
Since there is continuous change in the regimen of drugs and
the dosage recommended for preventing mother-child HIV
transmission, hospitals should be flexible and keep themselves
updated on the latest information.
</P>
<P>
The current regimen recommended by the Thai-U.S. Anti-HIV
Infection Center is a short course which can reduce
mother-to-child HIV transmission by two-thirds while a long-course
regimen recommended by a U.S. aids clinical group reduces
transmission by one-third.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals in Thailand have been reportedly facing
difficulty in complying with both the short- and long-course
programs because of cash shortages to buy the expensive drug.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Evaluate, Reform Health Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will appoint a team of
experts to launch a year-long evaluation of its health systems and
propose recommendations for reform, the newspaper The Bangkok Post
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The project, part of the Asian Development Bank's structural
adjustment loan, is to begin this week. The evaluation results and
proposals will be presented by April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The four main areas to be evaluated by the technical
consultants are decentralization of health personnel, services
provided by state hospitals, hospital patients' referral system
and medical and health finance management.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a top Public Health Ministry official as
saying the experts should find a way to decentralize health
workers to areas with shortage problems.
</P>
<P>
The official also said hospital services should be made more
efficient with the emphasis on equality.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the discrepancy in social benefits for different
groups, which leads to unequal opportunity and different standards
of service quality in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Problems of overcrowding in big hospitals continued to exist
due to the current weak patients referral system, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that it is necessary for the experts to
consider social consequences of their recommendations in addition
to economic efficiency so as to ensure the proposed development
plan could be applied to the country's current social setting.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Cut Production By 70 Million Tons in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to cut coal
production by 70 million tons this year to reduce the glut and
achieve the coal market balance, today's "China Daily"
(Business Weekly) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quoted an official with the
State Coal Industry Bureau as saying that the bureau is determined
to cut illegal and irrational coal output by 150 million tons in
the coming two or three years, which is an indispensable choice to
turn back the money-losing trend that has arisen in the sector
since the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the key coal firms reported
deficits of 184.3 million US dollars, increasing losses of 209.6
million US dollars over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The losses resulted from a sustained flagging market caused by
an astonishing glut of coal.
</P>
<P>
China boasts the largest coal producer in the world. It
produced 1.33 billion tons of coal and consumed 1.29 billion tons
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's coal stockpiles are still over 130 million
tons, according to the China Coal News.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the serious glut to rampant production of
township and village coal mines.
</P>
<P>
China has 93 key state coal mines, 2,500 local state coal mines
and 75,000 township and village coal mines.
</P>
<P>
Last year, township and village coal mines produced 581 million
tons of coal, or 43.6 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has strived to implement the Coal Law to
regulate the development of township and village coal mines since
December 1996 when the law officially took effort.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, coal producers should apply for a mine
license and production license from the government.
</P>
<P>
The State Coal Industry Bureau has made up its mind to rectify
the small coal mines completely this year, laying out a sound
foundation for the healthy development of the sector, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Hospitals Asked to Reduce HIV Transmission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has asked
community hospitals to improve counseling services and treatment
for HIV-positive pregnant women in order to reduce perinatal
transmission from mothers to newborn babies.
</P>
<P>
Viput Poolcharoen, director of Thailand's Aids Division, said
the current counseling process provided in state hospitals needs
to be improved, according to Sunday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the most common problem observed is that
many counselors unwittingly informed husbands of pregnant women
that their wives are HIV-positive, without the women's will.
</P>
<P>
HIV is a virus which can cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, it has also been observed that pregnant women
are HIV-positive while their husbands are free from the infection,
Viput noted.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted in the past two years by the Health
Department showed that the rate of HIV infection among pregnant
women whose husbands' HIV status was not known was as high as 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the counselors informing the husbands of pregnant
women, Viput said, it would be best for them to ask the women to
convince their husbands to get themselves tested.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing appropriate counseling, it is also
important for hospitals to provide anti-infection drugs to reduce
possible infection of HIV among the newborns, Viput said.
</P>
<P>
Since there is continuous change in the regimen of drugs and
the dosage recommended for preventing mother-child HIV
transmission, hospitals should be flexible and keep themselves
updated on the latest information.
</P>
<P>
The current regimen recommended by the Thai-U.S. Anti-HIV
Infection Center is a short course which can reduce
mother-to-child HIV transmission by two-thirds while a long-course
regimen recommended by a U.S. aids clinical group reduces
transmission by one-third.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals in Thailand have been reportedly facing
difficulty in complying with both the short- and long-course
programs because of cash shortages to buy the expensive drug.

<HEADLINE> Pivotals Crash on BSE Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Pivotals crashed on the Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the week on sustained selling
by speculators and foreign institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index moved between 3,434.46 and 2,961.81
before closing at 3,143.1 with a sizable loss of 204.31 points as
against the previous weekend's close of 3,347.41. The national
index also dropped by 99.49 points to 1,371.3 from the previous
close of 1,470.79.
</P>
<P>
A lackluster budget and news that the United States has
detailed its economic sanctions against India following its five
underground nuclear tests last month all contributed to the
selling pressure. Pivotals tumbled further in curb deals late on
Friday evening following reports of Moody's downgrading India.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Immunizes 16 Million Children Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil launched a national
campaign of vaccination against polio Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 16 million children under the age of five were
immunized in the campaign launched by Brazilian Health Minister
Jose Serra in Sao Paulo, the largest city of the country.
</P>
<P>
People can see many posters with the picture of famous
Brazilian forward Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima, who gestured the
children to go to the vaccination posts, and the slogan of "Brazil
Against Polio. We Are Going To Win the Game."
</P>
<P>
Serra said the campaign is fundamental to maintain the
eradication of polio from the country, which was certified in 1994
by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian National Health Foundation distributed Saturday
30.9 million vaccine doses in some 131,000 vaccination posts
nationwide with about half a million people offering the service
and a budget of 24 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Serra said this is the first stage of the National Campaign of
Multivaccination, and that the second will be held on August 15
against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, rubella, measles and
hepatitis.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Official: Political Uncertainties Keep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian government official
has warned that it will be difficult to attract foreign investors
to the country if political uncertainties still prevail.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the political problems have not yet been
definitively settled, Indonesia will be seen as a high risk
country (to invest)," Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said
here Saturday at a discussion on industrial reform.
</P>
<P>
The political uncertainties are also causing hesitation to
return to Indonesia among those Indonesians who have left the
country following the May 13-15 riots in Jakarta, capital of
Indonesia, the official Antara News Agency Sunday quoted Akbar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic capabilities are now at their lowest and
the country badly needs foreign and domestic investors to come out
of its economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hit by economic crisis since July last year.
The value of the rupiah, the national currency, has lost more than
80 percent against the U.S. dollar and the crisis caused political
uncertainties which forced former President Soeharto to step down
on May 21.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing the government is now trying to
accomplish is to ensure the availability of daily necessities to
the public at prices they can afford as a precondition to the
maintenance of political stability and law and order, Akbar noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an economic observer said the government will find
it difficult to stabilize the rupiah without confidence from home
and abroad in the country's political condition.
</P>
<P>
The plummeting of the exchange rate of the rupiah (15,000 per
dollar at present) is mainly caused by political uncertainty in
the country which has reduced confidence in the government, Marie
Pangestu of the Center for Strategic and International Studies
said.
</P>
<P>
The regional factor marked by the weakening of the Japanese yen
and the increasing demand for the U.S. dollar in the domestic
market for debt repayment also contributed to the rupiah's drop,
she added.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we have to follow the flow of the market because the
rupiah will further weaken if the political uncertainty continues.
This is proven by the fact that the present government has not
been able to restore market confidence," she said.
</P>
<P>
She predicted that with an economic growth of minus 15 percent
this year, Indonesia would need seven to 10 years to restore the
economy to its level before the crisis.

QUITO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The first stage of the project Wharf
2000 in the Ecuadoran city of Guayaquil was started here Saturday.

Under the construction plan, several commercial centers,
restaurants, a park, an ecological center and other recreation
facilities will be built in the area.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 17 million dollars will be spent on the first
phase construction.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Establishment of Financial Institution to Enhance Postal Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China is promoting the
establishment of a financial institution to handle the country's
extensive postal savings business, according to today's "China
Daily" (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
"We want to set up the country's first nationwide financial
institution specialized in retail financial services," the English
newspaper quoted Tao Liming, director of the Postal Savings and
Remittance Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
The financial institution would be a subordinate of the State
Bureau of Posts, but its financial operations would be supervised
by the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The move will put the postal savings business under the
standardized operation and management of the financial sector,
hence settling a paradox as the country's laws do not allow
non-financial institutions to provide financial services.
</P>
<P>
It will also expand the business scope for postal savings to
include individual settlement, credit cards and financial
consultation.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has 79,000 postal offices, of which only
32,000 do the savings business.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Police Urged to Implement Three Main Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt has urged the country's police force to successfully
implement three main tasks -- community peace and tranquillity,
prevalence of law and order and narcotic drugs control.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Committee for Reform of Myanmar Police
Force (MPF) Management System here Saturday, Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), said
reform of the management system of the Myanmar Police Force in
form and essence must be accelerated, the official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He asked all police personnel to be prepared for the prevention
of crimes in the new developed society and reorganize and train
the police units to be able to suppress subversives and hooligans.
</P>
<P>
He told them to be determined to safeguard the public, try to
be reliable and unbiased, avoid red tape and uphold their code of
conduct.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Senior-General Than Shwe, chairman of the SPDC, as
saying the MPF is a trained armed organization in addition to the
country's regular armed forces to be able to safeguard the nation
in emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
The committee for the reform was formed in January 1994 and
rules, procedures and laws were adopted for scrutinizing the
existing management, surveillance and prosecution and training
systems, deterring abuse of power, removing corrupt practices and
carrying out reforms keeping abreast of the times.

<HEADLINE> China Planning Extensive "Seabed Forests" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has a coastline of more than 18,000 kilometers and more
than 14,000 kilometers of island coasts, but marine development,
offshore petroleum exploration, and rapid industrial development
along the coasts have caused serious environmental pollution and
damage to the marine ecology.
</P>
<P>
The amount of losses from various marine disasters including
the red tide has reached some 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion
US dollars), as against 1 billion yuan each year in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
So, seabed forests are an effective way to help sustainable
development, Zeng said, and the country's oceanography authorities
has a positive attitude toward this giant scheme.
</P>
<P>
Song Xiuwu, an oceanographer who presided over the seaweed
planting project in Changdao, joined Zeng in suggesting that
algae, shellfish, and rare marine products be developed in the
offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
The two also emphasized the study of proliferation and
protection of various algae on the seabed and different
"afforestation" projects, and Zeng even hoped to establish a
"seaweed growing festival" to get more attention.

</P>
<P>
Teutenberg led through the streets of the state capitol to win
the stage in one hour, 21 minutes and 26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But no one gained time on pace-setter Jackson, who was 23rd

Jackson's overall time of 9:35:22 remained 50 seconds better
than Russia's Valentina Polkhanova.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Visit Called "Very Important" for Bilateral Trade Ties -1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming visit to China is "very important" for the development of
U.S.-China economic and trade relations, said Alan Turley,
minister counselor of commercial affairs at the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Turley, who noted that this is the first visit to China by a
U.S. president in almost 10 years, said the trip will help solve
many problems and reduce misunderstandings between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Noting that U.S.-China relations are multi-faceted and include
many issues, Turley said that both sides can continue to work
together in agreed-upon areas, and conduct "friendly and frank"
discussions on those issues on which they cannot reach agreement
such as human rights, MFN (most-favored-nation) status for China
and defense.
</P>
<P>
He said people should understand that bilateral relations are
complicated and will never be perfect, and that there will
continue to be disagreements, which will not affect the
fundamental interests of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the past two decades bilateral economic and
trade relations have grown rapidly and U.S. statistics show that
bilateral trade volume last year reached 60 billion U.S. dollars
and many U.S. companies, including many transnationals, have
invested in China.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the bilateral trade imbalance, Turley said that the
United States hopes to redress the imbalance through expanding
exports to China while avoiding cutbacks in imports from China,
adding that the U.S. stance is that such a cut-off would be
harmful to both countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese statistics show that bilateral trade volume last year
was 49 billion U.S. dollars with the United States becoming
China's second largest trade partner and China the fourth largest
for the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese side repeatedly stressed that it will strive to
expand bilateral trade, especially increasing its imports from the
United States while hoping that the United States can make efforts
in return to lift its export restrictions and offer credit support
for its companies.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether bilateral hi-tech cooperation would help
redress the imbalance, Turley said it certainly would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
During the short period of two years since he came to China,
Turley has contacted many U.S. business people who are interested
in investing in almost every aspect of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the United States views China as a huge potential
market, Turley said he believes that there is great potential for
U.S. businesses to invest in China's transportation
infrastructure, construction, and transportation equipment such as
airplanes and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
On the MFN issue, Turley said that the U.S. government's
position properly separates human rights from the annual renewal
of China's MFN trading status.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has always supported and will continue to
support MFN trading status for China, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
On the protection of intellectual property rights, he said that
the attitude change of the two sides shows interesting progress,
adding that the United States is aware of the strong effort made by
the Chinese government to clean up those plants involved in piracy.
</P>
<P>
He also said the United States is willing to show and has shown
great flexibility during negotiations on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization, and it will continue to show flexibility
in some aspects.

<HEADLINE> China Planning Extensive "Seabed Forests" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Chengkui, a prominent Chinese
oceanographer with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has proposed
that China build "seabed forests" similar to planting trees on
land to save the deteriorating marine environment.
</P>
<P>
This seaweed could absorb carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and
phosphorus compounds that come from marine animals and give off
oxygen that they need, Zeng explained.
</P>
<P>
The seabed forest could also purify and improve the
environment, he said, using the island county of Changdao in
Shandong Province, east China, as an example, where a
10-nautical-mile by 10-meter corridor of seaweed and kelp is
growing offshore. This seaweed forest is a promising residence for
various marine organisms.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, a hectare of sea produces ten times
the profit of a hectare on land. Changdao has a 47,000 ha. "blue
pasture" that is home to abalone, scallops and kelp.
</P>
<P>
Changdao's experience has shown that a seabed forest can cut
the effect of waves and offer abundant food and shelter for marine
animals.

<HEADLINE> Greene Withdraws from U.S. 100m Final </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greene, chasing the
100-meter world record, quited the 100m finals at the United
States Athletics Championships in New Orleans of Louisianah with
cramps.
</P>
<P>
Tim Harden won in a wind-aided 9.89 seconds after Greene
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
One of Greene's earlier efforts was a wind-aided 9.84-second
run that would have matched the world record set by Canada's
Donovan Bailey at the 1996 Olympics had it not been for the
excessive tailwind.
</P>
<P>
Greene said he had stomach cramps and diarrhea. "Everything I
put into my body went back out," Greene said.
</P>
<P>
Greene had a wind-aided 9.79-second run last month at Eugene,
Oregon. His training partner and main rival, Trinidad's Ato
Boldon, ran two 9.86s in Athens this week and Greene had hoped to
crack the mark here.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who made his decision one hour before the race, said he
will be fit and ready for next month's Goodwill Games in New York,
where he will face Boldon and Bailey to decide who is the world's
best sprinter.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Following are the facts and figures
of Saturday's matches at the World Cup finals:
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 goals were scored in the three games on Saturday,
the most goals on a single day at the current finals. Only one
goal was netted the day before on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Netherlands' 5-0 route over South Korea recorded the biggest
win of the finals so far. Five different Dutch players getting
their names on the scoresheet. It was their biggest ever win at
the finals and the first time the Dutch had scored five since
beating Austria 5-1 in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bergkamp, who scored the third Dutch goal, has netted in
each of the last four matches he has started in the finals. He
scored in the Netherlands' last three matches in 1994 against
Morocco, Ireland and Brazil at the U.S. finals. He failed to score
against Belgium in his team's opening match in France but came on
as substitute in that game.
</P>
<P>
It was South Korea's heaviest defeat since 1954 when they lost
9-0 to Hungary and 7-0 to Turkey on their World Cup debut.
</P>
<P>
Asian teams have fared disastrously in France. The record now
reads played seven, lost seven, goals for 1, goals against 16. The
only two teams definitely eliminated so far are Asian -- South
Korea and Saudi Arabia. Japan, beaten 1-0 by Croatia, have also
lost twice without scoring and look sure to go out.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, the first team at the finals to fight back from a
two-goal deficit, drew 2-2 with Belgium and have lost only once in
eight matches against European opponents at the finals in the last
20 years. The only team to beat them was Norway in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Despite throwing away their advantage, Belgium did at least
manage a first draw with Mexico following defeats to the Mexican
hosts in the 1970 (0-1) and 1986 finals (1-2).
</P>
<P>
World Cup newcomers Croatia completed a second consecutive win
over fellow-debutants. Their victory over Japan followed a 3-1
triumph over Jamaica.

<P>
MARSEILLE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands trounced South
Korea 5-0, the largeset margin so far in the France'98 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The defeat made South Korea the third Asian team to be
eliminated in the tournament following Saudi Arabia and Japan's exit.
</P>
<P>
The only remaining Asian squad in the tournamnent Iran will play
their second group match against the United States. If they lose the
game, they will also be out of the contention.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands started their star striker Denis Bergkamp and he
posed great threat to the South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
Phillip Cocu opened the scoring at the 37th minute and Marc
Overmars added one before the interval.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the South Koreans tried in vain to get a
goal but the Dutch team are too strong for them. Bergkamp scored
his first goal at the tournament with a splendid performance at the
70th minute while Pierre Van Hooijdonk and Ronald de Boer scored one
each to complete the one-sided match for the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
After the match, the Netherlands lead the group with four
points. Mexico also collected four points but have to settle for
the second place as the Dutch team have a better goal difference.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands will play Mexico to decide the top team of the
group while Belgium, which have two points from two draws, still
have the qualifying chance as they will take on pointless South
Korea.
