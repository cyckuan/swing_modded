BUSH ANNOUNCES ALTERNATE PLAN FOR DEBATES
</HEADLINE>
 (Subs for rewriting thruout, no factual changes) 
By ALISON MITCHELL  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Trying to end questions about his willingness to
debate and turn the tables on his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush
Sunday announced a schedule of three hand-picked debates that he
would do, only one of which is guaranteed to be broadcast on the
three major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointedly challenged Vice President Al Gore to meet him on
these chosen dates and terms, with the first debate on Sept. 12.
And he tried to turn Gore's response into a referendum on the vice
president's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has said he will debate anytime, anywhere, and he
has already accepted the debates that I am accepting today,'' Bush
said. ``It's important for the American people to be able to trust
the next president to keep his commitments, and therefore I take Al
Gore at his word that he will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal was a rebuff to the Commission on Presidential
Debates, which was created by both parties and has supervised the
presidential debates since 1988. That agency had proposed three
debates, all to be broadcast on the major networks, a plan Gore has
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who made his announcement at a hastily called news
conference on the lawn of the governor's mansion Sunday afternoon,
said he would debate Gore on a prime-time edition of NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' on Sept. 12, on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN on Oct. 3,
and in St. Louis on Oct. 17. The last debate, at Washington
University, was the only presidential commission debate accepted by
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The talk-show debates would last 60 minutes each, compared with
90 minutes for the commission debates.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Bush played video clips of Gore in
appearances with Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press'' in July and on
``Larry King Live'' in March in which he said he would be happy to
appear in debates on their shows. As the videos played, Bush stood
at a lectern tapping his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who learned of Bush's offer at a campaign appearance in
Philadelphia, instantly rejected it. His aides said that the
commission debates were the only ones likely to be carried by all
the major television networks and seen by the broadest television
audience possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore aide said that Gore would agree to the CNN and NBC
sessions _ but only if he also agreed to the three commission
debates. ``We've already accepted these,'' Chris Lehane, Gore's
spokesman, said of Bush's CNN and NBC debates. ``We have no problem
with these. We just want to make sure we do the three presidential
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   While the day's posturing was ostensibly over debates, it was
also an attempt by both campaigns to make a statement about the
opponent's character.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides have been suggesting that Bush is afraid of a
prime-time confrontation, raising the question of whether he is up
to the presidency. Bush was trying to plant the idea Sunday that
Gore is not a man of his word.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides also said that Bush was deliberately trying to shrink
the audience because unless there was blanket coverage on all five
networks, viewers would likely stray to other programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless these debates are road-blocked, you don't get the kind
of viewership you do with the commission debates,'' said one aide,
noting that Bush's proposal for the NBC debate would bump up
against popular shows like ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how much exposure the noncommission debates
proposed by Bush would get. Donald Evans, Bush's campaign chairman,
said that NBC and CNN had offered to make their videotape available
to other networks.
</P>
<P>
   An official of one of the rival networks said it was ``highly
unlikely'' that any network would broadcast a full debate that
carries with it the branding and identity of a competing news
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Gore campaign's reaction to Bush's debate
proposal, Karen Hughes, his director of communications, said,
``We'll be there and we'll see if Al Gore will keep his word.'' She
added, ``After eight years of prevaricating, after eight years of
`no controlling legal authority' and of debate over what the
meaning of `is' is, the American people deserve a president who
will keep his word.'' Hughes said she saw no reason why the
networks would not agree to broadcast all three debates as a public
service.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was just beginning a 24-hour Labor Day marathon tour
in Philadelphia, told reporters at Pat's Steaks, where he was
getting a cheese steak sandwich, ``I'm very disappointed in this
reaction because what's needed is to respect the rights of the
American people, to see the debates on all the networks in prime
time.'' He added: ``That's the way it's been done since 1988.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the commission debates, Gore said: ``It is a bipartisan,
nonpartisan tradition, and it's not about Governor Bush, it's not
about me, it's about the American people and giving the American
people the chance they deserve to make an informed judgment as to
who they want to be the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides replied that President Clinton himself had rejected
some of the commission's proposals in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The New York Times reported that Bush aides were
resisting the commission, because they did not want to commit to
three sessions that would be broadcast in prime time on the three
major networks. But the next morning, Bush told reporters that he
was not afraid of prime time. ``I want as many people to watch our
debates as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the one commission debate that Bush accepted, it
was not clear what the format would be. Evans said that still had
to be negotiated and that all the campaign had accepted was the St.
Louis venue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Sunday also said his campaign would agree to two
vice-presidential debates, one in Winston-Salem, N.C., sponsored by
the debate commission and another one in a forum yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is generally considered by political strategists to be a
weaker debater than Gore and his aides had been angling for
different formats. On Friday commission officials told aides to
Bush that they would not revise the locations of schedules for the
forums because the work was too far advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had selected the three formats because they would
be varied and because he wanted one debate on the West Coast.
``This will give the American people an opportunity to see the
candidates in a wide range of locations and formats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over debates has simmered, Bush has appeared on
the defensive, looking like he was seeking a better format for
himself. He and his aides were clearly trying to turn the tables
and use the struggle over debates to go after Gore's character and
make him look untrustworthy. After Bush's news conference, Hughes
reminded reporters that Gore had said he would debate anytime and
anywhere. ``We take him at his word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And on CNN, before Bush's news conference, Ari Fleischer, a Bush
spokesman, also noted that the vice president had been accepting
numerous debate offers. Fleischer said, ``I predict to you, they're
going to change their position all of a sudden again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued his challenge hours before flying to Chicago, where
he planned to begin the Labor Day kickoff of the general election
campaign. Polls show the race to be a dead heat or else give Gore a
slight lead. The debates are considered an important forum that
could well help undecided voters make up their mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his senior advisers had been saying for weeks that they
wanted to explore options beyond those proposed by the bipartisan
debate commission, because they felt that there could be other
debates of equal or greater value to voters.
</P>
<P>
   But one adviser conceded tonight that in selecting debates that
would be moderated by the journalist Tim Russert in one case and
the talk-show host Larry King in another, Bush was guaranteeing
that he would take questions from people who had quizzed him
before, and with whom he felt familiar
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist in Washington said that by spurning
two of the three commission debates, which would be more
structured, Bush was showing ``that he's concerned about filling
the full two-minute answer'' in a debate with formal time
parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry will bail him out,'' said the strategist, referring to
King. ``Larry will keep it moving.''
</P>
<P>
   But several of Bush's advisers said that while journalists were
sure to deride Bush's decision, most voters would care only about
the fact that Bush was debating and would find all the noise
surrounding the negotiations to be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not stupid. We've been looking at this,'' said one
adviser. ``Nobody knows who the commission is.'' &QL;

LABOR LEADERS LOOK AHEAD TO EXPANDED INFLUENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the nation celebrates Labor Day, local union
leaders have been savoring their successes of the past year and
looking toward the November and April elections as the true test of
their future clout.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several significant labor issues coming up in
Los Angeles __ in particular, a potential Metropolitan
Transportation Authority strike Tuesday _ could trigger public
backlash against union workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot at stake over the next 60 days,'' said Miguel
Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County
Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, an umbrella group for unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, I think we have to be careful to get our message out, to
let people know that these are working people and there won't be a
backlash. Look at the support the janitors received from across the
city because they were able to get their story out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the MTA, there is the possibility of work actions
by members of the United Teachers Los Angeles against the Los
Angeles Unified School District and by county workers. And
television commercial actors have been engaged in a bitter strike
that's already been going on several months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, labor leaders look ahead to the November elections,
throwing their support behind Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to deliver California for Al Gore, but I think
everyone realizes that if Democrats are to take back the House, it
comes through California and Los Angeles,'' Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three key races here, and if (House Democratic
Minority Leader) Dick Gephardt wants to be speaker, it will come in
Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreras believes organized labor will make the difference in
the congressional races of state Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena,
against incumbent Rep. James Rogan, R-Pasadena; Democratic former
congresswoman Jane Harman against Rep. Steve Kuykendall,
R-Torrance, who has held the seat since 1998; and Democrat Gerrie
Schipske against Rep. Steve Horn, R-Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, political director of the state Democratic
Party, said labor is considered a key to the party's success this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty percent of our delegates to the convention this year
was labor,'' Mulholland said. ``In my 25 years of Democratic
politics, I've never seen the unions as strong as they are. They
are the key to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, the unions expect to be active in the Los Angeles city
election when voters make their selections for a new mayor, city
attorney, city controller and six open City Council seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a historic opportunity for us,'' Contreras said.
``Never again will we have a chance like this to influence the
future of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp.
of Los Angeles, said the unions have been on a roll but also are
somewhat at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, labor is hoping for a Gore win but would be happy
if Democrats can take back the House,'' Kyser said. ``But the more
important election is next April in L.A. City Hall, where their
members can see a more direct benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot at play here, and they want to be directly
involved. And they have proven their ability to mobilize Latino
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kyser questions, however, is if the unions are looking to
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an upwardly mobile society, and what happens in five
or 10 years to the children of today's union members?'' Kyser said.
``The question is, Will they join unions?''
</P>
<P>
   If last year was the year of growth for unions _ they added
85,000 members to swell the rank-and-file to 800,000 members in Los
Angeles County _ this year has been one of consolidation and
negotiations, with some of the biggest talks going on now.
</P>
<P>
   The potential MTA walkout by the nearly 7,000 union members at
the county transit agency will be the first big confrontation if
talks fail to produce an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have pledged to give some notice before
authorizing a strike, but MTA officials took to television last
week to prepare the public for a possible work action, advising
people to seek alternative ways of getting to work.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high, with more than 1.5 million passengers a day
relying on the MTA for bus and rail service.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 25, the 43,000 members of United Teachers Los Angeles
are scheduled to take a strike authorization vote against the LAUSD
if their talks _ which have been continuing _ break down.
</P>
<P>
   Also late this month, about 45,000 Los Angeles County government
employees who are members of the Service Employees International
Union have a vote scheduled on a possible work action.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, the unions have been working with members of the
Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Radio and Television
Artists on their strike against the advertising agencies for
increased pay on commercials.
</P>
<P>
   SAG spokesman Greg Krizman acknowledged it has been difficult to
get much public sympathy for an industry many see as glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most people don't realize that 80 percent of SAG members
are making less than $5,000 a year,'' Krizman said, adding that the
impact of the long strike is felt far beyond SAG's 135,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the related trades and industry that are involved. We've
heard estimates that it is a loss of $1 million to $2 million a
day. It's affecting a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Krizman said there are plans to hold a new round of talks in the
middle of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The SAG-AFTRA work action worries Kyser the most because of its
implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most critical strings of negotiations are going on in
Hollywood,'' Kyser said. ``You have SAG-AFTRA now with the
advertisers. Next year they could be striking against the studios.
And in 2002, the Directors Guild might go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is worrisome is that this is now an international
industry and producers can go anywhere. We are getting to the point
that they don't have to work in Hollywood and that affects a lot
more than the actors. An actor can get on a plane. The same isn't
true for all the crafts and others who depend on the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreras also sees the SAG-AFTRA strike as a forerunner to
talks next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this resolves itself will show what will happen next
year,'' Contreras said, dismissing the possibility more production
will leave the area. ``We've already had some runaway production,
but most of it will remain here.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions are indeed looking to the future, Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strengthened ourselves internally this year,''
Contreras said. ``Next year, we will be involved politically and I
think we can be a major force. And we are going to continue to be a
model for central labor councils and go back out and do more
organizing.''

FOR LABOR DAY, CAMPAIGN MARATHON BY GORE AND LIBERMAN TARGET UNION
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS dateline; ADDS location of hotel in 3rd graf; SUBS 5th graf
with updated locale)

<P>
   Flint, Mich _ Like college students pulling an all-nighter
together, Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman Sunday
kicked off a round-the-clock Labor Day campaign swing, designed to
make the case for them as the ticket for the working class.
</P>
<P>
   On the holiday weekend traditionally seen as the start of the
stretch run to the November election, Gore continued the populist
themes on which he has based his general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key difference in this election is we're for the people,
they're for the powerful,'' he told 100 cheering construction
workers inside the unfinished Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman set a packed schedule for themselves from
Sunday afternoon through Monday night, a gimmick the campaign
dubbed ``Al and Joe's Hard Day's Night Tour,'' meant to cram in as
many appearances in as many swing-state media markets as possible,
in a little more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   They flew here together from Phil- adelphia for a rally at the
airport and  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  a late-night meeting with
hospital workers at Hurley Medical Center. From here they were to
fly to Tam- pa, Fla., where they planned a pre- dawn visit to an
all-night diner, fol- lowed by breakfast with firefighters and a
rally at a firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman planned to fly from Tampa to Detroit on Monday morning
for an AFL-CIO event, watch a game of the minor league Mud Hens
team in Toledo, Ohio, then wrap up the marathon in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to think that vice presidential candidates
should have collective bargaining rights,'' Lieberman said of the
pace. ``You know, this guy's working me.''
</P>
<P>
   After stopping at Pat's, a well-known Philadelphia cheesesteak
restaurant, Gore and Lieberman made their way to the dusty
construction site, which leaked water in a driving rain. They
addressed a carefully screened group of construction workers _ some
who work on the project, and other who do not _ and tried out the
campaign's theme for the week, stewardship of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a job done right, have it done by union workers,''
Gore said. ``If you want a job done right on our economic policy,
take a look at the blueprint. There are two competing blueprints.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan, he said, would mean a balanced budget,
securing Social Security and Medicare, investing in education, and
targeted tax cuts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not accept the blueprint from the other side that
proposes to give away all the surplus in a giant tax cut to the
wealthy at the expense of the middle class, that stops our
prosperity and progress,'' he said. ``We tried the other side's
approach before, and you saw what happened eight years ago, with
the high unemployment and the big deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the workers at the event acknowledged they knew little
about politics or economic policy, beyond the remarkable growth
they have seen under President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Gore, but it's also the administration that got us to
where construction is these days, where it's booming,'' said Lee
Worthington, 50, an electrician.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Stafford, 21, also an electrician, said, ``Clinton did a
real good job with the economy, and Gore was his VP, so he's the
next-best thing to Clinton if we can't have Clinton. Also, Gore's
pro-union and Bush isn't.''

FOSTER WORKS HARD, BUT WAS IT TOO HARD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ DeShaun Foster seemed to run through tackles
on virtually every play Saturday afternoon, but Alabama defenders
weren't the only ones climbing on for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Foster carried an entire team in the Bruins' stunning 35-24
victory over the third-ranked Crimson Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Foster rushed 42 times for 187 yards and had three touchdowns.
He also caught three passes for 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a soldier out there,'' said linebacker Ryan Nece.
``He put the whole team on his back and said, `Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, even before starting quarterback Cory Paus separated
his shoulder on the first play of the game, was to put the ball in
Foster's hands and let the offensive line do its part to establish
the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (offensive coordinator Al Borges) that if we don't run
(Foster) 30 times, I'm not going to be a very happy man,'' said
head coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, ranked 16th in the Associated Press poll and 17th in
the USA Today/ESPN poll, obviously have a good thing in Foster and
are intent on enjoying him, but they could develop a habit. The
question they may have to answer is when does use become abuse?
</P>
<P>
   Foster carried the ball on 55 percent of UCLA's plays (45 of 84)
and never ran out of bounds. Even though he says he's in the best
shape of his career, that's an extraordinary workload for someone
who's still lighter 208 pounds than most of the players trying to
hit him, has a history of injuries and has not been so depended
upon since high school.
</P>
<P>
   It's even been suggested the Bruins have a back like USC did in
its glory days with Charles White, Ricky Bell and Marcus Allen _
each of whom got the ball 40 times. But, unlike Foster, the USC
running backs were breaking their tackles in the secondary, not at
the line.
</P>
<P>
   And while Foster no longer is the stand-up runner he was in high
school, he has been hampered by ankle and knee injuries the past
two seasons. Moreover, his previous career single-game high in
carries was 24; in two previous seasons, Foster never had
back-to-back games when he's carried the ball as many as 42 times.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to give more work to Jermaine Lewis, who carried
five times for 14 yards against Alabama. In the past, he has proven
to be a dependable back.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could turn to Akil Harris, who looked good in the spring
but in fall camp has had the look of another Keith Brown _ solid,
but without the speed, strength or agility to make yards on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bruins have not had such a lopsided run-to-pass
ratio (57 to 24) since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   So, the player who could do the most to ease the reliance on
Foster is Ryan McCann, who with Paus' injury will likely be the
starter through the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   What he showed at the Rose Bowl on Saturday was what he's showed
in fall camp: He is unflappable and a hard worker, but there is
little consistency and he isn't as proficient as Paus at picking up
secondary receivers.
</P>
<P>
   He may throw a good pass _ like a well-placed out pattern to Jon
Dubravac on Saturday _ only to follow it up on the next play with a
poorly read slant that Alabama free safety Reggie Myles intercepted
and returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got spoiled with Cade (McNown),'' said Borges in explaining
why the Bruins must emphasize the run this season. ``It's time for
other people to pull the rope.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: UCLA received an oral commitment Sunday from Matt Mosebar,
a 6-foot-8, 260-pound offensive lineman from Santa Ynez (Calif.)
High. Mosebar is the nephew of former USC and Raiders center Don
Mosebar. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Maybe the Angels have become numb to these kinds of
losses. But they insisted after their 13-12 loss to the Chicago
White Sox Sunday at Comiskey Park they're not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   They say they'll just wipe off the blood and answer the bell
today when they continue their fight for a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it might be difficult to imagine the Angels not feeling a
bit groggy after getting swept in the three-game series. The
pitchers got pummeled, allowing 35 runs in the series and 46 runs
during what is now a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels tool a 4-0 lead in the top of the first Sunday,
starter Ramon Ortiz gave up nine runs in the bottom half and never
made it out of the inning. Still, the Angels rallied from a 9-4
deficit to take an 11-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels led 12-10 going into the bottom of the seventh, but
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-5) gave up three runs in the next two
innings, including Herbert Perry's game-winning, two-run triple in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The poor pitching overshadowed the performance of the Angels
offense, which had five home runs. Darin Erstad hit two, and Tim
Salmon, Scott Spiezio and Troy Glaus each hit one. For Glaus, it
was his 40th homer of the year, breaking the Angels' season-single
record he had shared with Reggie Jackson (39 in 1982).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are in sixth place in the wild-card race, 5 1/2 back.
They trail first-place Seattle by six games. But they say they're
not out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never give up,'' Glaus said. ``We haven't given up the
entire season. There's no reason to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I'm mistaken, we weren't eliminated today,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We have games left with Oakland and
we have games left with Seattle at the end of the season. We're
within range. These things can turn quickly. We can put together a
streak and be knocking at the door where we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels blew an 8-2 lead in Friday's game and got hammered
13-6 on Saturday. Sunday, Ortiz put the Angels into a big hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' Angels catcher Bengie Molina said. ``(Ortiz)
didn't have it today. He threw the ball right down the middle. When
you throw the ball right down the middle, they're going to get
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got eight guys playing behind me playing defense,'' Ortiz
said. ``And nobody could catch one. They were hitting the ball all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, Ray Durham and Frank Thomas each had three hits for the
White Sox, who had 15 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ortiz's troubles, the Angels had a chance to win it.
Spiezio's three-run homer in the third made it 9-7. Salmon's
three-run homer in the sixth made it 10-9. Glaus' solo homer in the
sixth made it 11-9. Erstad's homer in the seventh, his second of
the day, made it 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   But the weary Angels bullpen couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys need a break,'' Scioscia said. ``We can't
continue to go to them (so early in games) or there's no chance of
finishing the race where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels fell to 68-68, the first time they've been at .500
since June 16. And they know the only chance they have to contend
for a playoff spot is to get a big improvement from the pitchers,
particularly their starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're young, they're going to take their licks from time to
time,'' Salmon said. ``It's no secret this team is where it is
because of the offense. That's not a surprise. We have guys having
great offensive years. But it goes to show in this game, you need
pitching and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to Salmon, the Angels still have some fight left
despite another emotionally draining loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot out of you, but you see the way the team keeps
fighting,'' Salmon said. ``Instead of asking what's the limit of
what we can take, look at the guys and how we're battling. We're
battling our (rears) off. Nobody expected us to be here. We're
going to do everything we can all the way down to the end.'' &QL;

TIRE CHANGES WERE NEVER ENACTED AFTER 1978 RECALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS lede to clarify)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After the last huge recall of Firestone tires in 1978,
when tread separation problems re- sulted in hundreds of crashes
and dozens of deaths, Congress and regu- lators made a series of
proposals to tighten federal tire standards. But the standards were
not revised, and many of the same problems, includ- ing some that
the proposals were designed to address, have arisen again in the
14.4 million Firestone tires being recalled now.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional report on the 1978 recall of 14 million
Firestone 500 tires pointed out that the steel-belted radial tires
had easily passed the government's tests _ devised in the late
1960s for biased-ply tires, an earlier technology _ but still
failed in large numbers on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Carter administration officials began drafting new tire
regulations and imposed one new requirement on the auto industry in
1980, but many other initiatives were still in the rule-making
process when President Carter left office in 1981, documents from
that period show.
</P>
<P>
   All the moves to tighten tire regulation were stopped after
Ronald Reagan became president and sought to reduce the regulatory
burden on the then-beleaguered U.S. auto industry. The only new
rule, involving the disclosure of tires' capacity to carry weight,
was rescinded. Also canceled were plans for more stringent tests
and for mandatory devices to warn motorists when their tires became
underinflated.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the regulatory initiatives abandoned in 1981 are likely
to come up again this week, as congressional committees hold
hearings into the current recall.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received
more than 1,400 complaints about Firestone ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness AT tires, the bulk involving tires installed on Ford
Explorers. The complaints and data supplied to the agency by
Firestone attribute 88 deaths to the tires. Firestone has recalled
all ATX and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size, which were made
from 1990 to 1996, and has recalled Wilderness tires of the same
size made since 1996 at its factory in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency is also reviewing whether many more Firestone
tires may need to be recalled. On Friday it issued a consumer
advisory suggesting that motorists replace another 1.4 million
tires that Firestone has refused to recall.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone estimates that 6.5 million of the 14.4 million tires
covered in the current recall are on the road, and fewer than half
those covered by the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Two provisions dropped in the early 1980s clearly would have
made the current episode easier for consumers. One would have
required that identification numbers be printed on exterior rather
than interior sidewalls, making it much simpler for consumers to
determine if their tires were included in a recall or advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Another, enacted before the 1978 recall, required that
independent tire dealers keep track of the addresses of buyers, so
that those customers could be contacted during any recall.
</P>
<P>
   The year before the huge recall of 1978, Firestone had recalled
400,000 similar tires made in Decatur. The company insisted then,
as it does now, that the problem was confined to that plant, but
company documents obtained by regulators in 1978 showed that
Firestone knew of a design defect affecting tires from other
factories as well.
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 recall and the current one are the two largest, by a
wide margin, since tire regulation began in the 1960s. The earlier
recall produced more than 14,000 complaints to regulators, but
those complaints cited just 41 deaths. Firestone 500s were car
tires, and few cars rolled over when their tires failed. The
current recall involves far fewer complaints but more deaths, most
of which have occurred when Explorers and other sport utility
vehicles rolled over after the tires lost treads.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recall, House and Senate conferees were
scheduled to decide in the next several weeks whether to let
regulators proceed with plans to provide consumers with information
on vehicles' tendency to roll over. One of the hearings this week
will be held by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who has led efforts to
block the release of the information. Shelby, who has been
traveling in Africa for the past month, has declined interview
requests through aides.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and the
environment, said in a recent news conference that Ford would favor
any new tire regulations that improved safety. Ford opposes
regulators' plans to rate vehicles' tendency to roll over,
contending that the proposal does not measure this tendency
accurately enough.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have defended their plan, pointing out that
automakers have opposed every attempt to measure rollover
propensity since regulators began studying the issue in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The government tests tires for endurance by running them for 34
hours at 50 miles per hour and for speed by running them for 90
minutes at 70 to 85 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen R. Kratzke, the associate administrator of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, confirmed that regulators
were considering more stringent tests, notably for speed. Any new
rules would probably not be limited to tires for sport utility
vehicles and other light trucks, he said, but would also extend to
car tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly true that light trucks are more prone to roll
over with something like this,'' Kratzke said in a recent
interview. ``But this kind of failure scares me, and I don't think
people in cars will be comfortable with it either.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to disclosures that Ford subsidiaries overseas began
replacing the tires last year, Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater said Sunday on the ABC program ``This Week'' that the
Clinton administration also wanted legislation requiring
manufacturers to report recalls abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials declined to comment on whether they felt new
tire regulations were needed. But Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for
Goodyear, the market-share leader, said Sunday night that the
company did ``see a need for change in the regulations'' and had
been working on this even before the current recall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cause of the problems with the tires in 1978 was
never publicly determined, Firestone did make changes to them, and
the problems stopped. But the episode crippled the company
financially and contributed to its takeover in 1988 by Bridgestone
Corporation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone recovered from the 1978 recall by replacing virtually
all the tires itself, which kept customers coming back to its
dealers. But Ford has insisted that Firestone reimburse customers
who buy other brands this time.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1981, as the Reagan administration began reviewing its
predecessor's regulatory backlog, the U.S. auto industry had laid
off 500,000 workers and was close to bankruptcy. Chrysler had just
been rescued with a government loan.
</P>
<P>
   While high interest rates and high gasoline prices were partly
responsible, auto executives also blamed the high cost of
government regulation, and Reagan sought to ease this burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president recognizes the importance of protecting health,
safety and the environment,'' a White House announcement on the
auto industry said on April 6, 1981. ``Nevertheless, some of the
regulations governing the auto industry's plants and products are
unnecessarily stringent, and can be relaxed or rescinded with
little or no cost to worthwhile regulatory goals.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial tire regulations proposed at the
end of the Carter administration, and canceled by Reagan, would
have required that vehicles alert their owners to low tire
pressure, either with a light on the dashboard or with a red button
that would pop up from the tire's valve.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1981 statement said that the tire-inflation
requirement would cost at least $130 million per year. Keeping
tires inflated, it said, ``is arguably more directly and
efficiently addressed as a public/consumer issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for such warnings was questioned at the time, partly
because full-service gas stations were still common and many
Americans had their tires checked whenever they refilled their gas
tanks. Most Americans now use self-service stations, and air for
tires is not always free, if it is available at all.
</P>
<P>
   Tire inflation has been a big issue in the current recall.
Firestone has recommended that Explorer tires be inflated to 30
pounds per square inch, after acquiescing for a decade in Ford's
recommendation of 26 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   For drivers accustomed to a car's ride, softer tires help
cushion the stiffness almost inevitable in the suspension of a
pickup-truck-based sport utility like the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Baughman, Ford's director of light-truck engineering, has
acknowledged that Explorer tires could suffer damage if the
pressure falls below 20 pounds, but said that 26 pounds provided an
adequate margin of safety. Firestone was heavily criticized in 1978
for not having done more to tell customers of the dangers of
underinflation, and the company is emphasizing the issue now.

STUDY RANKS CONGESTED CALIFORNIA ROADS AMONG NATION'S SAFEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Believe it or not, sitting in Los Angeles traffic
may be beneficial to your health.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its national reputation as a tangle of freeways packed
with cell-phone wielding, gun-toting drivers, California's roads
rank as the fourth safest in the nation, according to a study to be
published this week by the National Safety Council.
</P>
<P>
   And that, some say, is a result of gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``In heavily populated areas, there's a lot more traffic on the
highways, so it's harder to drive fast,'' said National Safety
Council spokesman Joe Larkin. ``And there tend to be more emergency
facilities available so drivers can get treated right away.''
</P>
<P>
   With 1.1 traffic deaths per 100 million vehicle miles,
California tied with Rhode Island as the fourth safest state,
despite a dismal showing for most other Western states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is an anomaly in the West,'' Larkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The council, a national nonprofit membership group, is scheduled
to publish the numbers next week in an annual report on
nonintentional injuries and deaths. The study found that the
Northeast is the safest chunk of the nation, while sprawling
Western states _ many with open highways and higher speed limits _
generally are the least safe.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts rated as the safest state _ averaging 0.8 deaths
per 100 million miles traveled last year _ compared with a national
average of 1.5 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi ranked worst, with the most deaths _ 2.7 per 100
million miles. Arizona, Montana and Wyoming all ranked among the
worst with more than 2 deaths per 100 million miles.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Lawrence, a San Fernando Valley businessman and member of
the state Transportation Commission, said California's ranking
``pleasantly surprised'' him.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state has poured money into improving its highways
and into programs to help reduce poor driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an emphasis on improving the system and
transportation infrastructure so it is safer and gets more safe all
the time,'' Lawrence said. ``At the top there is tremendous
motivation to improve safety and congestion relief.''
</P>
<P>
   California Highway Patrol Deputy Commissioner Bill Carlson said
his agency works to educate the public about taking safety measures
such as using seat belts and having a designated driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just really try to focus as an organization on the types of
things that cause people to be hurt or killed,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said California has a lower blood-alcohol limit than some
other states _ at 0.08 percent _ and has a high rate of drivers and
passengers who wear seat belts. He said the state usually ranks
high in traffic safety studies, but ``there's still too many people
that die each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Akchy, a limousine driver for All-American Limousine
Services in Los Angeles, said he wasn't surprised by the study's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive around the world, and this is probably the
safest place to drive,'' he said. ``In Europe, it's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Cora, who works in an insurance office, chuckled at news
of the state's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised, just from seeing people drive on a daily
basis,'' she said. ``I have a window view of people just driving
out of our office, and it's surprising some of the things they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Cora said, ``Sometimes I've had to swerve out of the way
of other drivers who aren't paying attention. They are talking on
their cell phone or putting makeup on.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would have guessed California would have ranked
lower than the more rural states.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in other areas seem to be a little more friendly,
courteous,'' she said. ``In California, people are always in a rush
to get from Point A to Point B.''

COLTS PROVE THEY CAN TAKE CHIEFS' HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City Chiefs had everything going
for them.
</P>
<P>
   They had an NFL-best 11-game home-opening winning streak. They
had an Arrowhead Stadium crowd of 78,357 as loud as usual. They had
a heat index of 95 degrees at kickoff. And they had an emotional
pregame tribute to linebacker Derrick Thomas, who died in February.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chiefs had Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James and Marvin
Harrison going against them, and they were too much for Kansas City
to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Manning passed for 273 yards and a touchdown, Harrison caught
nine passes for 115 yards and James had 160 total yards and two
touchdowns as the Indianapolis Colts reestablished themselves as
AFC contenders with a 27-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of our young players appreciate how
difficult it is to come in here and beat these guys in this
stadium,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said. ``I do, because I've been in
this situation before. This is a big win for us, because it is a
tough place to come in and win. ...It was hot out there; the crowd
noise; it was a close game. That's when you have to execute and
perform and do what it takes to win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs clung to the bottom of the Colts' cleats until early
in the fourth quarter when Indianapolis scored 10 points in 59
seconds to take a 24-14 lead. Mike Vanderjagt made a 23-yard field
goal _ his 27th consecutive _ with 13:37 remaining to cap a
nine-play, 27-yard drive that was set up by a 40-yard Payton
Williams punt return. That was followed by a Jeff Burris' 27-yard
interception return for a touchdown at 12:38 when Elvis Grbac, who
was being pressured by linebacker Cornelius Bennett, tried to force
a pass to Derrick Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice in the fourth quarter to put it away and take the
game out of reach,'' said Manning, who was 22-of-32. ``This is a
tough environment to come into ... This crowd is so loud. It's hard
to hear. We had to use the silent count the entire game. This crowd
is a definite 12th man for the Chiefs. And their defense is so
good. That's what makes this win even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts also had to vanquish a case of the early game jitters.
</P>
<P>
   On its first drive, Indianapolis went from its own 36 to the
Chiefs 3, where James fumbled. On the Colts' next possession,
Manning threw into double coverage and was picked off by linebacker
Donnie Edwards at the Kansas City 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgerrin, he hardly ever fumbles, and he fumbles'' Manning
said. ``The second series, we get great field position, and I threw
it right to the guy. I was just, `Here, Donnie, take it.' It was
just a bonehead throw. We let them hang around and gave them
momentum. But at least we had opportunities. We can work on the
turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs have many things to iron out on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City was only 5-for-15 on third down. It got only 74
yards out of its committee of four running backs. And it dropped
seven passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put our defense out there too much,'' said Grbac, who was
16-for-37 for 212 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.
``Offensively we could have done better ... We just didn't help out
the team too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison was too much early, and James was too much late.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison beat cornerback Eric Warfield for 94 yards on six
catches in the first half, and James finished off the Chiefs with
68 yards on nine carries in the fourth quarter. James finished with
124 rushing yards and a touchdown on 28 carries and caught six
passes for 40 yards, including a 27-yard screen pass he scored on
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody did their job,'' said James, who has rushed for more
than 100 yards in 11 of his 17 regular-season games. ``I just did
my job. And this is the result.''

ANGELS LOSE ANOTHER CLOSE ONE

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Maybe the Angels have become numb to these kinds of
losses. But they insisted after their 13-12 loss to the Chicago
White Sox Sunday at Comiskey Park they're not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   They say they'll just wipe off the blood and answer the bell
today when they continue their fight for a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it might be difficult to imagine the Angels not feeling a
bit groggy after getting swept in the three-game series. The
pitchers got pummeled, allowing 35 runs in the series and 46 runs
during what is now a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels took a 4-0 lead in the top of the first Sunday,
starter Ramon Ortiz gave up nine runs in the bottom half and never
made it out of the inning. Still, the Angels rallied from a 9-4
deficit to take an 11-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels led 12-10 going into the bottom of the seventh, but
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-5) gave up three runs in the next two
innings, including Paul Konerko's tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the
eighth. &QL; 
The poor pitching overshadowed the performance of the Angels
offense, which had five home runs. Darin Erstad hit two, and Tim
Salmon, Scott Spiezio and Troy Glaus each hit one. For Glaus, it
was his 40th homer of the year, breaking the Angels' season-single
record he had shared with Reggie Jackson (39 in 1982).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are in sixth place in the wild-card race, 5 1/2 back.
They trail first-place Seattle by six games. But they say they're
not out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never give up,'' Glaus said. ``We haven't given up the
entire season. There's no reason to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I'm mistaken, we weren't eliminated today,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We have games left with Oakland and
we have games left with Seattle at the end of the season. We're
within range. These things can turn quickly. We can put together a
streak and be knocking at the door where we should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels blew an 8-2 lead in Friday's game and got hammered
13-6 on Saturday. Sunday, Ortiz put the Angels into a big hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' Angels catcher Bengie Molina said. ``(Ortiz)
didn't have it today. He threw the ball right down the middle. When
you throw the ball right down the middle, they're going to get
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got eight guys playing behind me playing defense,'' Ortiz
said. ``And nobody could catch one. They were hitting the ball all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, Ray Durham and Frank Thomas each had three hits for the
White Sox, who had 15 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ortiz's troubles, the Angels had a chance to win it.
Spiezio's three-run homer in the third made it 9-7. Salmon's
three-run homer in the sixth made it 10-9. Glaus' solo homer in the
sixth made it 11-9. Erstad's homer in the seventh, his second of
the day, made it 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   But the weary Angels bullpen couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys need a break,'' Scioscia said. ``We can't
continue to go to them (so early in games) or there's no chance of
finishing the race where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels fell to 68-68, the first time they've been at .500
since June 16. And they know the only chance they have to contend
for a playoff spot is to get a big improvement from the pitchers,
particularly their starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're young, they're going to take their licks from time to
time,'' Salmon said. ``It's no secret this team is where it is
because of the offense. That's not a surprise. We have guys having
great offensive years. But it goes to show in this game, you need
pitching and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to Salmon, the Angels still have some fight left
despite another emotionally draining loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot out of you, but you see the way the team keeps
fighting,'' Salmon said. ``Instead of asking what's the limit of
what we can take, look at the guys and how we're battling. We're
battling our (rears) off. Nobody expected us to be here. We're
going to do everything we can all the way down to the end.'' &QL;

DAY ONE ON JOB ONE ROUGH ONE FOR CAMPO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ You never forget your first bicycle ride, first
day of school or first kiss.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game under Dave Campo, the Cowboys fell off the
bike, got kicked out of school and smacked by the girl, leaving no
doubt that he would never forget his first game as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rough day,'' Campo said. ``I didn't think [a bad
game] would be the first one, but I might as well get it out of the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day that began so innocently, everything that could go
wrong did as the fifth coach in the 41-year history of the Cowboys
endured countless dubious firsts. Philadelphia toyed with Dallas
and won, 41-14, Sunday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was watching Eagles running back Duce Staley run for
201 yards, Troy Aikman leave the game with a mild concussion or
tackle Erik Williams get ejected, Campo could never have known just
how rough his first game would be.
</P>
<P>
   1:01 p.m. _ A little more than two hours before kickoff, Campo
walks out of the locker room and heads down the tunnel to the field
for pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Was the 29-year career assistant a little nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nervous,'' Campo said, ``and excited.''
</P>
<P>
   3:05 p.m. _ First coin toss. A smashing success. The Cowboys win
it and elect for the game's first possession.
</P>
<P>
   14:56 of the first quarter _ First of many dubious signs. Kicker
David Akers of the Eagles executes a perfect onside kick that
Dameane Douglas recovers.
</P>
<P>
   10:44 _ First panic. Although silent on the sidelines, Campo
can't like what he sees when quarterback Troy Aikman is sacked on
the Cowboys' first play. Aikman is sacked two more times in the
next five plays.
</P>
<P>
   10:12 _ First Campo-is-an-offensive-genius applause. On the next
play, Rocket Ismail gains 37 yards on an end-around.
</P>
<P>
   :08 _ First dumb penalty. On third-and-one from Dallas 27,
Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb floats a pass to the end zone for
Charles Johnson where safety Izell Reese is called for pass
interference. The Eagles score on the next play for a 14-0
first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   13:40 of the second quarter _ First wish that this was only a
preseason game. Jeremiah Trotter intercepts Aikman's pass and
returns it 27 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   13:40 _ First verbally enunciated displeasure from crowd. Later,
as the game progresses, Campo hears his first boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here wanted it for Dave,'' Cowboys owner/general
manager Jerry Jones said. ``But, this is not on him.''
</P>
<P>
   12:40 _ First Aikman concussion. In a right of passage for
Cowboys coaches, Aikman suffers a mild concussion when he's sacked
for the fourth time in the first half. He doesn't return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot take shots like this all season, or we're going to
send him into early retirement,'' Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   5:05 _ First pass completion/quarterback controversy. Backup
quarterback Randall Cunningham hits tight end Jackie Harris with a
pass that gains no yards.
</P>
<P>
   2:53 _ First points. Kicker Tim Seder caps a four-play, 2-yard
drive with a 34-yard field goal, cutting the deficit to 24-3.
</P>
<P>
   First first half _ Eagles 24, Cowboys 6.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the firsts were less numerous. But, there
was a positive, with some more negatives.
</P>
<P>
   6:45 of the fourth quarter _ First touchdown. Joey Galloway
catches a 4-yard pass from Cunningham, and the deficit is cut to
41-14.
</P>
<P>
   2:45 _ First natural disaster. Galloway is carted off the field
with a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   2:45 _ First Erik Williams ejection. Failing to land his Joe
Frazier impersonation on an Eagle, Williams is kicked out of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   First game?
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butts kicked, and now it's time to move on,'' Smith
said. ``We scored a touchdown and our field-goal kicker made two
field goals. That's the only positives.''
</P>
<P>
   And another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about it is that's [game] No. 1,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that might be a negative. nn

FOOTBALL, HUMILIATION GET IN CAMPO'S FACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The nicest thing that happened to Dave Campo all
day Sunday was when he was hit in the face by a football during
pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Bam, right in the kisser.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing was when he opened his eyes and found himself
still standing on the sidelines at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong team.
</P>
<P>
   On what should have been the biggest day of his football career,
Campo was blindsided by a humiliating dose of reality in his debut
as Cowboys' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 41, Cowboys 14 says somebody better call 9-1-1 and
fast.
</P>
<P>
   You think 109 degrees at kickoff was hot? You could have toasted
ravioli on the back of Campo's neck.
</P>
<P>
   One game into the regular season and we have a full-blown
five-alarm emergency on our hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that [football in the face] was an omen,'' Campo sighed
after the second-worst opening day loss in the Cowboys' 41-year
history. ``Looking back, that was a high point.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo's face was still stinging from the errant ball when the
Eagles stunned the Cowboys by successfully executing an onside kick
on the opening kickoff. Nine plays later Donovan McNabb hit a wide
open Jeff Thomason from the 1-yard line for Philadelphia's first
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Campo could only watch in helpless horror as the never-ending
nightmare rolled on, and on, and on. With a searing sun beating
down for most of the long afternoon, what should have been a day of
celebration turned instead into a trip to the nether regions of
hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had family and friends here today,'' Campo said after
finally emerging from a grim Cowboys' locker room. ``And I'm
completely, totally embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   If Campo wasn't such a nice guy, if he hadn't paid his dues in
serving 11 years as a Cowboys assistant coach and defensive
coordinator before finally getting his chance when Chan Gailey was
fired in January, there might be some small satisfaction to be
found in Sunday's humiliation. After all, it was Campo who stood up
at the team's kickoff luncheon last week and told the local media
doomsayers that most of us are out to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd have to be a sadist to wish what happened yesterday on
your worst enemy. Anyone with half a brain understood that Campo's
real target was his own team. It was a strategic psychological ploy
that failed miserably. His players obviously weren't listening and
Sunday's disgraceful performance was the result.
</P>
<P>
   The really bad news: It's going to get worse before it gets
better.
</P>
<P>
   Take Troy Aikman, for instance. The Eagles did, over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman spent much of the afternoon at the hospital, trying to
clear cobwebs from his head after what was initially announced as
his third concussion in his past 10 games and eighthof his pro
career.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine times he ``tried'' to pass the ball before leaving
early in the second quarter, Aikman was sacked four times, threw
four incompletions and had an interception returned 27 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be time for Aikman to follow Steve Young's lead and quit
before his eyes are permanently crossed. He doesn't need this kind
of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also might have lost star wide receiver Joey
Galloway for an undetermined length of time. He injured a knee late
in the game and Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones seemed much more worried
about his condition than he did Aikman's.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the two major physical blows that Cowboys suffered
yesterday, but the psychological scars from this one may last all
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, led by Duce Staley's 201-yard day, gouged out huge
chunks of real estate en route to 306 yards rushing. Staley joined
Jim Brown and Greg Bell as just the third running back in history
to surpass 200 yards against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   This, against a front seven that Jones had compared to the 1993
Super Bowl group, which speaks volumes about the owner/GM's ability
as a talent evaluator.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Cowboys have a weakness at cornerback? Sure they do, but
since they were able to run with complete immunity, the Eagles had
no reason to exploit it. Save that for another day.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense was hardly alone in its humiliation. The
next time the offensive line picks up a blitz will be the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't stop the run and we didn't protect the
quarterback,'' Campo said. ``They whipped our butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with me. Obviously I didn't have them exactly
prepared to play today. My words to them were, I ``will'' have them
ready next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. This season is just getting started and Campo somehow
managed to find solace in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measure of success is how you handle adversity,'' Campo
said. ``The great thing about it is it's No. 1.; I'd feel a heck of
a lot worse about it if it was No. 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Dave, if it was No. 16, at least the nightmare would be
over, not just beginning. nn

COWBOYS HAVE SUNK TO NEW LOW: NO. 31
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Since the mid-'90s, the Cowboys have desperately
attempted to hang on to what they once were. But after Sunday at
Texas Stadium, as the 2000 season debuted with a 40-year,
franchise-low disgrace, there's a much bigger concern to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   What have the Cowboys now become?
</P>
<P>
   After Week 1 of a long NFL season that locally, anyway, now
appears endless, there is no question about which club has earned
the right to be called worst in the league. The next fandom chant
to be heard around here:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're No. 31. ... We're No. 31.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Cowboys were so boot-licking bad in this opener,
there might be a tendency to say they've got to be better than
this. Don't bet on it. In fact, that would also be an old echo from
the exhibition games, which in August seemed to have some validity.
But now?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they can be this bad, at least based on what the
Philadelphia Eagles exposed in all football-related areas, starting
with superior smarts by the coaching staff, and then moving right
through offense, defense and special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Eagles were hinting that they are about to become
2000's version of the St. Louis Rams, how does a marginal-at-best
Philly outfit cause this kind of mass destruction? Two teams play
for 60 minutes, then one leaves town with new-found joy and the
other leaves a greasy spot on Jerry Jones' green carpet.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were still adjusting their jocks as Eagles' coach
Andy Reid opened the game with a successful onside kick, the kind
of gutsy call that made Jimmy Johnson a legend. Red faces suddenly
appeared on the opposite sideline, which had nothing to do with 109
degrees. Coaches dread being snookered by other coaches. And the
Cowboys looked like bumpkins on the first kickoff of Dave Campo's
head coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   If only the humiliation had ended there. Instead, it was just
the beginning. The Cowboys never did get those jocks adjusted, or
anything else, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   What do you say after 41-14? ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the postgame self-evaluation provided the finest local
moments of the afternoon, which, granted, didn't take much. But you
know how Jerry Jones can be _ he will sugarcoat famine and 100-year
floods if it suits his needs.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had losses that hurt before, but from the standpoint of
disappointment, there's never been one like this since I've been
associated with the Cowboys,'' Jones said. ``I'm embarrassed for
our staff, for our players, and then I'm also embarrassed. I don't
put this one on Dave Campo's shoulders. This one goes on my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, maybe. But it was a truly awful day in Campo's coaching
life. The very worst kind of day.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, with that armadillo-in-the-headlights look on his face,
then added, ``no loss has ever been this surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising, of course, in it's depth, width and overall scope.
Only the proverbial ``not ready to play'' explanation normally
applies, and Campo said exactly that, taking the blame himself. But
it's the season opener. How could players not be ready to play for
an emotional little fireball of a new coach _ the anti-Chan, if you
will? And that's what the fans wanted, right? Do you think docile
ol' Chan was laughing when he saw this score down in Miami?
</P>
<P>
   Jones poured millions into a ``new/old'' offense, and it wasn't
worth nickels and dimes yesterday, no matter if Troy or Randall
were at the controls. The offensive line had it's collective butt
absolutely kicked, and this, friends, is listed as a ``team
strength.'' Strategy-wise, the offense was clueless in trying to
figure out what the Eagles were doing on defense. You can't block
what has already whizzed past you.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, there was at least one consolation _ no worry about
the cornerbacks. Not with Duce Staley ripping for miles and miles
behind an Eagles' offensive line that steam rolled the front seven.
And not with a pass rush that young Donovan McNabb must have been
laughing at. But the bible of football tells us one sure thing: If
you can't stop the run, you can't stop the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, here's a thought: Do you think these sweatfest training
camps held in Texas just might cause the kind of September physical
drain that some players have said? How did the Eagles look so fresh
and frisky in this blast furnace after five weeks of training in
what was described as unseasonably cool and rainy climes up at
Lehigh University? Wasn't this heat supposed to work to the
heat-tested Cowboys' advantage? Instead, they were chestnuts
roasting over a Philly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if you were thinking yesterday was the absolute worst _
that there has to be an upside from here _ then check the medical
reports due to be announced sometime today. How serious is that
Troy Aikman concussion? Regardless, there's no way he plays next
week, or even the next, is there? And Joey Galloway _ what will the
MRI being done on his damaged left knee tell us about his
availability the remainder of the season? The postgame locker room
was very concerned over Galloway's future.
</P>
<P>
   See there, it can get worse. Even if you're already No. 31 in
the NFL. nn

DUCE STALEY FOUND HEAT TOUGHER OPPONENT THAN COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' defense almost /{killed/}
Philadelphia's Duce Staley on Sunday. After all, it allowed the
Eagles running back to run up and down the field for three hours in
the 109-degree Texas sun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired, especially toward the end,'' Staley said. ``Even
though the sun switched sides, I was still drained.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staley rushed for 201 yards on his 26 carries, added another 61
on receptions, and plowed into Dallas' end zone once in
Philadelphia's 41-14 opening-day victory against the Cowboys on
Sunday at Texas Stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1949, when Steve Van Buren gained 205 yards against
Pittsburgh, had an Eagles back had a 200-yard rushing game. Not
since 1984 has a running back rushed for 200 yards on the Cowboys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Duce went off today. He really did. He had a helluva game,''
Eagles defensive end Hugh Douglas said. ``He played hard and he
didn't give their defense a chance to rest and I think that was the
key.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys probably would not argue. Those that were not helped
off the field for heat-related cramps were gasping for air after
spending most of the game chasing Staley &AMP; Co. all over the field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of got to us because they ran a lot,'' Cowboys rookie
cornerback Kareem Larrimore said. ``But we're going to meet up with
him again, and I'm pretty sure it's not going to be as bad as
this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only twice in the storied history of the 'Boys has it been. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 when Buffalo's Greg Bell rushed for 206 yards and in
1963 when Cleveland's Jim Brown had a 232-yard performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staley might not be the second coming of Brown, but the Cowboys
made him look like it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least for a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the type of back who is not going to let one person
tackle him,'' Eagles offensive lineman Jon Runyan said. ``He wants
to get out, shake a guy off and make two or three guys tackle him.
If you give him a big enough hole there is not going to be enough
people around to tackle him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a couple of his runs, namely the 60, 34 and 18-yard ones,
there weren't any.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staley disagreed, shredding the Cowboys defense for a
career-high number of yards was not as always as easy as it looked.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was the time in the first quarter when he crashed into the
Eagles bench after an 8-yard run, hurting his right knee and
missing a couple of plays. He took another vicious hit after the
Eagles scored to open the fourth quarter. It was from his teammate,
quarterback Donovan McNabb, but the chest bump gone wrong at least
knocked him down.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would have loved to have been able to do that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' inability to stop Staley set the tone for the
Eagles. It was the beat they moved to all game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out with Tra [Thomas] and Big Runyan, we wanted to ...
pound, pound, pound,'' Staley said. ``They're down here in their
home town and they're getting tired. So we tried to take
advantage.'' &QL;

THE RISE AND FALL OF A DOCTOR ACCUSED OF KILLING HER PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By N.R. KLEINFIELD   and IVER PETERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was a great achiever, living out the theme of success. There
was the Harvard medical education, followed by prestigious
professional appointments. There was romance. An interlude in the
Virgin Islands. There was money.
</P>
<P>
   But when Dr. Idella Kathleen Hagen appeared in Superior Court in
Morristown, N.J., last Tuesday, she was the face of failure _ gaunt
and abject. One of her lawyers told the judge that she was only
dimly aware of why she was even there.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, Hagen, 54, was arrested and charged with murdering
her parents, Idella Hagen, 92, and James Hagen, 86 _ apparently by
suffocating them in their twin beds in their Chatham Township,
N.J., home. For some time, she had been living in their basement
and helping to care for them. They were frail, but the authorities
do not interpret this as a mercy killing. They are unsure what it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen's lawyers said they were preparing a defense based on her
questionable mental state. They suggested that she was severely
depressed, tormented by unknown demons and wearied by lack of sleep
and food. The police said she answered the door disheveled and in a
rumpled nightgown. They said that when they got there, the parents
had been dead for days, while their daughter continued to carry on
in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen is being held in the Morris County Jail and has not talked
publicly about her predicament. The following picture of her was
pieced together from documents and interviews with people who know
her.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, an only child, grew up in Chatham and attended Chatham
High School and then Douglass College, the women's college at
Rutgers, where she met Peter A. Cook, a graduate student at Rutgers
from Bedforshire, England. They were married in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their life together was compromised by the punishing
demands that went with the training of a doctor. She graduated from
Harvard Medical School in 1973, and became the first woman
appointed a urology resident at Massachusetts General Hospital. She
taught surgery at Harvard Medical School, and in 1982 became the
chief of the urology division at Rutgers Medical School, since
renamed Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and part of the
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we came to an understanding that her principal
emotional relationship was with medicine rather than with me,''
Cook said. Their marriage lasted 10 years. There were no children.
Cook is now a statistician and lives in Brookline, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, at a dance club at the Jersey Shore, Hagen met William
Tyrrell, an industrial engineer who worked at Motion Systems, a
small industrial components maker in Eatontown, N.J. The following
year, they were married. It was also his second marriage, and he
had two sons with his previous wife.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Hagen's life began to trace a new arc.
She worked very hard. She was a woman in what was largely a man's
specialty. And like so many doctors, she grew disenchanted with the
direction of medicine under the penny-conscious strictures of
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Tyrrell said, she buckled under a heavy depression. She
was hospitalized for several weeks. The consensus was that she
suffered from bipolar disease, or manic depression. She was put on
medication, Tyrrell said, and resumed her career without any
obvious affects.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tyrrell, he and his wife had talked about making a
sharp change in their lives. They had taken vacations to St. Thomas
in the Virgin Islands and had built a vacation house. On and off,
they had pondered buying a business there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, they discovered the Villa Olga, a small hotel and
restaurant in St. Thomas that had once been the Russian consulate.
Tyrrell said they acquired a long-term lease on the property for
about $600,000 from Richard Doumeng, the general manager of the
Bolongo Bay Beach Club. Doumeng said that his impression was that
the inn was more Tyrrell's dream than Hagen's, though Tyrrell said
they shared it equally.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen converted to part-time status at the medical school and
the couple moved to St. Thomas. They renamed the hotel the West
Indies Inn. At a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, they
enlarged it to 19 rooms from eight. For a while, things went well.
Then fate dealt them several bad hands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Hurricane Hugo ravaged the island, badly damaging the
inn. But they remained open as they repaired it. Next came the
Persian Gulf War and a jittery stock market, which disrupted many
travelers' vacation plans. A number of airlines, including Eastern
and Pan American, collapsed. The couple had guests who couldn't get
flights to the island. Grudgingly, they gave up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Tyrrell returned to New Jersey and resumed work as
operations manager at Motion Systems. She stayed in St. Thomas to
try to sell the lease. She remained for about a year, at which
point Doumeng took it back. In the end, Tyrrell said, they wound up
losing about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Though they kept their St. Thomas home, the couple resurrected
their New Jersey life. They bought a clapboard house in Rumson, on
the Shrewsbury River. Hagen began doing unpaid research at Robert
Wood Johnson, using rats to develop a treatment for bladder cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, she was dispirited. ``She quit medicine and we
had to quit the hotel business,'' Tyrrell said. ``She had to be an
achiever to do what she had done. When an achiever isn't achieving,
they aren't as happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon their marriage began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made sure she was the center of attention in some cases,
and that didn't sit well with some people,'' Tyrrell said. If a
waiter was unresponsive, she would make it clear what she thought
of his inattentiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The event that clinched it came the day in 1995 that Tyrrell
climbed on his motorcycle to visit a friend. A few blocks from
their home he was hit by a car. The accident broke several of his
ribs and his left leg was mangled.
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital, he faced a difficult decision. The doctors
could try to save his leg, but that could mean years of operations
that might prove fruitless. Or they could simply amputate it right
away.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, was adamant that he keep the leg, he said. ``At one
point, she said to me, `I'm not going to let anyone cut your leg
off,''' he recalled. ``I said, `Nobody is going to tell me what I
can or can't do.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he decided to have the leg amputated, she was enraged. This
drove him to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   He never returned home. When he left the hospital, he checked
into a motel. He declared their marriage over. It took more than a
year for them to reach a divorce agreement, slowed perhaps by a
stroke of bizarre behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen was aware that her husband liked to visit a go-go bar near
his office with co-workers. It irked her. ``She felt it was
demeaning,'' said Bernard Hoffman, her divorce lawyer. ``And she
was still hoping for a reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday in September 1996, she called the place and told
them that she was going to do a birthday dance on the bar for her
husband. His birthday was actually in May. The bar alerted the
police. She dressed in a go-go outfit and drove over. The police
handcuffed her and arrested her in the parking lot. Her husband was
not there. Charges against her were dismissed, but she has a
lawsuit pending against the Eatontown, N.J., police, contending
that they violated her civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   A medical history turned over in conjunction with the suit
showed that she suffered from a thyroid condition and from bipolar
disorder. It said that she was taking lithium.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, the couple had net assets of $1.6
million, most of them acquired during their marriage. Of the
marital assets, she left with $780,000 and he got about $405,000.
He took the Rumson house, and she took the St. Thomas one. Coupled
with her prior assets, Hagen as a newly divorced woman was worth a
little over $1 million.

 UNDATED: $1 million. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hagen shuttled back and forth between St. Thomas and her
parents' home in Chatham Township. She stopped doing research. She
had an apartment built in the basement of her parents' house.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to struggle for a sense of self. Everything had
melted _ two careers, two marriages. She began to worry about
money, more, it appears, than she had reason to.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that of her assets of more than $1 million, much was
not liquid. It included the St. Thomas house, valued at $280,000,
two Killington, Vt., condominiums of minimal net value, and
retirement accounts worth more than $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   But she had no children. She seemed frugal. Though her alimony
and health insurance were supposed to have ended by Aug. 15 under
the terms of her divorce, Tyrrell said the payment schedule had
been altered; she is still receiving alimony and is still covered
by his insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, her first husband, said she called him recently,
ostensibly to discuss some possessions from their marriage, but it
was clear to him that she really wanted to talk about her problems.
She did not sound despondent to him, but she spoke of stresses.
``She said she was going to have to start supporting her parents,''
he said. ``She made some allusions to her parents' retirement
money, about it being finite, and that unless she sold the house
she was going to be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with Hagen's financial holdings, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, said that he talked with her a couple
of months ago and that she was concerned about keeping up her
parents' expenses, but she had not cashed in any assets.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrrell said he, too, had spoken to her recently. ``She had
concerns about money, but I don't think they were founded,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents in St. Thomas said that she put her house
there up for sale on June 22 at the appealing price of $319,000,
but abruptly removed it from the market three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The house does not appear to have been visited recently. Weeds
have sprung up in the hand-laid blue-rock retaining walls. The
water in the small dip pool is colored with algae. Inside the
house, a floor lamp is on its side. Liquor bottles are stacked
below the circular stairs, and detritus covers the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen had no more career, but it is unclear why she did not seek
to revive one. ``What do the astronauts do after they go to the
moon?'' Tyrrell said. ``A number of them have had problems. It was
hard for her to live in the aftermath of what she had achieved so
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on a Saturday morning, she called the Chatham Township
police. She told them who she was and said that her parents were
dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Neb. _ In small Midwestern towns like this one, they
take their county fairs seriously. The Fillmore County Fair in July
was a big deal, the 125th annual event.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, while the Future Farmers of America are
showing their prize hogs in the Swine Show Barn, a slender visitor
appears. He's dressed in slacks, a golf shirt and loafers, and
wears sunglasses and a ball cap. Despite his fame and his new
career's need for visibility, there is no fanfare to herald his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   He extends his hand and quietly greets a man in overalls. ``Hi,
I'm Tom.'' The man responds, ``Well, Tom Osborne,'' his voice
reflecting as much surprise as if he had just shaken hands with
Elizabeth Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   For five minutes, Tom Osborne _ former Nebraska football coach,
current Republican candidate for the 3rd District seat in the U.S.
House of Representatives _ is just another fair goer. Then, as word
spreads, he spends the next 15 minutes signing autographs. After
the FFA members complete their showing of future breakfast meats,
Osborne makes his way inside the ring. Without introduction, he
takes the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do right now is hear from a
politician,'' Osborne says. ``I wish some of these 10-year-olds
I've been signing stuff for could vote; I'd do really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-deprecating, aw-shucks humor sells at county fairs. Osborne
speaks for less than a minute, with no mention of the issues or his
opinions. A Huey Long stump speech, it's not. Then, he moves
through the bleachers, shaking hands and saying hello. This is
low-key politics. Even the bumper sticker that says ``Tom Osborne
For U.S. Congress'' is in blue and white, not Nebraska red and
white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of myself as a politician, but I guess if you're
running for office, you are one,'' Osborne says.
Mr. Osborne Goes To Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines like that are ready to be set in type in Nebraska
newspapers. Of all the races being contested in this election year,
Osborne's Nov. 7 victory against Democratic challenger Rollie
Reynolds is the only sure thing. In this case, Dewey ``will''
defeat Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne won the Republican primary with 71 percent of the vote.
He's expected to wind up with a similar percentage in the general
election. After the primaries, polls showed Osborne favored by 90
percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Osborne a Republican running in a district that has
elected the GOP candidate in each election going back 70 years, he
is ``Tom Osborne.'' For 25 years, he was the state's most visible
celebrity/deity/leader as coach of the Cornhuskers. Osborne, a
native son (Hastings), won 255 games and three national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lifetime background in agriculture, and he has a
lifetime background in football,'' Reynolds said. ``Agriculture is
in the tank. This district is in dire straits, and they're going to
vote for him, probably, because of football and not agriculture.`
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's campaign theme is ``You and Tom.'' It might just as
well be ``In Tom We Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows Nebraska, and he has a wonderful moral character,''
said Pat Brinkman, a farm wife from nearby Shickley. ``I think he
represents what the people are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you plan to vote for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try and be fair,'' she said. ``I need to hear
where he stands on the issues first. Farm issues are very important
to most of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Bristol, a farmer from Fairmont, says that the farm
situation is bleak and that the government's farm program is in
``disrepair.'' He would like to see a return to a supply-and-demand
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom's an honest person,'' Bristol said. ``I'm supporting him
because I think there's a lack of honesty and integrity in
Congress. I consider him a coach, not a politician. I believe he
can make an impact in Washington. I'm hoping he can be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol, though, hasn't decided who to vote for. Osborne's lack
of political experience concerns Bristol, but then he sighs and
says, ``What are our alternatives?''
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd District is the nation's largest in area, making up 80
percent of the state. West of Lincoln, the district stretches 300
miles east to west and 200 miles north and south. Osborne estimates
that by November, he will have driven 40,000 to 50,000 miles
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva Rotary Club in a modern facsimile of a log cabin.
Thirty Rotarians are enjoying their lunch of Sloppy Joe s, corn on
the cob, lemonade and chocolate brownies. After his fair
appearance, Osborne works his way around the room, shaking hands
and redundantly introducing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne stands and joins in the singing of ``My Country 'Tis Of
Thee'' and the first stanza of ``The Battle Hymn of The Republic.''
All that's missing is Norman Rockwell, observing and sketching from
a corner. Then Honest Tom starts his 20-minute campaign speech with
some typical low-key humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a lot of Rotary meetings, but you guys sing
better,'' he cracks in a Steven Wright monotone.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-minute speech, Osborne outlines his three main issues:
helping farmers and improving the agriculture; improving the
district's infrastructure so that it can better serve computers and
the Internet, which would make the district more attractive to
high-tech businesses; be more proactive when dealing with young
people and their problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Rotarians are riveted. Osborne speaks like someone who has a
doctorate in educational psychology. He is thoughtful and willing
to learn. So far, though, he's just talking the talk. Until he gets
to Washington and proves he can be effective in government, he
hasn't walked the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' he said. ``People say I'm naive in
regard to politics, but I think dealing with the NCAA is a good
primer. So many things are done by the NCAA out of perception
rather than what was best. It's not like this is totally foreign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be some who perceive me as a football
coach elected strictly because of the fact I'm a former football
coach. Over time, I hope I can demonstrate a level of competence
and commitment that \Rother lawmakers\S will appreciate.''
Osborne, 63, announced his retirement in December 1997. The Huskers
defeated Tennessee, 42-17, in the 1998 Orange Bowl to earn Nebraska
a share of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my last game, I knew there were some things I was
leaving that would never be approximated again,'' Osborne said. ``I
don't think \Rpolitics\S will replace football. I miss football a
lot, the relationships with players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't consciously gone into this thinking I have to have
something to replace football. I'm not really good at retirement. I
didn't want to spend the rest of my time with a fishing rod or a
golf club.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Osborne was tempted to return to coaching. The
University of Houston reportedly dangled a $1 million contract.
Michigan State also inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tempting,'' he said of the preliminary
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, though, decided he didn't want to disrupt and uproot
his family. Running for office, while not the same as calling for a
two-point conversion with the national championship on the line,
was the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case of wanting to be relevant,'' Osborne said. ``I
felt I had enough energy to make one more major push. As I looked
around, I thought the 3rd District was where I could do the most
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne has talked with fellow Republicans J.C. Watts and Steve
Largent, former athletes who are congressmen from Oklahoma. He
understands the potential frustration trying to wade through
partisanship and special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared to be frustrated,'' said Osborne, who has placed
a limit of $300 on individual campaign contributions and who is not
accepting money from special-interest groups. ``In coaching, if you
wanted to run a play up the middle, you ran up the middle. You go
up there, and you're not going to have your opinion count for
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne will come in as an outsider and plans to remain an
outsider. The House does most of its business from Tuesday through
Thursday. He plans to commute, flying to Washington, on Monday
night, back home Thursday night. His ideal schedule would have him
attending events in the 3rd District on Friday and Saturday then
spending Sunday with his family.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, says Osborne has the
leadership and organizational skills to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with his kind of national recognition, he won't start
at the bottom,'' Granger said. ``He's a winner in his coaching
career, an extraordinary leader. That would put him in a special
category.''
</P>
<P>
   In cinematic fiction, Jimmy Stewart played rookie Sen. Jefferson
Smith in ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.'' Stewart/Smith was a Good
Guy who triumphed in the final reel. (That's the way Hollywood used
to make movies.) Osborne has never seen the Frank Capra film
starring Stewart. Coaches watch film recommended by the American
Football Coaches Association, not the American Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a desire to serve Nebraska well,'' Osborne said in his
quiet, Midwestern monotone. ``I think the 3rd District sometimes
feels a little left out, a little bit ignored. Maybe I can raise
the visibility of what's going on with agriculture, small towns. I
think maybe we can provide some vision, optimism, belief that it's
going to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can make a difference. I hope I come out as well as
Jimmy Stewart. I probably won't. They'll probably hand my head to
me.'' nn

<P>
   In 25 seasons as Nebraska's football coach, Tom Osborne had a
67-17-1 record in November, including an 18-game winning streak in
that month to close out his career. On Election Day, Osborne
figures to add another victory by winning the congressional seat in
Nebraska's 3rd District.
</P>
<P>
   Even his Democratic opponent, Rollie Reynolds, concedes that his
odds of winning Nov. 7 are slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a quite steep mountain to climb,'' said Reynolds, a
Grand Island resident. ``He's such a nice man. He gives the
impression he's more honest than other people. I don't know how,
but he does. He's very, very popular. Winning three national
championships his last four years as coach really makes people want
to identify with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd District has almost twice as many Republicans as
Democrats. Reynolds was unopposed in the primary; Osborne won the
Republican primary against two challengers with 71] percent of the
vote. That's the political equivalent of the Huskers' 39-10 average
scores in Osborne's 67 November victories.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne has raised about $300,000 in campaign contributions.
Reynolds estimates that he has raised $10,000. Osborne's campaign
has a Web site. Reynolds doesn't even own a computer; he used a
typewriter (a word processor that preceded the computer) to
distribute his stance on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a staff; it's a one-man operation,'' Reynolds
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to play Kennedy to Osborne's Nixon, Reynolds challenged
Osborne to four debates. One is scheduled Oct. 15 on Nebraska
Public Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect his advisers have told him that he's way ahead, go
sit on the porch and don't say anything,'' said Reynolds, whose
brother Don is married to Osborne's first cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds claims expertise in the campaign's most critical issue:
agricultural reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do like he did in football,'' Reynolds said.
``It's third and long for Nebraska agriculture, and I think he
wants to run it up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a duty call for me. I'm trying to get agriculture moving
again. The current system is set up by the government with coaching
from four big companies to maintain low grain prices. I'm saying
it's time for farmers to take control. A lot of people tell me they
like what I say \Rbut\S that doesn't mean they won't vote for their
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Osborne's 17 losses in the month of November, 12 came against
Oklahoma. Reynolds' best chance would appear to be hiring Barry
Switzer to run his campaign. Reynolds rejects that fantasy
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an unsavory character, and I wouldn't be caught dead in
the same room with him,'' he said with a chuckle.

COWBOYS `EMBARRASSED' AS EAGLES ADD INSULT TO INJURIES

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys have more to worry about than just
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   They were sucker-punched in 109-degree heat at home Sunday in
the 2000 season opener, 41-14, by a Philadelphia Eagles team that
had lost on nine of its last 10 trips to Texas Stadium, and were
1-22-1 over the last three seasons away from Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys, this loss was even worse than that:
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman left the game in the second quarter with a mild
concussion after being sacked four times and heavily
pressured/knocked down four other times, while failing to complete
a pass in five attempts. This now replaces a 1989 rookie-season
game in which Aikman broke his left index finger after going
1-for-6 for 11 yards against the New York Giants, as his worst NFL
start.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway sprained his left knee late in the game and was on
crutches afterward. He will undergo an MRI exam today. His injury
could have a longer effect on when he can play next than Aikman's.
</P>
<P>
   This loss was only the 10th in 41 season openers for the
Cowboys, and tied the second-worst season-opening defeat, behind
only a 28-0 loss at New Orleans in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The game began _ are you ready for this? _ with a successfully
executed onside kick by Philadelphia to start the season, proving
that the Eagles' losing the coin toss was a bad thing only for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia recovered, scored on the drive to take a 7-0 lead
and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're embarrassed,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally embarrassed,'' owner Jerry Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with me,'' said Campo, who made his head-coaching
debut at any level Sunday. ``Obviously, I didn't have them prepared
to play today ... \Rand\S I ``will'' have them ready to play next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not on Dave's shoulders ... it's mine,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   But what wasn't debatable was how the Eagles totally dominated
the six-point favorite Cowboys, who were the ones getting all the
attention for unveiling their new timing-route offense and
unleashing a rotation-ready defense that had used preseason simply
to brush up on base packages.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out, the Cowboys couldn't stop the run (read:
Duce Staley rushed for 201 yards to become the first 200-yard
rusher against the Cowboys in almost 16 years, or since Buffalo's
Greg Bell in November 1984.)
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys couldn't protect the quarterback (read: Aikman
was sacked four times on nine passing plays, and Randall Cunningham
once, by an Eagles defense that was totally in character by
blitzing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``After this,'' Jones said, ``teams are going to blitz us like
we've never seen it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set early and often.
</P>
<P>
   The onside kick off the foot of second-year kicker David Akers
worked to perfection, finding a hole between Darren Hambrick and
Barron Wortham, and bounding the necessary 10 yards until Eagles
third-string wide receiver Dameane Douglas could pounce on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RCoach Andy Reid\S told me what we were going to try five
minutes before the game,'' Akers said. ``He said, `Hey, we're
playing to win, that's what that shows right there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wortham: ``The \Rkicker\S took this weird angle. I thought
to myself, `Onside kick?' then I thought, `Naw,' because he squared
up like he was going to kick it deep. So, I started to turn and
then saw him take that weird angle again. I froze for just a
second. By then, I was blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hambrick: ``\RThe ball\S came close enough, I guess. But
when you're not expecting it, you're not going to get it. We're
starting to release and go back to help on the return.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles went 58 yards in nine plays with Donovan McNabb
throwing his only touchdown pass of the game to tight end Jeff
Thomason. McNabb completed 16 of 28 for 130 yards and added another
29 yards with his scrambling
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first five possessions were four punts sandwiched
around an Aikman interception.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Eagles had the ball nearly 17 minutes to less than
seven minutes for the Cowboys. The score: Eagles 24, Cowboys 0.
</P>
<P>
   Only rookie kicker Tim Seder could put points on the board for
the Cowboys in the first half, with field goals from 34 and 38
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' lone touchdown didn't come until 8 minutes, 15
seconds remaining in the game, when Cunningham hit Galloway on a
quick post for a 4-yard touchdown. Cunningham and Rocket Ismail
hooked up for a two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Far too little, far too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be candid with you,'' Jones said, ``this \Rloss\S
diminishes how good we thought we were. We thought we were better
than this ... and I think we are better than this right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It just didn't show Sunday. nn

   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Dave Campo said he won't
second-guess himself about playing wide receiver Joey Galloway late
in the fourth quarter of a rout. Galloway sprained his left knee
with less than three minutes remaining in the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the injury was not initially known. Galloway,
who was on crutches after the game, was X-rayed, but results were
inconclusive. He will undergo an MRI test this morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned anytime you have injuries like that,'' Cowboys
owner and general manager Jerry Jones said. ``We are concerned
about Joey's injury.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys traded two first-round draft picks to Seattle for
Galloway, who signed a $42 million contract during the off-season.
The speedy wideout was supposed to complement Raghib ``Rocket''
Ismail and replace the retired Michael Irvin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Galloway was not a factor until late in the game. He had one
catch for 22 yards in the first half. He finished with four catches
for 62 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Galloway misses any games, James McKnight will likely be his
replacement. Wane McGarity is another possibility. McKnight and
McGarity each had one reception Sunday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
OFFICIALS EJECT WILLIAMS &QL; 
Right tackle Erik Williams had a game to forget Sunday. The
offensive line allowed five sacks and was ineffective all day. The
aggravation boiled over in the final minutes of the game when
Williams was ejected for throwing a punch at an Eagles player. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who held out for 28 days during training camp, had no
comment. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SEDER SUCCESSFUL &QL; 
Kicker Tim Seder proved to be the lone offensive highlight for the
Cowboys. The former school teacher made both of his field-goal
attempts, from 34 and 38 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the first time Seder kicked in a real game since Nov.
22, 1997, when he played for Ashland University against Slippery
Rock in the NCAA Division II playoffs. He missed his only attempt
that day from 42 yards. The last time Seder was successful on a
field-goal attempt came against the University of Indianapolis on
Nov. 8, 1997. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AIKMAN, SMITH STALLED &QL; 
Quarterback Troy Aikman made no progress in moving into the NFL's
top 20 for career passing yards. He remained 21st in league history
with 31,310 career passing yards, 238 yards behind John Brodie
(31,548). His five pass attempts puts him 18 shy of moving past Ken
Anderson into 20th on the NFL's career pass attempts list. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith's 29 rushing yards left him 8 yards shy of becoming
the third player in NFL history to rush for 14,000 yards in a
career. He will join Walter Payton and Barry Sanders. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL; 
The 109-degree temperature at game time set a Cowboys record, home
or away. They played in 101-degree heat on Sept. 7, 1997 at
Arizona. The Texas Stadium record was 99 degrees against the
Cardinals on Sept. 20, 1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jason Tucker's two-game streak of consecutive 100-yard receiving
games was stopped. Tucker closed the 1999 regular season with
back-to-back 100-yard games. Sunday, he did not line up at wide
receiver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kareem Larrimore became the first rookie to start a
season opener at cornerback for the Cowboys since Ron Francis
opened the 1987 season at St. Louis. &QL;

ORGANIZED CRIME STILL INFLUENCING NEW YORK'S CONSTRUCTION
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several months ago, New York City suspended more than
$80 million in contracts with a construction company that has a key
role in closing a regional landfill so that officials could
investigate allegations that the company had ties to organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The city's action against the company, Interstate Industrial
Corp., which has also worked on the city's new $71 million stadium
complex on Staten Island, attracted little attention. Yet it was
hardly an isolated case.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, two successive companies hired by the
city to supply concrete for the renovation of City Hall Park were
thrown off the job in two months because of similar suspicions. And
during construction of his high-rise apartment complex on
Manhattan's West Side in 1997, Donald Trump faced problems because
one contractor _ who was indicted in 1987 in a mob-related bribery
case _ provided substandard concrete that had to be replaced.
Another company on the job was owned by a man whom the FBI long
identified as a mob associate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite state and federal racketeering cases in the last two
decades that broke organized crime's monopoly in the construction
business in the New York area, the organized crime has remained
entrenched in the business, feeding off public works projects and
private developments, law enforcement officials and industry
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still many industries, including the construction
industry, that suffer from its insidious influence,'' said the
Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, who has
investigated construction industry corruption since the 1980s.
``The effect of the mob's continued involvement in these industries
is to impose a mob tax which raises prices and makes New York City
a less attractive place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Interstate, a city Sanitation Department
spokesman said the investigation would have no impact on the
scheduled closing of the landfill in December. But industry experts
said rebidding the work could add tens of millions of dollars to
the $500 million cost of closing it.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the city halted work on $31 million-worth of
Department of Sanitation contracts with Interstate, which is based
in Clifton, N.J. At least $30 million more in work that had been
awarded to the company but not yet started was also suspended, city
officials said. The city also suspended a $24 million contract with
the company for road construction in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Through its lawyer, Harold Ruvoldt Jr., Interstate denied that
the company or its owners, brothers Frank and Peter DiTommaso, had
ties to organized crime. Ruvoldt said Interstate was cooperating
with the city and expected to be cleared _ with the contracts
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and investigators said it was impossible to gauge
the extent of organized crime's continued role in the construction
industry, given the nature of its influence. Christopher Prather,
who oversees the organized crime task force for New York Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer, said that corrupt labor unions or individual
union officials were still central to organized crime's ability to
make money in construction, a $29 billion industry that accounts
for more than 7 percent of New York City's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Common schemes generally involve bribing union officials so that
a company can hire cheaper nonunion workers and forgo expensive
payments into pension, benefit and health and welfare funds. The
schemes violate wage laws, which require contractors on public
works projects and in some cases large private projects to pay
workers a set wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bound to be a few takers'' when a contractor can
drastically reduce his payroll costs through bribery, Prather said.
``Once you get a few takers, it puts pressure on an industry.'' he
added. ``Pretty soon, people who want to play by the rules finally
can't compete and it becomes a race to the bottom as far as who is
going to cheat the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Violations of New York wage laws are at the heart of an
extensive labor racketeering indictment expected to be unsealed in
Manhattan soon that names about three dozen union officials,
contractors and reputed mobsters, according to an investigator. The
indictment is based on a long investigation by Morgenthau's office
and the New York Police Department's Organized Crime Investigative
Division.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment will involve three different mob families in
construction projects around the city, said an investigator on the
case, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among those charged in
the case will be Steven Crea, 53, the acting boss of the Lucchese
crime family, who the authorities have said played a direct role in
many of the family's construction rackets, and two of his senior
aides, Dominick Truscello, 66, and Joseph Tangorra, 51, who is
known as Joey Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Police detectives have dubbed the case Operation Textbook
because they see it as a primer on labor racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment is expected to outline organized crime's
involvement in the construction of city schools in the Bronx and
Queens, and in projects built for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and the city's Department of Transportation, the
investigator said. In addition to the role of the Lucchese family,
one of New York's five Mafia families, the indictment also
implicates associates of the DeCavalcante family, a smaller mob
family based in New Jersey, and the Bonanno crime family.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Tangorra, who has been indicted in Brooklyn on
federal extortion charges, said Sunday that his client has never
been convicted of a crime and denied he has any times to organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Leighton, who represents Truscello, would not discuss the
charges expected in indictment, and Crea's lawyer could not be
reached Sunday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, New York City set up a computer database to screen
contractors and suppliers in an effort to weed out those with
histories of poor performance, corruption or ties to organized
crime, but problem companies have continued to receive contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Interstate, there was nothing in the database
that would have disqualified it from receiving city contracts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Interstate's problems began in October 1996, when the company
bought a transfer station for dirt and construction debris,
Metropolitan Stone Corp., which government documents say was owned
by one reputed member of the Gambino crime family and controlled by
another, Edward Garafola, 62, a figure in the area's construction
industry for more than two decades. Garafola is married to the
sister of Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia turncoat known as Sammy The
Bull, whose testimony sent John Gotti to prison for life.
Prosecutors say Garafola took over many of Gravano's construction
rackets when Gravano became a government witness.
</P>
<P>
   After purchasing the transfer station, the city's Trade Waste
Commission began reviewing Interstate's license application for the
transfer station and subsequently opened a criminal investigation
with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, investigators said.
Meanwhile, the authorities in New Jersey, who had been reviewing
the company's application for a license to perform construction
work at casinos in Atlantic City, issued a report raising questions
about possible ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report did not recommend denying the license, it
called for a hearing to explore concerns. Three days later, an
official with Interstate, Lawrence Ray, 40, was indicted on stock
fraud charges by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn after an unrelated
investigation. Garafola was charged with extortion as a result of
the same investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure intensified, and within weeks, the city suspended
its contracts with Interstate. Ruvoldt contended that Interstate
was being unfairly singled out, saying it was helping the city
clean up the transfer station by buying Metropolitan Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DiTommasos are getting tarred because they came to the
table as good guys and bought out a transfer station, helping the
city accomplish its goal, and this is simply unfair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Sunny Mindel, said,
``At this point, these are allegations which are being
investigated, and final decisions will be made upon completion of
the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, Interstate has done hundreds of millions
of dollars' worth of work in major private and public projects,
including concrete work on the stadium complex in Staten Island.
Michael Carey, the president of the New York City Economic
Development Corp., said Interstate had nearly completed $7 million
in work at the complex. Carey said that at the time the company was
selected, there was no reason to question its fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The DiTommaso brothers are the sons of a New York City police
officer, Anthony DiTomasso, who in the 1950s started L&AMP;T
Contracting with his brother, a city firefighter, according to
documents the brothers filed with the city. Among the jobs that
Interstate has completed, the documents said, are the control tower
at Kennedy International Airport, the new federal office building
in lower Manhattan and the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal
Courthouse in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Like the city, New York state has spent millions on construction
projects that have involved companies with alleged ties to
organized crime. In one case, Worth Construction Co. was awarded a
$20 million state contract to help build a hospital wing at the
Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a state prison for women in
Westchester County. The company, which also did $14.4 million in
work at the Triborough Bridge for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, is owned by Joseph Pontoriero, 60, who law enforcement
authorities contend is tied to the Genovese crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the State Division of
Criminal Justice Services, would not discuss how the contract was
awarded to Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Pontoriero was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the
Commission Case, a key prosecution in 1986 that helped break the
mob's stranglehold on the concrete industry. He was a regular
visitor to the Palma Boys Social Club in East Harlem in the 1980s,
where, according to the FBI, he often met and talked with Anthony
Salerno, then the crime family's boss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Worth, based in Bethel, Conn., was disqualified by the
New York City School Construction Authority's inspector general
from bidding on city school jobs because the company refused to
answer questions about accusations that Pontoriero and his company
were controlled by organized crime. The company did not return
telephone calls seeking comment, but in the past it has denied any
links to organized crime.

came after the Americans had apparently won the game, only to have
an official with the International Amateur Basketball Association
give the Soviets a second chance, ruling that the referees had not
set the clock correctly when the game ended the first time. The
Americans filed a protest, but to no avail, and they refused to
accept their silver medals. It was the first loss for the U.S.
men's team in Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   The American women have won three of the past four gold medals,
losing only to the Russians in the semifinals of the 1992 Olympics
in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Past heroes: Until professionals were allowed to represent their
country in 1992 in Barcelona, the American men's teams were
comprised of collegiate and amateur standouts. Bill Russell was the
center on the 1956 team in Melbourne, Australia; Jerry West and
Oscar Robertson were in the same backcourt in the 1960 Games in
Rome; Bill Bradley led the 1964 team in Tokyo. The greatest team of
all time was assembled in Barcelona when Larry Bird, Magic Johnson,
Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Scottie Pippen, Karl
Malone, Charles Barkley and John Stockton were teammates.
</P>
<P>
   No one has stood taller in the women's game than the ``Latvian
giant,'' Uljana Semjonova of the Soviet Union, who led her country
to the gold medal in the first women's Olympic basketball
competition in 1976 in Montreal. Semjonova, who was 6-10 1/2 and
284 pounds, towered over the competition and averaged more than 19
points and 12 rebounds, despite spending a great deal of time on
the bench. She might be the ``old lady'' on this year's team, but
in 1984 in Los Angeles, Teresa Edwards made her first appearance on
the women's Olympic team. She led the Americans in scoring in Seoul
in 1988 (16.6 points) and assists (eight per game) in Atlanta in
1996. She'll be looking for her fourth gold medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Checking the rules: Players may touch a ball while it is
bouncing on the rim. This would be offensive goaltending in the
NBA. The 3-point line is 20 feet, 6 inches from the basket, and
only the coach is allowed to call a time out.
</P>
<P>
   1996 medalists: Men: United States, Yugoslavia, Lithuania;
Women: United States, Brazil, Australia
</P>
<P>
   Best of the Yanks: Atlanta gold medalist Gary Payton will be
expected to provide the leadership for this American men's team
that lacks some of the big-name glitter of the first two Dream
Teams. Alonzo Mourning and Kevin Garnett are the biggest of a
relatively small front line, and Allan Houston and Ray Allen give
the United States offense from the guard position. Look for a lot
of 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best women's team ever fielded by the U.S. The
national team was named in 1995, thus these women have played a
great deal together in international competition and against one
another in the WNBA. Chamique Holdsclaw, Lisa Leslie, Sheryl
Swoopes, Ruthie Bolton-Holifield and Yolanda Griffith are
star-quality players. Teresa Edwards is a coach on the court, and
Swoopes, fresh off her fourth WNBA title, doesn't know how to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Rest of the blokes: There might be a smattering of players from
the NBA representing Croatia, Yugoslavia, Australia and Russia, but
even this watered-down U.S. Dream team should win handily. Luc
Longley and Chris Anstey give the Aussies the bulk to deal with
Mourning, Vin Baker and Garnett inside; Andrew Gaze is back again
to fire away from the perimeter. China has two 7-footers to clog
the middle. But if the United States loses, the players might want
to pursue free agency in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of women's basketball is improving dramatically, and
Brazil (silver in Atlanta) and Australia (bronze), are capable of
an upset. Look for the Aussies _ led by WNBA players Michele Timms
and Michelle Griffiths and young center Lauren Jackson _ to be
inspired playing in front of their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. medal chances: The U.S. men and women's teams are heavily
favored to bring home the gold. The world, however, is catching up,
and some of the games might be closer than expected. Of course for
the men, that could mean winning by 20 points instead of 35.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.: Oh, to be a fly on the wall listening to dinner
conversation at the men's camp in Hawaii. Seattle's Vin Baker
almost was traded to New York for Ewing, which would have made
Baker and Houston teammate. That's if Houston wasn't then traded as
some reports indicated would have happened. Instead, the trade fell
through and the winner was ... Olympic coach Rudy Tomjanovich. His
Houston Rockets signed free agent Maurice Taylor, who had wanted to
play with Ewing in Seattle. ... On second thought. Edwards said the
U.S. women's team was still ``head and shoulders better than
everyone.'' Then the retraction. ``Did I say `head and shoulders?'
'' Edwards said. ``I don't know if it's head and shoulders above.''
... Because his flight was canceled, Antonio McDyess (subbing for
the injured Tim Duncan) had to drive six hours from his Mississippi
home to Houston to sign his Olympic contract.
Spotlight on: The Dream Team
It's not the Dreams of the past, but it's still more than enough
for gold
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it's a Dream Team, if you're a basketball fan in
Estonia. But from an American perspective, it's difficult to
mention Dream Team III in the same sentence with its Olympic
predecessors. In fact, the U.S. women might be more worthy of the
designation than Rudy Tomjanovich's squad, which should at least
compensate for its lack of superstars with an entertaining style of
play.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we were spoiled in 1992 when Bird, Magic and Air Jordan
highlighted a team in which all 11 NBA players are probably headed
for the Basketball Hall of Fame. But Atlanta wasn't too shabby
either with David Robinson, Reggie Miller, Grant Hill, Hakeem
Olajuwon and Shaquille O'Neal playing for the first time. Now, it
appears that the novelty has worn off. Tim Duncan asked out because
of an injury. Hill pulled out, too, and Shaq wasn't interested. And
Kobe Bryant would rather spend the summer with his fiance and
reliving his NBA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rest of the world should take heed: the talent pool in
the NBA is so deep that the United States could send a team of
spares to the Olympics and win the gold. But that is not the point.
The first Dream Team included Christian Laettner, who was a
collegian at the time. The second team was comprised only of pros.
Perhaps the NBA and United States Olympic Committee can tinker with
the selection process again and include two or three collegians who
were selected in the first round of the NBA Draft. It would give
fans a sneak preview of these potential stars.
</P>
<P>
   Without O'Neal or Duncan, Alonzo Mourning will have to carry the
majority of the rebounding load in Sydney. Kevin Garnett and
Antonio McDyess are leapers, not bangers, and Vin Baker plays soft
for a power forward. Thus, Tomjanovich's plan is for the Americans
to run and exploit their quickness, with Jason Kidd and Gary Payton
directing the offense.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly will be the case when Mourning leaves Sydney on
Sept. 22 to fly home to Miami, where his wife will give birth.
Mourning will then make the exhausting flight back to Sydney. He
will miss two games and might be too tired to be a factor in the
rest of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   That could enable Vince Carter, who will remind fans in Sydney
of a young Michael Jordan, to put on a one-man show from his small
forward's position. The United States also has plenty of outside
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we are smaller on the front line than some of the
other countries like Australia, we play above the rim and we run,''
Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is the consummate point guard who will make sure everyone
gets his shots, but the question is, will games break down into a
series of one-on-one contests? Remember, Magic and Bird were
terrific passers who set the tone for the original Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   That tour de force in 1992 won by an average of 43.8 points; the
1996 team won by an average of 32.3. points. So the margin is
beginning to shrink, making some other countries Daydream
Believers.
</P>
<P>
   But remember this: The U.S. record in any competition with NBA
players on the roster is 60-0. It should remain perfect in Sydney.
The question is whether the best NBA players are losing interest in
participating in an event that most of the world's athletes can
only dream about?

NO SECOND-GUESSING ON GALLOWAY PLAY
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Dave Campo said he won't
second-guess himself about playing wide receiver Joey Galloway late
in the fourth quarter of a rout. Galloway sprained his left knee
with less than three minutes remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the injury was not initially known. Galloway,
who was on crutches after the game, was X-rayed, but results were
inconclusive. He will undergo an MRI test this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned anytime you have injuries like that,'' Cowboys
owner and general manager Jerry Jones said. ``We are concerned
about Joey's injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys traded two first-round draft picks to Seattle for
Galloway, who signed a $42 million contract during the off-season.
The speedy wideout was supposed to complement Raghib ``Rocket''
Ismail and replace the retired Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway was not a factor until late in the game. He had one
catch for 22 yards in the first half. He finished with four catches
for 62 yards.
</P>
<P>
   If Galloway misses any games, James McKnight will likely be his
replacement. Wane McGarity is another possibility. McKnight and
McGarity each had one reception Sunday.
OFFICIALS EJECT WILLIAMS Right tackle Erik Williams had a game to
forget Sunday. The offensive line allowed five sacks and was
ineffective all day. The aggravation boiled over in the final
minutes of the game when Williams was ejected for throwing a punch
at an Eagles player.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who held out for 28 days during training camp, had no
comment.
SEDER SUCCESSFUL Kicker Tim Seder proved to be the lone offensive
highlight for the Cowboys. The former school teacher made both of
his field-goal attempts, from 34 and 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the first time Seder kicked in a real game since Nov.
22, 1997, when he played for Ashland University against Slippery
Rock in the NCAA Division II playoffs. He missed his only attempt
that day from 42 yards. The last time Seder was successful on a
field-goal attempt came against the University of Indianapolis on
Nov. 8, 1997.
AIKMAN, SMITH STALLED Quarterback Troy Aikman made no progress in
moving into the NFL's top 20 for career passing yards. He remained
21st in league history with 31,310 career passing yards, 238 yards
behind John Brodie (31,548). His five pass attempts puts him 18 shy
of moving past Ken Anderson into 20th on the NFL's career pass
attempts list.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith's 29 rushing yards left him 8 yards shy of becoming
the third player in NFL history to rush for 14,000 yards in a
career. He will join Walter Payton and Barry Sanders.
BRIEFLY The 109-degree temperature at game time set a Cowboys
record, home or away. They played in 101-degree heat on Sept. 7,
1997 at Arizona. The Texas Stadium record was 99 degrees against
the Cardinals on Sept. 20, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Tucker's two-game streak of consecutive 100-yard receiving
games was stopped. Tucker closed the 1999 regular season with
back-to-back 100-yard games. Sunday, he did not line up at wide
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kareem Larrimore became the first rookie to start a
season opener at cornerback for the Cowboys since Ron Francis
opened the 1987 season at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Dat Nguyen was taken to the lockerroom at the
8:03 mark of the third quarter and was treated for dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline: G Al Jackson, CB Dwayne Goodrich (left
hamstring), DT Michael Myers, CB Charlie Williams (left knee), CB
Mario Edwards (left hamstring), LB Orantes Grant, G Kelvin Garmon,
WR Chris Brazzell.
INJURY REPORT

Will be reevaluated today.

PAC-10 FOOTBALL MAKES QUICK FIX OF TARNISHED REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a famous Californian who liked to dabble in football ratings
might put it, ``We don't have the Pacific-10 Conference to kick
around anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Former president Richard Nixon, who crowned Texas as his
personal champion in 1969 after The Shootout with Arkansas, played
a little ball at Whittier College. A Division III team, Whittier
was 0-9 last season, which would have made them a perfect fit in
the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with highly ranked Arizona's 41-7 pratfall at Penn
State and ending with one victory in five bowl games, the league
had a 1999 season to forget. Arizona coach Dick Tomey admits the
league lost some prestige.
</P>
<P>
   One full week into the season, and some of that prestige is
returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were real tired of hearing the myth that Pac-10
football was done,'' Southern California defensive tackle Ennis
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, coming off a desultory 4-7 season, pulled the first big
shocker of the 2000 season with its 35-24 mastery of Alabama in the
Rose Bowl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people didn't give us much credit,'' said UCLA coach
Bob Toledo, whose team went 10-2 in 1997 and '98. ``I don't know if
we're back, but I'm very excited right now for our football team
and the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Crimson Tide from third to No. 13 in The
Associated Press media poll and from third to No. 14 in the USA
Today''/ESPN coaches poll. Rating drops like those have cooled the
national-championship talk in 'Bama.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly didn't play like the third-best team in the
nation,'' said Alabama coach Mike DuBose, who went from sitting
pretty to the hot seat in zero to 60 minutes of substandard
defensive football.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' victory was a nice follow-up to crosstown rival
USC's 29-5 victory against Penn State in the Kickoff Classic on
Aug. 27. And while the Trojans' victory has been downgraded
slightly _ how good can the Nittany Lions be if they can't even
beat Toledo? _ those two victories have provided the Pac-10 with a
welcome image boost.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pac-10, UCLA and USC are similar to Texas and Texas A&AMP;M
in that the national perception of their conferences are tied to
their successes. Last season, UCLA and USC combined for 10
victories. When neither the Bruins nor the Trojans go bowling, the
Pac-10 is only a thin cut above the Mountain West Conference in
national perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to show the rest of the country that the Bruins
are back,'' said junior running back DeShaun Foster, who rushed for
a career-high 187 yards on 42 carries against Alabama. ``Hopefully,
we'll keep it rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the writers and coaches preseason polls, no Pac-10 team was
picked in the top 10. And while it is unlikely that the league will
produce a national-championship contender this season, the early
indications are that the Pac-10 will be better than last season.
</P>
<P>
   Most Pac-10 observers felt that this] Saturday's games would be
crucial to the league's image. Miami (Fla.) visits Washington, Ohio
State plays at Arizona, Colorado plays at USC, Oregon travels to
Wisconsin and Utah is at California. And while a few victories in
those games could provide some more buzz, UCLA and USC already have
done a nice job of carrying the Pac-10's banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of the players, and we all agree that we
want to make some noise on the national scene,'' Arizona State
senior linebacker Adam Archuleta said. ``Of course, it depends on
how good we play. If we play bad, we can't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, players in the Pac-10 can say about whatever they want.

BUSH ANNOUNCES ALTERNATE PLAN FOR DEBATES
</HEADLINE>
 (Adds 16th graf with quote from CBS spokeswoman)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Trying to end questions about his willingness to
debate and turn the tables on his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush
Sunday announced a schedule of three hand-picked debates that he
would do, only one of which is guaranteed to be broadcast on the
three major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointedly challenged Vice President Al Gore to meet him on
these chosen dates and terms, with the first debate on Sept. 12.
And he tried to turn Gore's response into a referendum on the vice
president's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has said he will debate anytime, anywhere, and he
has already accepted the debates that I am accepting today,'' Bush
said. ``It's important for the American people to be able to trust
the next president to keep his commitments, and therefore I take Al
Gore at his word that he will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal was a rebuff to the Commission on Presidential
Debates, which was created by both parties and has supervised the
presidential debates since 1988. That agency had proposed three
debates, all to be broadcast on the major networks, a plan Gore has
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who made his announcement at a hastily called news
conference on the lawn of the governor's mansion Sunday afternoon,
said he would debate Gore on a prime-time edition of NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' on Sept. 12, on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN on Oct. 3,
and in St. Louis on Oct. 17. The last debate, at Washington
University, was the only presidential commission debate accepted by
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The talk-show debates would last 60 minutes each, compared with
90 minutes for the commission debates.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Bush played video clips of Gore in
appearances with Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press'' in July and on
``Larry King Live'' in March in which he said he would be happy to
appear in debates on their shows. As the videos played, Bush stood
at a lectern tapping his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who learned of Bush's offer at a campaign appearance in
Philadelphia, instantly rejected it. His aides said that the
commission debates were the only ones likely to be carried by all
the major television networks and seen by the broadest television
audience possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore aide said that Gore would agree to the CNN and NBC
sessions _ but only if he also agreed to the three commission
debates. ``We've already accepted these,'' Chris Lehane, Gore's
spokesman, said of Bush's CNN and NBC debates. ``We have no problem
with these. We just want to make sure we do the three presidential
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   While the day's posturing was ostensibly over debates, it was
also an attempt by both campaigns to make a statement about the
opponent's character.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides have been suggesting that Bush is afraid of a
prime-time confrontation, raising the question of whether he is up
to the presidency. Bush was trying to plant the idea Sunday that
Gore is not a man of his word.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides also said that Bush was deliberately trying to shrink
the audience because unless there was blanket coverage on all five
networks, viewers would likely stray to other programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless these debates are road-blocked, you don't get the kind
of viewership you do with the commission debates,'' said one aide,
noting that Bush's proposal for the NBC debate would bump up
against popular shows like ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how much exposure the noncommission debates
proposed by Bush would get. Donald Evans, Bush's campaign chairman,
said that NBC and CNN had offered to make their videotape available
to other networks.
</P>
<P>
   An official of one of the rival networks said it was ``highly
unlikely'' that any network would broadcast a full debate that
carries with it the branding and identity of a competing news
organization.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for CBS News, Sandy Genelius, declined to say if
the network would broadcast a ``Larry King Live'' debate. ``The
candidates are obviously wrestling with how to serve the American
public, and once they work that out, we'll then figure out how we
can best serve the Ameri- can public,'' Ms. Genelius said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Gore campaign's reaction to Bush's debate
proposal, Karen Hughes, his director of communications, said,
``We'll be there and we'll see if Al Gore will keep his word.'' She
added, ``After eight years of prevaricating, after eight years of
`no controlling legal authority' and of debate over what the
meaning of `is' is, the American people deserve a president who
will keep his word.'' Hughes said she saw no reason why the
networks would not agree to broadcast all three debates as a public
service.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was just beginning a 24-hour Labor Day marathon tour
in Philadelphia, told reporters at Pat's Steaks, where he was
getting a cheese steak sandwich, ``I'm very disappointed in this
reaction because what's needed is to respect the rights of the
American people, to see the debates on all the networks in prime
time.'' He added: ``That's the way it's been done since 1988.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the commission debates, Gore said: ``It is a bipartisan,
nonpartisan tradition, and it's not about Governor Bush, it's not
about me, it's about the American people and giving the American
people the chance they deserve to make an informed judgment as to
who they want to be the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides replied that President Clinton himself had rejected
some of the commission's proposals in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The New York Times reported that Bush aides were
resisting the commission, because they did not want to commit to
three sessions that would be broadcast in prime time on the three
major networks. But the next morning, Bush told reporters that he
was not afraid of prime time. ``I want as many people to watch our
debates as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the one commission debate that Bush accepted, it
was not clear what the format would be. Evans said that still had
to be negotiated and that all the campaign had accepted was the St.
Louis venue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Sunday also said his campaign would agree to two
vice-presidential debates, one in Winston-Salem, N.C., sponsored by
the debate commission and another one in a forum yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is generally considered by political strategists to be a
weaker debater than Gore and his aides had been angling for
different formats. On Friday commission officials told aides to
Bush that they would not revise the locations of schedules for the
forums because the work was too far advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had selected the three formats because they would
be varied and because he wanted one debate on the West Coast.
``This will give the American people an opportunity to see the
candidates in a wide range of locations and formats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over debates has simmered, Bush has appeared on
the defensive, looking like he was seeking a better format for
himself. He and his aides were clearly trying to turn the tables
and use the struggle over debates to go after Gore's character and
make him look untrustworthy. After Bush's news conference, Hughes
reminded reporters that Gore had said he would debate anytime and
anywhere. ``We take him at his word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And on CNN, before Bush's news conference, Ari Fleischer, a Bush
spokesman, also noted that the vice president had been accepting
numerous debate offers. Fleischer said, ``I predict to you, they're
going to change their position all of a sudden again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued his challenge hours before flying to Chicago, where
he planned to begin the Labor Day kickoff of the general election
campaign. Polls show the race to be a dead heat or else give Gore a
slight lead. The debates are considered an important forum that
could well help undecided voters make up their mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his senior advisers had been saying for weeks that they
wanted to explore options beyond those proposed by the bipartisan
debate commission, because they felt that there could be other
debates of equal or greater value to voters.
</P>
<P>
   But one adviser conceded tonight that in selecting debates that
would be moderated by the journalist Tim Russert in one case and
the talk-show host Larry King in another, Bush was guaranteeing
that he would take questions from people who had quizzed him
before, and with whom he felt familiar
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist in Washington said that by spurning
two of the three commission debates, which would be more
structured, Bush was showing ``that he's concerned about filling
the full two-minute answer'' in a debate with formal time
parameters.

King. ``Larry will keep it moving.''

   But several of Bush's advisers said that while journalists were
sure to deride Bush's decision, most voters would care only about
the fact that Bush was debating and would find all the noise
surrounding the negotiations to be meaningless.

   ``We're not stupid. We've been looking at this,'' said one
adviser. ``Nobody knows who the commission is.'' &QL;

   DETROIT _ It wasn't 107 degrees in Detroit on Sunday. It was 78
degrees at game time, but intense humidity left manager Johnny
Oates concerned about starter Ryan Glynn. Oates even thought at one
point Glynn might be close to another one of his fainting spells.
</P>
<P>
   False alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fine the whole game,'' Glynn said. ``There was just one
time where I got a bug in my face, and I was trying to wave it
away, and \Rfirst baseman Frank Catalanotto\S thought I was shaking
off a spell. Frankie thought I was bugging out. But I wasn't
speaking gibberish. I was fine the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, in his second start since coming off the disabled list,
held the Tigers to one run on seven hits in 61/3 innings as the
Rangers won, 4-1. He walked one and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're so high on him; he was able to do what he did
today,'' Oates said. ``He pitched the ball extremely well.''
FOUR LIKELY TO BE CALLED
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are planning to announce their September call-ups
today, and four are expected to join them from Triple-A Oklahoma:
outfielder Ruben Sierra, shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt, pitcher Darwin
Cubillan and catcher Randy Knorr.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, a former three-time All-Star for the Rangers, is hitting
.326 with 18 home runs and 81 runs batted in, and Dransfeldt is
hitting .247 with eight homers and 42 RBI. Both aren't expected to
play much. Knorr is hitting .258 with six homers and 39 RBI and
would be recalled merely to give the Rangers an extra catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Cubillan, sent to Oklahoma on Tuesday, has a 3.86 ERA in seven
games with the Rangers. Oklahoma's last game is tonight, and the
call-ups are expected Tuesday in Chicago.
FIFTH SPOT, SOFT SPOT
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates used Ricky Ledee in the fifth spot Sunday, the
fourth time Ledee has batted fifth for the Rangers. The Rangers
have used nine players in the fifth spot: David Segui (67 starts),
Gabe Kapler (31), Ruben Mateo (17), Chad Curtis (5), Rusty Greer
(4), Bill Haselman (4), Dave Martinez (3), Frank Catalanotto (2)
and Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth hitter is supposed to protect the cleanup hitter,
Rafael Palmeiro, but the spot has given the Rangers mixed results.
The Rangers' No. 5 hitters, going into Sunday's game, had combined
to hit .314, the highest average from that spot in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   But they also had combined for 12 homers, tied with Baltimore
for the fewest, and 73 RBI, tied with Oakland for the third fewest
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what each team is getting from the fifth spot in the
order. Team Avg. HR RBI Anaheim .256 32 91 Baltimore .277 12 62
Boston .278 23 93 Chicago .274 18 91 Cleveland .285 34 98 Detroit
.252 21 89 Kansas City .266 18 87 Minnesota .284 13 66 New York
.290 23 87 Oakland .266 18 73 Seattle .268 17 96 Tampa Bay .254 16
79 Texas .314 12 73 Toronto .293 31 111
BRIEFLY Closer John Wetteland got the save Sunday, only his second
since July 25. But he has had only three opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are trying to win two in a row for the first time
since they won four in a row July 25-28. They have gone 35 games
without winning at least two in a row, the longest such streak in
club history.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Mike Lamb was 6-for-11 in the three games against
the Tigers.

GRASS FIELD TAKES A BEATING; FINES FOR HILLIARD AND DIXON; GARNES
KNOCKED OUT; LONGEST RUN IN 41 YEARS; ANOTHER STORMY DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The new grass at Giants Stadium had a
shaky NFL debut. After the portion down the middle of the field was
replaced last week, heavy showers Saturday apparently loosened some
of the sod. Two gaping pieces came out after a pileup caused by a
fumble by Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer late in the first half.
One resembled a New York City pothole.
</P>
<P>
   Officials spent some of their time patching the holes, and the
grounds crew tried halftime maintenance. A Giants Stadium worker
was tending to the field after fans left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was coming up,'' Giants offensive lineman Lomas Brown said.
``When they were fighting for that fumble, there were a lot of
divots.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiki Barber had no complaints. He said he loved running on grass
after accumulating 144 yards on 13 carries. Barber tore a knee
ligament on the old artificial turf here in 1997.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fines For Hilliard And Dixon
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers Ike Hilliard, a veteran starter, and Ron Dixon, a
rookie, missed practice Saturday and will be fined the team
maximum. Coach Jim Fassel said the players were staying together
and overslept until a team telephone call awoke them. Fassel
considered suspending them for the game but did not think that
would have been fair to their teammates, and he thought that not
starting but playing them would be ceremonial. Fassel discussed his
decision with the team captains before announcing the fines. He did
not disclose the amount of the fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking it lightly,'' Fassel said. ``I'm not happy with
it. They know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams walk through their plays on Saturdays as a final tuneup
for the game.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garnes Knocked Out
</P>
<P>
   Safety Sam Garnes sustained a concussion in a fourth-quarter
collision with Jessie Armstead and was taken to the Hospital for
Special Surgery in New York City for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead's right shoulder hit the left side of Garnes' helmet,
and the safety lay face down and motionless on the field for over a
minute. Fassel said Garnes lost consciousness for 30 to 40 seconds
and was still foggy afterward. He walked to a cart that drove him
off the field.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Longest Run In 41 Years &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiki Barber's 78-yard touchdown run was the longest for the
Giants since Frank Gifford ran 79 yards against Washington in 1959.
Hap Moran's 91-yard run against Green Bay in 1930 is the longest in
team history. Eddie Price ran 80 yards at Philadelphia in 1951. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Stormy Day
</P>
<P>
   The only other lightning delay in Giants Stadium football
history occurred in a Jets-Colts game in 1996. Kansas City played
host to Seattle and the league's last lightning delay in 1998. ...
The Giants are 4-0 on opening day under Fassel. They have lost the
next two games in each of his previous three years.

Kansas coach faces heat 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
As a drought-plagued summer gives way to a steamy September, there
is no escaping the heat for Big 12 football teams and coaches.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On-field temperatures topped 100 degrees for league teams in
venues as far south as Dallas and as far north as South Bend, Ind.,
during the first full weekend of action. But the telling heat, the
type that won''t subside with the advent of cooler temperatures,
surfaced yesterday in the football offices at Texas A&AMP;M, Colorado
and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies (0-1) and Buffaloes (0-1) dropped out of The
Associated Press' Top 25 rankings after dropping winnable season
openers to Notre Dame and Colorado State, respectively. Because of
emotional overtones surrounding both games, A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
and Colorado coach Gary Barnett will be hearing howls of discontent
from angry fans and alumni until they prevail in the next
``statement'' game on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The upside for both coaches is that A&AMP;M and Colorado showed
enough in defeat to suggest a bounce-back could be around the next
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, on the other hand, is reeling and may not rebound. The
Jayhawks lost what coach Terry Allen described as a ``red-letter
game for us'' and did it in dismal fashion by falling to SMU,
31-17, in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Allen, a fourth-year coach in search of his first
winning record at Kansas, the owner of the hottest coaching seat in
the Big 12 as of Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Jayhawks' amount of returning talent (17 starters)
from a 5-7 team, coupled with an influx of 10 junior college
signees to provide immediate depth, Kansas was expected to spend
the season jockeying for position with Iowa State and Missouri to
land a job-saving bowl berth for one of three embattled coaches in
the North Division.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Allen seemed like the logical pick to withstand the
North Division's version of ``Coaching Survivor'' during the 2000
season. Now, he's the front-runner to be voted off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Both Iowa State and Missouri won their openers, capitalizing on
matchups against weak nonconference opponents. But Kansas couldn't
counter. And, with the loss to SMU, it's hard to see where the
Jayhawks _ now 1-15 on the road in Allen's tenure _ will pick up
the six victories necessary to land one of seven guaranteed bowl
berths available to Big 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he was ``amazed'' by his team's inept performance in
a game he had publicly identified as a potential season-maker or
season-breaker. The night began with the announced suspension of
the team's best player, free safety Carl Nesmith, and included
three first-quarter gaffes in the punting game that gift-wrapped 17
points for the Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   After four possessions, SMU owned a 24-0 lead and coasted home,
leaving Allen perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever been as disappointed in one quarter
of football as I was out there,'' Allen said, referring to his
team's first-quarter meltdown in Dallas. ``We're not going to beat
anybody doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Jayhawks beat six teams between now and the end of
the regular season, expect a postseason coaching change. Early
feedback from players does not suggest a turnaround. One game into
the season, cornerback Andrew Davison sounds as if he's ready to
toss in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Davison registered his disgust with the loss to SMU, a Western
Athletic Conference also-ran, in yesterday's editions of ``The
Kansas City Star''. After the game, Davison said: ``Here we go
again, just like last year. There was all this hype about how good
we were supposed to be and now we've lost to a WAC team. If we're
supposed to be better, I didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Allen finds a way to reverse that sort of thinking, the
Jayhawks won't experience a reversal of fortune in 2000. That's why
the hottest seat in a sizzling September can be found in the
football coach's office at Kansas. nn

EMOTIONAL TESTAVERDE; PENALTY WOES 
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quarterback Vinny Testaverde felt the rush of emotion as he left
Lambeau Field and then he sat in his locker crying on Sunday, the
relief of his comeback checkered by memories of his late father Al,
who died in February 1999 and to whom he has dedicated the season.
With his 44 attempts, Testaverde passed Phil Simms to take over
15th place on the NFL's all-time pass attempts list.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's 23 completions also sent him past Simms into 18th
place and left him just three short of passing Jim Hart for 14th
place on the all-time completions list. Testaverde received a game
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any one point I thought, `I made it to this
point,'' &UR; ' &LR;  Testaverde said. ``This was probably one of my most
enjoyable victories.''
 &UR;  &LR; Penalty Woes
</P>
<P>
   If there was a downside to the Jets' performance, it was the
play of left tackle Jason Fabini. He was called for four of the
Jets' 10 penalties and accounted for 35 yards of penalties by
himself. It was an unusually error-prone effort by Fabini, who took
over the left tackle spot when Jumbo Elliott _ who has since come
out of retirement _ left after last season.
</P>
<P>
   One of Fabini's penalties nullified a play on which Wayne
Chrebet caught a touchdown pass. Fabini was benched after that, and
Kerry Jenkins, who started the game at left guard, played left
tackle while backup David Loverne played left guard.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini left the locker room quickly after the game and Coach Al
Groh would not say definitively that he would start Fabini next
week. Elliott, who was serving a one-game suspension this week,
will be available to play next week. ``We'll take some more
analysis,'' Groh said. ``No player is worth penalties.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE GATEWAY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   New York City has long held a special place in American life as
a metropolis that perpetually renews itself with waves of foreign
immigration. That has never been truer than today, when the city is
brimming with newly arrived residents.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a decade in which 1 million newcomers swept into
the city, 40 percent of New Yorkers are now foreign-born, the
highest level since 1910. The city is enriched by the immigrants,
but it also faces major challenges in helping to integrate them
fully into the life and economy of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier generations of immigrants who passed through Ellis
Island were largely from Europe. The fastest-growing groups these
days are from South Asia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the
nations born of the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In Queens alone 167 nationalities and 116 languages coexist.
That variety is one of New York's most distinctive traits. While
other cities tend to attract immigrants primarily from one or two
foreign regions, New York is a magnet for the whole world. The
immigrants come because of the city's reputation as a point of
entry and the presence of friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for immigration, the city's population would be
decreasing today. The newcomers culturally and economically
revitalize abandoned neighborhoods, and their presence bolsters the
economy and contributes to the tax base.
</P>
<P>
   But the surge has also brought a slew of challenges. Many
immigrants do not speak English, and long lines of people are
turned away from the too-few English classes sponsored by nonprofit
organizations and community colleges. The inability to speak
English keeps immigrants in very low-paying jobs. Many Mexican and
Dominican immigrants, for instance, earn less than $20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a shortage of affordably priced housing has led to
overcrowding in poor areas. It is not uncommon in some Bronx
neighborhoods for four or more people to live in a single room.
Schools are also inadequate in these neighborhoods, with
enrollments straining already sparse resources.
</P>
<P>
   Because newly arrived immigrants are not eligible to vote _ and
turnout is low among those who have become citizens _ many of these
problems do not receive the attention they deserve from political
leaders. Naturalized citizens should be encouraged to register to
vote and local politicians need to make more effort to reach out to
these traditionally ignored populations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, immigrants are often unaware of the programs that
do exist to help them. Public housing aid and child health
insurance, for example, are not widely used by immigrants who are
eligible for them. Many immigrants use emergency medical care, but
also rely on unlicensed community clinics, in part because they are
unaware of the dangers associated with such clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty rates among immigrant populations are high, and if
current problems are allowed to grow, they could lead to a
permanent underclass of immigrants. With the city's foreign-born
population expected to grow even larger in the years ahead, the
health of the city will depend in no small measure on how
successfully it absorbs its newest residents.

EDITORIAL: FINGERPRINTS FOR MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   New York was among the first states to require electronic
fingerprinting of welfare recipients as a way to prevent fraud. But
as Nina Bernstein of The New York Times reported last week, there
is little solid evidence that finger imaging actually deters
welfare fraud, particularly when stringent work rules, shortened
eligibility times and other anti-fraud measures are already pushing
people off public assistance rolls at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a study conducted for the state three years ago found
that finger imaging made no difference in the approval or dropout
rates of welfare recipients. Yet despite that finding, state
officials are still pushing this strategy, and they are seeking
approval for $9.9 million to extend a contract with a finger
imaging company an additional year, to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The state now wants to expand electronic fingerprinting to
440,000 adults who qualify for Medicaid, a proposition that makes
even less sense than fingerprinting welfare recipients. Few
patients are likely to seek extra medical treatment by posing as
two people. In fact, Medicaid fraud is largely committed by doctors
and other health care providers, a problem this measure does
nothing to address.
</P>
<P>
   Finger imaging will merely intimidate some Medicaid applicants
or cause them to stay away because of privacy concerns. The process
for getting Medicaid is already complicated and difficult. New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other officials are putting
together campaigns to encourage eligible uninsured individuals to
enroll in Medicaid. This is no time to erect a useless, expensive
hurdle that may dissuade low-income people from getting the care
they need.

EDITORIAL: QUARRELING OVER MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Richard Cheney provided further evidence of the
divide between the two main presidential candidates on
environmental issues when he criticized the Clinton administration
for the way it has been designating millions of acres of public
land as national monuments, thereby protecting them from mining and
other forms of commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican vice presidential nominee did not, as originally
reported, threaten to ``rescind'' these monument designations, nor
did he say that he would ask Congress to do so. Under law, only
Congress has the power to roll back a designation.
</P>
<P>
   However, he made one telling remark that has annoyed the White
House while reinforcing the impression that a Bush administration
would be much more reluctant than Clinton has been to use federal
power to expand wilderness protections.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney charged that Clinton had used his authority ``willy-nilly
all over the West'' without consulting local residents or
accommodating their needs. Clinton has designated 11 monuments _
the first encompassing 1.7 million acres in Utah's canyonlands, the
latest protecting 197,000 acres of the Hanford Reach, the last
undammed stretch on the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's remarks suggested that in these and other designations,
Clinton had undermined private property rights. But in fact the
land in question already belonged to the federal government. A
monument designation simply gave it a higher level of protection
against future intrusions by, say, the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, has spent
weeks talking to local residents. The interests of existing
stakeholders, mainly ranchers with grazing allotments, have been
largely preserved.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true, however, that a monument designation is a
quintessentially federal act, imposed from above by the executive
branch. Although that is just what Congress intended in 1906 when
it passed the Antiquities Act, giving the president unilateral
authority to rescue historic sites imperiled by congressional
inaction, recent Republican presidents have resisted using it.
Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush are the only chief executives
since 1906 not to designate at least one monument.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush is on that wavelength. He says he sees an
important federal role in conservation, but mainly as a manager of
existing parks and wilderness areas and as a ``partner'' in local
conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, by contrast, is prepared to use federal powers
pre-emptively to protect additional lands from development, and
presumably Gore would do the same. It is that expansive view of the
federal role, as much as anything, that prompted Cheney's
criticism.

</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems as though summer is just three days long:
Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day. Where the rest of
summer goes is anyone's guess, but such is the headlong life we
live.
</P>
<P>
   Summer was once an endless tract of time. Now, there is one day
to set out the lawn furniture, one day to sprawl on it, and one day
to put it away and get out the Christmas tree stand while you're at
it.
</P>
<P>
   The last of those days has come. The ark of one's leisure is
about to run aground. The September fashion bibles _ fat as phone
books _ are already on the newsstand. School buses are already on
the road. A chill is in the air, or so they are saying somewhere
much farther north.
</P>
<P>
   But Labor Day is really the beginning of a short season all its
own, an in-between time, a month of not-quite-summer, not-yet-fall.
That season, whatever you call it, often feels more like the new
year than the New Year itself _ new books, new exhibitions, new
music, new commitments, and never mind that it has all been in the
planning for months.
</P>
<P>
   The city is full again and no longer in dishabille. The leaves
are still green. None of the races, pennant or political, have been
run to the wire just yet. Night closes in on both ends of day, and
still on fair evenings the light seems to linger. The subways begin
to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in this strange, short season, the days seem to flock
together, as if they were about to begin their migration, like a
flight of doves. There are only a few weeks before fall is really
here and summer is indisputably absorbed into the past. Perhaps
what makes the short season after Labor Day so pleasing is the fact
that we catch only glimpses of it on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time we should take off from work _ only we never do
_ to watch summer and fall collide, to feel the sharp nights and
the warm days, to walk through a garden that is ripening and dying
all at once. In the country, a morning will come soon enough when
all the gnats have disappeared, a sign that this short season is
over.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is now 23 matches and counting, but Venus Williams
did not know much about her winning streak until a reporter
mentioned it to her last week.
</P>
<P>
   After showing a trace of vulnerability in her third-round match
Friday against Meghan Shaughnessy, the third-seeded Williams
eliminated Magui Serna, 6-2, 6-2, in 53 minutes Sunday to advance
to the quarterfinals. Her victory came after she waited around the
National Tennis Center for more than five hours during two rain
delays and wound up playing yet another late-afternoon match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty disappointing,'' Williams said. She passed the
time by nibbling on food every hour. ``I'll never get away from
this place,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she wants to do so anytime soon. ``In the first couple
of rounds I was not playing well,'' Williams said. ``But I feel
more warmed up and in a groove, more ready to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with her serve in the third round, Williams was
much more efficient Sunday, winning 74 percent of her first-serve
points. She also had 24 winners to Serna's five.
</P>
<P>
   The last match Williams lost was to Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in
the quarterfinals at the French Open. But Williams will not get a
rematch because the eight-seeded Nathalie Tauziat defeated
Sanchez-Vicario, who was seeded ninth, in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never been one of my goals to have a winning streak, so
this is nice,'' said Williams, whose streak includes her run to the
Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did make it clear that one of her goals is avoiding a
battle of the sexes. After John McEnroe said that any male college
player or senior player could beat Venus or her sister, Serena, a
volley of words ensued, prompting Donald Trump to propose a $1
million match between either sister and McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that back in the '70s, Billie Jean King did it the
right way,'' Williams said, referring to King's match in the
Astrodome against Bobby Riggs. ``Right now I'm just really focusing
on trying to win this U.S. Open more than anything, just have a
good result here, just competing with the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some later date,'' Williams added, ``I'll be ready to think
about competing with men. At this point, I'm ready to just play the
Open.'' &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;  Richard Williams, her father, al- ready said that neither she nor
Sere- na would participate anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Richard was a smart guy and this only reinforces that
fact,'' McEnroe said Sunday. ``Richard knows it's best to keep his
daughters away from Johnny Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, McEnroe added, ``By the way, Trump's offer was a
good start.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Garden To Munich
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Tennis Association Tour will sever its 29-year
affiliation with Madison Square Garden after this year and hold its
year-end championships in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The Chase Championships, a weeklong event beginning Nov. 13 this
year, will move to Germany and begin three weeks earlier, in
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden's contract with the WTA was up after this year, and
while the Garden made a bid to renew the deal, the WTA made an
agreement with Munich officials worth about $1 million more prize
money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing,'' said Joel Fisher, senior vice
president of MSG Sports. ``We would have loved them back. We made
what we felt was a very fair offer, but we couldn't go any further
and we had to make the correct business decision. They felt they
had a better offer.''
</P>
<P>
   This will not mean the end of women's tennis in the Garden.
Fisher said the Garden was negotiating to establish an annual
exhibition with six of the top women's players at about the same
time in November, but for fewer days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel that in the end it will work out well,'' Fisher
said. ``We're pretty far along in our discussions and agreement.
We're proceeding forward as if we were having an event. I think
we're going to start asking players now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Garden are trying to negotiate with
International Management Group, which works with several top
players, including Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport and
Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   While Seles will play the coming Chase Championships in New
York, she will not play in them next year in Munich because she has
not played a tournament in Germany since being stabbed by a fan
during a crossover in a Hamburg tournament in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament will be an exhibition because the WTA season will
have already ended. Fisher said he hoped the top players would be
attracted by the prize money and the opportunity to play in the
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the draw will be,'' he said. ``We feel the
responsibility for the fans in New York, and we think that major
women's tennis is on a real upswing. It's bittersweet, but it's
also very exciting, and a new opportunity.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hits The Town
</P>
<P>
   Hyung-Taik Lee, the surprise fourth-round opponent of Pete
Sampras Monday, went on an afternoon escapade through Flushing's
Korean section Sunday after he practiced at the National Tennis
Center. At two restaurants, owners and staff showed him respectful
attention.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee, 24, a qualifier from Seoul, South Korea, walked into
the Korean-owned sushi restaurant Nam Sam, the owner quickly called
up her friends, who soon arrived en masse to get Lee's autograph.
After hors d'oeuvres there, Lee and his coaches went down Northern
Boulevard to Kum Kang San to eat Korean barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was ranked No. 182 in the world entering the Open, is
the first Korean man to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam. In
1981, a Korean woman, Duk Hee Lee, advanced to the fourth round of
the U.S. Open before losing to Hana Mandlikova. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Wet And Left Out
</P>
<P>
   For some fans, Sunday's rain was more than an exercise in
annoyance. After enduring two rain delays and waiting until Marat
Safin finally finished off Sebastien Grosjean in the fifth-set
tiebreaker, fans waiting for Venus Williams heard announcements
that her match against Magui Serna would be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Officials moved her match to Louis Armstrong Stadium, giving
people little time to scurry next door. Within minutes, Armstrong
was close to capacity, and some fans were angry about being shut
out of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Officials moved the match to clear Arthur Ashe Stadium for the
featured night match, Jennifer Capriati against Monica Seles,
ensuring that if there was another rain delay during Williams'
match, she could finish it without upsetting the night schedule.
Seles went on to defeat Capriati, 6-3, 6-4. &QL;

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ All around the National D-Day Museum, which landed
here on June 6, an invasion of art is refashioning New Orleans'
once forlorn warehouse district into a chic enclave of culture and
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Old cotton mills and warehouses that stockpiled cargoes from the
Mississippi River as far back as the 1830s are being transformed
into art galleries, artists' studios, lofts, hotels, cafes and
restaurants in an expanding area of some 50 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   A museum of Southern art is rising near a former German brewery
that tells the story of the victory over Hitler, and an old
industrial building is being turned into artist studios, antidotes
to the crime that long plagued the derelict warehouse district,
which is sandwiched between the French Quarter and the Garden
District.
</P>
<P>
   While it began as a renewal district bounded by Poydras Street
and Howard Avenue from Convention Center Boulevard to Magazine
Street, by some definitions its western boundary has been pushed
back close to the Superdome, almost doubling its territory and
taking in much of the business district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was skid row,'' said Donna Perret, director of Galerie
Simone Stern, one of the early arrivals. She recalled warily
walking the district's streets. ``I had a guard to make sure I
wasn't mugged and could get to my car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now gallery hopping in the warehouse district is joining the
city's traditional infatuations with dining and jazz. In an
open-house program called ``Art for Art's Sake,'' the 20 or so
galleries sprinkled around Julia Street stay open late on the first
Saturday of each month.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of revelers converged on the district on Aug. 5 for
the sixth annual White Linen Night, featuring gallery receptions
and (this being New Orleans) street music and cash bars,
culminating in a party at the Contemporary Arts Center, a converted
pharmaceuticals warehouse that became a home for visual and
performing arts programs in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   There was ample cause for celebration, said Patricia Gay,
executive director of the Preservation Resource Center, a private
nonprofit organization that has been guiding the revival from an
1832 town house on Julia Street. ``Whatever we do, we end up having
a party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing frivolous about much of the art on display.
One prime showcase, the Arthur Roger Gallery on Julia Street,
featured the patterned paintings of Robert Gordy, the fanciful
sculptures and paintings of Ida Kohlmeyer and the work of the
Shreveport sculptor Clyde Connell, known for her totemic figures.
</P>
<P>
   It also recently showed giant granite monoliths sculptured by
Jesus Bautista Moroles of Rockport, Texas, who was featured in a
show of Hispanic artists at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, in New
York, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Many industrial districts, from SoHo in New York to the
downtowns of Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Newark, N.J., can claim a
certain amount of revival sparked by arts projects. But the
comeback here seems at least partly attributable to a commercial
debacle: the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition nearby at the
riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal-tainted fair, with accusations of improprieties,
including kickbacks, lost $130 million when expected crowds failed
to materialize. But by forestalling other development while drawing
architectural talent to the city, the flop appears to have planted
seeds for today's preservation and redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the fair was an economic failure, it revitalized
the district,'' said Lea Sinclair Filson, director of public
relations for the ultraluxurious Windsor Court Hotel downtown, not
far from the district. (In 1998 Conde Nast Traveler called it the
best hotel in the world.)
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, an architect, recently moved into a
warehouse that they renovated. ``It brought locals back to the
river, like a renaissance,'' she said. ``We have fond memories of
the world's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Success, when it came, seems to have priced out many artists.
``We never went through the loft phase,'' said Gay, contrasting the
New Orleans experience with that of, say, New York, where artists
colonized cheap manufacturing lofts, only to be priced out by the
gentrification they had engendered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some artists have taken up residence in the warehouse
district, which abuts (some would say encompasses) another historic
district, Lafayette Square. ``We just sort of discovered it,'' said
Ellen Pincus, a jeweler whose work in silver and gemstones is on
display in Ariodante, a crafts gallery on Julia Street.
</P>
<P>
   She and her boyfriend, who both moved here in February from
Chicago, pay $920 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in a
converted cotton mill on Poeyfarr Street. She said they would like
more space but find the rents steep.
</P>
<P>
   But she said they love the warehouse district and the
opportunities. They were promptly put on a jury for the independent
film festival at the Contemporary Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chicago I couldn't have gotten on a jury,'' she said.
``It's like they were thanking us for just showing up. It's very
bizarre here, actually.'' But best of all, she said, she sold some
earrings to the novelist Anne Rice, who has a house in the Garden
District.
</P>
<P>
   Two other big openings in the warehouse district are set for
next year: the Ogden Museum of Southern Art of the University of
New Orleans, housing one of the largest such collections in the
nation, and Louisiana ArtWorks, a 78,000-square-foot complex of
ateliers and demonstration studios for artists inside the preserved
shell of the old Bradford Furniture Store, put up before World War
I.

 &UR; NEW ORLEANS: War I. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Ogden, being built around 1,200 works donated by
the philanthropist and businessman Roger H. Ogden, has opened a
temporary site two blocks away on Julia Street. One recent
exhibition featured artists' views of daily life in the South
during World War II, a show intended to mesh with themes at the
D-Day museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Ogden's new director, J. Richard Gruber, who came from
Atlanta, where he was founding director of the Morris Museum of
Southern Art, said the gallery scene was already more concentrated
here than in Atlanta and benefited particularly from the strong
emotional draw of the D-Day museum.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the biggest sign of the turnaround is the D-Day
building, a reconstruction of the Weckerling Brewery. Built in
1887, it has been expanded to 70,000 square feet at Magazine Street
and the former Howard Avenue, which was recently renamed Andrew
Higgins Drive in honor of the New Orleans shipbuilder who produced
the war's crucial 20,000 invasion boats.
</P>
<P>
   With its stark wartime artifacts and mixed-media exhibitions,
the museum has proved so popular, particularly with World War II
veterans and their families, that it issues timed-entry tickets to
ease the flow of 1,300 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   A second phase of construction is expected to expand the
museum's scope to the Pacific war, with the opening of a
5,000-square-foot exhibition scheduled for Dec. 7, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom has its downside. ``We recently lost two artists
because someone bought the building,'' said Perret, the gallery
director. ``They had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a far cry from the problems of old, as remembered
by Beverly Gianna, vice president for public affairs at the
Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. It was not so long
ago, she said, that the population of the warehouse district
numbered two, both of them living on the street. Now, she said,
some 5,000 people have moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Perret of Galerie Simone Stern noted that ``crime is down
because people are stabilizing the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a patina,'' she said. ``It's settled. It's
going to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Perret said she found the warehouse district more alluring even
than the somewhat larger French Quarter that remains the city's
biggest tourist draw. ``I love the Quarter like a village,'' she
said. ``But there's an energy here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEWATER, Vt. _ A couple of years ago, a very wealthy couple
finished building a very large house in this southern Vermont
hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   It was truly a fine house, built of stone, nearly 13,000 square
feet, set on 460 acres near the top of Stonegate Mountain, with
panoramic views of verdant Vermont wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a house so large and so fine, in fact, that when it came
time to bill its owners for property tax, the town's Board of
Listers, as assessors here are known, put its value at about $6
million, a nearly unheard-of sum in a modest rural state where log
cabins are still far more common than starter mansions.
</P>
<P>
   That's not fair, protested the property owners _ Jim P. Manzi,
former head of Lotus Development, whose stock in the company was
worth $78 million when IBM bought the business in 1995, and his
wife, Glenda _ faced with an annual property tax bill of more than
$100,000. (Or rather, their lawyers said it.) The house may have
cost nearly $6 million to build, they asserted, but it is so
idiosyncratic that no buyer would ever pay so much for it. The
value of a property, they argued, is what it would bring on the
market. They set the house's value at less than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   No, responded the Bridgewater listers. Under a Vermont Supreme
Court ruling, cost is a valid measure of such a property's value,
they argued; plus, by their calculations, $6 million was close to
what recent sales of comparable property indicated the house would
bring if sold. An insurance company appraisal also coincided with
the $6 million figure. It was unheard-of, they said, but it was
right, particularly in a super-charged economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years or so, Vermont has become like the
coast of Maine was _ the super-rich are starting to discover it,
and we are seeing that happen here,'' said Thomas K. Standish,
chairman of the three-person Board of Listers. ``We're the first to
confront the fact that very high-end properties are scarce as hen's
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the Manzis' claims, the home's features as described by
the listers sound luxurious but hardly eccentric: seven fireplaces,
radiant heat in the floors, stonework in the bathrooms and beams
from old barns used in some of the construction.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Manzis' third home, according to the listers.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, is now about two years old, with another hearing
scheduled next week, but this much is clear: in a boom-time of
got-rich-quick millionaires indulging their house fantasies, such
tussles abound from the mountains of Vermont to the shores of Puget
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bill Gates briefly questioned the assessors' estimate
that the 40,000-square-foot high-tech mansion his Microsoft
billions built near Seattle was worth more than $50 million, saying
no one else would pay such a price. He later withdrew the
objection, and the assessment has since risen to about $110
million, putting his annual property tax at over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, Michael Dell, the Dell Computer mogul, challenged
his county property-appraisal office in Austin because it said his
new 33,000-square-foot home was worth more than $22 million; he
maintained it was worth no more than $5 million or $6 million. The
two sides reached a compromise of $12 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there may be several hundred such disputes about
extra-luxurious houses under way around the country, said Dick
Netzer, a professor of economics and public administration at New
York University and an expert on property taxation. And the
conflicts are not limited to houses: in a classic tax case, he
noted, the owners of the New York Stock Exchange argued decades ago
that it should not be assessed at what it cost to build, because it
had virtually no value to anyone but the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In towns like Bridgewater, with a population of about 960 people
mainly of modest means, these tax conflicts can take on a tinge of
David versus Goliath, with the town's resources looking decidedly
David-sized next to a homeowner with millions. Studies on other
regions have found that the fanciest of houses are routinely
under-assessed, both because it is hard to place a value on unique
properties and, some say, because towns lack the resources to fight
legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   When towns are challenged, ``They very frequently give way on
legal battles about property taxes and zoning, in order to avoid
the costs of litigation,'' Netzer said. ``It happens all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But not in Bridgewater. Standish and his two fellow listers,
elected officials paid $9 an hour for their time, have devoted more
than 1,000 hours, they estimate, to fighting the Manzis' appeal,
and they show no signs of flagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that the rich don't know what they're doing with
their money, and will build toys they'll never get their money back
out of, is not a credible one, in our opinion,'' Standish said.
</P>
<P>
   Manzi, through his Boston lawyer, Michael Lynch, declined
comment on the dispute. Lynch provided only this written statement:
``All property taxes assessed against the Manzis' Bridgewater
property have been timely paid and will continue to be paid in the
future. Any further comment would be inappropriate in light of the
pending litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Lee, the chairman of the town Board of Selectmen, said
that Vermont's recent property tax reform is already hurting
Bridgewater, and cases like the Manzi's fuel an anger among
old-style Vermonters that is visible these days in the thousands of
``Take Back Vermont'' signs spotting the state's roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``People born in Vermont are having to give up their properties
because of the tax rate being rammed down their throat by people
who are like the Manzis,'' he said. ``It's happening in Colorado,
it's happening in Maine'' he added. ``You should see what's going
on there. The gentrification and the tastelessness _ and the
disregard of the local guy.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush kicked off a heated
political debate when he declared that two of the Army's 10 active
divisions were ``not ready for duty, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he wanted to highlight the complexities of measuring
military readiness, however, he could have looked closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard _
nominally under the governor's command _ has the lowest ranking for
war-time readiness that the Pentagon gives, according to military
officials. It has been that way for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Pentagon disputes that its active-duty forces
are not ready for combat, the 49th Guard Division's case reveals a
far more difficult question about the overall state of the American
military. It involves an arcane, sometimes subjective readiness
accounting system that can be misleading and is not easily reduced
to the sound bites of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush and his running mate on the Republican ticket, Dick
Cheney, the former defense secretary, who has joined heartily in
the criticism, do not dispute that the American military is
technologically advanced, highly trained and well equipped.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, and one that the candidates on both sides
have only glanced on, is how the next administration intends to
prepare its forces, and for what and where.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not if you're ready,'' as a senior military officer at
the Pentagon put it, ``it's what you're ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in assessing the state of today's military is
that the Pentagon's system for measuring readiness ultimately
measures only one thing: fighting a major ground war with air and
naval support. Any units doing anything else _ and thus not
preparing for that worst case _ can run afoul of the system's
subjective but merciless readiness classifications.
</P>
<P>
   And so the two divisions cited by Bush _ the 10th Mountain and
the 1st Mechanized Infantry _ were briefly classified as unready
for war last fall, not because they suffered from budget cuts and
low morale, as Bush suggested, but rather because large parts of
the divisions were keeping peace in Bosnia and Kosovo, according to
Army and Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that it counts if you're training to fight Saddam,
but doesn't count if you're actually deploying deterring Milosevic
or containing conflict in the Balkans is a strange artifact of our
national military strategy, and makes little sense,'' said Michael
O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institute in
Washington who has informally consulted for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the 49th Guard Division in Texas, the meager readiness
rating it holds may not be the best indicator of its ability to
conduct military operations. According to the Pentagon's system,
the 49th is unfit to fight a war. Since March, however, nearly 700
men and women of the 49th, including its headquarters company and
most of its commanders, have overseen the American sector of NATO's
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and, by all accounts, doing it
well.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the 49th is sending roughly 300 more combat troops to
Bosnia. In October, the Texas Air National Guard is sending the
unit Bush once served in, the 111th Fighter Squadron, to patrol the
no-fly zone over southern Iraq, where American pilots are routinely
responding to Iraqi antiaircraft fire with air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of combat the unit never saw when Bush trained as
a fighter pilot in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Pentagon's accounting system serves a purpose,
which is to prioritize dollars for the armed services and their
combat units. The system's ratings are based on the national
military strategy, which since Cheney was secretary of defense has
called on the military to be prepared to fight and win two major
regional wars _ for example, in the Persian Gulf and on the Korean
peninsula _ at nearly the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On that scale, the Pentagon's latest quarterly readiness report
to Congress, issued last week, concluded that ``most major combat
and key support forces are ready to meet assigned taskings,
although there are force readiness and capability shortfalls that
increase risk in executing operations.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hillen, a retired Army captain who has served as a defense
policy adviser to the Bush campaign, said, ``These things are so
eminently capricious and fungible that the readiness ratings are
not really significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a lawyer,'' Hillen said, ``you could say that,
technically, both sides are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the two-war scenario, the Army would need all 10 of its
active divisions, supplemented by units from the Army Reserve and
the National Guard, to satisfy the plans. That is the standard by
which the divisions are measured for readiness, but it is one that
ignores how the Army is using its forces today, and how it is
likely to keep doing so, whoever is elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity of the readiness measuring system is that forces
involved in actual military operations score lower under it. After
the Persian Gulf War in 1991, several Air Force squadrons returned
home only to be classified as unready since they had not been doing
the training that had to be checked off to qualify as ready. Never
mind that those squadrons had just returned from waging one of the
most successful air campaigns in history.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Army is keeping peace in Bosnia or Kosovo, or
conducting exercises in Kuwait, or fighting fires in the Western
United States, those units will not be doing what it takes to meet
the system's highest standards for the war plans. After an extended
peacekeeping mission, for example, it can take months for units to
regain the highest level of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You face very different scenarios in a peacekeeping mission,''
said one Army officer involved in monitoring readiness. ``You're
not going to move, attack and defend the way you have to in the
war-fighting mission. Those are skills that have to be practiced
over and over again until they're almost subconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army, like the other services, has begun to address the
problem by relying more heavily than ever on the National Guard and
Reserves. But because the Army's eight Guard divisions are not, for
now, in the nation's war plans, they have received a lower priority
when it comes to financing for equipment and training. The Army
does not expect them to be at the highest level of readiness.
</P>

 &UR; AUSTIN, Texas: of readiness. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Guard's 49th Division slipped to the lowest level three
years ago because of shortages in training time, equipment and
personnel, according to officials in Texas and Washington. Even
though he is commander in chief of the Texas National Guard, Bush
has little impact on the 49th's readiness, since the state provides
only 5 percent of the Guard's budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the 49th's deployment to Bosnia has freed up another
division to concentrate on the war mission. By the time the 29th
Infantry Division from Virginia takes over the American sector in
Bosnia, almost all the American troops in Bosnia will be
reservists, compared with 25 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has gone even further, proposing to include Guard
divisions in the war plans. That would relieve the strain on the
active divisions, but it could cost billions of dollars since the
Guard divisions would have to bring themselves up to a higher level
of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   So far in the campaign, neither Bush nor his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has proposed ways to address the
fundamental problems, at least as measured by the traditional
readiness accounting system. Bush has proposed increasing the
modernization budget by $20 billion to design, building new weapons
systems, and raising pay and benefits by $1 billion, or nearly $750
for each person in uniform. Gore, too, has proposed increasing
benefits for the troops.
</P>
<P>
   While those address problems like increasing morale or creating
new weapons, they do little to fix the problems outlined by Cheney
this week. Daily needs like spare parts and training rarely receive
attention from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And no one in either campaign has talked about the easiest
solution. If the next administration decided to change the national
military strategy, concluding that two major wars were not very
likely to happen at once, the question about whether forces are
ready would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix the problem,'' Hillen said, ``by changing the way
you measure it.''

BUCCANEERS DOMINATE PATRIOTS WITH RELENTLESS PRESSURE ON BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
  (REPEATING to add photo note) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The game's first play and its last one caused
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to shiver.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every play in-between, though, shook the New England
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The first play: Tampa Bay fumbled the game's opening kickoff at
its own 28-yard line and that led to a Patriots' field goal. The
final play: With one second remaining in the game, with New England
at the Tampa Bay 22 with a chance to win, the Patriots' final fling
from Drew Bledsoe, under siege, fell harmlessly out of the end zone
without a Patriot close to making the winning catch.
</P>
<P>
   So Tampa Bay won this lopsided scramble, 21-16. New England
scored its field goal after the game's opening turnover, scored on
a Troy Brown 66-yard punt return in the second quarter and scored
on a 39-yard pass play with 3 minutes 1 second left. Other than
that, it was complete domination by the Tampa Bay defensive line
versus the New England offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decisive and ugly domination.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was hit so many times his head is probably still
ringing. On most Patriots' snaps, he would barely gather the ball
from center before some young Buc was in his face _ tackle Warren
Sapp or end Marcus Jones or linebacker Shelton Quarles or the
blitzing cornerback Ronde Barber among others. Bledsoe was sacked
six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, I'm beat up,'' Bledsoe said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, he looked beat up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking to him all day, telling him it was going to be
a long day,'' said Bucs end Chidi Ahanotu. ``He said, `Yeah, yeah,
you're right, it's a long day.' When you can pin your ears back and
let it fly, well, you like games like that when you can just hound
the quarterback. They tried a version of the no-huddle to counter
us and they seemed more uncomfortable with it than we did. The
one-on-one matchups were good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp, the all-pro, said he read in a newspaper before the game
that he had been ``handled'' during the preseason. Sapp was hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, that upset me so much, I couldn't eat breakfast,''
Sapp said. ``I was sick to my stomach. But we came out and showed
what we do. We get after the quarterback and get him, and that's
the ultimate prize. We're a team unit _ somebody strikes a match
and then everybody pours gas on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And New England's offense was singed.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were a pitiful 4 of 17 (24 percent) in third-down
conversions. They gained more yards on kickoff and punt returns
(118) than they did rushing (88). Bledsoe was 26 of 39 for 216
yards with those six sacks, a touchdown pass to receiver Terry
Glenn and no interceptions. Even on his touchdown _ a heave, a lob
into the end zone just as he was crushed once again by the Tampa
Bay defense _ Bledsoe barely stood upright long enough to get it
off.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively immobile quarterback and a leaky offensive line
against a fierce pass rush and menacing defense.
</P>
<P>
   A wicked combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some trouble on pass protection,'' said Patriots Coach
Bill Belichick, who lost in his first regular-season game as the
team's head coach. ``They mixed it up some but kept us off balance.
They did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Tampa Bay offense did just enough, scoring 14
second-quarter points to lead by 14-10 at halftime. Fullback Mike
Alstott scored on a 5-yard run and receiver Reidel Anthony scored
on an 8-yard pass from quarterback Shaun King. On that play, King
acted like he was going to spike the ball but threw it into the end
zone instead, a fake-spike-play like the one the former Miami
quarterback Dan Marino performed a few seasons ago against the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Buccaneers scored the only points of the third quarter
when Alstott started inside and then bounced outside for a 3-yard
run. That play made it 21-10 with 3:09 left in the quarter. The
score was set up by a forced fumble _ Bucs linebacker Derrick
Brooks on Patriots running back Kevin Faulk _ at the New England
24. The ball was recovered by safety John Lynch. It looked like
Tampa Bay would cruise from there, but Bledsoe to Glenn gave New
England a chance and the last play of the game could have turned
the whole affair upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay defense would not let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the right spot,'' Brooks, who made a game-high 15
tackles, said of his forced fumble on Faulk. ``I wanted to be
physical and finish my tackles because I had seen that some of
their backs have a tendency to put the ball on the ground.
Fortunately, we got it.''
</P>
<P>
   King said: ``If our defense can dominate like that we will be
something.''
</P>
<P>
   King (12 of 24, 167 passing yards, 1 touchdown and no
interceptions) made big plays, too, especially by converting on
seven third-down passing plays. He completed four passes to
Keyshawn Johnson for 64 yards, and Johnson opened passing lanes for
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we were supposed to do,'' Johnson said, ``and we
came out and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy, Tampa Bay's coach, said: ``Those third-down plays
Shaun made were plays we weren't making throughout last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bucs have more team balance, but make no mistake, its
defense rules.
</P>
<P>
   `` I know we're going to improve,'' Ahantou said. ``But I don't
think we've ever been this far along as a defense at this point in
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to shake up the rest of the league.

PARK GIVES DODGERS REASON TO HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NFL has kicked off its season. USC's and
UCLA's big wins have L.A. excited about college football again.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Dodgers are no longer the only show in town. And
they've been gasping to keep their fans and themselves interested
in the baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, watching Chan Ho Park pitch is worth the ticket
prices. Park survived his own wildness Sunday to remain one of
baseball's hottest pitchers in leading the Dodgers to a 6-1 win
over the Philadelphia Phillies at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Park (15-8) yielded just two hits and struck out six in eight
shutout innings. He's won his last four starts, compiling an 0.84
earned-run average (three earned runs allowed in 32 innings) over
that span.
</P>
<P>
   Park matched his career high in victories and was asked about
the possibility of being a 20-win pitcher with roughly five starts
remaining in his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get 20 wins I'll buy you dinner,'' Park told reporters.
``I have 15 wins now. I can't think about 20 wins. I have to worry
about right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Park was more concerned about his control Sunday. He fell behind
in the count far too much, issuing seven walks. But the Phillies
never cashed in.
</P>
<P>
   Park induced three double-play grounders. None was bigger than
his smothering of Tomas Perez's comebacker in the fifth to start a
1-6-3 double play. Pat Burrell and Marlon Anderson had drawn walks
to open the inning in what was still a 1-0 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how (Park's) been all year; once he gets a guy on base
he's very focused, especially when they get in scoring position,''
catcher Chad Kreuter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he needed to get double-play balls in certain
situations and he did get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Park came back to strike out pitcher Robert Person to end the
fifth. His teammates provided breathing room in the bottom of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Person (7-5) had retired 11 in a row since the Dodgers scored a
first-inning run. But Adrian Beltre led off the fifth with an
opposite-field solo homer. Kreuter then walked and eventually
scored on the first of Mark Grudzielanek's two RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers keep winning _ Sunday's victory was their 11th in 14
games _ while gaining modest ground in both the National League's
Western Division and wild-card playoff chases.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers lost to Montreal on Aug. 21, they were 62-61,
nine games behind division-leading San Francisco. The Dodgers' hot
streak has shaved just two games off the Giants' advantage. San
Francisco won its fifth consecutive game on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' sweep of Philadelphia failed to make up any games
in their chase of the Giants. But they're just two games back of
second-place Arizona, have crept within 6 1/2 of the Mets for the
NL wild-card and are playing their best baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of a lot of good things with this ballclub,'' manager
Davey Johnson said. ``Defensively, we're playing better. ... And we
seem to be getting a little better (starting) pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can't afford to be anything but sensational in the
season's final 25 games in order to maintain their already-faint
hopes of the playoffs. At 73-64, the Dodgers are nine games over
.500 for the first time since ending the 1997 season 88-74.
</P>
<P>
   ``You to try to get these kinds of winning streaks when it
really counts,'' left fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``You want to
try and do this a lot earlier and then we can put pressure on
teams. If we played like this earlier, we'd probably be one or two
games ahead or behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never too late. You've got to play the games. Nobody's
going to lay down for nobody.'' &QL;

5 ARRESTED NEAR U.N. ON EVE OF GATHERING
</HEADLINE>
  By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five people were arrested Sunday near the United
Nations in scuffles that appeared to have been aimed at the Iranian
delegation to the Millennium Summit, one of the largest gatherings
of national leaders, which begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:15 p.m., a 44-year-old man with a Swedish passport was
arrested near 53rd Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive for
throwing yellow paint at the motorcade of the Iranian delegation,
the police said. The man, whose name was not released, was charged
with disorderly conduct, Officer Theresa Farello said.
</P>
<P>
   After 5 p.m., two men were arrested in the lobby of the U.N.
Plaza Hotel, at 44th Street near First Avenue, for shouting racial
epithets, the police said. They were found to be holding paint as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, had been scheduled to
stay at the hotel, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, a man running down 44th Street threw yellow
paint at the hotel. A police officer grabbed the man, and both fell
to the ground. The officer was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center
with minor injuries, and the suspect was arrested and taken to
Bellevue because he appeared to be emotionally disturbed, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man got into a scuffle with several people at 44th
Street and Second Avenue, and was arrested and taken to Bellevue
for evaluation. The police, who did not release the names of the
suspects or the charges against them, later closed 44th Street to
pedestrians and let people enter the hotel only in groups of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Three suspicious packages were searched at the U.N. Plaza Hotel,
but no bombs were found.

such an approach _ including the possible customer confusion. But

BELICHICK, BLEDSOE BEATEN UP BY TAMPA BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He often walked off the field looking as if
he'd been mugged. His shoulder pads were up in his ear, his helmet
was turned sideways, and there were often pieces of the Foxboro
Stadium turf stuck on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Often his last sight before walking off in disgust was watching
Warren Sapp's celebratory dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, I'm beat up,'' said Drew Bledsoe. ``Those types
of games, when you have a chance to win and you don't, hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   As beaten as he looked, Bledsoe still had a chance to win the
Patriots' season opener Sunday. But just as it appeared the offense
was about to make some headway, time ran out, the Patriots lost the
first game of the Bill Belichick regime, 21-16, before 60,292 at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unacceptable,'' said Patriots safety Lawyer Milloy. ``Our
goals were set high. Whenever you lose a game in your home stadium,
it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick did not look for any excuses or positives on the
dismal day. He could not find even a glimpse of praise for his
offense, though Bledsoe did connect with Terry Glenn on a 39-yard
touchdown pass with 3:01 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa Bay outplayed us,'' said Belichick. ``We didn't make
enough plays.''
</P>
<P>
   There weren't enough Troy Brown moments, either. The top
playmaker ran back a punt 66 yards for a touchdown (the first
touchdown return of his career) and ran back another 39 yards. He
also ran a 35-yard reverse and caught seven passes for 70 yards,
including one for 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't enough Troy Browns, not in the receiving corps,
the running game (running backs accounted for 25 yards on 11
carries), or on the offensive line. For despite quantity _ nine
offensive linemen played _ the quality of the line's play was
lacking. It did not open holes against the tough, fast, and
superior Buccaneers defensive front. They allowed six sacks, 14
knockdowns, and 21 hurries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bledsoe is the heart and soul of New England,'' Sapp said.
``If you can beat Bledsoe, you can beat New England. We knew we had
to get in his face, but he got away a few times. He knows when
we're coming after him. But you know he's going to drop back 5 or 6
yards and then you have to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offensive line had a horrific day. Max Lane tried
playing with a broken thumb, but allowed a sack and a pressure to
Sapp and he was out of the game quickly. ``I wasn't effective,''
said Lane. ``We just made a lot of mistakes. We've had six weeks to
prepare and get it right and it just didn't happen for us today.''
</P>
<P>
   The line had done a respectable job against Tampa Bay in the
fourth exhibition game Aug. 20, but it had to figure it didn't see
the best of the Buccaneers' defensive line in that one. The
Patriots used odd substitutions on the line for a regular-season
game. But the Patriots used Jason Andersen over Damien Woody on
long snaps, and Andersen played left and right guard when veteran
Grant Williams replaced rookie Greg Robinson-Randall as the
starting right tackle after Robinson-Randall had taken virtually
every snap of the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had a chance to hit the jackpot at the game's
beginning, but settled for the consolation prize. Kevin Williams
fumbled the opening kickoff on a great hit by Larry Whigham and
Kato Serwanga gobbled up the loose ball at the Buccaneers 28. After
a quick sideline pass to Glenn gave the Patriots a first down at
the 16, the pressuring of Bledsoe began in earnest as he had to
throw away a third-and-6 pass intended for Eric Bjornson. Adam
Vinatieri came on to hit a 30-yard field goal, giving the Patriots
a 3-0 lead with 12:19 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But then the momentum began swinging the Buccaneers' way. On a
Lee Johnson punt late in the first quarter, Whigham and Tony
Simmons converged near the goal line and Whigham appeared to jump
up in the end zone and bat the ball to the 5. But the officials
ruled it was a touchback and the call survived a Patriots
challenge. The Buccaneers then drove 80 yards on 11 plays with a
pounding, tough running game featuring Mike Alstott (16 carries, 54
yards) inside and Warrick Dunn (16 carries, 56 yards) outside. The
big pass play was a 25-yard toss from Shaun King to Keyshawn
Johnson over the middle on which Tebucky Jones grabbed the
receiver's facemask advancing the spot from the 25 to the Patriots
12. Three plays later, Alstott capped it off with a rugged 5-yard
run on which his blockers knocked everyone off the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offense was well into its three-and-out mode when
Brown changed the routine. Fielding a punt at the Patriots 34,
Brown shot up the middle after Harold Shaw, Ty Law, and Tony George
made big blocks to give Brown some room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran and didn't look back,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Leading, 10-7, the Patriots' fortunes turned to misfortune. What
had been a flawless and effective defense made backbreaking
mistakes. With less than a minute remaining in the half, King
connected on a 33-yard pass with Jacquez Green on a quick out on
which cornerback Antonio Langham went for the pickoff. With 31
seconds remaining and the ball at the 8, King faked a spike and
threw a fade to the right corner to Reidel Anthony over Serwanga
for the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Belichick always tells us to be alert, but we fell
asleep on that one,'' said Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were at least playing with the Buccaneers on a
physical and emotional level into the third quarter. But the wind
went slightly out of their sails when Kevin Faulk fumbled at the
end of a 9-yard pass play on a vicious hit by Derek Brooks (15
tackles). The ball was recovered by safety John Lynch at the
Patriots 32 and he ran it to the 24. Four plays later, with left
guard Randall McDaniel lined up as a fullback, Alstott bounced off
a pile and kicked to the right for a 3-yard score, making it 21-10
with 3:09 remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until late in the fourth quarter that Bledsoe
connected with Glenn, but the Patriots botched the 2-point
conversion when Michael Bishop's pitch was fumbled by Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   There was still time. The Patriots' defense made a couple of
plays, including an 11-yard sack of King by Willie McGinest at the
Buccaneers 12. After Mark Royals's punt, the Patriots took over at
the Buccaneers 45, but without any timeouts. They converted on
fourth and 1 at the 26 when Bledsoe hit Brown for 4 yards. After a
spike stopped the clock with 11 seconds left, Bledsoe rolled right
and saw Chris Calloway open in the end zone on the opposite side of
the field. But his throw didn't quite get there in time. ``For a
while it looked like I had him,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   After another incompletion and with one second remaining,
Bledsoe said he called a play on which there was miscommunication
with Glenn. He wanted Glenn to run a post, but he called a Q-route,
which is a comeback route (unless the defense is in a certain
coverage). Glenn ran the Q-route, curling in, and ball sailed over
the end zone. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed just one more play,'' said Chad Eaton. ``As a
defense, we were looking for one more chance to put the ball in the
offense's hands and we couldn't quite get it late in the game.''

PATIENCE BLEDSOE'S VIRTUE, AND DOWNFALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe had the best rushing day of his
career Sunday. That is not a good thing for the New England
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly scrambling Bledsoe rushed eight times for 30 yards
and the only man to outrush him (other than Tampa Bay defensive
tackle Warren Sapp, who rushed to wherever he wanted) was Patriots
wide receiver Troy Brown, who gained 33 yards on two carries.
</P>
<P>
   When your leading rushers are a wide receiver and a quarterback,
it's probably a sign that things did not go well on opening day,
and in fact, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers came to Foxboro Stadium with a reputation for
having one of the league's best defenses. They left with a better
reputation for defense than the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   All day, Sapp and the six men who accompany him up front in
Tampa Bay destroyed the Patriots' offensive line and manhandled
Bledsoe, sacking him six times, knocking him down 14 times, and
hurrying him 21 times, according to unofficial statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In New England's 66 offensive plays, its quarterback ended up on
the ground 28 times. If this continues, it will be a long season
for the Patriots and a short one for Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Tampa Bay had escaped with a 21-16 win when
Bledsoe's last desperate pass fell out of bounds _ in part because
of a miscommunication with receiver Terry Glenn that led to Glenn
running a comeback route when Bledsoe wanted a post corner _ an
ambulance roared up Route 1, lights flashing and sirens blaring. As
fans and media wandered down toward the parking lots and locker
room, someone remarked, ``There goes Bledsoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, but soon enough if this keeps up.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, Bledsoe's back was scratched, his skin
was blotched red, and his face was flushed. To say he will be sore
Monday is like saying Sapp will wake up happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking to Bledsoe all day,'' said Tampa Bay defensive
end Chidi Ahanotu. ``We knew he wasn't the kind of quarterback to
sit in there and take hits.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is someone who could have sat in there and taken any
more hits without cracking, it would have to be a Sluggo doll.
Despite the beating, Bledsoe still finished 26 of 39 for 216 yards
with no interceptions and a 39-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass
to Glenn that cut Tampa Bay's lead to 5 with 3:01 to play.
</P>
<P>
   When he got one last chance with 1:53 left beginning at the
Tampa Bay's 45, Bledsoe completed five passes and was sacked once,
moving the ball to the Tampa Bay 22 before that last ball fluttered
harmlessly out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   He had not pulled off the comeback after pulling himself off the
floor but he had come close. Considering he took the kind of
beating Joe Frazier could relate to, it was a performance that
inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got beat on all day but he kept giving us chances to make
plays,'' Brown said. ``He gave us a chance to win it at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   That is more than can be said of the offensive line. Rotated all
day like a carousel, with every lineman playing at one point or
another and some playing more than one position, the unit allowed
its backs to gain a total of 25 yards and got the quarterback half
decapitated. Other than that, it was a pretty good day for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope everyone doesn't feel very good about how we
played,'' tackle Grant Williams said. ``There's no secrets with
them. They came after us and we didn't play well. If there's a
positive it was Drew. He was the consummate pro. It was good to see
some leadership like that.''
</P>
<P>
   That leader was often buried under 600 pounds of Tampa Bay
defenders but he was there somewhere _ even at the end when he was
as punchy as one of Mike Tyson's sparring partners. Still throwing,
still taking the hit, still making his reads and looking for
receivers who, frankly, weren't open often enough or quickly enough
to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally I'm beat up, but physically I feel fine,'' Bledsoe
said. ``Those type of games, when you have a chance to win and
don't, those take the biggest toll emotionally. As a kid growing up
those are the situations you think of . . . Some ways I'm still
like a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he was beaten up like a little kid who continues getting
up off the playground grass to fight anew. He fought until there
was no time left, fittingly being drilled on his last pass of the
day as he was on so many others.
</P>
<P>
   But he also brought his team back in the face of a hard rain of
a pass rush all around him, holding his ground behind a line that
could not hold its own and delivering no interceptions and nearly
the pass that could have won the game.
</P>
<P>
   That came with 11 seconds left when Chris Calloway somehow got
wide open in the left corner of the end zone as Bledsoe was rolling
wide to his right. At the last moment, he saw Calloway and tried to
fling the ball to him as the rush closed on him. Unable to fully
set himself to fire, the ball took too long to reach Calloway and
was knocked to the ground. For all intents and purposes, that was
the end of the game. Tampa Bay had given New England its window of
opportunity and then slammed it shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a minute there I thought we had it,'' Bledsoe said. ``But
I couldn't set up to throw it fully.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case all afternoon and if it continues, he'll be
gone before the leaves are. He probably knows this. Certainly the
men trying to protect him know it. And you can bet coach Bill
Belichick knows it.
</P>
<P>
   What they do about it, not a soul knows this morning. Except
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll get better,'' Bledsoe said of his pass protection. ``It
has to. When you play quarterback in this league, you're going to
get hit. They're going to get their shots. You just have to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe continues to take shots like he did Sunday, he won't
have to be patient anymore. He'll just be a patient.

MARINERS' ABBOTT FLIRTS WITH NO-HITTER 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARINERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the esteemed former voice of the Red Sox, Ned
Martin, might say, ``Mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this. With 29 games to go in a wild scramble
toward the postseason, the Sox Sunday &UR;  &LR; night squandered another
vital game, extending their run-production crisis in a one-hit act
of futility.
</P>
<P>
   One hit. Facing a journeyman, Seattle righthander Paul Abbott,
who had been on the disabled list 10 times and had never pitched
anything near a no-hitter, the Sox went hitless until Rico Brogna
grounded a single up the middle with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   One hit. That was it, as the Sox got pancaked by the Mariners,
5-0, and dropped two games behind Cleveland in the American League
wild-card race. They languish six games behind the Yankees in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll hit (Monday),'' manager Jimy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be nice, since the alternative, with stopper Pedro
Martinez on the mound, would be near-certain disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But just one more hit Sunday &UR;  &LR; night might have made a remarkable
difference. Trailing, 3-0, in the eighth, the Sox loaded the bases,
as Brogna singled, and Scott Hatteberg and Trot Nixon drew walks
off the tiring Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Nomar Garciaparra with two outs and Jose
Paniagua on to relieve Abbott. The ``Rocky'' theme blared. The
crowd rose.
</P>
<P>
   But Garciaparra, mired in a slump that has sent him from
flirting with .400 to third in the AL batting race, flied out to
right. It was the 15th straight game in which Garciaparra failed to
drive in a run, the longest stretch of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he was among many reflecting on the team's drought.
The Sox have scored two runs or fewer in four of the last six
games. It was the sixth time this season they have been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   And the more they struggle, the more they press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes everybody tries to do too much,'' Garciaparra said.
``It can snowball. They say hitting is contagious. But it can go
the other way, too. People are struggling, and saying, `I gotta do
it, I gotta do it, I gotta do it,' and they're trying to hit a
five-run home run every time at the plate. You can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Sox are 1-2 to start a 10-game homestand they consider
the most important of the season. They have little more margin for
failure.
</P>
<P>
   They can thank Abbott for most of their sadness. Though it was
his only start this season in which he did not allow an earned run,
Abbott baffled the Sox mostly with a changeup and sharp control
until he faltered in the eighth. That was the only time a Boston
base runner reached second.
</P>
<P>
   ``No team wants to come close to getting no-hit,'' Brogna said.
``But you have to tip your hat to the guy. He pitched super.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said for the Sox starter, Tomo Ohka, who
was shaky from the start.
</P>
<P>
   His trouble started with the second batter he faced, Stan
Javier, who bounced a double off the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka walked Alex Rodriguez, bringing up the RBI machine, Edgar
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   He survived Martinez, who flied out to left field, but John
Olerud lined a double to right-center for a 2-0 Seattle lead.
</P>
<P>
   Triggering a smattering of boos, Ohka then walked Jay Buhner,
prompting pitching coach Joe Kerrigan to visit the mound to try to
calm the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Kerrigan said apparently worked because Ohka retired
Carlos Guillen on a ground out. He pitched five more scoreless
innings before Rod Beck took over in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohka's recovery hardly pleased him. ``What bothers me is
that I gave up two runs in the first inning and that cost us the
game,'' he said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   But catcher Jason Varitek credited him for the poise he showed
when the Mariners had him on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can go out there and hold a first-place team to two
runs when you don't have your best stuff, that's pretty good,''
Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners extended their lead off Beck in the seventh. Mark
McLemore laced a ground-rule double to right and scored on Javier's
double.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Sang Lee pitched a scoreless eighth for the Sox. But with
two out in the ninth, he walked Javier and gave up a gargantuan
home run over everything to left by Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Sox sought to keep hope alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're far from being out of it,'' Varitek said. ``What it's
going to take is for us to get on a roll and play free and easy and
just let things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, though, that the roll needs to start soon and last
``for a long stretch.''

BELICHICK'S FIRST DAY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The new boss, a man fascinated with details,
walked into a room and went off on the Patriots. He said he wasn't
impressed with them. He told them that fans and sportswriters would
tell them they were better than they actually were. They would mine
out ``the positives'' and he wasn't interested in fuzzy optimism
when there was so much work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out players, testing them, seeing if they would offer
the wrong answer to his loaded question: ``Do you think you had a
good game today?'' For his ears, the correct answer for everyone
should have been an emphatic no.
</P>
<P>
   And that, folks, was Bill Belichick's postgame mood on one of
his good days _ July 31 _ following a 20-0 exhibition win over the
49ers. The players should have known then that this football
savant, who studied college game film when he was 11 years old, was
difficult to please. Imagine what he had to say Sunday at Foxboro
Stadium when his players embarrassed him and themselves on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the romantics will try to frame the latest Patriots
loss, 21-16 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with uplifting
could-have-beens. They will tell you that with one second remaining
in the game, Drew Bledsoe had a chance to lasso an unlikely win.
What they won't mention is that even on that last heave to the end
zone, Bledsoe had to have some Maurice Greene in him just to escape
the Buccaneers' linemen, who had stalked him for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   What the new boss knows is that his first regular-season day at
the office was hell. When he gazed across the field, he saw
filmmaker Spike Lee _ director of ``The Original Kings of Comedy''
_ on the Buccaneers' sideline. That was fitting, because
Belichick's own team put together a documentary of inexcusable
errors, the worst one coming when it was done in by a phantom
spike.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots gave up a silly touchdown late in the second
quarter when they thought quarterback Shaun King was going to fire
the ball into the turf to stop the clock. King didn't spike it. He
threw it to Reidel Anthony for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   This is the NFL's version of a shell game. Baseball has the
hidden-ball trick and (talk to Johnny Bench about this one)
sneaking a strike past a batter who is expecting to be walked
intentionally. Soccer, hockey, and basketball have theatric flops
from players trying to influence the officials. You never want to
be victimized by the gimmick plays. They become bloopers fodder,
placed on the shelf next to such classics as the Cal-Stanford
``band'' game. You know you've been had when the blooper has its
own name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the `Dan Marino Fake Play,' '' Lawyer Milloy said of
his team's breakdown. The New England safety was referring to the
Hall of Fame quarterback's sly move against, ironically, Pete
Carroll's New York Jets in 1994. Marino pretended he was going to
throw the ball to the ground. He pumped once toward the turf, saw
the flat-footed Jets, and went to the end zone for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That play happened six years ago, but a casual fan can still see
Marino passing to the right side of the end zone. You may have
watched the highlights and wondered how a team could flat-line like
that in the final minutes of a game. You may have also known that
it was the kind of loss that could end a team's season as well as
Mr. P.C.'s Jets career.
</P>
<P>
   So here was Belichick, after a half day on the job, being linked
indirectly to Carroll. That's not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't react well to the play at all,'' Belichick said.
``We obviously blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy said that if he knows his coach as well as he thinks, the
Patriots will be going over that play constantly in practice.
Milloy, one of the team's captains, said there was no one to blame
on the play. Kato Serwanga was helpless, in single coverage, when
Anthony ran past him. The only way anyone else could have reacted
better, Milloy said, is if they could ``run 2.2 40 (-yard
dashes).''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay safety John Lynch said that the Buccaneers once fell
for the play in practice, so coach Tony Dungy had them practice
against it for weeks. ``Fortunately,'' Lynch said, ``we haven't
fallen for it in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the analytical Belichick, the play was not his
only problem. The New England coach enjoys solving things, so it
will be a busy Labor Day for him. Belichick once called his buddy,
former NBA coach Mike Fratello, because he couldn't understand why
teams were so inconsistent in their double teams of Karl Malone.
He'll probably need to contact an entire tribunal to find out what
ticks inside of his offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic view is that the team ran into a rare creation: a
defensive line with power and quickness. Or maybe these guys aren't
very good. The offensive line provided the Buccaneers with a brief
tough-guy facade before collapsing, making Bledsoe _ who was sacked
six times _ look like one of the characters in ``Run, Lola, Run.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the Patriots were having a public identity crisis.
Last year, they blamed unprepared coaches and arcane schemes for
their problems. Sunday, they certainly seemed to be trying to stuff
themselves into their silhouetted 1999 profiles. Bad running game.
Bad pass protection. A dependable defense. A harassed Bledsoe. A
remarkable Troy Brown (the team has to figure out a way to get him
the ball more often). A blitz not picked up by a back (Kevin
Faulk). A loss that was close to becoming a win, but didn't make
it.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is not what you would call a public personality. After
Warren Sapp had danced on the field, and after Keyshawn Johnson had
talked trash with Willie McGinest and Ty Law, Belichick stood in
the Patriots weight room. The private man then delivered this
analysis of his team: ``I think we need to shore up every area. We
had some problems on defense. We had a few problems in the kicking
game. And we had some problems on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   If he said that publicly, try to imagine what he said in
private. Maybe the coach is so demanding of his team because he
views them as aloof gifted students: talented but underachieving.
That has to be it, because these New England Patriots cannot
possibly be as bad as they looked on Belichick's Day 1 in
Foxborough.

SEASON TO BELIEVE IN RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Unofficially, Labor Day marks the end of summer and,
for generations of Red Sox fans, the beginning of the season of
despair.
</P>
<P>
   It was that way when Red Sox receptionist Helen Robinson was a
teen and has not changed a bit, even as she begins year 60 as the
grande dame of Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back losses to the Seattle Mariners this weekend did
nothing to lighten the predictable gloom that every year settles in
as surely as the fog on Block Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox collected a grand total of four hits in two games,
and were nearly no-hit Sunday by Mariners righthander Paul Abbott,
a guy who broke into the big leagues in 1990 and began this season
averaging less than one win for each year he has pitched.
</P>
<P>
   It took an eighth-inning single by Rico Brogna to give the Red
Sox as many hits off the nondescript Abbott as the Devil Rays had
last Tuesday off the incomparable Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a win from Pedro the Younger this afternoon, the Sox
can do no better than a split with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are six games behind the Yankees in the AL East, two
behind the Indians in the wild-card race. They are not fighting for
the postseason as much as doing a baseball rope-a-dope, covering
up, taking some withering blows, while hoping that the other guys
tire.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Miss Gandy welcomes a new class of third-graders
Tuesday for the start of another school year, she is advised to
pull up the shades, throw open the windows, and tell her kids that
they will not be bound by the same portents of doom their parents
see in every Sox loss.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because I am here to say the Sons of Jimy Williams are
going to win the American League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Call me mad. Call me Nomar's bobo. Pedro's puppet. Duke's dweeb.
The loon from Lunenburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those things are true,'' said one pressbox colleague,
shaking his head. ``Win the pennant? This last month is going to
look like the Iraqi retreat to Baghdad, with (Dan) Duquette as
Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you detect a slight difference of opinion? But hear me out.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, if you gave the Sox a nickel for every big hit they've
gotten lately, it would be a month before they could afford a
double decaf latte at Starbucks. Did you see that Indians-Orioles
score, 12-11? The Sox haven't scored in double figures since July
20, and that was 42 games ago.
</P>
<P>
   But I defy anyone to tell me that Nomar Garciaparra will go
another 15 games in a row without driving in a run, the way he has
the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Dante Bichette, the new guy, won't soon be taking aim at
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Trot Nixon won't stand up again to the Yankees this
weekend, or that Troy O'Leary and Rico Brogna and Jason Varitek and
Lou Merloni and Brian Daubach (if he ever recovers the feeling in
his left arm) will deliver meaningful hits before it's over.
</P>
<P>
   I agree. It is worrisome that Bichette has hit just three home
runs since the All-Star break. And yes, his career numbers are
inflated by the years he spent hitting in the thin air of Denver.
But he has hit his whole life, he will hit here, and his addition
gives the Sox three middle-of-the-order hitters that ultimately
will be tough outs down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the absolute truisms of the game. Hitting comes and
goes. Mostly, it has been gone this season, but while the stats say
the Sox rank 12th in the league in scoring, this team is different
than the one forced to rely on the likes of Ed Sprague earlier.
</P>
<P>
   What these Sox have now is starting pitching, and pitching
depth. Pedro Martinez, Rolando Arrojo, and Ramon Martinez are all
veteran big-game pitchers, better than any three you can name from
the other contenders, including the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Tomo Ohka, despite taking the loss Sunday, has been a dependable
fourth, and Tim Wakefield, Jeff Fassero, Pete Schourek, and
eventually Paxton Crawford give the Sox some options.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox bullpen is deeper, and Derek Lowe is better than anybody
else's closer not wearing pinstripes, and this season Lowe has been
even more reliable than Mariano Rivera of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are playing superb defense. They have not made an error
in their last six games, and have made just nine errors in their
last 20 games. In that stretch, they have committed more than one
error in a game just once.
</P>
<P>
   And even while it seems that some Sox types operating behind the
scenes are trying to sandbag Jimy Williams over the Izzy Alcantara
affair (as if Alcantara could ever have been more than the 24th or
25th man on the roster), that little tiff pales compared to the bad
feelings left by Boss Steinbrenner's attack on injured Yankee
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, or the flareup between Yankee
manager Joe Torre and reliever Jeff Nelson last week.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Williams. They have yet to invent a tempest in this
town that will cause him to stray off course.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year pitching and defense win games.
Duquette agrees, to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing for us is to score enough runs to get into the
postseason,'' Duquette said, ``because if we get in the playoffs we
will be a very dangerous ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to get enough run production to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget about hoping for a miraculous recovery from Jose
Offerman, who has been a ghost of the leadoff man who scored 107
runs last season and had 56 extra-base hits. His sore left knee
will not permit him to be that kind of player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs six weeks of rest for it to heal,'' Duquette said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But even without a healthy Offerman, the Sox have the components
to win. And for a change, they would welcome some positive vibes
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for only one purpose,'' Pedro Martinez said Sunday.
``Just win. That's my goal. Until I do, I won't rest. Sooner or
later, our guys step up, especially this time of year. We know how
to win. If we don't, we find a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to do what we're going to do, but keeping
other people positive for longer gives more fun to the chase. It
adds a little fun to everything we do. If we don't win when people
are not negative and we lose, that doubles the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra wants people to know that he deeply appreciates the
way they've stuck with this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season drains on you, it weighs on you _ you're playing
every day and everything that happens, on and off the field, it
affects you. But people have been supporting us great the whole
year, and we appreciate it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take that for granted. We definitely have a chance,
and we ain't giving up, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just try it. Set aside the usual vibes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, tell yourself the Sox will win.
</P>
<P>
   And believe it.
</P>

THOUGHTS OF A NO-NO? YES-YES! 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Did he know? What do you think? When you have been in
and out of major league baseball since 1990 and you have never
thrown a complete game, you damn well know when you're flirting
with a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely,'' admitted Paul Abbott. ``I knew. I started
thinking about it in the fifth inning. You're aware. If you get
that far with pretty good stuff, with good command, you just
continue your game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott and no-hitter don't quite have that
love-and-marriage/horse-and-carriage resonance, but stranger things
have happened in this game. People with far fewer credentials than
the goateed 32-year-old Paul Abbott have thrown major league
no-hitters. You just never know when you'll be attending a major
league game and a no-hitter will break out, although it seems to
happen everywhere but here.
</P>
<P>
   Through five, through six, and through seven innings Seattle's
journeyman righthander (14-15, 4.47 ERA in 47 major league starts,
interspersed with 36 relief appearances and a whopping 10 trips to
the disabled list) had his no-no. Nomar Garciaparra had stroked one
fairly deep to center in the first. Troy O'Leary had drilled one to
very deep center in the second. Dante Bichette had hit one about
two steps from the warning track in center in the seventh. And when
Jason Varitek led off the eighth inning with a shot to right that
died on the warning track in the eighth, Paul Abbott was five outs
away from both his first major league complete game and the first
Fenway Park no-hitter in 35 years, minus 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly thought he was going to get it when Varitek's ball
stayed in the ballpark,'' observed catcher Joe Oliver. ``He hit
that ball great.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about a no-hitter. It's not just about good
stuff, although Abbott certainly had that. ``Best fastball I've had
all year,'' he pointed out. ``When that happens, it makes
everything else better.'' Those other things, in this case, were a
changeup and a slider, both of which played beautifully off a
90-plus heater.
</P>
<P>
   But a no-hitter always requires luck. You need a reasonable
share of those ``right at 'em'' balls, and you've got to hope that
when someone does get hold of one it goes to the big part of the
ballpark. O'Leary really smashed that ball in the second, for
example. It wasn't much different than the ball he hit for a homer
on Saturday, except that it wasn't pulled quite as much. So all it
turned out to be was a very long ``8'' in the scorebook.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott had plenty on his mind when he started the eighth. His
lead was a hardly impregnable 3-0, and he was, after all, in Fenway
Park. But no one is foolish enough to deny that when a man takes a
no-hitter into the eighth inning, that becomes the immediate
priority. You figure if you keep that no-no going the W will kind
of take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another reason a no-hitter was a plausible outcome. The
Red Sox have become baseball's resident Hitless Wonders. They
compressed their offense into one little outburst on Friday and
they were held to three hits on Saturday. They really haven't hit
well all year. This is currently as no-hittable as any team in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With Varitek retired, the next batter was Rico Brogna. He had
grounded to second and lined out hard into a double play in the
fifth. He was a very good candidate to at least get his bat on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott fell behind, 2-0. He came in with a fastball and Brogna
bounced one hard past the mound. ``I wished I had shaded a bit more
toward the middle,'' said Alex Rodriguez. ``I gave it my best shot.
I gave it my best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. He's A-Rod, after all. He moved to his left and hit
the ground, but the ball skidded into center field. Bye-bye,
no-hitter. The Fenway no-hit drought continues. The Ghost of Dave
Morehead still patrols these hallowed grounds.
</P>
<P>
   There was still the matter of the complete game and, of course,
the W. Pinch hitter Midre Cummings flied to center for the second
out. He walked pinch hitter Scott Hatteberg, bringing manager Lou
Piniella and those hilarious itty-bitty steps to the mound. ``I was
able to talk him into letting me stay in,'' Abbott claimed. Let the
record show that Piniella took 41 of those baby steps between the
mound and the dugout on his return trip. That is major league
short-stepping.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon was next. Abbott, now in very unfamiliar territory
with a triple-figure pitch count, lost the Boston leadoff man on 3
and 2. After a lengthy delay, Piniella made a return trip to the
mound. A disappointed, but resigned, Abbott would not be getting
that complete game. Jose Paniagua would be pitching to Nomar
Garciaparra with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of gas,'' Abbott admitted. ``I've never even had a
complete game, much less a shutout.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and the game in the balance, the suspense
lasted all of two pitches. Nomar flied routinely to right. End of
threat.
</P>
<P>
   So Paul Abbott was left to ponder the evening's intriguing
events. This was, without question, the best game he had ever
pitched in the big leagues. But with a little more luck it might
have been something even more special. It might have been a
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it wasn't a cheap hit,'' Abbott reasoned. ``It was a
situation where I fell behind and I had to take my chances. He hit
a fastball back up the middle. It was clean. It would have been
hard to swallow if it had been a broken-bat hit. I got behind, and
I put him at an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hate losing it on a little flare,'' agreed Oliver.
``This was a legitimate hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the master of understatement, skipper Piniella allowed that
``We need to get starting pitching, and that was an excellent job
tonight.'' Sorry, Lou, but it was a little more than that. Around
these parts, we've come to the conclusion that Fenway Park has a
better chance of being hit by an asteroid than being the sight of a
no-hitter. Paul Abbott had a few pulses racing Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.

RED SOX HONOR SOCIETY HAS SPECIAL MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's an exclusive club. The Red Sox Social Register is
not like that of the Yankees or Celtics, who are running out of
monuments, wall space, and digits. There's no ``Loscy'' on the
right-field facade at Fenway Park and worthies such as Jimmie Foxx,
Tony Conigliaro, Harry Agganis, Jim Rice, and Luis Tiant have been
denied admission.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams (No. 9), Joe Cronin (No. 4), Bobby Doerr (No. 1),
and Carl Yastrzemski (No. 8) make up the Mount Crushmore of the
ancient Back Bay theater and Monday they are joined by New
Hampshire's own Carlton Fisk (No. 27).
</P>
<P>
   Fisk is the first New Englander to have his number retired by
the Red Sox. Williams, Doerr, and Cronin were all born in
California and Yaz grew up in (gulp) Southampton, N.Y. Catcher
Carlton was born in Bellows Falls, Vt., and raised in Charlestown,
N.H. He's the only member of the Fab Five who knows a frappe from a
milkshake.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox started wearing numbers on their backs in 1931 (this
would take Babe Ruth out of consideration), and first retired
numbers May 29, 1984, when they honored Williams and Cronin. Doerr
went up on the wall in 1988 and Yaz was immortalized a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Sox insisted a player would only be considered
for the honor if he had these credentials:
</P>
<P>
   1. Membership in the Baseball Hall of Fame;
</P>
<P>
   2. At least 10 years of service with the Red Sox;
</P>
<P>
   3. He finished his career with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Yastrzemski, and Doerr played their entire careers in
Boston. Cronin played 6 1/2 years for the Washington Senators
before coming to Boston in 1935. Cronin managed the Red Sox for a
club-record 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's inclusion would appear to violate the third stipulation
of the Sox' arbitrary rules. (The Boston brass claim Fisk finished
his career with the Sox because they gave him a cheesy job last
spring.) This will no doubt provoke new lobbying for the likes of
Foxx, Conigliaro, &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Ballgame is happy to have Fisk join the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're damn right,'' said the splendid one. ``We've got a
pretty good crew and now we've got Carlton Fisk, who's a hell of a
player.''
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Williams's No. 9 was one of the first to be
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous honor,'' said Williams. ``It's the nicest
honor I could get in my life because I love baseball so much and it
was my life and I was lucky to have the years of good playing that
I did. I met a lot of people and I'll always be remembered as a
baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also fitting that Williams and Cronin were honored
together. Cronin was player-manager of the Red Sox when Teddy
Ballgame burst on the scene in 1939. Cronin, who retired as a
player in 1945, was the Sox manager when Williams played in his
only World Series in 1946. Cronin later became general manager of
the Sox and was named president of the American League in 1959, one
year before Williams retired.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin was 77 and his health was failing when the Sox retired
his No. 4. He was unable to be on the field with Williams and he
died less than four months after the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Dad's last trip to Fenway Park,'' said Maureen Cronin,
his daughter. ``He had to stay upstairs because he was failing
badly. But he was very thrilled. He made a great effort to be there
because he loved Boston and he loved the fans of Boston. That day
was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was misty and rainy, but it was wonderful because
all of our friends were there. We sat with Jean Yawkey and Bowie
Kuhn. It was nice to have the Williams and Cronin entourages all
there together. It was meaningful for all of us, the passing of an
era, really. We all felt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see the number when I'm there. I'm very proud of my
dad. He left me a wonderful legacy. Baseball meant so much to him
and he passed it on to all of his children.''

   Doerr, who came to the Sox two years ahead of Williams, played
10 seasons under Cronin and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in
1986. Two years later, the Red Sox put his No. 1 alongside the
numbers of Williams and Cronin. The ceremony was held in May 1988
and cantankerous Sox manager John McNamara was still wearing No. 1,
but Doerr said, ``He took his shirt off and gave it to me.''
(McNamara was fired two months later and no one has worn the number
since.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thrill, a great honor,'' said Doerr. ``It just
seems like as time goes by, there's not many numbers being retired.
I have been back to Fenway maybe three or four times since they did
that. Sometimes when I'm watching a game on television they'll show
that. It's great to be sitting in Oregon, watching it on TV, and
see the number. It's really an honor, just like making the Hall of
Fame. It's pretty hard to have it done.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Doerr's ceremony, Yastrzemski got his ticket to
Cooperstown, and the Sox _ as they are doing with Fisk _ retired
his number later the same summer. No. 8 went on the facade Aug. 6,
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got the call about the Hall of Fame, John Harrington
called me and said they wanted to retire my number,'' said Yaz. ``I
was ecstatic. I still remember that day and the tremendous
reception I got from the fans. At that moment, it filled me even
more than going into the Hall of Fame. And the thought kept running
through my mind that I made the right decision playing my entire
career in Boston. Because of the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaz had links with the three prior inductees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Cronin was still general manager when I signed with the
Red Sox,'' he said. ``I remember going there at Thanksgiving and
meeting with Joe and putting in a call to Mr. (Tom) Yawkey. I think
one thing that struck Joe about me was my size. I think he expected
somebody about 6-2, 200 pounds, and I was barely 6 feet and 165
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Doerr was an instructor when I was in the minors and he
was a class guy. I was very close with him and, of course, he was
one of our coaches in 1967. He's a great guy that never changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, there was Ted. When I first came to spring
training (in 1960), it was his last year and they lockered me next
to him. He was always talking to me about hitting and he had all
these theories. All I knew was to look for the ball and hit it. The
first time I saw him in person, I can remember him taking batting
practice. He'd take a short, quick swing and he'd be talking to
himself, saying, `OK, Teddy Ballgame, let's pop a couple out.' The
guy was amazing. I looked at him and thought, `Holy mackerel.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' retired numbers (red digits in white circles) were
originally hung in the order in which they were retired: 9 _ 4 _ 1
_ 8. (The blue No. 42 represents baseball's across-the-board
retirement of Jackie Robinson's number and has nothing to do with
Mo Vaughn's Red Sox career.) Applied as a date, 9/4/18 represents
the eve of the first game of the 1918 World Series, which was won
by the Red Sox over the Cubs. (The Series began early because of
World War I). In 1998, the Red Sox tired of this massive reminder
of futility staring down at them, so the numbers were taken down
and reattached in numerical order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so disappointed when they did that,'' said Maureen
Cronin. ``It was kind of spooky the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they have 1 _ 4 _ 8 _ 9 _ 27. Let's see the numerologists
make something of that.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzemski, Fisk's longtime teammate, will be one of the
presenters at Monday's event. Williams just turned 82 and rarely
travels, but the greatest Red Sox player of them all is ever
mindful of his place in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at it,'' he said. ``I always thought I could hit a
ball up there from home plate, but I never did.''

SAFIN SURVIVES SLIPPERY FIVE-SETTER? 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This diversion called the US Open is beginning to
seem like a Russian winter to the Moscow man-child, Marat Safin.
Endless. Slippery. Chilling. Wet. Confining.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again he has appeared to be buried in a drift _ his
mind away from the business at hand, the job of punching fuzzy
yellow balls even fuzzier than his thought processes. But he has
always shoveled himself out, Sunday arriving among the last 16 men
standing at Flushing Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, I have a lot of headache . . . what to do with the
ball?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the irrepressible Safin, not far removed from his
teenage years, a big but quick and coordinated guy who would look
just fine laboring as a tight end: 6 feet 5 inches, 200 pounds. He
is tight, all right, as he walks onto the asphalt stage for the
third act of a gloomy drama that has covered 6 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared. Thinking too much. Got to concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Could he concentrate for 90 seconds? That's what it took for
Safin to finally conclude his third-round victory over the scrappy
little Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 1-6, 3-6, 7-6
(7-5) _ a windup as close and excruciating as they can get in this
game.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety seconds, two points. That was the difference. Somebody
was going to blink, and it was Grosjean as they returned to Arthur
Ashe Stadium after the second cloudburst intermission. They had
spent as much time in the dressing room as on court, fretting and
``going crazy,'' says Marat, dangling, waiting out thunderstorms
that halted them twice.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly this encounter of five sets, 3 hours 9 minutes, and 326
points had come down to best-of-three points, 10 whacks. It was
commotion interruptus as they resumed in the decisive tiebreaker,
Grosjean serving at 4-points-to-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible to have to start again like that,'' says the
skittering Grosjean, dwarfed by Safin by 7 inches and 50 pounds.
``It's a matter of luck. Coming back from two sets down, I didn't
have quite as much juice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's gonna be more lucky?'' Safin wonders. ``It's a lottery.
I'm afraid. My eyes are bigger than my face. Now I can lose,'' says
the Russian, feeling morose as he glunks a forehand into the net:
5-5. Two points from delight or the dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   But Marat rips a forehand return of a second serve down the
line: 6-5. His lead, and his serve. Now Grosjean lashes a forehand
. . . same route . . . but . . . ``I think it's going wide,'' Safin
recounts, clasping his hands together. ``I'm praying, `Please,
please go out!' ''
</P>
<P>
   It does, and ``I can stop going crazy for a while. I'm still
here. I'm here to make history, to do something special. To win.''
No Russian has conquered the US Open. But Safin, dripping with
power (25 aces) and talent, and spinning in mood swings like a guy
in a revolving door, remains in the chase. An immense and immensely
likable guy, he goes nuts, smashes rackets _ 46 in 55 matches this
season _ yet is ever sporting and laughs at himself.
</P>
<P>
   Par for this course is nine sets for three rounds. He's been
bogeying: 14 sets _ four against Thierry Guardiola, five against
Gianluca Pozzi and Grosjean, totaling more than 9 hours. Pete
Sampras has shot par, nine sets in less than six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Safin should have dusted Grosjean in under two hours. It was
good old summertime while he knocked off the first two sets. Then
Russian winter descended as his concentration fled like robins
headed south, and Safin lumbered about as though on snowshoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more set to win.'' He ``didn't expect (the temperature
change) so quickly. How's possible happen to me these things? I
gave Grosjean back his confidence. It's 6-1, 6-3, for him so fast.
I lose my serve to start the fifth . . . I'm crazy. But I promised
myself not to break a racket . . . they're new, just strung. But it
might have felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   He has plunged to countryman Gorky's Lower Depths. This drama is
evoking the Gershwin tune, ``But Not For Me'' _ specifically ``. .
. I've found more clouds of gray than any Russian play can
guarantee . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Thunder rumbling behind those glowering clouds like the cannons
in Tchaikovsky's ``1812 Overture,'' seems to awaken Safin, who
shoots ahead, 30-15, at 4-4 in the fifth set where raindrops halt
them for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Into the locker room for 85 minutes. Safin issues a socks
appeal. ``I didn't bring enough clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Back again, Safin holds serve to 5-4, and they proceed into the
tense tiebreaker. More rain after nine points, during which Safin
grabbed two mini-breaks only to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again I have to shower, change. Jeff Tarango gave me clean
socks the first break. Now Nicholas Kiefer gives me socks and a
shirt the second time. I don't want to smell bad when I go back on
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Marat wants to look spiffy for his 90-second curtain call, and
ends up smelling like a winner. Russian winter thaws. Momentarily.
But look for Safin, next matched with another 20-year-old whiz,
Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero, to stumble through more drifts,
develop periodic frostbite of the brain, and crumple a few more
weapons as he tries to emulate the 13th century Russian warrior
Alexander Nevsky, a champion of famous icy battles.

NORMAN NEEDS MARATHON TO ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strike one. Strike two. Strike . . . hold on just a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked like the last of top three men's seeds at
the US Open was about to be run out of town, Magnus Norman came
alive Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Norman scratched his way out of a huge hole to hold off Max
Mirnyi, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 7-6 (11-9), in a 4-hour-6-minute
marathon that highlighted a wet and wild day at the Open.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the rain won out. At 11 p.m., tournament officials
announced that several matches had been postponed until Monday. One
was Todd Martin's clash with No. 10 seed Cedric Pioline. Martin
led, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 2-0, when the rains disrupted play again. No.
1 women's seed Martina Hingis was in control of her match with
Sandrine Testud, 6-2, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Norman took a while to get a grip on his match. He was up, 5-2,
in the third set, but squandered that lead before winning the set
in a tiebreaker. Norman got the only service break he needed in the
first game of the fourth set and it was on to the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Norman broke first in the final set. Mirnyi, chipping and
charging, got that break back.
</P>
<P>
   Norman was up, 5-2, in the tiebreaker but before it ended, each
player had match points. Mirnyi was up, 9-8, and serving when
Norman ran off the last three points.
</P>
<P>
   And then apologized to Mirnyi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the feeling when you lose a match like that,'' Norman
said. ``But he's still young. He's going to get a lot more
opportunities. I really want to cheer him on, like say, `Come on,
great game.' It's not really the time to do it when you shake hands
at the end of the game, because maybe he's going to punch you in
the face or something. He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Norman's escape act kept some sense of stability on the
men's side with No. 1 Andre Agassi and No. 2 Gustavo Kuerten long
gone, Venus Williams, the No. 3 seed, did her share to keep the
women's draw in line.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was not thrilled that because of the rain she had to
hang around the National Tennis Center all day. When she did get on
the court several hours after she planned, it was in Louis
Armstrong Stadium, not in the featured Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The changeup didn't throw her off much. Williams led the way
into the US Open quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Magui
Serna.
</P>
<P>
   Later, No. 6 seed Monica Seles joined her there with a 6-3, 6-4
win over No. 15 seed Jennifer Capriati in a rematch of a 1991
showcase semifinal here. ``She (Seles) came out real strong from
the first ball,'' Capriati said. ``She served very well and it was
tough for me to break and of course that put more pressure on my
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Seles won the battle of teenagers _ she was 17 and
Capriati 15 _ on her way to a fourth major championship title.
Capriati hasn't made it as far as the semifinal of a major since.
</P>
<P>
   Both young women missed a couple of years in the mid-1990s:
Seles after being stabbed at a tournament and Capriati with
personal problems. Seles has won two US Opens and nine majors in
her career. She last won here in 1992 and won her last major in
Australia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Seles beat Capriati in the fourth round here last year and now
holds a 7-3 record over her. Seles will play the winner of the
Hingis-Testud match in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Hingis, she knows she will be in for a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely have to cut down on my errors because Martina is
not going to give any free points like the other players do,''
Seles said. ``Up to this point she has been playing really well.
She hasn't really been tested. Obviously, I'm going to have to be
very aggressive out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman next gets No. 14 seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, a 7-5,
6-3, 6-4 winner over Sjeng Schalken. Norman isn't too worried about
coming back Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good anyway, even if it's a long match,'' he said. ``I
think I'm pretty fit. I think I can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be looking to get off to a better start against Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing really, really well,'' Norman said. ``He was
playing unbelievably good in the first two sets. There was nothing
much I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the finish and the final tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had match point, I had match point,'' Norman said. ``It's
tough to have a strategy. Just try to get the ball over the net,
you know?''

BUCS' VICTORY WELL-PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They knocked him down. They ran over him.
But the Buccaneers couldn't make Drew Bledsoe cower the way they
thought they would under their relentless pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, we looked at (Bledsoe) as a guy with happy
feet,'' said Warren Sapp, Tampa Bay's brilliant defensive tackle
who lived up to his reputation as the best lineman in the league.
``When we played him before (in 1997), when we got pressure on him,
he ducked, or he got nervous, and wanted to get rid of the ball. We
talked about this before the game. This was our goal, to get
pressure on Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I give him credit. We hit him, and we hit him hard. He
hung in there. Today, he was a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing thing about Tampa Bay's 21-16 victory over the
Patriots Sunday was the way it happened.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Tampa's biggest edge was its defensive line _ the best
and fastest in the NFL _ against New England's suspect offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers coaching staff felt the No. 1 priority of the
Patriots coaching staff would be to figure out a way to keep
Tampa's front four off Bledsoe, to give him a chance to make some
big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they might try to spread their offense, and that
they might go to a no-huddle,'' said Monte Kiffin, the Buccaneers'
defensive coordinator. ``We practiced for all of that stuff. They
didn't do anything to surprise us. I'm just disappointed we didn't
get to Bledsoe more. We must have knocked him down 20 times. There
were five or six other times we should have sacked him and let him
get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``On his touchdown pass (with 3:01 left in the game), we had a
man about a foot away from him when he let the ball go. That was a
bad play for us. Our defense played well the whole game, but we
usually don't give up a big play like that near the end of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw them spread out on offense at the beginning,''
said Buccaneers head coach Tony Dungy, ``we thought they were doing
this to spread us out on defense and try to run the ball more. When
we saw they weren't going to run, we just got after Bledsoe. We
kept the pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the critical factor for Tampa Bay was its ability
to score touchdowns on all three tries inside the Patriots' 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were 31st and last in the league converting
inside the 20,'' said general manager Rich McKay. ``This is why we
made some moves over the winter to correct that situation. If this
was a year ago, we might have come away with three field goals
instead of three touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy brought in a new offensive coordinator, Les Steckel, and
McKay acquired a superstar wide receiver, Keyshawn Johnson, and two
outstanding offensive linemen, Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn did what we want him to do for us; he made several
big third-down plays,'' said McKay. ``And when he isn't making
plays, they still have to respect him on defense. That opens up the
field for some of our other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened up the offense in the second period,'' said Steckel,
talking about the quarter in which the Buccaneers scored two
touchdowns. ``This is not an easy defense to play against. (The
Patriots) did some good things on defense that made it tough for
us. But once we got the third touchdown (to lead, 21-10, in the
third) we shut their offense down. I just wanted to burn the clock.
With our defense, I didn't want our offense to make any mistakes
and help the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defensive front and safety Lawyer Milloy played
well. They put good pressure on Shaun King and tackled well. They
really gave up just two touchdowns, with the third Tampa score
being set up by a Kevin Faulk fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk had a tough day. On several Tampa blitzes, the Patriots'
running back didn't know who to block and Bledsoe paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offensive line has to be beat up,'' said a gracious
Sapp, when asked to assess the New England line. ``They couldn't
stop us today. We got after (Bledsoe) in a hurry. I should have had
him myself three or four more times. I came from the backside and I
didn't think he saw me coming and he just turned his shoulder. Next
time, I'm going to punch him in the back,'' said Sapp, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots won't be playing any defenses as good as Tampa
Bay's the rest of the year. But unless they figure out a way to
give Bledsoe more time to throw, he won't be around to finish the
season.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, a visiting scout was asked if he was timing how
fast Tampa got to Bledsoe: ``I don't have a stopwatch that works
that fast,'' he responded with a laugh. He wasn't far from being
right.

KEYSHAWN STILL PLAYS PATRIOT KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The elegantly understated suit looked like a
giant chocolate Necco wafer. The performance and the post-mortems
were just as subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson, maestro of the outrageous while in the media
maelstrom surrounding the New York Jets, was content to be a
peripheral figure Sunday in and after his Tampa Bay Buccaneers'
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Peripheral figure? Make that a peripheral force. While the
methodology was different, it was no less lethal to the Patriots.
Johnson killed them softly in a 21-16 victory at Foxboro Stadium,
where he had become a billboard-sized villain while wearing green
and white for the first four years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   There were no touchdowns, no histrionics, no grandiloquent
outbursts upon his return to the scene of his most cherished
infamy. But none was necessary. Johnson knows that regardless of
his role, he is genuinely appreciated up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hate me,'' he said with an impish smile.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands that venom is as ephemeral as a Patriots
offensive drive, that only the color of his uniform _ now pewter
and scarlet _ puts him on New England's Most Wanted list rather
than its most coveted list.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd love to have me here,'' he said with a satisfied smile.
</P>
<P>
   Even those pronouncements were delivered without the usual
Johnson bravado. Perhaps it had been excluded from his renegotiated
contract when the Buccaneers gave him an eight-year, $56 million
deal after spending two first-round draft choices to acquire him
from the Jets, who were eager to let him go in hopes of
forestalling a tabloid-sized negotiating impasse down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. Johnson says that while his change of address
represents a case of ``two different cities, two different teams,
two different organizations, totally different people,'' he isn't
in exile off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still gracing magazine covers,'' he said. ``I'm still on
TV, still doing all kinds of interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   And still doing whatever job is placed on his agenda, no matter
how menial. No GQ wardrobe can camouflage the blue collar Johnson
wears to work and always has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same offense here as in New York and college (at
Southern Cal),'' he said. ``I'm totally comfortable in this
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, his statistical contributions were not headliners _ 4
receptions for 64 yards, 1 reverse for 3 yards. But the numbers do
not reveal that every one of his catches produced a first down,
that two of them _ a 27-yarder to the New England 25 in the second
quarter, a 6-yarder to the Patriots 3 in the third _ set up Tampa
touchdowns, that the consistent double-team attention he drew
opened up other avenues for quarterback Shaun King, and that his
relentless blocking was a vital piston in the running machine,
capped by his clear-out of Patriots cornerback Ty Law that set up
Mike Alstott's 3-yard sweep for the winning TD. This was the latest
example of his full effect: What Johnson threatens against a
defense is as vital as what he does to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys who dictates things'' opponents can do,
according to coach Tony Dungy. To new offensive coordinator Les
Steckel, whose idea of offensive daring is a quick kick, even if
Johnson isn't directly involved in the play, his mere presence
``makes a lot of things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   All in a day's work, Johnson believes. ``I'd say I had a good
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Patriots patrons must grudgingly concede, another
successful one.

BROWN BRIGHTENS GRAY DAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Troy Brown is a smart football player.
</P>
<P>
   He's smart enough to know not to do what New England running
back Kevin Faulk did with 33 seconds left in the game _ take a pass
in the right flat from quarterback Drew Bledsoe and then casually
run out of bounds for a 2-yard gain, a yard short of a first down
at the Tampa Bay 26.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Patriots with a fourth down and no timeouts left,
and as wide receiver Terry Glenn later put it, ``We only had three
downs there and we had to burn time off the clock.'' The Patriots
did get the first down, but were left with only 14 seconds after
Bledsoe spiked the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Brown was smart enough to know much earlier in the game
that the Patriots had squandered opportunities created by the
special teams, that a team with a shambles of an offensive line
must take advantage of every chance to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some great opportunities a couple of times in the first
half,'' said Brown, ``and we didn't take adantage of them. I'm
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities were created when Larry Whigham forced a
fumble on the opening kickoff and New England recovered on the
Bucs' 28, then when Brown returned a punt 39 yards after Tampa
Bay's first possession. The Patriots could get only 3 points from
those chances.
</P>
<P>
   So Brown was glum and a man of few words after the game, even
though he returned a punt 66 yards for a TD in the second quarter.
It was the Patriots' first punt return for a touchdown since Dave
Meggett ran back a 60-yarder against the New York Giants Dec. 21,
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bucs) did what they wanted to do,'' said Brown of New
England's feeble offensive efforts. ``They contained us and they
brought four guys up front and . . . boom! And that's what they
did. We couldn't get them out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the New England offensive line played worse than
advertised, the Patriots' attack could do little of anything. But
Brown went out of his way to say the offense's problems were not
limited to the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of everything,'' said the Patriots
receiver. ``They played their style of play and we didn't get
physical enough with them. We didn't get open enough, we didn't
block well enough, we didn't throw well enough, and we didn't run
well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brown was as shocked as many fans that the Patriots
still had a chance to win the game in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well at all,'' said Brown. ``Considering how we
played, it was amazing we still had a chance to win it coming down
the stretch. We just didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown did. Brown displayed why he is one of the most
valuable members of this offense, a fact well known in New England,
but little known in the rest of the football world. On the four
punts he ran back, Brown totaled 118 yards, including that 66-yard
return.
</P>
<P>
   He caught seven passes for 70 yards and gained 33 yards on two
running plays, both reverses. But none of those numbers meant
anything to Brown on a day his team lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed we didn't win the game,'' said Brown.
``I don't care how we win the game, I just want to win it. That's
the most important thing. We didn't do good enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's return was set up by exceptional blocking. Ty Law made a
crisp block and so did Tony George, but the block of blocks was
made by New England's Harold Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw had his back to the punt as he ran downfield, turning back
upfield just as Brown was about to catch the ball. And once Shaw
turned to see what he was facing, he acted decisively, laying low
not one, but two Buccaneers with the same block. With Shaw's block
opening up the middle, Brown was quickly able to shift into fifth
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to block the fullback and the other guy was right
behind him,'' said Shaw. ``When I blocked him, he fell backwards
into the other guy. He sort of bumped into him.''
</P>
<P>
   The special teams had not played exceptionally well in the
exhibition season, Shaw conceded, ``and we had to go out there on
the special teams and try to do something. That's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, as usual, deflected all attention away from his heroics,
saying that any running lanes he found on his two long punt returns
were opened ``by the blockers in front of me. They did a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Brown. Alas for New England, he can't touch the ball on
every play, especially on every crucial one, such as catching a
2-yard pass when 3 yards are needed. Troy Brown would know enough
not to be casual.

BC'S OPENING LOSS WAS QUITE A TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They say West Virginia is almost heaven, but Boston
College's season-opening trip to Morgantown, W.Va., certainly
proved to be anything but for the Eagles after a sobering 34-14
loss Saturday at steamy Mountaineer Field.
</P>
<P>
   BC's hopes seemed doomed from the start when the team endured a
three-hour delay in its Friday departure, an emergency landing of
its Spirit Air charter in Pittsburgh, and a late 10:45 p.m.
check-in at the team's hotel in Washington, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Things did not improve Saturday when, after absorbing a tough
Big East loss, the Eagles were forced to alter their plans to
depart from Clarksburg, W.Va., some 30 minutes away from
Morgantown. Because a flight crew was unable to meet BC's travel
party in Clarksburg, the team was forced to bus back to Pittsburgh,
where a crew and another weather delay greeted them. The Eagles
finally landed in Boston around 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Almost heaven? It was more hellish, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God Almighty,'' BC coach Tom O'Brien sighed, when asked
what time the team finally arrived home. ``I got back to my home
around 10:30.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was happy to see Morgantown disappear from sight,
O'Brien muttered: ``Yeah, I guess so. It's been a long weekend,
that's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   With a veteran offense that was expected to carry a young and
inexperienced defense, O'Brien was disappointed when the offense
went AWOL Saturday. BC managed a meager 206 yards total offense (79
rushing) after committing five turnovers (three interceptions) and
nine penalties for 43 yards, prompting O'Brien to call the
performance ``probably the worst I've seen in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, O'Brien did not back off his harsh
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed my mind a bit,'' he said. ``We just weren't
physical. We were too soft. We were running the ball soft, we were
tackling soft, and we were blocking soft and almost got our
quarterback killed a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, BC's defense, which hung tough for much
of the afternoon before withering in a fourth-quarter West Virginia
frenzy, lost two starters. Junior tackle Antonio Garay and senior
cornerback D.J. Sutton suffered knee injuries and underwent MRIs
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the tests had not yet been evaluated, but indicated
both players were eligible to be redshirted if the injuries were
season-ending.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Brien lauded his young defense, which had at least 11
different players make their collegiate debuts, he indicated that
none of his offensive players received a passing grade following
his film evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody _ nobody _ played well on offense,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to evaluate the performance of fifth-year quarterback Tim
Hasselbeck (14 of 29 for 119 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions),
O'Brien said: ``He was no worse than anyone else. I can't single
anyone out. They all played poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   So, suffice it to say, O'Brien will spend his Labor Day holiday
working to get his team battle-hardened for Saturday's game at
Army. The Eagles, though, will have one advantage: Army will open
its season Monday hosting Cincinnati, leaving the Cadets four days
to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to get back to work this week and get back to
being a physical football team,'' O'Brien said. ``Now if we lose
some guys along the way, we'll lose some guys, but we're not going
to lose any more games because we were not physical. We might get
beat, but we're not going to get outhit like we were Saturday.''

PENN STATE STUMBLES OUT OF GATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Things are not so happy in Happy Valley these days.
Mighty Penn State is 0-2 on the heels of a stunning 24-6 loss to
Toledo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the controversy involving the legal problems of
quarterback Rashard Casey is one thing for coach Joe Paterno. He
can make decisions about right and wrong and people can agree or
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   But what is tougher to take for the Penn State faithful is the
losing, especially to Toledo, which became the first Mid-American
Conference team to beat Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Now things are turning ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Take sophomore running back Larry Johnson's comments after the
game. ``Our coaches have been here for 20 or 30 years and it seems
like things never change,'' said Johnson. ``We run the same
offense. The teams that play us know what we're going to run. They
can pull out the tapes from 1992 or '93 and we run the same
offense. Same plays, same offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows what we're doing. Sometimes, I don't even know
the play and I can guess what's coming. The system is too
predictable. It's been around too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson is also the son of Paterno's defensive line coach,
Larry Sr., Sunday's staff meeting should have been a lively one.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also took one final shot at his own teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best backfield in the nation and we don't have an
offensive line to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Now if you heard the griping at some schools, where
mouthing off is part of the game plan, you might pass it off as
normal chatter after a tough loss.
</P>
<P>
   But Penn State remains Paterno's fiefdom. Very little is said or
done without Joe Pa's consent. Johnson's remarks will no doubt lead
to a clamping down of public utterances by the Lions, who must now
face Louisiana Tech Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And Tech, like Toledo, is another ``watch out'' game. Coached by
Jack Bicknell 3d, Tech does not back off from anyone. It beat
Alabama in Tuscaloosa a year ago and is not afraid to play with the
big boys, Kansas State's 54-10 romp Saturday not withstanding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it did a year ago, the Pac-10 is making an early-season
statement. Unlike a year ago, when the conference was embarrassed
by high-profile nonconference losses, there are plenty of West
Coast smiles today.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal's thrashing of Penn State was a harbinger a week
ago in the Kickoff Classic (though the Nittany Lions' second loss
diminishes that accomplishment somewhat).
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing fluky about UCLA's 35-24 win over Alabama
Saturday. The Bruins were better, quicker, hungrier, and tougher
than the third-ranked Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of more than 20,000 Tide fans in Pasadena,
UCLA took care of business when it had to _ down the stretch. It
was Alabama's first season-opening loss since Southern Miss
prevailed, 27-24, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 can make more noise this week. Washington hosts
Miami, Colorado visits Southern Cal, and Oregon travels to
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only a few days ago, the gloom doomers were predicting dire
things for the Golden Domers. But Notre Dame's 24-10 win over Texas
A&AMP;M has sparked an air of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the death watch on Bob Davie's tenure in
South Bend is on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this will all change if No. 1 Nebraska comes to town
this week and manhandles the Irish as many expect.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on that happening. First, the Irish came out of the
opener with no major injuries, always a plus when you play a
physical team such as A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the game is in South Bend and no one is more dangerous
than an Irish team as a home underdog in a game few people feel
they can win.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear Davie giving his best Knute Rockne ``us
against the world'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go in a short period of time,'' said
Davie, ``because the football team that is coming in next week is
probably as good a team as I've seen in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, but count on Davie milking the underdog role the way
his predecessor, Lou Holtz, did against every team from Nebraska to
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Holtz. There were finally smiles in the Holtz family
when football was discussed Saturday night. After a winless debut
season a year ago at South Carolina, Holtz's Gamecocks won their
opener against New Mexico State, 31-0, snapping the longest losing
streak in Division 1A at 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   The event was so monumental that the fans stormed the field and
tore down the goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're becoming a team,'' said Holtz. ``It's coming and coming
but not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this about Carolina fans. They are loyal to the core. They
had not won a game since 1998, but more than 80,000 fans were on
hand Saturday night at Williams-Brice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut made a valiant effort in its 1A debut Saturday night
against Eastern Michigan. Coach Randy Edsall's Huskies overcame a
24-13 deficit going into the fourth quarter to take a 25-24 lead,
only to see Eastern come back and pull out a 32-25 victory . . .
The weather has played a factor in the first weeks of the season.
Lightning storms forced the cancellation of the Black Coaches
Association game between Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech, while
lightning storms caused a delay in Saturday's Pittsburgh-Kent game
and suspension of the Louisville-Kentucky game with 8:11 remaining
in the third quarter and Kentucky leading, 19-14. After a 74-minute
delay, Louisville came back and won a 40-34 thriller in overtime .
. . Heat, especially in the Midwest, was also a factor. Shows you
what can happen when you begin your season before Labor Day.

REVOLUTION FAIL TO CLINCH PLAYOFF BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Revolution's playoff-clinching celebration was
postponed Sunday. They could have clinched a berth with two games
remaining, but a 2-0 loss to D.C. United forced them into a
position in which they likely will have to defeat either Kansas
City Wednesday or the MetroStars Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those games are at Foxboro Stadium, and the combination
of its narrow dimensions, plus the return of key players, should
boost the Revolution's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Against D.C. United, the Revolution chased the game. Most of
their weaknesses were exposed by a young team which displayed
balance and composure. Second-half substitute Pete Marino converted
twice as a rainstorm moved in, knocking goalkeeper Juergen Sommer
out of the game with a possible broken right ring finger on the
second goal, coming in the 61st minute. Jeff Causey replaced Sommer
and likely will be in goal for the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of national team players Wolde Harris (Jamaica) and
William Sunsing (Costa Rica), as well as Rusty Pierce (suspended),
altered the dynamic which had launched a three-game Revolution
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United was even more debilitated by player absences, yet
adjusted with ease _ partially because of the lack of urgency
caused by having been eliminated from playoff contention. And the
addition of US national team members Jeff Agoos, Carlos Llamosa,
and Richie Williams gave United a balance it had lacked in a 1-0
loss to the Revolution Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have put ourselves in a good position but we didn't
do it,'' Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo said. ``There is
absolutely nothing we can do about it now except to look ahead to
the next game. It's disappointing to lose but our fate is still in
our hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was maybe too quick for us. We were slipping and not
concentrating, reacting to the ball two steps behind instead of
being there. The rain hurt because we don't have the fastest
players, and they were quicker to the ball than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Wynalda made his first Revolution start, and had a goal
disallowed on a close offsides call in the 18th minute. Wynalda and
Jose Luis Morales combined well in the opening minutes but were
increasingly ineffective as the match progressed, partly because of
unfamiliarity, and partly because of a lack of midfield play.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. calmly began building up its offense midway through the
first half. And the Revolution struggled to dismantle the United
attacks. Antonio Otero hit the post from close range with Sommer
out of the net in the 32d minute. Marino grazed the bar with a
sharply angled cross in the 48th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's first goal resulted from an unforced error by Adam
Eyre, who took down A.J. Wood from behind in an attempt to recover.
Agoos curled a free kick to an unmarked Marino, who headed into the
side of the net in the 55th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution resistance crumbled after that. Sommer stuffed a
Bobby Convey breakaway and Wood shot wide in the 59th minute. Wood
ran free on the right and sent a low cross for Marino to convert
two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Revolution had almost no sustained or productive
possession. They had half-chances out of chaotic situations, the
best when John Harkes lifted a shot over onrushing goalkeeper Mark
Simpson that was cleared off the line by Agoos in the 73d minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan was to go in with experienced players and hold the
ball,'' said Ted Chronopoulos, who played defense in a 3-5-2
alignment. ``They are the younger team, and we wanted to make them
run around. We can play more defensively on the road, but we were
lacksadaisical about it. The attitude we are playing with is not
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big field, and they knew how to use it. Maybe we
took them lightly. But we are not in the playoffs, yet. We can't
count on other teams to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sommer left the locker room with a splint on his right hand and
was to have X-rays Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. ``It could be dislocated but the
way it feels and judging by the swelling I think something is
broken,'' Sommer said . . . Causey, playing for the first time
since a 4-1 loss at Columbus July 12, made a spectacular kick save
on Convey in the 67th minute . . . Wynalda said he tired after 55
minutes in his first full game with the Revolution. ``He played
well enough for 60 minutes,'' Clavijo said. Wynalda scored the
first goal for the US in a 2-0 win over Guatemala in a qualifier at
RFK Stadium Nov. 3, 1996, but has not played for the national team
since the US Cup in February . . . Sunsing did not play in Costa
Rica's 3-0 victory over Barbados in San Jose, Costa Rica . . .
Harris was with Jamaica, which met St. Vincent &AMP; the Grenadines in
Kingston Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.

 McBRIDE'S GOAL SHORT-CIRCUITS GUATEMALA  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The US slogged a step closer to the Japan/Korea
2002 World Cup finals, and Cobi Jones revived his status on the
national team in a 1-0 victory over Guatemala Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the US within 3 points of advancing to the
final round of regional qualifying, with games remaining against
Costa Rica Oct. 11 in Columbus, Ohio, and Nov. 15 in Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   But this was an extremely difficult result to obtain, especially
considering that the US had the home-field advantage and the
well-orchestrated support of a crowd of 51,996 at RFK Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The US had to recover from a 65th-minute ejection of Eddie
Lewis, who was sent off by Mexican referee Ulises Rangel after
elbowing Fabricio Benitez. But though that play might have changed
the dynamic in the Chapines' favor, the US instead continued to set
the pace. Brian McBride converted Jones's cross from the right side
on a counterattack at the far post, just past goalkeeper Edgar
Estrada, in the 72d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jones began the day confronting a turning point in his career.
His campaign to extract a multi-million dollar contract from the
notoriously cost-conscious MLS was losing ground quickly. His
status as a national team fixture seemed fragile. But that changed
quickly in the second half as he took advantage of space on the
right wing and made the pass that decided the game. With Lewis and
Earnie Stewart suspended, Jones is certain to make his 134th
international appearance when the US meets Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Arena also made the right moves. Most of Arena's
substitutions in the opening qualifiers at Guatemala and Costa Rica
failed to contribute. But in this match, the changes paid off,
despite the sending-off of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Brien more than compensated for the injured Chris Armas
(ankle), and appears to be a solid contributor for the future.
O'Brien, who turned 23 last week, is the US team's youngest player.
But O'Brien has secured a position with Ajax Amsterdam, the first
American player to start for Holland's most famous club, and he
will be with the US Olympic team in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien added composure and creativity to the midfield, and
seemed even more comfortable than the team's leader, Claudio Reyna,
who departed with a bruised knee after a 78th-minute clash with
Evaraldo Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   The US attack, though, once again displayed its limitations.
Guatemala retreated into defense, both out of good sense and
necessity. The Chapines were missing their top two strikers _
Carlos Ruiz (suspended) and Juan Carlos Plata, who was injured in
the first half. The US found it difficult to break through,
partially because it seemed unsure whether to power through with
crosses to McBride or to allow Reyna to finesse his way.
</P>
<P>
   The match became a war of attrition in the 85-degree heat, and
the US paced itself well enough to remain composed at the end _
unlike when it squandered the lead in a 1-1 tie in Mazatenango,
Guatemala, in July.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US extended its unbeaten streak to 15 games in World Cup
home qualifiers . . . Jones has played in 14 successive games, the
longest streak on the team.

FEAST DAY FOR HUNGRY SAPP

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Warren Sapp weighs 303 pounds. His appetite
is precious to him. Interfere with Warren's meals at your own
peril.
</P>
<P>
   So when he awakened in his Dedham hotel room Sunday morning and
immediately suffered a case of tabloid-induced indigestion, the
Patriots _ particularly Drew Bledsoe _ were doomed. They were
innocent, but somebody had to pay after Sapp rolled out of bed,
read the pregame matchups, and tried to absorb this nauseating
tidbit:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy up here said they handled me pretty well in the
preseason'' when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers faced the Patriots in an
exhibition game two weeks ago. ``I was so sick to my stomach, I
couldn't eat. I was pissed. I've never been disrespected like that
in my whole career. I was already fired up this morning at 9. I
couldn't wait to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   To devour Bledsoe, the sacrificial lamb, the Patriots claim is
an offense.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp showed why he was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year last
season by spearheading a voracious Tampa rush that sacked Bledsoe
six times for 26 yards, applied a life-threatening total of ``15,
16 pressures _ no doubt about it'' in the defensive tackle's
estimation, and generally turned the quarterback into mincemeat.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp spent most of the Bucs' 21-16 victory down Bledsoe's
throat, smothering him for 1 1/2 sacks to share team honors with
left end Marcus Jones. How's that for handling?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had time,'' said Sapp. ``We didn't panic. We just did what
we were supposed to do. Our heart and soul is our defense. We knew
we have the depth at the defensive line. Our blitz just kept
coming. It was just a whole team unit. We get paid to rush the
quarterback and take real pride in it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bledsoe got an endless beating for it, though he never once
insulted Sapp. His tormentor realized that. It was nothing
personal. In fact, he paid belated respect to Bledsoe after the
Bucs defense almost paid their last respects to him.
</P>
<P>
   This Bledsoe, Sapp discovered, was a far cry from the one who
submitted meekly during a 27-7 Tampa home romp three years ago the
last time the teams met in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the heart of a warrior, no doubt about that,'' said
Sapp. ``We've changed our whole perception of him. We thought he
was a happy-feet quarterback that would go down if we got around
him. But he stood in there and took the hits, got right back up and
kept moving his ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a wonder Bledsoe was able to move his body parts, but
darn if he didn't throw a scare into Tampa _ one that traveled 39
yards into the end zone to Terry Glenn in the fourth quarter and
put the squeeze on the visitors by closing the gap to 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The Bucs were not taken aback in the slightest by
this incursion. It seems their defense is always susceptible to a
hiccup, as if it were part of their game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always say that there's one bad play that's going to
come,'' said Sapp. ``We just don't know when it's going to come.
One bad play is guaranteed to happen. It always does.''
</P>
<P>
   But this one wasn't critical. The Patriots' last chance died on
the Tampa 22 when Bledsoe threw the ball out of bounds. He was
under savage pressure and Sapp was right there just to make sure.
He wasn't about to let anything spoil his dinner.

</P>
<P>
   ``THE FRAILTY MYTH''
</P>
<P>
   By Colette Dowling
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   After we tell you about this book, we're going out and throw
some fastballs, just to prove that we can. Dowling (''The
Cinderella Complex'') tells us that second-grade boys throw 72
percent faster than second-grade girls when they use their dominant
arms, but with their non-dominant arms there is no difference in
throwing speeds. In other words, ``throwing like a girl'' means
throwing like a kid who hasn't had much practice, and ``running
like a girl'' and ``hitting like a girl'' belong on the same list.
Historically, girls have been discouraged from developing their
natural athleticism, and Dowling says it has sabotaged them in many
other facets of their everyday lives. She discusses the ``strength
gap'' that has closed consistently since 1972's Title IX ruling on
equal funding for girls sports and implies that soon the gap might
be gone for good. Maybe that's too much to expect, but it's hard to
argue with her indignation or with her pleasure in the fact that at
62 she has outlived the ``frailty myth'' herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``HATS IN THE RING''
</P>
<P>
   By Evan Cornog and Richard Whelan
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   That's Jackie Kennedy on the cover, and she actually looks as if
she's having fun, which might be the greatest measure of how
political campaigns have changed. This volume, subtitled ``An
Illustrated History of Presidential Campaigns,'' begins with that
great anomaly, George Washington, a man
(beginitalic)e(enditalic)(beginitalic)veryone (enditalic)wanted for
president. His vice president, John Adams, was a pricklier sort
with a knack for modern-style politics - according to James
Madison, he ``made himself obnoxious to many, particularly in the
Southern states.'' Cornog and Whelan provide lively accounts of
each election, with an appreciation for the humor of it all.
``Dullness Visible'' is their title for the 1996 campaign of
Clinton, Dole and Perot, and the Bush-Dukakis showdown of 1988 is
dubbed ``Meet Willie Horton.'' Of course, there's no mention of Al
and Dubya, who are writing their chapter as we speak. We think they
should call it ``Are we having fun yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``BODY OF A GIRL''
</P>
<P>
   By Leah Stewart
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   A young Memphis newspaper reporter named Olivia Dale covers the
rape and murder of a woman much like herself. Allison Avery was 24,
a pretty girl who wanted to be famous but became so only with her
grisly death. As Olivia pursues Allison's story and interviews her
grief-stricken brother and mother, her friends, old acquaintances
and boyfriend, she gradually becoming obsessed with the victim and
with what happened to her. Olivia needs to believe that Allison's
death was not a random act. ``I want to know her,'' she says. ``I
could learn so much about what happened to her if just for a moment
I could slip inside her skin.'' At its best, this first novel has
the ominous effect of Susanna Moore's tense, violent book ``In the
Cut,'' but Stewart gives her story a melodramatic and disappointing
ending. Its strengths are in the details: realistic dialogue, a
believable narrative voice and a conviction that, as Joan Didion
once said, reporters ``are always selling somebody out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``FAITH OF MY FATHERS''
</P>
<P>
   By John McCain
</P>
<P>
   (HarperPerennial, $14)
</P>
<P>
   ``In prison, I fell in love with my country. It wasn't until I
had lost America for a time that I realized how much I loved her.''
Set off the fireworks, wave your flags, John McCain's memoir is out
in paperback. For those of you who have been in a closet for two
years, it's the story of his father's and grandfather's illustrious
naval careers and of his own evolution from a bad-boy student at
the U.S. Naval Academy to the injured flier who endured five years
of torture and isolation in a Hanoi prison during the Vietnam War.
The sections on the older men lag, but the book picks up when
McCain himself appears - a brash, rebellious and often dislikable
young man who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the
academy. The story of his prison years is not new to anyone who has
heard his political speeches, but McCain has never told it quite
this well, in a straightforward voice and with occasional and
unexpected moments of droll humor.

 &HT;    BLACK CATHOLICS DEFY THEIR BISHOP(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By Maureen Jenkins and Kerry Fehr-Snyder(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 32 Black Catholics gathered for services on Sunday,
defying the wishes of their bishop who wants them to worship with
the larger ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Community of St. Monica had planned to hold Sunday service
in the parking lot of St. Pius X Mission in south Phoenix but found
the church doors unlocked and open for worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're not wanted, although the bishop never gave us
official notice,'' said Keith Williams, former chairman of the
Office of Black Catholic Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Williams was dismissed from his volunteer duties - a
move he believes resulted from his outspoken stance on Black
Ministry issues. Since then, internal politics and personality
conflicts have come into play.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, African-American Catholics wanting a
Black-centered worship experience have gathered monthly for a
``Unity Mass.'' The service gives the Valley's scattered Black
Catholics a chance to celebrate their faith in the Black and
cultural tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past several months, a Mass also has been held on
the first Sunday of the month, organized by the Faith Community of
St. Monica, a group of Black Catholics eager for more frequent
worship.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Diocese of Phoenix suspended this service,
saying in a recent mailing that the Mass ``has become a tool in an
effort by some to move {hellip} in a direction focusing on
separatism and separation from the Diocese and Office of Black
Catholic Ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cancellation of the Mass, determined worshipers
gathered Sunday for a service at St. Pius, near Seventh Avenue and
Buckeye Road.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the service attracts 50 to 75 worshipers, said
Phoenix resident P.J. Longoni, who goes by the name Almaz Cato.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to call people to let them know we were still having
service,'' she said. ``Some people said they'd come, but others
said they wanted to stay out of the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests and churches within the Phoenix diocese were advised not
to celebrate the Eucharist or provide meeting space for groups not
officially connected to the Black Catholic Ministry office.
</P>
<P>
   The decision confounds member Mildred Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be disobedient,'' she said, adding that she's
been attending the church for more than 50 years. ``Somebody is
going to say why we can't be here, and they're going to give a good
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Black Catholics just want to have services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's trying to be secretive; nobody's trying to do
anything against the diocese or what our Catholic faith is,'' said
state representative Leah Landrum, an active member of the Faith
Community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see a difference from the first Sunday Mass to
the third Sunday Mass. All I see is a beautiful service, and thank
God we have a place we can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Office of Black Catholic Ministry, the third
Sunday ``Unity Mass'' sometimes is a standing-room-only service,
drawing a multiracial crowd and featuring the gospel sounds of the
Freedom Singers. But it's not enough, say some in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Richardson, who said the service is open to all races,
added that once-a-month gathering left him unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to discriminate, we're not bigots, we don't
have a sign out there that says, `Only our own kind,''' he said.
``We've been very successful not only at reaching a lot of
African-Americans but a lot of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks - who comprise less than 4 percent of all Arizonans -
already are a minority within the Catholic Church. Within the
diocese, the 1,500 to 1,800 Blacks are just a fraction of the
440,000 Phoenix Catholics. But members of Faith Community of St.
Monica aren't looking to break away, said Williams, the former
chairman. He pointed to other ethnic ministries within the diocese,
such as Hispanic, Vietnamese, Korean and Polish, which he said are
``left in peace'' by diocesan leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting to stay complete Catholics,'' he said. ``This
(cancellation of first Sunday Mass) is simply to scare people,
defame our name, and keep people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those that want to have Mass once a month, do the
Black thing, and go back to their parish. The rest of us want to
have Mass in our own cultural context.''
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the service was a joint decision by Bishop Thomas J.
O'Brien and the Office of Black Catholic Ministry board, said
coordinator Marie Chavis Ausberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the Mass, it's what the group is doing'' that's in
conflict, she said. ``A Catholic Mass is a Catholic Mass. We'd like
to have the unity, and that's what I'm striving for.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Black Catholics don't comprise a single parish, the
diocese encourages them to be active, visible members of their
neighborhood parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things we can't offer,'' Ausberry said,
``because we're not a parish and don't have the facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Landrum, who chooses not to belong to a parish, can't
understand why only one monthly Mass is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really starting to see the same faces and build a nice
community,'' Landrum said.

 &HT;    DON'T CURSE AROUND MY KID, YOU BLEEP(a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: Moving in ``K'' and ``L'' categories) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DAVE WALKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm no bleeping church lady, but all of a sudden I'm all bleeped
off about public profanity.
</P>
<P>
   It's the parent in me, surfacing at ballgames and in the mall to
spurn foul-mouthed punks who closely resemble the pre-parent Dave
to a startling degree.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: I was once not so careful about self-regulation
in the a-, h-, d-, G-, s- and f-bomb departments. I have used the
worst possible language in inappropriate settings, offending
friends and relatives. They were all, for the most part, adults who
had heard the words before.
</P>
<P>
   I remember most of the exceptions. Usually they were thoughtless
outbursts of cursing around children not my own, and today they
haunt me in ways I couldn't have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   I have also cursed around my own child - no better, I know - but
that usually only happens in the car, and it's never directed at
anybody but other motorists, so it's not my bleeping fault.
</P>
<P>
   Further disclosure: In the appropriate adult settings, sailor
talk still occasionally works its way into a discussion. Newspaper
newsrooms are the only adult setting I frequent with any regularity
anymore, and, OK, it happens there more often than occasionally.
It's seriously veteran sailor talk. Sailor talk with forearm
tattoos of anchors and hula dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a bleep. I don't mind. I'll call you one back, though
louder and using excruciatingly precise diction. As long as there
are no kids or grandmothers around, let's talk dirty. Let's talk
like grown-ups, rap stars, stand-up comics and Nixon aides.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I say ``sailor talk'' and paint an entire branch of
our noble armed forces with a broad brush, probably a
rust-inhibiting hue of gray. There are no doubt a handful of
non-swearing sailors somewhere, and to them I apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I could and can and will curse with the worst of their
mop-slinging sea chums. The First Amendment, after all, is among my
top 10 favorite amendments. Let freedom bleeping ring, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I can hear the political and social conservatives among you
now: This all started with taking prayer out of school or whatever
it is you say whenever pop culture lets you down. Plus, I just
insulted the Navy and those heroic Nixon aides.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my disappointment, however, to be suddenly aligned with
all of you bleeping prudes. For the record, I'm a single-issue
prude, and that issue suddenly is public profanity around children.
</P>
<P>
   No. I can be more specific than that. Public profanity around MY
kid is what bleeps me off. (Despite the fact that, thanks to the
likes of Eminem, there are words my 11-year-old could teach me.)
Not knowing what to do about it - aside from writing bleep-filled
essays in the Sunday paper - bleeps me off worse.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter of another desultory Arizona Cardinals game is
not the time or place to counsel the drunk(s) around you that potty
talk around children is a social faux pas. Same goes for the
bullpen innings of another close Arizona Diamondbacks loss. Telling
someone to shut the bleep up only makes matters worse. This I know
from sad experience.
</P>
<P>
   Trying that tactic at a mall could get you killed. Sporting
events, at least, are staffed by security dudes who can save your
bleep once the fight starts. No such backup will come running
should Mr. Eyelid Ring find your impromptu deportment lesson
wanting. At the mall, the only nearby help you're likely to get
comes from a pretzel-stand assistant manager.
</P>
<P>
   So, next time, here's what's going to happen: I will keep my own
yap shut at least until I find the first available usher or cop or
security guard or authority figure above the rank of pretzel-stand
assistant manager. Then I'll demand to be moved to comparable
seats, immediately. If I'm paying for a seat at an event, I'm also
paying for air space. Clean, unobstructed-by-bleepage air.
</P>
<P>
   I'll make them move us, right now. Make a scene. Make trouble.
It's the only way. I don't want Mr. Bleep kicked out. I don't want
him to get a lecture from a timid usher, who'd rather just be
watching the ballgame anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I want to watch the game without having to cover my kid's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   I'll relax.
</P>
<P>
   Meri Wallace, author and founder of the Heights Center for Adult
and Child Development in Brooklyn, N.Y., said that even the most
tender child is not likely to be permanently scarred by a forced
encounter with profanity. As long as you act like a grown-up
yourself when you deal with such a situation. It's hard, I know,
not to just punch the loudmouth in the nose and run. But I'll be
strong.
</P>
<P>
   When we reach our new seats, we'll talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walk around as interpreters of our environment,'' said
Wallace. ``With children, whatever they're seeing, we help them
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a sports event, you are an interpreter of the behavior (of
others). Say, `Sometimes grown-ups use words they shouldn't, words
we don't use in our home.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, how the child is treated in the home is the thing
that wins out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm no bleeping church lady, but all of a sudden I'm all bleeped
off about public profanity.
</P>
<P>
   It's the parent in me, surfacing at ballgames and in the mall to
spurn foul-mouthed punks who closely resemble the pre-parent Dave
to a startling degree.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: I was once not so careful about self-regulation
in the a-, h-, d-, G-, s- and f-bomb departments. I have used the
worst possible language in inappropriate settings, offending
friends and relatives. They were all, for the most part, adults who
had heard the words before.
</P>
<P>
   I remember most of the exceptions. Usually they were thoughtless
outbursts of cursing around children not my own, and today they
haunt me in ways I couldn't have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   I have also cursed around my own child - no better, I know - but
that usually only happens in the car, and it's never directed at
anybody but other motorists, so it's not my bleeping fault.
</P>
<P>
   Further disclosure: In the appropriate adult settings, sailor
talk still occasionally works its way into a discussion. Newspaper
newsrooms are the only adult setting I frequent with any regularity
anymore, and, OK, it happens there more often than occasionally.
It's seriously veteran sailor talk. Sailor talk with forearm
tattoos of anchors and hula dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a bleep. I don't mind. I'll call you one back, though
louder and using excruciatingly precise diction. As long as there
are no kids or grandmothers around, let's talk dirty. Let's talk
like grown-ups, rap stars, stand-up comics and Nixon aides.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I say ``sailor talk'' and paint an entire branch of
our noble armed forces with a broad brush, probably a
rust-inhibiting hue of gray. There are no doubt a handful of
non-swearing sailors somewhere, and to them I apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I could and can and will curse with the worst of their
mop-slinging sea chums. The First Amendment, after all, is among my
top 10 favorite amendments. Let freedom bleeping ring, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I can hear the political and social conservatives among you
now: This all started with taking prayer out of school or whatever
it is you say whenever pop culture lets you down. Plus, I just
insulted the Navy and those heroic Nixon aides.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my disappointment, however, to be suddenly aligned with
all of you bleeping prudes. For the record, I'm a single-issue
prude, and that issue suddenly is public profanity around children.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, Clay Lange, a foreman at MKB Construction, was
gesturing with his hands to communicate to his Spanish-speaking
workers that a break was over.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating last week from a 12-week Spanish course, Lange
now can simply ask them: ``Estas listo para trabajar?'' to see if
they're ready.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to communicate is important in any work setting -
offices, courts, hospitals. But as more immigrants pour into the
workforce, communication has become a critical diversity issue in
the construction industry, where a misunderstanding can cost money
and even lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we had a problem,'' said John Dusch, safety
director at MKB in Phoenix. ``The fact that we were not able to
communicate with our employees was affecting our productivity and
most importantly, our safety records.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusch said that about 30percent of his 250 employees do not
speak English and 80percent of those workers are of Hispanic
origin, similar to percentages for the 160,000-person industry in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of foreign-born workers is only expected to grow in
coming years in construction and other industries because of the
U.S. labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic workforce nationwide is projected to increase
37percent, to more than 19million by 2008, according to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Hispanic population of 1.1million - the sixth-largest
in the country - accounts for more than 20percent of the state's
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the labor shortage we see contractors having to scramble
for any workers,'' said Darin Perkins, director of the state office
for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ``And
those non-English speaking ones are the most willing to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was only recently that the industry awoke to the
language barriers between English and Spanish-speaking workers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a 23-year-old Mexican national worker Rigoberto
Morales died after he was buried alive in a 20-foot-deep ditch on a
project in Scottsdale. Two other Hispanic workers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA fined Agate Construction Co., Morales' employer, a record
$355,250 for safety violations, including $70,000 for failing to
provide training to the employees. Agate denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement filed with OSHA, Morales' brother,
Clemente, who worked at the site, said through an interpreter, ``He
(Clemente) feels that if his brother had been trained in excavation
safety, then maybe this would have not happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Morales accident, some construction companies either
started hiring an interpreter or, in the case of MKB, decided to
offer language training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we should've been doing five years ago,'' said
Linda Tweten, executive director of the American Subcontractors
Association of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic culture has been a significant one in Arizona for
a long time, now, and I think the industry has failed to recognize
they are an extremely important part of the workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, construction fatalities nationwide accounted for
1,200 occupational deaths, 20percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that
nearly 700, or about 10percent of all workers killed on the job,
were born in other countries. Mexico was the native country of
31percent of those fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
   MKB has sent six foremen and superintendents to its first
12-week language class, provided by Lingo Communications of
Phoenix, and a new group of 12 is expected to start training soon.
The company is also planning an English class for its
Spanish-speaking workers.
</P>
<P>
   Dusch, of MKB, said that after the first class, the incident
rate on job sites had fallen from a few a month to one or even
none.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different culture out there, in Mexico,'' Dusch
said. ``There is no OSHA there. People who come here don't know we
have regulations, they don't realize there are things they cannot
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the people, it's just they've lived in a different
world where they would take all the chances to finish a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to communicate is appreciated on the job sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, there were a lot of instances when the workers would
not understand what to do,'' said Frank Martinez, an MKB foreman
who speaks both English and Spanish. ``They would either come to me
or did what they thought they needed to do. Now, they know exactly
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lange, one of the foremen who took the Spanish class, now
carries with him a binder with the 50 phrases he needs to know and
other terms that help him in his plastering job.
</P>
<P>
   His Spanish-speaking workers correct his accent during lunch
breaks, and they can talk about things other than work.
</P>
<P>
   But when the site superintendent approaches, he can warn them:
``(beginitalic)El Grande Patron(enditalic)!''

   &UR; A STAR CALLED HENRY: Volume 1 of `The Last Roundup' &LR;  By Roddy
Doyle. (Penguin, $14.) The first novel in a planned trilogy
recounts the coming of age of Henry Smart, born into wretched
poverty in the Dublin slums at the turn of the century and caught
up as a teen-ager in the 1916 Easter Rebellion. Before long he is
enlisted by Michael Collins to recruit a rebel army by day and
assassinate the movement's enemies by night. This ``witty, furious
and bitingly detailed story,'' chosen by the editors of The New
York Time Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, plays
subversive tricks with history as it punctures Ireland's national
legend, Richard Eder wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A RAGE TO LIVE: a Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton &LR;  By
Mary S. Lovell. (Norton, $19.95.) The author uses persuasive new
material in her partisan account of an eminent Victorian couple who
offended just about everyone with their many exploits (real and
imagined). Last year the reviewer James R. Kincaid called this ``an
extraordinary biography.''

   &UR; THE FENCING MASTER &LR;  By Arturo Perez-Reverte. (Harvest/Harcourt,
$13.) This novel, set in Madrid in 1868, revolves around one of
Spain's last remaining fencing masters, who becomes reluctantly
involved in political intrigue after an exotic woman hires him as
an instructor. ```The Fencing Master' is a splendid performance,''
Walter Satterthwait wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL: Written by Herself &LR;  By
Harriet A. Jacobs. Edited by L. Maria Child. New edition edited by
Jean Fagan Yellin. (Harvard University, $16.95.) This 1861 slave
narrative, long thought to be either a novel or a ghostwritten
autobiography, but authenticated in 1981 by Yellin, charts the
harrowing sexual exploitation of its narrator. The result is ``one
of the major works of Afro-American literature,'' Henry Louis Gates
Jr. said in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FASTER: The Acceleration of Just About Everything &LR;  By James
Gleick. (Vintage, $14.) From day-trading mania to a Japanese
restaurant that charges by the minute, this fact-filled book
surveys today's hyperdriven society, as well as the pitfalls of
ever-greater speed and connectedness. The result is a ``nimble,
smart, often funny and _ best of all _ fast'' road trip on ``the
autobahn of modern life,'' Barbara Ehrenreich said in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COME BACK, LOLLY RAY &LR;  By Beverly Lowry (Louisiana State
University, $15.95.) The heroine of this 1976 novel is Lolly Ray
Lasswell, a virtuoso high school majorette from a Mississippi
trailer park who enchants _ and later outrages _ the residents of
her small hometown. ``The flashes of Flannery O'Connor-like
toughness are gratifying to the core,'' Joe David Bellamy wrote.
``Lowry's imagination proves sound and patient.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY DATE WITH SATAN: Stories &LR;  By Stacey Richter. (Scribner,
$11.) These tales, populated by rock stars, metalheads and the
Prince of Darkness himself, are bound together by an awareness of
the common humanity underlying our chosen personas, however
eccentric they may be. ``Sometimes very funny, sometimes too
bizarre for their own good,'' the stories display ``a refreshingly
original vision, reminding us at every turn that our surfaces
rarely reflect the depths of our human reality,'' Elizabeth Gleick
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CATFISH AND MANDALA: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape
and Memory of Vietnam &LR;  By Andrew X. Pham. (Picador USA, $14.) The
author, who fled Vietnam with his parents as a child, describes his
yearlong 4,000-mile bicycle trip up the Pacific Coast of the United
States and on through Japan and finally Vietnam, where he embarks
on a painful parallel journey into his family's past. ``At its
finest moments, his narrative becomes a meditation on the state of
loneliness that is everyone's lot in the modern world,'' Adam
Goodheart wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; SOUTH WIND CHANGING &LR; , by Jade Ngoc Quang Huynh (Graywolf,
$16), a Vietnamese refugee tells of his ordeal in a forced-labor
camp during the war, his harrowing escape and his struggle to
create a new life in America. His account ``achieves an unlikely,
powerful blending of lyricism with straightforward descriptions of
cruelty,'' George Packer said in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY SHE LEFT US &LR;  By Rahna Reiko Rizzuto. (Harper Perennial,
$13.) This novel, featuring four different narrators, follows three
generations of a Japanese-American family whose members were
interned during World War II. Last year the reviewer Sarah Saffian
praised the ``simple, lyrical beauty of the language.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 26 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   Abbie Hoffman, Yippie, media performer and author, was the
say-no-to-war, yes-to-drugs face of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and his seven years underground, fleeing a 1973 charge
of dealing cocaine, are the subject of a new film, ``Steal This
Movie,'' which may enlighten young Americans who know some '60s
music but regard his life and times as remote from their own
dot-com lives. The movie's associate producer, Hoffman's longtime
lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, recently said, ``Now you can't trust
anyone under 30.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the Youth International Party, Hoffman died in
1989, in an apparent suicide. His Yippie stunts included scattering
dollar bills at the New York Stock Exchange, causing a near
stampede; plotting to disrupt the 1968 Democratic National
Convention, resulting in him being charged with conspiracy, and
leading to the famous Chicago Seven trial; and nominating a pig for
president.
</P>
<P>
   He became an environmental activist while in hiding. He
surrendered in 1980 and served a brief sentence. Throughout his
life Hoffman wrote, including the letters below to his brother,
Jack, who ran the family's medical supply company in Worcester,
Mass. His correspondence and FBI documents, along with items like
red, white and blue socks, were recently given to the University of
Connecticut in Storrs by his brother.

in the Chicago Seven trial. Judge Julius J. Hoffman had declared
Hoffman, his co-defendants and their lawyers in contempt of court
159 times. Writing to his brother, three days later, Hoffman
describes his sentence of eight months in prison as laughably
lenient. (END ITALICS HERE)

places. Already a (POUND SIGN) of bombs have gone off &AMP; thousands

   Feb. 2?, 1970
</P>
<P>
   I've just been moved out of isolation. Just so the newsmen could
see me in a cage that was clean and neat. It's unbelievable. I was
told it's illegal for the guards to sell mug shots to the
newspapers, yet I'm told our pictures are all in every paper today,
as I predicted. ... The Warden made a special deal with them. It's
so obscene, just like I said in my closing statement: ``Delilah is
waiting in the wings; (our) heads will be shaved just like in Nazi
Germany. Tomorrow they will sell the hair outside the prison
walls.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   I hear on the news now they are bragging they clipped 12 inches
of hair off me. Jerry (Rubin) and I were dragged down 4 floors, but
they don't tell that part. It was the bloodiest haircut in penal
history. The newsmen that come through here are taken on a
whirlwind smear tour with no conversation allowed between them and
us. Everything they write about our stay is untrue and just public
relations bullshit carried on by the Warden's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry (Rubin) and I have lost a lot of weight. The food is unfit
for human consumption. A system of informers and guards is always
present in an attempt to ferret out information. This letter is
even written at great risk because if anything is known, I'll get
isolated and beaten again _ but I must speak out. There are people
in need of medical and psychiatric care who are not receiving it.
If you're not in isolation like I was, there is a bad bed shortage.
Last night, my first night out. I was moved into Dave's ward _ D-1.
I sleep on the bench in the waiting room for there aren't enough
beds.
</P>
<P>
   The warden had orders to cut off our hair now rather than wait
until next week in the event we got bail and were let out on the
streets. ... Jerry (Rubin) and I had to be handcuffed to the chair.
I began to understand for the first time why barber shop poles are
red, white and blue. Those colors have come to represent the sadism
and brutality present in Amerikan thinking and policy.
</P>
<P>
   All Amerika is a prison. The president is a warden and the
people are all inmates.
</P>
<P>
   love,

<P>
   Abbie
</P>
<P>
   I just saw the haircut story on TV and it is a total obscene
lie. I never said anything the way they said except that ``it was
an act of racism.'' They all want to make it sound cute but my
long-haired brothers and sisters will understand the truth of it
and see through their short-haired pig lies.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On Aug. 28, 1973, Hoffman was arrested for
trying to sell $36,000 worth of cocaine to undercover police
officers. About a week later, he wrote to his brother about his
arrest and with instructions for sales of his 1971 book, ``Steal
This Book.'' (END ITALICS HERE)

   Jack:
</P>
<P>
   Well what can I say. It was agonizing to see you through the
glass darkly. It's Labor Day _ hot _ oh, about 105 in here. I'm in
much better shape than when you were here but I have trouble
holding the pen right since my writing finger has a huge bunion
from finishing my last book . ... There's not much I can say about
the arrest in a letter. There is a good chance of a legal defense
based on the theory you and I agreed on when you visited. Things
have made some movement along these lines of investigation and we
could discuss this better if you were in New York when I got out
probably in a week. Meanwhile, could you try to sell the Steal This
Book's (that) you have.
</P>
<P>
   First call Dick Glassman at Irvall Distributors if you can't
reach him, Danny Zimmerman has his number. Danny is at Lancer Books
in New York City (on Broadway). Sell them 70(CENTS) each. If
Glassman doesn't buy them then ship them all, or the remainder, to
Barry Reid in Westminster, Calif. You should have his address from
a postcard I sent you a few weeks ago asking you to send him 600
books.
</P>
<P>
   He's giving me 25(PERCENT) of the profits in a mail order
operation handling everything in my next book. Which is already
completed. We worked out a nice contract with lawyers etc. I'm
counting on ``honor among thieves.'' ... The publisher wants to
print 300,000 now. First run I hope in 2 years Barry could do a
revision of the book &AMP; we'd split profits on it &AMP; all subsequent
ones. ... That way I could have an income for some time.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In February 1974, Hoffman jumped bail and
disappeared, living as a fugitive in the United States and in
Europe until he surrendered in 1980. He uses a pseudonym in the
following letter, which was written on stationery from the St.
Moritz Hotel in New York City, shortly after the death of his
father, John, on March 27, 1974. (END ITALICS HERE)

</P>
<P>
   Hello Jack!!
</P>
<P>
   Sorry we couldn't get together last time you were here in New
York. I was tied up a little. Getting along just fine. Staying out
of trouble mostly. Sorry about you having to take all
responsibility for dad's death but suppose you have some mixed
feelings about it all ... I learned about it peeling off the
bandages. New looks are incredible _ I ... write a lot _ take voice
&AMP; karate lessons to change voice and gait and for discipline. I've
not seen anyone I love for 3 months. Seems forever _ I'm writing a
host of letters to folks now because I plan to go into a more
isolated state than now even in another month and maybe even stop
writing. Although I don't feel too much heat on the scene _ have to
dig in for the long haul. Lawyers all over the world are working on
things but I like it here in U.S. anyway &AMP; want to finish my next
book. It will take at least that. It's good if papa didn't get a
chance to read it. Wrote mama a letter &AMP; assume she showed it to
you. Anxious to hear how you are handling everything. Maybe there's
something I have to sign or something although notarization could
be a problem. Now couldn't it? Lefcourt, by the way, has full power
of attorney for me _ legally &AMP; can sign anything.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Less than a year before his death, Hoffman
was writing a book about George Bush and the 1988 presidential
campaign, including a chapter that was sold as an excerpt to
Playboy about Bush's role in the Iran-contra affair. A postscript
reveals Hoffman's fears of continuing government surveillance. (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   6-1 88
</P>
<P>
   Jack,
</P>
<P>
   Because of the explosive contents of this article &AMP; a pact I
have with Playboy, no one is to make a copy of this article or read
it without you present &AMP; in possession of all the pages. This is
the first chapter of a book by Abbie Hoffman &AMP; Jon Silvers (``The
Faking of the President'') ... The article should present some
serious problems for George Bush. ... Congress may indeed want
another whack at why pre-1985 arms sales (we have tons more
evidence on this point) weren't pursued more vigorously by the past
panels _ that's up to (Rep. John Conyers Jr.) &AMP; Congress ... During
the research, we just felt it was our obligation to our country &AMP;
the truth to do a good a job as we could. But if Bush doesn't lose
500,000 votes on this I'll eat the article raw!
</P>
<P>
   (Postscript) Jack we have every reason to believe the current
administration is on our tail &AMP; don't trust telephones at this
time.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) For all his scoffing at capitalism, Hoffman
showed a passion for marketing and an eye for turning a profit. In
one of his last letters, he discussed his latest ventures. (END

   7/21/88
</P>
<P>
   Jack:
</P>
<P>
   These notes refer to (Contemporary Classics, a publishing
venture) which I think can be a real steady money maker. I got tons
of fans out there _ like a cult rock singer _ who simply aren't
covered by mass distribution techniques &AMP; desperately want stuff. I
auctioned my No Bush ... T-shirt for $65 for a group. Now I want to
start making profit &AMP; need your help.

reach him, Danny Zimmerman has his number. Danny is at Lancer Books
in New York City (on Broadway). Sell them 70(CENTS) each. If
Glassman doesn't buy them then ship them all, or the remainder, to
Barry Reid in Westminster, Calif. You should have his address from
a postcard I sent you a few weeks ago asking you to send him 600
books.

   He's giving me 25(PERCENT) of the profits in a mail order
operation handling everything in my next book. Which is already
completed. We worked out a nice contract with lawyers etc. I'm
counting on ``honor among thieves.'' ... The publisher wants to
print 300,000 now. First run I hope in 2 years Barry could do a
revision of the book &AMP; we'd split profits on it &AMP; all subsequent
ones. ... That way I could have an income for some time.

<P>
   Sorry we couldn't get together last time you were here in New

of trouble mostly. Sorry about you having to take all
responsibility for dad's death but suppose you have some mixed
feelings about it all ... I learned about it peeling off the
bandages. New looks are incredible _ I ... write a lot _ take voice
&AMP; karate lessons to change voice and gait and for discipline. I've
not seen anyone I love for 3 months. Seems forever _ I'm writing a
host of letters to folks now because I plan to go into a more
isolated state than now even in another month and maybe even stop
writing. Although I don't feel too much heat on the scene _ have to
dig in for the long haul. Lawyers all over the world are working on
things but I like it here in U.S. anyway &AMP; want to finish my next
book. It will take at least that. It's good if papa didn't get a
chance to read it. Wrote mama a letter &AMP; assume she showed it to
you. Anxious to hear how you are handling everything. Maybe there's
something I have to sign or something although notarization could
be a problem. Now couldn't it? Lefcourt, by the way, has full power
of attorney for me _ legally &AMP; can sign anything.

serious problems for George Bush. ... Congress may indeed want
another whack at why pre-1985 arms sales (we have tons more
evidence on this point) weren't pursued more vigorously by the past

   The Good News About `Going Postal'
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1986, an Oklahoma postal worker shot and killed 14
co-workers, then himself. In the years since, there have been other
incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by
current or former postal workers.
</P>
<P>
   On Aprril 17, 1994, in his ``On Language'' column in The New
York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ``going
postal'' meant ``losing it'' or ``not being online.'' It was the
first time that ``going postal'' appeared in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is linguistic history. Three-year-olds know what going
postal means.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Postal Service happy about this? Not at all. So, calmly,
it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that _
with charts and myriad statistics _ strikes out at the notion that
your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an
Uzi out of his mail pouch.
</P>
<P>
   ```Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says.
``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually
harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the
national workforce.'' Retail workers, it says, are eight times as
likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.
</P>
<P>
   The study is a serious one. ``The level of violence throughout
the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers
a variety of remedies. But it also seems intent on clearing the
Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is
that it has so many workers _ as a civilian employer, it's second
only to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be rough. A new expression, once it has burst from
the starting gate, is awfully hard to call back. And ``going
Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   A Restaurant That's All Lobby
</P>
<P>
   Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired
someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings
outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci
Gulch. Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and
the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other
Washington restaurant. Thomas H. Boggs Jr., one of its largest
investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father,
Hale, was a Democratic leader in the the House, his mother, Lindy,
a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the
Vatican), provided a simple explanation. So many closed doors, he
said, make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, a Republican, and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a
Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events.
Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits
as business expenses as possible _ 100 percent for a banquet, but
only 50 percent for a regular meal.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael
Brown, the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, as well as
James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign.
It practically guarantees a full house nightly. And if political
junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms
carefully, they might just be able to figure out the
behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the
lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one
of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that
fairly sizzles with accommodation _ a steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   A Missile Defense Strategy That Will Have to Wait  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton left to his successor the decision on whether
to deploy a national missile defense system. He said he would not
do so himself because of test failures and diplomatic disputes. The
president, speaking at Georgetown University, said he had decided
not to act after two huge $100 million tests of the system failed
to intercept incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more time is also needed to find a diplomatic
solution to what has been a growing confrontation between the
United States and Russia and China, staunch opponents to a U.S.
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temps, Unite  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement has long been eager to unionize temp workers
because they are such a fast-growing group and because they often
receive inferior pay and benefits. But for years they were off
limits because they were not allowed to join unions unless the user
company and temp agency agreed _ something that rarely happened.
The National Labor Relations Board opened the door to forming such
unions by ruling that they no longer needed the temp agency's
permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Awards After an Uprising
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 former inmates who were beaten during the 1971
Attica prison uprising will split $8 million as part of a
settlement with New York state, a federal judge ruled. The awards,
which range from $6,500 to $125,000, punctuate a protracted legal
battle stemming from the uprising, in which 43 people died. Still,
the judge said many survivors ``remain casualties because of
lingering physical problems and the inability to erase memories of
Attica.''
</P>
<P>
   No Terminator, Please
</P>
<P>
   The computer scientists at Brandeis University have created the
first robotic system that can design and build other robots with
almost no human help. The technique will merely speed up the
process of designing robots, said Dr. Jordan B. Pollack, a
professor of computer science at Brandeis and one of the
researchers, and sharply drop the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Crime Continues to Decline
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its
lowest level since the government began its annual national crime
survey 26 years ago. Law enforcement officials credited
crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the
street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs.
The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the
Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9
percent. But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and
property crimes committed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The French and Corsica
</P>
<P>
   A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited
self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France's
political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement
to resign in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive
constitutional issue in France. But the plan has also gained wide
backing, including from Corsicans, because it aims to strengthen
moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists, who have
thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Aryan Nations  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to seize the compound of the Aryan Nations, Morris
S. Dees Jr. went to court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Dees, founder of
the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right
suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a
campaign to drive them out of business. The Aryan Nations compound
has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its
82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in
command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a
woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998. Dees'
goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to
surrender their compound in payment.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant Influx in Nevada
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, at least, the future of America seems to be at
the gambling table. The Census Bureau estimated that jobs in Las
Vegas lured so many people that Nevada grew the fastest of any
state in the 1990s, with its population rising 50 percent. Many of
those pouring in to build or staff casinos and hotels were
Hispanics and Asians, the nation's fastest-growing minority groups.
California, though, still has the largest Hispanic population _
10.4 million, up 36 percent in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Eh, Get a Horse
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough week for Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The auto giant admitted it was aware of tire failures on
Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela as early as 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Alameda County, Calif., Michael E.
Ballachey, largely agreed with complaints that Ford knowingly
installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford
vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995. The judge said he intended to
issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles. Analysts estimated
the cost could run as high as $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ford refuted the finding, and predicted it would be reversed on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A New Trial for American
</P>
<P>
   After an election marred by charges of voter fraud, President
Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru no doubt needs all the friends he can
get. That could well explain Peru's decision to grant a new trial
to Lori Berenson, the New Yorker who in 1996 was tried in secret
before masked judges and sentenced to life imprisonment for
terrorism. The case has been a thorn ever since in relations
between Washington and Lima, but human rights officials remained
wary, fearing that a new trial would be no fairer than the first.
</P>
<P>
   A Finding on Death Row  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all Texas murder defendants get a decent courtroom defense.
Not in the case of Delma Banks Jr., who was sent to death row in
1980. His lawyer, a former district attorney, failed ``to
investigate or interview punishment-phase witnesses,'' a federal
magistrate later found. On Aug. 18, David Folsom, a U.S. District
judge in Texarkana, Texas, endorsed that finding, which was first
reported Wednesday in The Texarkana Gazette, and ordered either a
sentence reduction or new sentencing trial for Banks.

   As the soldiers raped and beat her in front of her two children,

   Last month, a federal jury in New York awarded the woman and a

</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Center for Constitutional Rights _ a nonprofit
organization in Manhattan that successfully argued the first such
case more than 20 years ago _ served papers on Li Peng, the former
Chinese premier, who was staying at the Waldorf Towers in New York.
Jennifer M. Green, a lawyer with the center who is arguing the
case, said a group of Chinese students has filed suit in federal
court in New York against Li over the Chinese government's actions
during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the U.S. courts' acceptance of human rights standards
are important steps forward in an international system in which
human rights violators can be held accountable,'' Green said. The
Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return calls requesting
comment last week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the Center for Constitutional Rights sued a government
official in Paraguay on behalf of a family who claimed their son
had been tortured there. The case, Filartiga vs. Pena, was a
landmark attempt to use American courts to judge a dispute that, on
its face, had nothing to do with the United States or its citizens.
To make the argument, Peter Weiss, the center's vice president,
turned to a 1787 law called the Alien Tort Claims Act, which
allowed foreigners to use U.S. courts to sue for violations of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law after an attack on a French diplomat in
Philadelphia, said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of
international law at Harvard who collaborated on a recent article
about the law for the journal Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what was called a badge of honor,'' Slaughter said.
``We wanted to proclaim we were a member of the family of
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, international law consisted of conventions between
sovereign states, and covered issues like piracy and diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Neuborne, a New York University law professor, views the
Nuremberg Tribunals that followed World War II as a turning point
for international law, because the Nuremburg judges found that even
though the Nazis had acted within their own legal framework, they
were not immune from prosecution under a more general law.
</P>
<P>
   ``International law involves individuals and not just
governments,'' Neuborne said. ``Human rights norms trump the rights
of dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude underlies some international criminal cases, like
Spain's pursuit of the former Argentine strongman Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, and the indictments issued by the International War
Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   And since the Filartiga case ended in 1980 _ with a judgment of
more than $10 million for the plaintiffs _ there has been a steady
increase in the number of civil cases brought in American courts by
foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants, Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Application of the Alien Tort Claims Act, and a handful of
similar laws, has extended beyond individual human cases to broader
areas of misconduct, she said, citing as examples claims against
corporations for environmental damage and for actions during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Filartiga case and the Karadzic verdict, many such
cases bring huge monetary awards, but few plaintiffs ever collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people engaged in this type of litigation would say the
power is the power of publicity and the very important symbolic
impact of allowing the victims to tell their story,'' Slaughter
said. ``If they do recover that would be great but that is not the
point of the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few cases likely to result in money changing hands
was filed against Ferdinand Marcos, the former leader of the
Philippines. Robert Swift, who represented 9,539 people who sued
Marcos before his death in 1989, won a $2 billion judgment in
federal court in Hawaii in 1995. The plaintiffs settled with
Marcos' estate and with the Philippines' government for $161
million, Swift said. But he said the payment has been blocked by a
judge in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said that while he recognized the political importance of
such civil cases, that was not his main motivation. ``My
involvement in this whole line of cases is to try to get
compensation for the victims,'' he said. ``I have never been
satisfied with a simple declaration that the abuse occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the largest settlements have involved the cases brought
in American courts by Holocaust survivors against banks and
corporations they accused of profiting from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Although concerns have been raised that the success of the
Holocaust suits could lead to other _ less legitimate _ lawsuits,
representatives of the plaintiffs say it is an important step in
the recognition that certain rights do not stop at national
borders.

SUBMARINES AND THE HIDDEN COSTS OF CLOAK AND DAGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Memphis embarked
on a recent spy mission _ in which, Navy officials have said, it
captured the sounds of the explosions that helped sink Russia's
Kursk submarine last month _ one unsettling precaution was taken. A
bright orange rescue buoy, designed to shoot to the surface and
summon help if the Memphis got in trouble, was welded down and
rendered unusable.
</P>
<P>
   This was standard practice during the Cold War, when the Navy
feared that the inadvertent release of a buoy could tip off the
Russians to the presence of an American spy sub and set off an
underwater chase. It also reflected the grim acceptance among
submariners that if a serious accident occurred in hostile waters,
they probably were not coming back. But now that the two nations
are friendlier, times have changed. Or have they?
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk disaster, with the loss of all 118 men on board, has
cast a harsher light on the secrecy that has continued to define
submarine operations on both sides. It has also raised the question
of whether a little less cloak and dagger _ and more cooperation
among seafaring nations _ could go a long way toward improving the
safety of those on board the vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits die hard. News reports in Russia last week suggested
that the Kursk might have been secretly testing a powerful new
torpedo when it sank in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12. That might help
explain why Russian leaders delayed seeking rescue assistance from
the West, even though a few crew members might have remained alive
for two or three days inside the wrecked hull.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities believe a torpedo accident caused two
explosions aboard the Kursk, with a huge blast from the torpedo's
warhead ripping a hole in the submarine. Pentagon officials said
last week that the Memphis and another U.S. submarine recorded the
explosions while secretly monitoring a Russian naval exercise.
</P>
<P>
   It is natural that the U.S. Navy wants to keep an eye on the
Russian navy. But the United States has sharply cut back the
frequency of surveillance missions since the end of the Cold War,
and the Russians rarely go to sea anymore. So, some critics ask,
why should U.S. submariners still be restricted in their ability to
seek help if a fire or flooding were to cripple their vessel?
</P>
<P>
   Submarine officers have said that if an accident occurred, they
would be much more willing to surface in international waters near
Russia than they used to be. U.S. subs also carry a tiny
communications buoy that can be ejected to transmit an SOS signal
for up to 18 hours. But even if they called for help, who would be
there to rescue them?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said it would have taken two or three days
for them to rush divers and rescue craft to the scene, or about the
same amount of time that it took the British and Norwegians to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   One solution would be for the world's leading submarine navies
to work together to build a new generation of rescue vessels and
position them around the globe. Some Western navies have already
modified their old rescue equipment to work with the U.S. gear.
Experts say Russia will need to cooperate more if such a rescue
network is going to work.

AMERICAN JUSTICE TACKLES RIGHTS ABUSES ABROAD

   As the soldiers raped and beat her in front of her two children,
a Bosnian refugee recalled, they taunted her, saying there was
nowhere she could turn for help.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal jury in New York awarded the woman and a
group of other refugees from the Balkans war $745 million in their
case against the former leader of Serbian forces in Bosnia, Dr.
Radovan Karadzic, charging him with masterminding a campaign of
genocide, rape and torture in the early 1990s.

<P>
   That is just one of a series of recent cases in which American

   Football season is here again, and as anyone who has been to a
high school or college game in recent years knows, this is not your
Aunt Gidget's cheerleading squad anymore. Today's cheerleaders
tumble, vault, build human pyramids _ and sometimes exhibit higher
athletic skill than the teams they're rooting for. Like gymnasts,
cheerleaders work with coaches, choreographers and physical
trainers, often attending summer boot camps to prepare for both the
sidelines and competitions with other squads.
</P>
<P>
   After years of disregard and even ridicule, cheerleading is back
and bigger than ever, with a steely, aerobicized attitude that's a
long way from old-fashioned pom-poms and sis-boom-bahs. This
summer, Hollywood released two major high-school cheerleader
movies: ``But I'm a Cheerleader!'' and ``Bring It On,'' a hit that
depicts cheerleaders as serious athletes and socially responsible
citizens. And cheerleading is being pushed as a potential Olympic
sport in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cheerleading supports an industry of fashion and sports
suppliers, instructors, sports doctors, competition organizers and
glossy publications. ``Where else can a teen-age girl stand up in
front of thousands of people and tell them what to do?'' a
cheerleader asks in an ad in American Cheerleader magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The following excerpts, gleaned from the magazine and its Web
site (www.americancheerleader.com), suggest some of the forces at
play in the brave new world of cheerleader empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Vince Lombardi would have been proud:
Today's cheerleaders are tough as nails and can play with pain.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   To many, falling from stunts represents the adverse side of
cheerleading. Yet in a controlled environment, it's really not!
Cheerleaders should know that without failure there would be no

</P>
<P>
   Serious knee injuries are not just for boys!
</P>
<P>
   Do you need a fun way to get in shape for the summer, but hate
those boring step classes and supermodel workout videos? Try
kickboxing!
</P>
<P>
   Hi! I'm a junior high cheerleader (and) I have an idea: Liberty
turn with advanced stunts. Start facing to the left of the crowd,
go into a lib and do an arabesque, then turn and have your flyer
kick a stretch heel, turn again and your flyer will do a waterfall,
then turn and kick a heel stretch and turn again to your starting
point and pull one more waterfall, then cradle. It's an awesome
stunt. I did it on my first try. Good luck!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Not that the modern cheerleader is
completely squeaky clean. A half-page ad for Glass Chalk, an ink
marker used to make washable graffiti on glass, depicts a
mischievous-looking cheerleader with marker in hand, posed beside
summer-camp snapshots showing windows scrawled with gently taunting
insults against opposing teams. The ad's text says: (END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   What we did last summer: Did you hear about cheer camp? ... We

Chalk does for team spirit! But no worry. It washes right off any
glass window with a wet paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) A little community outreach never hurts,
especially if spreading cheer can raise your squad's visibility.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the complaint time and time again: The cheerleading
team doesn't get enough support. You're athletes, so why does all
of the attention focus on football and basketball and not on you?
You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   While the student body celebrates the biggest game of the week,
they probably don't even know that your golf team is undefeated and
your swim team is ranked first in the state. As the spirit leaders
in your school, you can help gain support for (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)
every (END ITALICS HERE) sport and bring added attention to the
cheer squad in the process. A fall sports pep rally dedicated
strictly to these athletes will show them they are important to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And hey, don't we all want to share that
invincible team spirit? Even trumpet players and classroom
wiseacres are vulnerable.(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes say that the cheerleaders and the band never get
along. Here are some suggestions to help make you and the band a
spirit unit: Teach them some cheers. ... Put them on the sidelines
with you. ... Invite a few down to do one of your cheers with you,
maybe in the later part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And you know that kid in your history class who always keeps
everyone else laughing? Invite him or her to use those ``class
clowning'' skills and join you on the sidelines, running back and
forth painted in school colors and flashing ``Go! Fight! Win!''
signs to get the crowd to yell along with you.

HERE) It was sooo awesome. You can't believe what a little Glass
Chalk does for team spirit! But no worry. It washes right off any
glass window with a wet paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) A little community outreach never hurts,
especially if spreading cheer can raise your squad's visibility.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the complaint time and time again: The cheerleading
team doesn't get enough support. You're athletes, so why does all
of the attention focus on football and basketball and not on you?
You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   While the student body celebrates the biggest game of the week,
they probably don't even know that your golf team is undefeated and
your swim team is ranked first in the state. As the spirit leaders
in your school, you can help gain support for (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)
every (END ITALICS HERE) sport and bring added attention to the
cheer squad in the process. A fall sports pep rally dedicated
strictly to these athletes will show them they are important to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And hey, don't we all want to share that
invincible team spirit? Even trumpet players and classroom
wiseacres are vulnerable.(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes say that the cheerleaders and the band never get
along. Here are some suggestions to help make you and the band a
spirit unit: Teach them some cheers. ... Put them on the sidelines
with you. ... Invite a few down to do one of your cheers with you,
maybe in the later part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And you know that kid in your history class who always keeps
everyone else laughing? Invite him or her to use those ``class
clowning'' skills and join you on the sidelines, running back and
forth painted in school colors and flashing ``Go! Fight! Win!''
signs to get the crowd to yell along with you.

MAKING A DENT IN THE DEMAND FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   When Andres Pastrana, the president of Colombia, said last week
that the key to winning the war against drugs was taming demand in
the United States, he ruffled some American feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was timing: President Clinton was about to
hand him a check for $1.3 billion in aid to train and outfit a new
Colombian anti-drug brigade. But Pastrana's words also rankled some
people because they took no account of the myriad demand-reduction
programs that are already in place in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the office of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White
House drug czar, have a landslide of little-noted statistics that
show domestic demand for drugs has plunged. Use of cocaine, both
crack and powder, has decreased by 70 percent in the last 15 years,
said Bob Weiner, a spokesman for McCaffrey. Consumption of all
drugs by youths aged 12 to 17 went down 21 percent from 1997 to
1999, Weiner said. And while drug use went up among people 18 to
25, it was still far below what it had been 20 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have to do a better job of making certain that
Latin American nations, for one, understand that we have a strong
demand-reduction program in place and that it's working and
successful,'' Weiner said. The programs range from a national
campaign to put anti-drug commercials into movie theaters to having
federal agents talk in classrooms and office parks about the
dangers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are mirrored by a network of local programs around
the country. Many were modeled after those pioneered by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office. That office, which spends a
good deal of time making cases against dope dealers and crack
addicts, has in the last decade also focused on getting drug felons
into treatment programs, as well as educating the young about the
perils of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear that the problems Brooklyn was having when I
took over this office could not be addressed by law enforcement
alone and needed something other than a traditional approach,'' the
district attorney, Charles Hynes, said last week from San
Francisco, where he was speaking at a conference on drug treatment
programs. ``And if drugs were the operative reason for the crime
increase, then something had to be done about demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of his efforts is a program called D-TAP, or
Drug Treatment Alternative to Prison, which was the first of its
kind in the nation when it was introduced in 1990, the first year
of Hynes' tenure. Under the program, people convicted of
nonviolent, drug-related crimes may choose between going into
treatment or going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DA said I'm going to take this population that would
otherwise end up in prison and divert them into treatment,'' said
Anne Swern, a deputy district attorney who runs D-TAP. ``If they
fail the program, they go to jail. But what we've found is that
D-TAP can deal with these people with risks to the public that are
low and benefits that are very high both financially and
recidivism-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Swern said about 50 percent of the people sent to prison in
Brooklyn for drug crimes since the program started were re-arrested
after three years, while only 23 percent of those who had entered
D-TAP were back before a judge over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The program has saved millions of dollars in taxpayer money,
too, Swern estimated. She said it cost $69,500 a year to house an
inmate with a drug habit on Riker's Island, the city's largest
jail. And it cost $82,000 a year, she said, to hold a criminal in
New York City before his trial and then imprison him in an upstate
cell. But to treat a convict for drug abuse, even in New York state
_ which has the highest such costs, she said _ takes between
$18,000 and $21,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes also requires every prosecutor in his office to spend at
least two days each month talking to students in more than 300
schools in Brooklyn about the consequences of using drugs. This
initiative, called Legal Lives, teaches children that there is a
price to pay for snorting cocaine or smoking pot by having them act
out situations they are certain to encounter on the street.
</P>
<P>
   In one script, ``Pot Luck,'' three youths are hanging out in the
schoolyard after class, and one pulls out a joint. They light up.
Then the cops arrive, and everyone is arrested. ``We stop the
action there and ask the kids questions,'' said Mary Hughes, who
runs the program. ``Why was Bob arrested? Why was Ernie arrested?
Did the police have a right to arrest them? Why? What choices did
everybody make?''
</P>
<P>
   So as it turns out, crime-busters, from Hynes' office to the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, are, in fact, in agreement
with Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the DEA as the guys who throw people in
jail,'' said Jack Hook, who runs the agency's demand-reduction
section. ``But the bottom line is that to solve the drug problem in
this country means education, prevention and treating those who are
already addicted.''

WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT? LIEBERMAN AND THE RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twelve years ago, lashing out at his opponent, Sen.
Lowell Weicker accused Joseph Lieberman of espousing the ``Jesse
Helms-Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson platform'' by advocating a moment
of silence in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Was Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew and political moderate, somehow
aligned with a group Weicker characterized as the ``extreme right
wing''? Connecticut voters apparently ignored the charge, and a few
months later Lieberman was sitting in Weicker's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, many of those same religious conservatives
found themselves admiring Lieberman's advocacy of a spiritual
foundation to American public life, even as they wondered how he
got away with saying it. Now the Democratic vice-presidential
candidate, Lieberman has continued to espouse a greater role for
faith, but was rebuked by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith only when he suggested last Sunday that belief in God is the
basis of true morality. The group said such an appeal ``is contrary
to the American ideal.'' Lieberman later backed away from his
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians from divergent political strata quickly came to
Lieberman's defense, saying they had been advocating the same
things for years yet they had been vilified. Forest Montgomery, of
the National Association of Evangelicals, said members of his group
were ``very comfortable with everything the senator's been
saying,'' even as they chafed at a double standard applied by the
news media. The Rev. Dr. Richard D. Land, president of the Southern
Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said he was
delighted at Lieberman's stance, but added that if an evangelical
Christian had said the same things, he would have been accused of
promoting theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remains, in the national media and many of the country's
elites, an extreme prejudice against evangelicals, who are seen as
threatening,'' said Land. ``But just as it took Nixon to go to
China, maybe it will require an Orthodox Jew to restore to its
rightful place the role of religion in this society. Because if it
desirable for an Orthodox Jew to say these things, it should
certainly be kosher for an evangelical or a Roman Catholic to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, Lieberman's message _ and his nature as a
messenger _ is substantially different from that of Christian
conservatives over the last 20 years. Evangelicals believe that
their mission is to spread the Gospel of Jesus to all nonbelievers;
the Southern Baptist Convention's Web site describes its ``strategy
for evangelizing the world'' by ``aggressively pursuing converts.''
As a Jew, without a sectarian mandate to proselytize, Lieberman
bears none of the baggage of the religious salesman, and is thus
more palatable to a wider public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there's no fear that he will evangelize or poke into
your personal affairs, he sets up a perfectly designed
experiment,'' said Alan Wolfe, director of the Center for Religion
and American Public Life at Boston College. ``Now we'll be able to
see how much American unease there is about the subject, once they
don't have to worry about the intrusiveness of the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a carefully calibrated blandness, too, about
Lieberman's presentation that is designed to appeal to a wide
audience. Many religious scholars say the senator's airy, almost
generic souffle of faith and policy recalls an older, nonsectarian
spiritual underpinning to government that has stronger roots than
the hard-edged prescriptions of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives have linked their beliefs to a set of
specific policies that do not always enjoy widespread support, such
as an opposition to abortion, a rejection of homosexuality or
support for school prayer. Lieberman says his support for
subsidizing medication for the elderly grows out of the Fifth
Commandment's insistence on respect for parents. But in general he
has not invoked faith to justify any measure that is considered
politically divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans like to have their politics informed by
morality, and their morality informed by religion, but they don't
believe religion should be used by politicians to justify a
particular piece of legislation,'' said Martin E. Marty, the
religion historian. ``Lieberman is very much in that mild tradition
of Dwight Eisenhower, trying not to disturb anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In stressing the religious foundation of American society and
government, Lieberman is advocating what has been called the
country's ``civil religion,'' the spiritual but nonsectarian ties
that bind America's majority of believers, of whatever faith. The
term, which originated with Rousseau and was modernized by the
sociologist Robert N. Bellah in the 1960s, encompasses the basic
beliefs that led the Founders to proclaim that the Creator had
endowed man with certain ``inalienable rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the common stock of political thought in the 18th
century,'' said Bellah, co-author of ``Habits of the Heart''
(University of California Press, 1996) and a sociologist at the
University of California in Berkeley. ``As Tocqueville wrote, a
religious foundation was particularly necessary in a democratic
society, because it depends on the self-control of its citizens.
Without those inner guidelines, democracy would never have
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But faith can be used to justify any number of political
positions, and over time, Americans have learned to be
uncomfortable with that. In the early years of this country,
ministers cited passages in the Bible to justify slavery. In the
20th century, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. grounded the
civil rights movement in the same document. Today, in South
Carolina, there are religious people on both sides of a proposed
state lottery for education that is on the ballot in November. Many
religious opponents of abortion believe Lieberman is a hypocrite
for advocating faith while supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voting record on abortion is in direct contradiction to
the teaching of his faith,'' said Holly Gatling, executive director
of South Carolina Citizens for Life. ``Where is his faith when it
come to the unborn?'' Lieberman has said that Orthodox Judaism
considers abortion to be a personal matter, although many Orthodox
Jews disagree.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those unhappy with the senator's votes are still
pleased that he has cast them in moral terms, convinced that he has
now opened the doors for others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the Lord says we should vote a certain way is a
debasement of religion that verges on sacrilege,'' said the Rev.
Richard John Neuhaus, a Catholic priest who is editor of First
Things, a conservative religious journal. ``But there's nothing
wrong with making policy proposals in frankly moral terms, which
used to be the norm in this society. The only thing strange about
what Lieberman is saying is that people think it's strange.''

A RISING TIDE, BUT SOME BOATS RISE HIGHER THAN OTHERS

<P>
   For the labor movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the
nation's growing income gap. John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO
president, frequently complains in speeches that the economic boom
under President Clinton has left millions of hard-working Americans
behind and that corporate chieftains have rewarded themselves
richly while downsizing their work forces and clamping down on
wages.
</P>
<P>
   To fan the flames of blue-collar and white-collar discontent,
the labor federation has set up a Web site (www.paywatch.org) that
shows workers how many hundreds of times more the CEOs at their
companies earn than they do.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Vice President Al Gore, who has borrowed much of
labor's class-edged, us-against-them rhetoric, with an eye to
making America's steel-mill workers and truck drivers feel
enthusiastic about his candidacy. Gore rails against the powerful
and declares himself the champion of working families. Intending to
please the have-nots and the have-littles, Gore says he will oppose
``a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.''
In his embrace of labor, Gore plans to speak alongside Sweeney in
Pittsburgh on Monday, Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But while co-opting some AFL-CIO rhetoric (Sweeney's favorite
phrase is ``working families''), Gore steers clear of the income
gap, which only widened on his and Clinton's watch.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration points to statistics showing
that the gap has grown far more slowly than under Presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, recent trends are still daunting. Last
year, it took 100 million of the lowest earning Americans to equal
the after-tax dollars of the top 1 percent. In 1977, it only took
49 million of the lowest earners to equal the top 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another politically embarrassing nugget: the bottom four-fifths
of households _ numbering 217 million _ took a thinner slice of the
nation's economic pie last year, 50 percent, than in 1977, when it
was 56 percent. One reason, according to data from the
Congressional Budget Office, was that nine-tenths of the growth in
the economic pie since then went to the richest 1 percent of
households, which last year averaged $515,600 in after-tax income,
up from $234,700 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign heating up, labor leaders have been bringing
up the income gap less frequently, partly because focusing on it
might embarrass their preferred candidate. In an interview, Sweeney
said that he had not forgotten the issue, but that many of the
forces spurring the gap were largely beyond the control of the
Democratic administration. For instance, rapid technological change
and the decline in manufacturing have wiped out millions of
unskilled jobs and have thus held down wages for many low-wage
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney praised the Clinton-Gore team for pressing for
legislation that would reduce the income gap, both pre-tax and
after-tax. He cited the administration's push for a higher minimum
wage, more money for job training and billions of dollars for an
expanded Earned Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO president added that he expected the Republican
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, to do considerably less
than Gore to help middle-income and low-income Americans. Bush has
repeatedly asserted that his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut will do
far more for the middle class than Gore's proposal for a smaller,
focused tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush campaigned with a $40,000-a-year teacher and high
school coach from Louisiana, Andrew Beechac, who hailed Bush's tax
proposal, saying: ``We all want tax relief, especially for my
family and for middle America around the country. We really need
this plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a pollster who often advises the AFL-CIO,
predicted that workers concerned about the income gap would be
unlikely to favor Bush. ``The concern about Bush among AFL-CIO
members,'' he said, ``is that he will be a rich man's president and
will have the kinds of policies that are designed to let the
well-to-do have all the benefits of the economy. And they think
Gore will be much more likely to spread the benefits around.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that Bush's policies would widen the gap, labor
leaders point to his proposal to allow individual states to opt out
of any increase in the minimum wage beyond the current $5.15 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Some unions _ most notably the Teamsters, one of the few not to
endorse Gore _ are not willing to give the vice president a pass on
the swelling income gap. For these unions, globalization and freer
trade are among the biggest factors behind the widening gap. James
P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, has often argued that trade
liberalization measures, like the administration-backed China trade
bill, encourage a flood of imports from low-wage countries and an
exodus of American jobs. These developments, Hoffa said, and many
free-trade economists acknowledge, help hold down blue-collar wages
and thereby worsen the income gap.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has sought to convince the Teamsters that the best way
to reduce income disparities is to elect a Democrat. ``Many of the
initiatives the administration has taken to spread the wealth more
fairly, like increasing the minimum wage, have consistently been
blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress,'' he said.

MOST PRESIDENTS HAD A COUNSELOR. ONE HAD A SHRINK. 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The only president whose wild mood swings prompted
his own secretary of defense to issue orders designed to block him
if he called out the Marines for protection against impeachment is
also the only president known to have been treated by a
psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   That president was Richard M. Nixon, and both of those
experiences are chronicled in ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret
World of Richard Nixon,'' by Anthony Summers (Viking). And while
other accounts in his book, including episodes of wife-beating and
pill-popping, are angrily contradicted by Nixon's defenders, the
revelations about the secret order and the president's psychiatric
treatment have not been widely disputed.
</P>
<P>
   But they raise important questions. While the physical health of
presidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public
discussion, the overwhelming majority of politicians still hide
their mental difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is purely anecdotal, but talking to psychiatrists
in Washington, it is clear that while there have been some changes
since Nixon's time (when his therapist, Dr. Arnold A. Hutschnecker,
visited the White House rarely and used false destinations when he
signed in), they have largely been around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Solomon, a practicing psychiatrist here since the early
1960s, said, ``I don't think the politicians are any more eager,
more relaxed than they used to be about therapy for themselves.''
But, he said, they are ``a lot more willing to have family members
get help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition of usefulness for psychiatric care for family
members is just moving along just fine,'' he continued. ``Marital
counseling is sought by a number of people, and there is
recognition in general that mental health problems can be just as
disabling as physical health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who has crusaded for legislation
to force insurance companies to treat mental health the same as
physical health, recalled a meeting at Vice President Al Gore's
house a few years ago about a proposed bill. More than 30 senators
were there, most with their spouses. They spoke ``very personally
about members of their own family or close friends who struggled
with mental illness, but not to the point of talking about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists here say they understand why politicians fear
disclosure. Dr. Dorothy Starr said, ``I think there remains a good
deal of uncertainty in the public mind about people who have been
mentally ill.'' Another psychiatrist, Dr. Harvey Rich, said, ``We
hold our politicians up to a different kind of standard _ you can't
have a weakness of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, who was a Seattle psychiatrist before coming
to Congress and who has referred other members of Congress to
psychiatrists, said the fear of being found out discouraged others
who talked to him about getting help.
</P>
<P>
   But the experiences of those politicians who have publicly
acknowledged mental illness _ in each case treatment for depression
_ raise questions about that widespread fear. Sen. Thomas Eagleton,
who was dropped as a vice-presidential candidate in George
McGovern's campaign in 1972 after failing to disclose electroshock
treatments for depression, was re-elected to the Senate in Missouri
in 1974 and 1980. Lawton Chiles, who left the Senate in 1989,
recovered from depression and was twice elected governor of
Florida. And three current members of the House _ Reps. Lynn Rivers
of Michigan, Nydia Velazquez of New York and Patrick Kennedy of
Rhode Island _ have survived such disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a high-profile campaign tried to damage an
opponent by accusing him of seeking psychiatric help was in 1988,
when George Bush's presidential campaign and President Ronald
Reagan sought to discredit Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
nominee. John Deardourff, a longtime Republican consultant, said he
believed that ``there are enough people in both parties'' today
``who would speak out against anybody who tried to raise that issue
against a candidate that it would be very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, said it could make a
difference what office a politician was seeking. For a
congressional candidate, he said, the examples of entertainment and
sports figures suggested disclosure was safe, phrased in terms of
``Here's a challenge that I faced.''
</P>
<P>
   But a candidate for president, he said, ``faces a tougher
barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Deardourff agreed, saying the public understands that the
presidency is an ``intensely demanding job demanding mental
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Goodwin, a former head of the National Institute of
Mental Health, said it was important to distinguish between
different sorts of mental illness _ a treatable depression is one
thing and schizophrenia another. ``I don't think the public
concerns are entirely unfounded,'' Goodwin said. ``When we fight
stigma, we shouldn't pretend that mental illnesses are just the
same as physical illness. If you're talking about a disorder that
affects thinking, behavior, that's different from high blood
pressure or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the public is uneasy about something, their views may be
exaggerated, there may be a lot of irrationality, a lot of fear.
But when it's pervasive and hangs around, the public is at least
partially on to something.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon pointed out that some politicians, like President
Clinton, publicly engage in spiritual counseling while rejecting
psychiatric help. And even those who discuss mental illness often
do so using murky terminology. ``They also pick their words very
carefully, like `counseling,' not `therapy,''' he said. ``They get
medication from their internal medicine doctors, like Vince Foster
did, but didn't really want to see a psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tipper Gore, praised by one psychiatrist after another for
discussing her depression and treatment last year, spoke of
``counseling.'' And when an article in The New York Times Magazine
in 1993 described the family therapy received by the Gores after
their son was struck by a car and nearly died, the vice president's
office complained that the article should not have said he had
weekly visits from a ``therapist,'' but from a ``facilitator.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 3, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-SECRETS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee
raises a troubling question: what's really secret anymore? The
surprising answer is a lot. Some restricted data is deemed so
sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into
foreign hands. By William J. Broad. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   MOSQUITOES-GLOBALIZATION-REVIEW (Paris) _ Mosquitoes and efforts
to control them are at the nexus between the poor, infected world
and the rich, scared one. A look at how globalization has
intensified the spread of mosquitoes, exposing rich countries to
the same hazards as poor lands. By Donald G. McNeil. (Moved in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLS-MENTAL-HEALTH-REVIEW (Washington) _ New disclosures of
President Richard M. Nixon's purported drug abuse and mental health
problems raise important questions. While the physical health of
presidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public
discussion, the majority still hide their mental difficulties. Vast
increases in the willingness of ordinary Americans willing to seek
mental health help and talk about it have not been reflected in the
political class. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   UNIONS-INCOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ For the nation's labor
movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the nation's growing
income gap. But as the presidential campaign has heated up, labor
leaders have begun speaking out less than usual about the income
gap partly because focusing on it might embarrass Vice President Al
Gore, since the gap continued to widen under the Clinton
administration. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ After years of disregard
and even ridicule, cheerleading is back, bigger than ever _ and
with a sassy, teeth-baring attitude that's a long way from
old-fashioned pom-pom waving. Excerpts from recent issues of
American Cheerleader magazine suggest some of the forces at play in
the brave new world of cheerleader empowerment.
</P>

   ABBIE-HOFFMAN-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The late radical activist
Abbie Hoffman is the subject of a new film ``Steal This Movie,''
which may enlighten young Americans who know some '60s music but
regard his life and times as remote from their own dot-com lives.
Throughout his life, Hoffman wrote letters to his brother, Jack,
who ran the family business in Worcester, Mass. Some excerpts from
the letters provide rare insight into Hoffman.

<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RELIGION-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman's
emphasis on America's need for religious values in public life has
made him popular with the Christian right and raised some concern
among many with more moderate religious views. But Christian
conservatives believe they have a mission to spread the gospel of
Jesus to non-believers, while Lieberman, as a Jew without a
sectarian mandate to proselytize, bears none of the baggage of the
religious salesman, and is thus more palatable to a wider public.
By David Firestone.

<P>
   ANTIDRUG-PROGRAMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said the key to winning the war on drugs was taming
demand in the United States, he ruffled some American feathers, in
part because he took no account of the myriad demand-reduction
programs already in place. A look at some of those efforts. By Alan
Feuer.

<P>
   NUCLEAR-SECRETS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee
raises a troubling question: what's really secret anymore? The
surprising answer is a lot. Some restricted data is deemed so
sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into

<P>
   MOSQUITOES-GLOBALIZATION-REVIEW (Paris) _ Mosquitoes and efforts
to control them are at the nexus between the poor, infected world
and the rich, scared one. A look at how globalization has
intensified the spread of mosquitoes, exposing rich countries to
the same hazards as poor lands. By Donald G. McNeil. (Moved in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLS-MENTAL-HEALTH-REVIEW (Washington) _ New disclosures of
President Richard M. Nixon's purported drug abuse and mental health
problems raise important questions. While the physical health of
presidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public
discussion, the majority still hide their mental difficulties. Vast
increases in the willingness of ordinary Americans willing to seek
mental health help and talk about it have not been reflected in the
political class. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   UNIONS-INCOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ For the nation's labor
movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the nation's growing
income gap. But as the presidential campaign has heated up, labor
leaders have begun speaking out less than usual about the income
gap partly because focusing on it might embarrass Vice President Al
Gore, since the gap continued to widen under the Clinton
administration. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ After years of disregard
and even ridicule, cheerleading is back, bigger than ever _ and
with a sassy, teeth-baring attitude that's a long way from
old-fashioned pom-pom waving. Excerpts from recent issues of
American Cheerleader magazine suggest some of the forces at play in
the brave new world of cheerleader empowerment.

   PARIS _ Many passengers flying out of Africa are familiar with
the ritual: the doors close and the flight attendants ask those
wearing contact lenses to shut their eyes. Some passengers pull
blankets over their heads. Then they pop the tops on two cans of a
sickly sweet aerosol and walk quickly down the aisles, a white
cloud billowing behind them which the air-conditioning quickly
dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   This is mosquito control at the nexus between the poor, infected
world and the rich, scared one. The spray is meant to kill any bugs
that slipped in while the doors were open; a long-lasting fumigant
is used in the luggage hold.
</P>
<P>
   There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes in this world. Luckily for
mankind, only a few relish human blood. No one knows how many germs
and worms _ from viruses to bacteria to parasites _ are loose in
the bloodstreams of other animals, but it's even luckier that only
a few can survive back-to-back assaults by the mosquito digestive
system and the human immune system and emerge as an illness.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the arrival of the West Nile virus last
year brought home just how unpleasant an unlucky series of
coincidences can be when the right mosquito for the job is around;
of the 62 cases last year, seven were fatal. Seven cases have been
reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the indestructible cockroach is the Sherman tank of the
insect kingdom, the fragile mosquito is its DC-7, a pioneer in
linking the world by air. Most mosquitoes don't fly five miles in
their lives, but a few have joined the jet age. Just last month the
World Health Organization in Geneva issued a warning about
``airport malaria.''
</P>
<P>
   France leads the world, with 26 cases since 1970, a few of them
fatal, among people who had never visited a malarious country but
who lived near airports or worked at them. They were probably
bitten by stowaways disembarking from flights from West Africa. In
a 1994 outbreak, epidemiologists counted six malaria cases in three
weeks near Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, and calculated that 8
to 20 anopheles mosquitoes had been on each of 300 arriving
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the dangers of globalization,'' said Dr. David L.
Heymann, director for communicable diseases at the World Health
Organization, although he was quick to point out that humans carry
disease around the globe more effectively than mosquitoes do.
</P>
<P>
   To stop mosquitoes, European nations have stepped up their
spraying of airplanes; U.S. carriers hesitate, public health
experts say, even on obviously dicey routes like some Caribbean
flights because of fears of litigation from passengers claiming
reactions to the aerosols, which the WHO considers safe.
</P>
<P>
   Countries in northern climes have built-in barriers. As the old
medical adage goes, ``The world's best public health policy is
winter.'' And until a cold snap arrives, rich nations have
protection that citizens of poor tropical nations often cannot
afford: air-conditioners, window screens, window glass and bug
repellent.
</P>
<P>
   What poor nations have are trucks puffing out pesticide _
something New Yorkers are now enduring as West Nile reaches Central
Park. Poor nations also still spray DDT on inside walls because it
is cheap, persistent and lethal. If the United States is not
careful, the use of that old resource, now banned, could return,
too. Americans forget that yellow fever was once endemic in the
country and that mosquito species capable of spreading malaria are
found as far north as Boston in summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito hitchhikers predate not only the jet age but the steam
age. The African species Aedes aegypti, an avid man-eater with the
power to carry both yellow and dengue fever, probably reached South
America in slave ships. ``The eggs lived in the water containers
and the live ones fed on the populations on board,'' said Michael
Nathan, an entomologist with the WHO. ``A lot of slaves and a lot
of crews died of yellow fever on the way over.''
</P>
<P>
   Global commerce has sped up species transfers. Used tires sent
for retreading are thought to be the vehicle for Aedes albopictus,
the aggressive ``tiger mosquito'' that reached the United States
from southeast Asia 20 years ago and is found as far north as
Minnesota. It does not usually carry fatal diseases in the United
States, but can.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is the riskiest candidate, but not the only one. Besides
West Nile virus and its St. Louis and Japanese relatives, yellow
fever, dengue fever and elephantiasis can all be injected by
mosquito saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes are easy to hate, but there is no public health value
in blaming them alone, particularly for West Nile. Since it
survives in birds, West Nile could have entered in imported birds.
Or in a gull blown far off course or, conceivably, one who shared a
tick with a bird from Africa or the Middle East while both were
summering near the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the most likely transmission was in the blood of a tourist
coming back from Israel,'' said Vincent Deubel, an arbovirus
specialist at the Pasteur Institute here. There was an outbreak in
rural Israel in 1998 and the New York strain is a close genetic
match.
</P>
<P>
   Once it arrived, though, it still had to find a local mosquito
to spread it around. According to Zdenek Hubalek of the Czech
Academy of Sciences, 43 mosquito species can play that role.
Night-biting culex pipiens obliged first; now day-biting Aedes
japonicus has made the risk a 24-hour affair.
</P>
<P>
   Not all diseases need mosquito vectors for the animal-to-animal
jump. Milkmaids caught cowpox on the job and became immune to
smallpox. The AIDS virus, many scientists believe, jumped from
chimpanzee blood to human in the 1940s when a hunter in central
Africa nicked himself while butchering an ape.
</P>
<P>
   But because they are so effective at blood transfer, the flying
syringes are the nearly perfect vector _ and the risk they pose is
increasing. Not all that faint humming in the global village is
from Internet connections.

ARE THERE ANY NUCLEAR SECRETS LEFT TO STEAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The abrupt turnaround in the public image of Dr. Wen Ho Lee from
villain to victim, from atomic spy endangering the nation's
security to computer nerd unfairly put behind bars for downloading
harmless minutia, is raising new questions about what constitutes a
nuclear secret these days. More than half a century after the
making of the atom bomb, millions of former secrets have been
either declassified or posted willy-nilly on Internet sites, even
as the nuclear club has grown to at least eight members, with many
more wanabees in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with President Clinton's announcement on Friday that he
would leave the decision on whether to pursue a national missile
defense system to his successor _ a shield that China, Russia and
the NATO allies have warned may set off another nuclear arms race _
Lee's case raises a troubling question: what's really secret
anymore?
</P>
<P>
   The surprising answer is, a lot. Some restricted data is deemed
so sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into
foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
   Though itself off limits, the list of high-risk topics, experts
say, includes information that would let outsiders foil U.S.
weapons, fire stolen arms, copy American bomb designs and
manufacture nuclear weapons small enough to fit atop long-range
missiles or into a terrorist's briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stack of blueprints for Little Boy, the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima _ an extremely crude device by today's
standards _ is now proposed to be made top secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to restore people's respect for classified
information,'' said Dr. Albert Narath, a former director of the
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M. The problem, he
added, is that Washington has such a ``long history of classifying
too much stuff that people have lost respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Lee, 60, a Taiwan-born naturalized citizen who was
fired last year from the Los Alamos National Laboratory amid a spy
inquiry, is a worrisome example of just how bewildering the
nation's nuclear secrets policy has become.
</P>
<P>
   After he was arrested in December, the government asserted that
Lee was dangerous because the computer files he downloaded
illegally to an unsecure computer were the ``crown jewels'' of the
nuclear arsenal. Some of his portable computer tapes are missing,
and the government argued that Lee, if freed on bail, might give
secrets to China or other nations.
</P>
<P>
   But his defense team later showed that the data Lee downloaded
was classified as secret and confidential only after his dismissal
from Los Alamos. And last month, a defense witness, John L.
Richter, a former top nuclear weapons designer at Los Alamos,
testified that perhaps 99 percent of the downloaded information had
already been made public and would not be that useful to a foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if national security would be hurt if the missing tapes
found their way into foreign hands, Richter replied, ``I don't
believe that it would have any deleterious effect at all.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, after that testimony, a federal judge reversed
himself and said Lee could be released on bail after eight months
in jail, though on Friday prosecutors won an appeal that delayed a

<P>
   Lee's guilt or innocence has yet to be determined. But Richter's
assertion has fed the growing perception that many, if not all,
nuclear secrets are out of the bag _ a view based partly on fact.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of memoirs and histories, and the fact that scientists
talk for a living, have unveiled most basic principles. It is well
known, for instance, how the high heat of a small atomic explosion
in a thermonuclear weapon ignites hydrogen fuel in a far more
powerful blast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the dribble of official declassifications during
the Cold War later turned into a flood. Private experts who have
tapped this gusher include Chuck Hansen, the author of ``The Swords
of Armageddon,'' a CD-ROM containing 2,503 pages and 345 diagrams
that is a near-encyclopedia of what is known publicly about
America's efforts to make nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington in recent years, the push for greater openness has
coexisted uneasily with an equally intense desire to raise a wall
around the nation's remaining nuclear secrets. That tension began
with Hazel O'Leary, who as head of the Department of Energy from
1993 to 1997 was the main keeper of the nation's atomic secrets.
Her pursuit of openness was widely praised and condemned, but
behind the scenes she also promoted a secrecy drive known as
``Higher Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think Hazel was declassifying promiscuously,'' said
Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American
Scientists, a private group in Washington. ``In fact, she was
trying to bring order and logic to the classification process.''
</P>
<P>
   The rationale was that the bag of atomic secrets had grown so
large that protection would be ensured only if the most serious
topics were set aside for stringent safeguarding. So it was that,
long before the Lee case made Washington hypersensitive about lax
security, a push was underway to put key nuclear secrets under
tighter lock.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 report, the National Academy of Sciences blessed the
general idea. In 1997, Narath of Sandia led a Energy Department
panel that called for 137 topics to be raised from secret to top
secret classification, which would increase protections and sharply
cut access. But the Defense Department, which deploys the nuclear
arms made and maintained by the Energy Department, balked, citing
the added cost of building new storage facilities, computer
networks and specialist cadres. Defense Department officials also
expressed an unwillingness to shoulder the added costs of providing
top secret clearances. The price of a federal investigation for a
secret clearance is about $100, experts say, whereas a top secret
clearance runs about $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to ease the load, the Energy Department then winnowed the
list of proposed top-secret topics to 65, officials said. Still,
nothing happened. Recently, the deadlock ended after Congress shook
things up. Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., chairman of the House
Commerce Committee, asked Defense Secretary William S. Cohen in a
Aug. 14 letter to explain why his agency had apparently failed to
make ``an adequate effort'' to review the Energy Department's
revised plan or boost security.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the two feuding agencies signed a agreement to make
joint recommendations by Dec. 1, and perhaps to help end the false
impression of a nuclear sieve created by the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new study end in another standoff between the
bureaucracies? ``I don't engage in dry holes,'' said Eugene E.
Habiger, head of security at the Energy Department. ``I engage in
making things happen.''

ARE THERE ANY NUCLEAR SECRETS LEFT TO STEAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The abrupt turnaround in the public image of Dr. Wen Ho Lee from
villain to victim, from atomic spy endangering the nation's
security to computer nerd unfairly put behind bars for downloading
harmless minutia, is raising new questions about what constitutes a
nuclear secret these days. More than half a century after the
making of the atom bomb, millions of former secrets have been
either declassified or posted willy-nilly on Internet sites, even
as the nuclear club has grown to at least eight members, with many
more wanabees in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with President Clinton's announcement on Friday that he
would leave the decision on whether to pursue a national missile
defense system to his successor _ a shield that China, Russia and
the NATO allies have warned may set off another nuclear arms race _
Lee's case raises a troubling question: what's really secret
anymore?
</P>
<P>
   The surprising answer is, a lot. Some restricted data is deemed
so sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into
foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
   Though itself off limits, the list of high-risk topics, experts
say, includes information that would let outsiders foil U.S.
weapons, fire stolen arms, copy American bomb designs and
manufacture nuclear weapons small enough to fit atop long-range
missiles or into a terrorist's briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stack of blueprints for Little Boy, the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima _ an extremely crude device by today's
standards _ is now proposed to be made top secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to restore people's respect for classified
information,'' said Dr. Albert Narath, a former director of the
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M. The problem, he
added, is that Washington has such a ``long history of classifying
too much stuff that people have lost respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Lee, 60, a Taiwan-born naturalized citizen who was
fired last year from the Los Alamos National Laboratory amid a spy
inquiry, is a worrisome example of just how bewildering the
nation's nuclear secrets policy has become.
</P>
<P>
   After he was arrested in December, the government asserted that
Lee was dangerous because the computer files he downloaded
illegally to an unsecure computer were the ``crown jewels'' of the
nuclear arsenal. Some of his portable computer tapes are missing,
and the government argued that Lee, if freed on bail, might give
secrets to China or other nations.
</P>
<P>
   But his defense team later showed that the data Lee downloaded
was classified as secret and confidential only after his dismissal
from Los Alamos. And last month, a defense witness, John L.
Richter, a former top nuclear weapons designer at Los Alamos,
testified that perhaps 99 percent of the downloaded information had
already been made public and would not be that useful to a foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if national security would be hurt if the missing tapes
found their way into foreign hands, Richter replied, ``I don't
believe that it would have any deleterious effect at all.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, after that testimony, a federal judge reversed
himself and said Lee could be released on bail after eight months
in jail, though on Friday prosecutors won an appeal that delayed a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's guilt or innocence has yet to be determined. But Richter's
assertion has fed the growing perception that many, if not all,
nuclear secrets are out of the bag _ a view based partly on fact.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of memoirs and histories, and the fact that scientists
talk for a living, have unveiled most basic principles. It is well
known, for instance, how the high heat of a small atomic explosion
in a thermonuclear weapon ignites hydrogen fuel in a far more
powerful blast.
</P>

   Possession is a strange thing. It begins in childhood. If you
ask children anywhere, in any part of the world, they can
immediately identify the object they cherish most.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers commissioned by The New York Times asked children
to pose with their most prized possessions. If these pictures say
anything at all, it is that most children prefer at least two
points of contact with their beloved object _ that is, two hands,
or a hand and a face. The children do not just point. They encircle
their objects. They hold their dolls, their soccer balls and their
animals _ stuffed or live _ close to their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   You have to look twice to see that Elif, an 8-year-old in Agni,
Turkey, is not holding a real baby.
</P>
<P>
   And heaven help anyone who tries to pry the soccer ball from the
mittened hands of Gennady, in Novokuznetsk, Siberia, or the stuffed
horse from the arms of Ally, an 8-year old in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the wealthier have the fanciest toys. Christopher, a
12-year-old in suburban Maryland, got a new red kayak.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have next to nothing, though, manage to locate
and claim something in the world that they love best. Two
10-year-old boys in Istanbul, Emre and Yunus, found their favorite
possession abandoned in their neighborhood _ a rusted car that they
pretend to race.

LAWSUIT A BACK-ALLEY ATTACK ON NATIONAL MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has written about public lands issues
for over a decade and is respected for his insight into these
issues. His e-mail address is levendos(at)trib.com.) 
By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The oil, gas and minerals industries are attempting another
strategy to abolish national monuments so they can drill and mine
on the public's land. This latest attempt is a legal shell game.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF) out of
Denver filed a lawsuit in the federal district court of the
District of Columbia against President Clinton. The lawsuit
contends that Clinton does not have the constitutional authority to
create national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   So close to the presidential elections, the lawsuit's timing is
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the members of Mountain
States Legal Foundation _ read that as Texaco, Exxon, Chevron and
other mineral industry donors _ and members of the Blue Ribbon
Coalition who want to drive their off-road vehicles on land now
protected by national monument status.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit challenges five of the most recent national
monuments that Clinton created: Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument
in Oregon, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument in Colorado,
Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington, Ironwood Forest
National Monument in Arizona and Grand Canyon Parashant National
Monument in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The MSLF admits in its lawsuit that members of MSLF ``have
concrete plans for the future to use, each of the five areas at
issue in this complaint for a variety of purposes including, but
not limited to: prospecting for minerals, exploring for and mining
for ore bodies, exploring for and drilling for oil and gas
deposits....''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is so sweeping and general, it might as well have
challenged the creation of all 110 national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   It repeats in simplistic terms that President Clinton has
violated the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article IV,
Section 3, Paragraph 2): ``The Congress shall have the power to
dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting
the territory or other property belonging to the United States...''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that Clinton violated the Property Clause of
the Constitution ``because he thereby disposed of, reserved, and
made various rules and regulations respecting property belonging to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Not once does the lawsuit acknowledge or even mention the
Antiquities Act of 1906. The Antiquities Act specifically gives the
president the authority to reserve federal lands and put them under
the management of public lands agencies created by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can and has given the executive branch certain
authority over public lands. The Antiquities Act is one of those
delegations of power granted to the president by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Antiquities Act an unconstitutional delegation of
authority? That seems to be the unasked, invisible question in this
simple-minded lawsuit that MSLF has filed in its original
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiquities Act is constitutional if Congress inserted into
the act guidelines specific enough, so that it is Congress making
the public policy and the president merely implementing that policy
when he creates national monuments. The guidelines are there. The
fundamental policy is made by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress has the power of the purse so that it can refuse to
fund any national monument. Congress can also, by a vote of a
majority in both Houses, abolish any national monument.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has no problem with the constitutionality
of the Antiquities Act. In Cameron v. U.S. (1920), Wyoming's only
U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Willis Van Devanter, delivered the
opinion of the court and upheld the national monument status of the
Grand Canyon against mining claims. Theodore Roosevelt created the
Grand Canyon National Monument in 1908. Congress later turned it
into a national park.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a decision in federal courts where the
president's authority under the Antiquities Act has been denied.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice will undoubtedly respond with a
request for summary judgment to dismiss the case based upon the
authority given to the president under the Antiquities Act to
create national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the shell game: The challenge was never really about
violating the Property Clause of the Constitution; it's about how
to undo national monuments through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   After the Justice Department's response, we can expect MSLF to
file an amended complaint that spells out more specific allegations
as to how the president violated the terms of the Antiquities Act
in creating the five recent national monuments. The litigation will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the timing. Presidential elections are held in two
months. This case could very well be a calculated move to keep a
challenge to these national monuments in court until after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The president is named as a defendant in the case. So if George
W. Bush is elected president and the case is still in a federal
court, the new president, Bush, could simply settle the matter out
of court by abolishing the challenged five national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario would be a back-alley attack on the authority
that Congress has granted presidents since 1906.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, the president's power under the Antiquities
Act would be gutted. Other national monuments could be challenged
in federal courts and then settled in favor of the minerals
industries. All our national monuments would be at risk. For what?
For mining. For oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there must be room for the minerals industries, for
drilling and mining _ elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of balance, there also must be room in our nation
for the grand vistas, scientific and cultural sites, landscapes and
special wilderness areas that are protected by national monuments.

Proust (a bedridden neurasthenic) and Sartre (the author of
``Nausea''), Michel Houellebecq represents a particularly acute
case. Houellebecq is France's biggest literary sensation in 20
years - and his suffering is enormous. To spend a weekend in his
company is to become an unwitting participant in a
sensory-deprivation experiment. External stimuli are reduced to a
minimum. Physical movement is discouraged. Likewise talking and
eating and any other activity that might detract from the primary
objective - getting from Saturday morning to Sunday night with as
little conscious awareness as possible. Living outside Dublin,
where Houellebecq moved from Paris last year, helps: he knows
almost no one in the city and doesn't like to speak English. When I
rang the bell of his suburban town house in June, I was the first
person to have done so in quite some time. Houellebecq answered the
door in stocking feet, blinked at me with his sad brown eyes and
ushered me into the living room. He curled up in a chair with a
pack of Silk Cuts and a bottle of Jim Beam and hardly moved for the
entire weekend. He murmured obligingly in response to my questions,
but finishing a sentence often proved beyond him. Whatever energy
he had seemed mostly consumed by the quiet labor of existing.
Houellebecq's wife, Marie-Pierre, came and went, refilling liquor
glasses and emptying the ashtray. By late afternoon, the room was
choked with smoke, and Houellebecq was no longer sober. Through a
door, half hidden behind some drapes, was a balcony and directly
beyond it the gray expanse of the Irish Sea. When I asked
Houellebecq when the tide came in, he seemed taken aback. ``I know
it moves,'' he reflected, ``but we shut the curtains.'' By the time
we sat down to dinner - in the living room - he was too inebriated
to eat. He picked at his boiled crab and got some of it on his
sleeve. His head began to nod; his eyelids drooped. But for the
first time all day, he looked almost cheerful. ``I am the star of
French literature,'' he slurred. ``The most radical one of all.''
He reached over and petted my knee. ``What's your name again?'' he
mumbled. ``How would you like to be in my erotic film?''

   in france, houellebecq (pronounced WELL-beck) is famous for
being a lot of things. Being a pitiful shut-in, however, is not one
of them. To 20-somethings, he's a hero; to baby boomers, he's a
menace to society. He is also considered by turns a pornographer, a
Stalinist, a racist, a sexist, a nihilist, a reactionary, a
eugenicist and a homophobe. About the only thing the French seem to
agree on about Houellebecq is that he is the first French novelist
since Balzac whose work captures the social realities of
contemporary life. It's an extraordinary claim - all the more
unlikely given Houellebecq's palpable aversion to the world. But
then, ``extraordinary'' is the word that best sums up Houellebecq's
career. A few years ago, he was an obscure poet and recovering
mental patient with a single novel under his belt and a day job
debugging computers at the French Parliament. Then in 1998, he
published ``Les Particules Elementaires'' (``The Elementary
Particles''). A novel overflowing with anguish and graphic
descriptions of anonymous sex, it sold 300,000 copies and incited a
national verbal slugfest unlike anything France had ever seen.
Debated on the front page of Le Monde and denounced by the Catholic
press, the book bitterly divided the jury of the Prix Goncourt,
France's top literary prize. (The award went to someone else.)
Meanwhile, French Gen X'ers launched a Houellebecq fan club on the
Internet to discuss his philosophical kinship with Nietzsche and
Celine. ``Suddenly it's a question of agreeing or disagreeing with
'The Elementary Particles' the same way one had to agree or
disagree with Picasso's 'Guernica,''' Le Monde grumbled.
Houellebecq is now, at 42, a wealthy one-man multimedia franchise.
He has ventured into music (he has recorded a CD of his poems and
tours France with a rock band) and TV (he is directing an erotic
film for the Canal Plus network), and his face is splashed across
billboards in the metro. Hoping that he will prove just as
provocative - and bankable - in English, Knopf is bringing out
``The Elementary Particles'' in translation this November,
according it the kind of print run (40,000 copies) rarely lavished
on a foreign novel. It's a quixotic wager. Houellebecq's book is an
original work of art - ironic, intelligent and as airtight and
elegant as a geometry proof. It is also considerably bleaker than
any French sex-and-death novel in recent memory. ``Elementary
Particles'' tells the story of Bruno and Michel, a pair of
half-brothers who are palmed off to grandparents at a tender age by
irresponsible hippie parents. Bruno grows up to become a
self-loathing, sex-obsessed psychiatric patient who, though
``prepared to go to the ends of the earth'' for nubile flesh
``wrapped in a miniskirt,'' is rarely satisfied. He abandons the
one woman who loves him when she becomes a wheelchair-bound
invalid. As for Michel, he becomes a chronically depressed
molecular biologist who commits suicide off the Irish coast - but
not without leaving a blueprint for establishing a new species of
perfectly rational human clones, the only hope for saving mankind
from self-destruction. In a clever twist clear only at the end, the
book's narrator turns out to be one such clone and the novel itself
a mordant history of the now-extinct human race. The wretched
characters, affectless prose and clinical descriptions of group sex
(``Bruno and Rudi took turns penetrating Hannelore'') are deeply
disturbing. But the French took exception to something else: the
book's militant ideology. ``The Elementary Particles'' takes pains
to ensure that we don't see Bruno and Michel merely as products of
bad parenting or dumb luck. Rather, they are victims of a culture
awash in post-1960's values. Over the course of the novel's 272
pages, Houellebecq catalogs a daunting number of alleged scourges -
the free market, New Age mysticism, legal abortion, skyrocketing
divorce rates, materialism, debauchery - and lays them at the door
of counterculture idealism. According to the novel's freewheeling
historical logic, the 1960's begat not peace and prosperity but
selfishness, misery and violence. ``In a sense,'' muses Bruno in a
characteristic aside, ``the serial killers of the 1990's were the
spiritual children of the hippies of the 60's.'' For those
fortunate enough to have avoided a criminal fate, the book implies,
loneliness is the reward. ``We live in a world in which there are
no more links,'' Houellebecq told me. ``We're just particles. It's
a simple metaphor.'' His biggest gripe, however, is about what has
happened to sex. The Parisian swingers' club that Bruno frequents
is the apotheosis of sexual liberation gone awry. Erotic
possibilities abound, but sex in the club is ultimately another
free-market competition, a contest stacked in favor of the
strongest and most beautiful. Bruno doesn't make the cut. He ends
up checking into a mental hospital, where he plans to spend the
rest of his days on a regimen of drugs that kill his libido. ``In
France, the sexual revolution never stopped,'' Houellebecq said.
``Now you can do what you want. The problem is that people take no
more pleasure in sex. For example, more and more white women don't
want to go out with white men. They aren't virile enough. And white
men, they want to go out with black or Arab women. It's not a
question of race, but that sex is still forbidden to these women.
That's the ideal: when you have freedom but it's new.'' It is
reckless armchair sociologizing like this that gets him into
trouble, a fact he cavalierly dismisses. ``What I write is the
truth,'' he told me serenely. Many Parisians disagree. In France,
Houellebecq is infamous for giving Michel, his biologist anti-hero,
the same last name - Djerzinski - as a high-ranking Stalinist
official and then defending the gesture by saying Stalin wasn't
such a bad guy. After all, Houellebecq told a French magazine that
Stalin ``killed a lot of anarchists.'' His antipathy for democracy
(``Liberty is equivalent to suffering,'' he said on French TV) has
caused much hand-wringing among the intelligentsia. His confidence,
however, remains unshakable. ``I find myself morally perfect,'' he
said. Or, as Marie-Pierre put it: ``Michel's not depressed. It's
the world that's depressing.'' Initially, Houellebecq set out to
change the world. His first novel, ``L'Extension du Domaine de la
Lutte'' (``Extension of the Battlefield''), which appeared in 1994,
features a physically repellent software technician whose
unrealistic obsession is to find a woman who will have sex with
him. Instead of losing his virginity, he ends up losing his life in
a car crash. Houellebecq believed the book would force people to
reconsider the premium we place on physical beauty. ``I was certain
the novel would provoke social change,'' he said. ``Now I think it
was megalomania. When you go into a club today, you see the same
behavior as six years ago. A novel won't ever change the world.''
With ``The Elementary Particles,'' Houellebecq abandoned his
fantasy of fixing the world and tried to imagine a more perfect one
instead. The society of human clones at the end of the book
approximates Houellebecq's idea of utopia. Freed from the shackles
of sexual reproduction, Darwinian competitiveness vanishes. Gone,
too, are egotism, violence and greed. As for sex, it exists purely
for fun: equipped with pleasure sensors taken from the genitals of
both sexes and distributed over the epidermis, each clone is a
hermaphrodite destined to a life of ``new and undreamed-of erotic
possibilities.'' Houellebecq - who maintains an open marriage,
frequents swingers' clubs and estimates that he sleeps with 25
women a year - said that he couldn't imagine anything nicer than
``having clitorises all over your body.'' Is Houellebecq, the
sexual libertine, guilty of not practicing what he preaches? ``He's
interesting because he's so contradictory,'' said Frederic
Beigbeder, a French novelist. ``He says the world is a nightmare
because we are creatures of our desires and that individual liberty
drives us to destruction and despair. He says all this, but he does
the exact opposite in his life. In a sense, he is the ultimate
example of what he hates.''
</P>
<P>
   houellebecq's friends don't wonder at his self-imposed exile
abroad. They wonder at his being alive at all. ``He has suffered a
lot,'' Beigbeder said. ``I think he has come back from a place
where a normal person would have committed suicide. And that
explains everything.'' He was born on the French island of Reunion,
off the coast of Madagascar, in 1958, the son of a mountain-guide
father and a physician mother. Like the parents of his ill-starred
protagonists, Houellebecq's own were hippies, committed neither to
each other nor to child rearing, and at the age of 6, Michel was
shipped off to a grandmother southwest of Paris. He has no idea
where his parents are today - or even if they are alive. During
high school, Houellebecq spent hours by himself watching trains at
the station next door. ``I would get on them and go nowhere,'' he
recalled. ``Just get on, get off.'' He was frequently depressed.
Beigbeder realized just how depressed one evening not long ago,
when he popped a Moody Blues ballad into his CD player and saw
Houellebecq burst into tears: ``He started crying, crying. Finally
he explained that at all the parties when he was 18, all the boys
and girls slow-danced to this song, but he was alone and no one
talked to him because he was ugly.'' Then again, Beigbeder said
dryly, Houellebecq ``loves pathetic - all his work is about being
pathetic.'' At 18, Houellebecq was rejected for French military
service because of a morphine addiction. In 1980, he graduated from
college with a degree in agricultural engineering. He married, had
a son and divorced. Within a few years, he was unemployed, drinking
heavily and in and out of mental hospitals, where he was treated
for anxiety. ``Until I met writers, the most interesting people I
knew were in asylums,'' he said. Around the same time, he began to
publish poems. But it wasn't until he took a job as a software
technician in 1991 that he found his true subject as a novelist -
the everyday routine of a working stiff. ``L'Extension du Domaine
de la Lutte'' contains the first articulation of Houellebecq's
grand theme: free choice for all is misery for most. ``In a
perfectly liberal economic system, some will accumulate
considerable fortunes; others will wallow in unemployment and
misery,'' explains his narrator. ``In a perfectly liberal sexual
system, some will enjoy a varied and exciting erotic life; others
will be reduced to masturbation and solitude.'' Virtually ignored
by the press, the book sold 20,000 copies thanks to word of mouth.
The succes de scandale of ``The Elementary Particles'' four years
later assured his literary ascendancy. It was a remarkable coup. In
a country where writers are overwhelmingly upper class and products
of the grandes ecoles, Houellebecq was an affront. He was a petit
bourgeois from the provinces with a trade-school degree. Moreover,
he was indifferent to French literature. His closest precursor was
the British writer Aldous Huxley, whose ``Brave New World'' is
equally obsessed with eugenics. His favorite book was ``The Magic
Mountain,'' Thomas Mann's philosophical novel set in an asylum.
``In the French tradition, it's completely odd to put ideas in a
novel,'' Houellebecq said. In some ways, Houellebecq's outsider
status has actually worked to his advantage. For decades, French
literature has foundered. The stalwarts of postwar fiction,
novelists like Nathalie Sarraute, Marguerite Duras and Alain
Robbe-Grillet, are either retired or dead, and the nouveau roman -
a plotless, characterless exercise in abstraction - is widely
considered an unreadable snooze. ``For years, French novelists
haven't dared attack the big subjects,'' lamented Francois
Nourissier, president of the Prix Goncourt. ``There was the war in
Algeria. Not a single novel! There has been this extraordinary
upheaval in French society, which has become multiracial. No
novel.'' Houellebecq's novel certainly attacks a big subject. But
to write, as he does, that the 1960's were a fraud - that the
mythologized student riots of May 1968 were more about errant
individualism than glowing idealism - is seen by the liberal
establishment as tantamount to sedition. ``We're all crushed by the
weight of the 60's - in cinema, music, books,'' said Guillaume
Durand, a French talk-show host. ``And here's Houellebecq saying
the 60's were nothing. It made people hate him.''
</P>
<P>
   It also made him rich and famous, although hanging out with him
in Dublin, you would never know it. His wardrobe - a pair of dingy
chinos and a couple of flannel shirts - suggests graduate-student
asceticism. Ditto his diet: coffee and tobacco leavened by the
occasional bender. (``I don't like to eat,'' he told me. ``I only
like sex.'') The bookshelves in his town house are cheap, and the
wallpaper is beginning to peel. (Houellebecq and Marie-Pierre, whom
he married in 1998, plan to move to a house on an island off the
southwest coast of Ireland where there are more sheep than people.)
Houellebecq said that having money has changed his life in one
crucial respect only: it has allowed him to escape ``the
nightmare'' of being an employee. Fame is a more ambiguous
blessing. ``It's too much pressure,'' he complained. Then again, he
conceded, ``my sex life is richer.'' But even that perk can't be
depended upon to make celebrity worth the hassle required to
maintain it. In July, Houellebecq left his Dublin hideaway to spend
a week in Paris tending to his career. The trip produced nothing
but irritation. At Flammarion, his publishing house, he met with
his editor to discuss his latest work, a novella due out next month
that features an actual extraterrestrial-worshiping cult on the
Canary Islands. Fearing a lawsuit, Houellebecq's editor urged him
to change the name of the cult. Houellebecq resisted. ``But I write
about reality,'' hegrumbled. ``I don't know how Bret Easton Ellis
gets away with using all those brand names.'' He also met with a
costume designer about the erotic short he is directing for Canal
Plus. No one seemed to be keeping pace with the production
schedule, and Houellebecq, who envisioned an all-female cast and a
fairy-tale plot line that would allow for ``more shots of pleasure
than of organs,'' still had only one actress lined up - his wife.
He found a fresh prospect in the form of a lanky young publicist at
Flammarion. When he complained to her about his troubles with the
film, she volunteered for a part. ``But you haven't even seen the
script,'' he said dubiously. ``I don't care,'' she replied. He
dutifully took down her name and address, but even her evident
enthusiasm - with its hint of sexual availability - failed to lift
his spirits. He had talked about going to Chris et Manu, a
swingers' club, on Friday night, but when I called him in the early
evening, he was having second thoughts. He suggested I drop by his
apartment in a see-through skirt instead. ``I don't really want to
go out,'' he said. ``I just want to have sex.'' When this failed to
elicit the response he was looking for, he made a feeble attempt at
blackmail. ``We have reached the limit of talking,'' he said.
``There are things only people who have physical relations with me
get to hear.'' When that, too, fell flat, he lapsed into a
melancholy monologue. ``The journalist is the enemy of the
groupie,'' he said. ``The groupie exists just to have sex with. The
journalist wants an interview, and the journalist usually wins. I'm
on the side of the groupie, but I'm too passive to put up a
fight.'' Before I hung up, I asked him what he was going to do.
``Go to bed,'' he sighed. It was 8 o'clock. Fortunately,
Houellebecq has a few other ways of distracting himself besides
sex. Writing, for example. There are always aspects of contemporary
life to repudiate. He is already working on his next novel, which
will be set in Thailand and include a broadside against Muslim
fundamentalism. Then, of course, there is the living room in
Dublin, the pack of Silk Cuts, the bottle of Jim Beam. Halfway
through dinner on the night I visited, Houellebecq fell into a
drunken stupor, his nodding head eventually landing on his plate
next to a smear of mayonnaise. As the light faded outside and
Marie-Pierre and I continued to talk, Houellebecq slept on. The
last time I saw him that night, he was still slumped in his chair
with his head against the table, the posture of a man engaged in a
silent protest against the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of Emmylou Harris's show at the Birchmere Theater
just outside Washington in May, a big black dog _ part poodle, part
who knows _ bounds onstage, tail wagging. He finds his mistress
standing between Buddy Miller, the nonmainstream country-music
star, and the drummer-bassist Daryl Johnson. In an off-white dress
and with her white hair shining, Harris looks, as she always does,
like Someone. She can't help looking like Someone. Or if she can,
she doesn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   She's tall and vivid and glamorous, but she also emanates a
nearly religious modesty, and when she's not onstage, the
combination makes people want to stare at her and try not to. It's
a neat (possibly unconscious) trick: the ability to encourage
admiration while appearing humbled by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bonaparte,'' Harris says. ``He's one of our four dogs.
The rest are at home with my mother in Nashville.'' The dog dodges
away from her and runs offstage.
</P>
<P>
   She sings the show's finale _ a semitheological song called
``The Maker.'' The small band approximates the cosmic-country-rock,
attic-rummaging sound that has characterized Harris's recent
recordings. Her voice isn't quite what it used to be in the upper
register, but 30 years of hard work have given it a complicated
kind of power and authority. Before leaving the stage for the
night, she makes a pitch for the Campaign for a Land Mine-Free
World. There are scarves woven by Cambodian land-mine victims for
sale outside the auditorium, she says, after reciting some
horrifying land-mine statistics, and it's clear that this person
has a conscience that does not rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the Birchmere's greenroom, Buddy Miller _ unshaven,
unassuming, his round face beaming _ chats with a visitor about the
music that Harris and he and Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle and
others like them play. ``Alternative country,'' it is often called
_ because of its rural and folk antecedents and its differences
from the formulaic commercial-radio monsters. Maple Byrne, Harris's
elfin stage manager, puts away her guitars, one of which has the
singer's trademark rose-and-brier motif inlaid in the wood just
below the strings. Byrne is agile and silent, like a priestess's
acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   Harris looks down and quietly thanks people for their praise.
She has fine features, some softness of age at the jaw. A slight
slouch seems an objective correlative for her reflexive
self-deprecation. Her movements are quick, verging on anxious.
Another reporter who has heard Harris's next CD, ``Red Dirt Girl''
(her first studio recording in almost five years, its release next
week to be followed by a major tour), tells her he thinks the 11
songs she has written for the album are very good. ``I hope so,''
she replies, nervously, and thanks him for the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Emmylou Harris was born in Birmingham, Ala., on April 2, 1947,
the daughter of a Marine fighter pilot from New Jersey and a south
Alabama farmer's daughter. She attended high school in Woodbridge,
Va., and was her class's valedictorian. In Woodbridge, she started
listening to folk music over American University's FM station, was
given a $30 pawn-shop Kay guitar when she was 16 and worked her
emulational way backward _ or is it forward? _ from Peter, Paul and
Mary to Joan Baez to Woody Guthrie to a seminal book of early
British ballads. After stabs at college and acting, she eventually
fetched up in the Greenwich Village folk clubs in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she married a songwriter named Tom Slocum, and her
first daughter was born. Penury and fear of the big city drove the
young family to Nashville, but the marriage failed, Harris went on
food stamps and she eventually moved back in with her parents in
Virginia. For the next couple of years she waited on tables and
sang folk songs. One evening, the country-rock star and
scapegrace-genius-rich-boy-Harvard-dropout Gram Parsons saw her
perform in D.C. A year later, he flew her out to Los Angeles, where
she sang duets with him on his album ``GP'' and had an artistic
epiphany about country music _ a genre that most folkies disdained.
</P>
<P>
   Under Parsons' chaotic tutelage, on recordings and on tour,
Harris not only began to hear the virtuosity in country musicians
like Hank Williams but also started to find her real voice and her
own eclectic taste for the first time. And then in 1973 Parsons
died as a result of a drug overdose. Harris has often described
this event in traumatic terms _ ``an amputation,'' ``when the
meteor hit the earth.'' She and Parsons were not lovers; their
``consummation'' was musical, not physical, as Nicholas Dawidoff
put it in his book ``In the Country of Country.'' But she has kept
the flame (and perhaps carried a rescue-fantasy torch) for Parsons
from that point on.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'70s, Harris became a country-music star. She made
eight gold albums and three platinum albums, and had five No. 1
hits. She has won nine Grammy awards and has toured tirelessly
around the world for more than 20 years. As the '80s wore on into
the '90s and Nashville's welcome for traditional country musicians
wore out in favor of male ``hat acts,'' slick production and Shania
Twain's navel, Harris refused to hang up her own hat. She kept it
on and began to experiment with even more eclectic material. It may
not have improved her commercial success, but this perseverance has
given her a strong reputation for musical openness among other
musicians. It has also earned her a public following that often
falls off the cliff of fandom into idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after her Birchmere performance, Harris is back in
Nashville. She is getting ready for her appearance, with other
like-minded country musicians, in a Ryman Auditorium concert of the
soundtrack music from the Coen Brothers' next movie, ``O Brother,
Where Art Thou?'' which will open in December. The movie is a
picaresque comedy about four prison escapees in the South, and the
all-star cast of musical performers was chosen by the Coens in
auditions two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the concert, Harris arrives for a lunch date at a
simple restaurant in a shopping mall in Nashville. In the
self-effacing (and for the most part self-shielding) conversation
that follows _ which includes tributes to Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger,
the Carter Family, the Mamas and the Papas, Dolly Parton and, of
course, Gram Parsons _ words like ``anathema'' and ``Wunderkind''
surface naturally. And she is well read. In discussing the
existential cast of her songwriting on ``Red Dirt Girl'' (one
couplet goes, ``Like falling stars from the universe, we are
hurled/Down through the long loneliness of the world''), she says:
``I'm entrenched in middle age, and I've endured some dramatic
losses. I don't have answers, but I do have questions. I guess
that's why I like the two Annies so much.'' She laughs. ``Annie
Dillard and Annie Proulx.''
</P>
<P>
   Some troubled currents run through Harris's literary philosophy
and unceasing admiration for other musicians. One involves the
possible turning point she has reached in her career. Since its
release in 1995, her CD ``Wrecking Ball,'' perhaps the most
important alternative-country recording made so far, has sold about
250,000 copies. It contains grand and haunting renditions of songs
by Harris herself, Jimi Hendrix, Julie Miller, Anna McGarrigle,
Neil Young and the album's producer, the glowering French Canadian
Daniel Lanois, who has also produced records for U2 and Peter
Gabriel. The next album, ``Spyboy,'' a 1998 collection of raw and
sometimes ragged live performances, has sold about 100,000. These
albums are cult objects, but their sales look like tiny potatoes
next to today's pop and country Idahos, and even next to Harris's
own platinum-album and Grammy-rich past.
</P>
<P>
   With Malcolm Burn as producer, ``Red Dirt Girl'' may be more
musically accessible than her two previous releases, but it has
many of the same Lanois-style artsy effects _ a tom-tom pulsing
loudly behind a post-Phil Spector wall of sound, noises like
whale-song and what sound like stray signals from SETI's Very Large
Array. Still it's obvious that Harris was disappointed with her
business alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 'Spyboy,' I let my manager go, I let my label go, I let
my producer go,'' she says. ``I don't want to dwell on the
negative,'' she goes on. ``I've always zigged and zagged, and I
guess 'Red Dirt Girl' is a pretty big zag.''
</P>
<P>
   More undercurrents: Like most writers, Harris seems genuinely
uncertain about the quality of her work, especially on this new
album. And like most performers, she by definition enjoys the
gratification of love from strangers. Artists often have an
altruistic desire to communicate with their audience, but they also
have their reasons, and for many, ``reasons'' means ``parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's father, who died in 1993, was evidently a man of great
physical skill and psychological courage. In the anthemic ``Bang
the Drum Slowly,'' a song about her father laden with regret, she
says: ``I meant to ask you ... if you ever really were deceived/By
the likes of me.'' It's a puzzling, charged line. At lunch Harris
leans forward, closes the sides of her cardigan conclusively and
says: ``My father was a man of enormous compassion and humanity.
And he could do anything. I always felt phony around him, as if
what I was doing weren't real work. He told me he didn't feel that
way, but I was always afraid that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely moving around as a military child also contributes to
some adult uneasiness. Despite her mother's Alabama provenance,
Harris refers to herself as rootless. Recently, in an interview in
No Depression _ which waggishly calls itself ``The Jovially
Amateurish Alternative Country (Whatever That Is) Bimonthly'' _ she
sounded almost bitter about her rootlessness: ``I wasn't raised on
a farm in Tennessee, you know, one of 12 children.... I have no
roots anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As it does for so many in the alternative-country audience, this
sense of deracination no doubt plays a part in Harris's search and
reverence for musical authenticity. And her offstage relationships
have not given her much of a rock to lean on. When asked about her
personal life, Harris _ thrice divorced (twice from her record
producers, Brian Ahern and then Paul Kennerly) _ takes a deep
breath, like someone who must give the people a glimpse of her
wounds, and says, ``I am not in a relationship now, and I'm not
happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She raises her hand, as if taking an oath in court, and goes on.
``I have known true love _ I really have.'' She lowers her hand.
``But, obviously, it hasn't worked out. I believe we all have a
profound need for a good relationship to another person. When we
don't have it, there's a void, which we try to fill with sex, with
drugs, with food, with alcohol, with buying things. I've come to
realize sadly that good relationships are very rare. Most marriages
just aren't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has been called the Queen of Country Music, the Angel of
This, the Sweetheart of That. Even the Diva of Loss. Well, as
``Bang the Drum Slowly'' and three decades' worth of song choices
and songwriting and the Nashville lunch conversation indicate, it
might be more accurate to say the Diva of Remorse. Many of the 12
songs on ``Red Dirt Girl'' deal with regret _ some tunefully and
even whimsically, some heavily. And, like her entire career, many
seem darkened by the death, and maybe the spirit, of Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has of course written and sung upbeat numbers and plain
old love ballads and ramblin' songs, but her core repertoire, and
her new album, thrum with self-reproach. Perhaps this is why her
music resonates so deeply for so many poets, writers, other artists
and anyone else who suffers from bouts of self-criticism. The
domestic menagerie, the land-mine crusade, the musical tributes to
other singers, the benefit-concert appearances, the incessant
duetting, the sense of phoniness before her father's example _ it
all suggests that Harris seeks not only communication and
admiration but moral approval. You certainly cannot fault
creativity and generosity as responses to inner needs. You might,
however wish such a hard worker more ease. She can be wary and
reticent _ she feels she has been betrayed by a couple of reporters
who have gotten close to her.
</P>
<P>
   After the ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' concert at the Ryman
Auditorium in Nashville _ which includes Harris, the angel-voiced
Alison Krauss, the rubbing-alcohol-voiced Gillian Welch, the
gospel-singing Cox Family, the top-flight bluegrass family the
Whites, Ralph Stanley, the virtuoso Dobro-guitar player Jerry
Douglas, the fiddle virtuoso Stuart Duncan, a white Baptist choir
and a black spiritual group called the Fairfield Four _ cataclysmic
storms begin to descend on Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Harris wants to get home. The streets are flooding, tornadoes
are approaching, the elements are adding a crescendo encore to the
celebration of traditional and new American music that has just
taken place within. But before she can leave, a couple of the other
performers approach her backstage like petitioners and ask for her
autograph. And as I say goodbye to her, I feel a tap on my
shoulder. I look around, and there's Maple Byrne, who, as if we
were both initiates in the same secret society, wordlessly hands me
a guitar pick stamped with a red rose and, in white and in a fancy
hand, the initials ``E.H.'' (The rose has faded with the pick's
use, but the letters remain distinct.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when Leonid Aniskin was frightened of
radiation. But that was before he went to work at the Chernobyl
nuclear power station. He still remembers his first day on the job.
It was in 1987, a little over a year after an explosion had ripped
the roof off the plant's fourth reactor block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees in the forest behind the station had all died,'' he
recalls. ``The pine needles had turned red and dropped off.''
Soldiers were burying the radioactive tree trunks when he arrived
for his first shift. Everywhere he looked there were men in masks
and dark rubber suits, and orange bulldozers scraping away the
contaminated soil. The station's three undamaged reactors were all
up and running by then, ordered back on line by Soviet central
planners.
</P>
<P>
   While the world was still reeling from a disaster that spewed
radiation over much of northern Europe and forced the evacuation of
more than 100,000 people, the Kremlin was wrestling with a
different issue: where to find workers willing to operate the
stricken plant. Aniskin was 27 at the time, a champion marathon
runner and a newly graduated acoustical engineer. He and his wife,
Marina, had just celebrated their first wedding anniversary and the
birth of their son, Igor. Like most young couples, they were living
in a crowded dormitory near the Kiev airport while waiting for a
state apartment in a soulless high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, newlyweds faced years if not decades of communal
showers and public toilets before they were assigned their own
place. There was a way, however, to bypass the waiting list. The
Kremlin was building a new city 40 miles from Chernobyl _ just
outside the depopulated Exclusion Zone _ a town unimaginably
luxurious by Soviet standards. Brand-new apartments were to be had
in this ``model city,'' which the Kremlin christened Slavutich
after the Russian word for glory, and jobs that paid 10 times the
average national wage. All Aniskin had to do to win this Faustian
Soviet sweepstakes was sign up to work at Chernobyl. ``When Igor
was born,'' he says, with the conviction of someone looking back on
a difficult decision that came out right, ``I decided to offer my
family a chance at a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a warm and breezy Saturday morning in Slavutich. The
six-foot-wide Geiger counter over the pediatric wing of the nearby
hospital flashes a reassuring 15.4 microroentgens _ about the same
as in Denver _ if you stick within city limits, where the
contaminated soil has been removed. Leonid Aniskin has already run
his daily 10 miles and is cooking breakfast for his family and me.
</P>
<P>
   Igor, now a tall and big-boned teenager, sits transfixed by a
sumo wrestling match on ESPN's Eurosport. Cable television is an
extraordinarily rare sight in the lands of the former Soviet Union.
In Slavutich, cable is piped in free of charge to every household,
courtesy of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Nine thousand of Slavutich's 26,000 residents are children under
the age of 16, a result, town fathers proudly note, of the city's
astonishing birthrate, the highest in post-Communist Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can afford to have children here,'' explains Marina
Aniskin, as we settle down to breakfast. ``We've had stability,''
she adds. ``It's what sets Slavutich apart from the rest of the
country.'' Between them, the Aniskins bring home the equivalent of
$450 a month, which doesn't sound like much until it's compared
with an average wage in Ukraine of $38 a month. More important,
Chernobyl pays on time and in cash. In the rest of the country,
people often get their salaries in tires or sacks of sugar, or not
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think an outsider can appreciate to what degree
Chernobyl has saved us,'' she says. Over the years, she and her
husband, and the rest of this one-company town's residents, have
all learned to live with radiation. The one thing they can't live
without, though, is Chernobyl. And Chernobyl is closing. In June of
this year, the Ukrainian government _ which inherited the plant in
1991 and has kept it running to allay its own crippling energy
crisis _ finally bowed to international pressure and agreed to take
Chernobyl off-line by Dec. 15. Madeleine Albright, the American
secretary of state, calls the shutdown a ``gift to the Ukrainian
people.'' But no one around here sees it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The train to Chernobyl leaves Slavutich's one-platform station
at 7:30 each morning. It's a 40-minute commute, and passengers pass
the time catnapping, playing cards or reading newspapers. For the
first half of the ride, the scenery is bucolic and serene, a
tableau of collective farms, dairy herds and gently rolling
pastures. The semblance of normalcy fades, however, once the train
crosses into the Exclusion Zone. Double rows of barbed-wire fencing
and yellow radiation signs announce its perimeter. A few minutes
later, deep ditches appear, dug to prevent the cesium and strontium
fallout that has leached into the marshy soil from draining into
the nearby Dnieper River basin, where 36 million Ukrainians get
their drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned settlements start soon after, weedy and overgrown,
with peeling walls and moldy roofs decaying from neglect. The
radiation level here jumps from 15 microroentgens per hour to 43,
no longer safe for human habitation (25 to 30 is considered the
limit). Then two large red structures loom into view: shells of
Chernobyl's incomplete fifth and sixth units, whose construction
was halted after the 1986 meltdown. Next to the rusting hulks lies
a sandy clearing, where the foundations for two more reactors were
to have been poured. Soviet central planners had intended for
Chernobyl to be the world's largest nuclear power station rather
than its most infamous.
</P>
<P>
   The train stops at a specially sealed platform with blue
corrugated steel walls and translucent rubber flooring. The
platform shades into a metallic gold corridor bisected by rows of
phone-booth-size radiation detectors, which the plant's 5,940
workers pass through after changing clothes at the end of their
shift. The uniform at Chernobyl is a tasteful turquoise jumpsuit,
black boots and a dosimeter that, like a pager, clips onto the
waistband and is measured monthly to track each employee's
accumulated exposure. Large Geiger counters are installed
throughout the station.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Aniskin has invited me to visit him on the job, and I
have accepted with some trepidation. Aniskin works at the so-called
sarcophagus, tending the steel and cement tomb that encases 216
tons of uranium and plutonium buried within the remains of the
fourth reactor block. His is one of the most dangerous jobs at
Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   The Geiger counter mounted 100 yards in front of the electrified
fence that surrounds the sarcophagus flashes 1,430 microroentgens
per hour. Beyond this point, radiation at Chernobyl is measured in
rem. There are a million microroentgens in one rem, and in some
chambers inside the ruined reactor hall the radiation can reach two
thousand rem per hour, four times the lethal dose.
</P>
<P>
   I follow Aniskin down a stairway to a passage that leads under
the fence into an underground locker room where radiation suits are
issued. We strip down and step into protective gear: double layers
of white cotton-weave pants and undershirts, high, astronaut-style
boots, a jacket, gloves, a mask and a head covering reminiscent of
a short-order cook's. We ascend another stairway and emerge
directly in front of the sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   We enter the sarcophagus _ what was Chernobyl's fourth reactor _
through a narrow staircase near the old turbine hall. On one panel
of the control room someone has spray-painted 4/26/86, the date of
the explosion, and just outside the control room, on what was once
the observation deck, there is a brass plaque and a few plastic
tulips to commemorate Valery Khodemchuk. Khodemchuk was the
night-shift manager on duty at 1:23 a.m. when the core started
overheating during an experiment he was conducting and the
reactor's automatic shutdown system did not respond. Khodemchuk
rushed to the observation deck just as the pressure inside the core
reached a critical mass. He was vaporized.
</P>
<P>
   A three-foot-thick concrete wall is all that now separates us
from the remains of the reactor core, and this is as far as Aniskin
says it's safe for me to go. He can see that I'm sweating badly and
that it is not from the 100-degree heat inside the sarcophagus.
``Come meet my boss,'' he says, guiding me down a corridor.
</P>
<P>
   We step into the monitoring station, where his supervisor,
Vitaly Borets, is tracking temperature and gamma and neutron
activity. Borets, a thickset man in his 60s with a few silver teeth
and a sliced-off pinky, is one of only 547 of Chernobyl's 6,000
original personnel who returned to the plant after the accident. He
came back, he says, because he grew tired of being treated like a
``leper'' by outsiders. ``When people heard I was an evacuee from
Chernobyl, they wouldn't even shake my hand, like I was
contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Borets is angry about the impending shutdown, which he says is
``stupid,'' and worries where it will leave people like him. ``They
told us that if we moved to Slavutich and worked at Chernobyl, we
were patriots, we were rendering a great service to the motherland.
Well, we came, we took our doses and now it's thank you very much
and please leave. I have nowhere else to go,'' he complains. ``And
I'm fed up with being played like a human Ping-Pong ball.'' Aniskin
politely interrupts his boss, pointing to the clock on the wall.
``We should go,'' he tells me. ``You shouldn't stay too long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand how he feels,'' Aniskin confides, as we
retrace our steps toward the changing room. ``The government
promised to take care of us for the rest of our lives if we came to
work here.'' Aniskin is one of the lucky few whose jobs will
continue past the plant's closure: for at least five years, or
until the completion of a new, $750 million, internationally
financed dome over the existing sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   After I take a decontamination shower, my dosimeter is measured.
During the 20 minutes I spent inside the fourth reactor block I was
exposed to one-hundredth of a rem, or 10,000 microroentgens.
``You'll live,'' declares the technician who hands me my readout.
</P>
<P>
   The first thousand layoffs at Chernobyl will be posted in
October. Virtually everyone in Slavutich, from the ambulance
drivers and kindergarten teachers to the snow-removal crews and the
surly waitress at the lone hotel, works for Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slavutich and Chernobyl are really one organism,'' says
Vladimir Zhigalo, the deputy mayor. ``If you kill one part of that
organism, it's very hard for the other to survive.'' Zhigalo is
trying to attract new employers to Slavutich by offering potential
investors free land and tax holidays, but so far there have been
precious few takers. ``It's the downside of being associated with
Chernobyl.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hospital No. 1, one of Chernobyl's legacies can be seen.
``Over the last few years we've had an increase in kidney and
thyroid cancer,'' says Dr. Irina Frulova, a surgeon from St.
Petersburg who has been tending Slavutich's sick since 1987. Thus
far 1,354 young people from the Chernobyl region have been treated
for thyroid cancer. Because Ukraine cannot afford to send out
medical teams into all the contaminated regions, many cases go
undiagnosed until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   It is my last night in Slavutich, and the Aniskins have prepared
a farewell feast. There is carp that Igor and Leonid caught,
cucumbers and tomatoes from their dacha plot, cheese from the local
market and beet salad. I know from my conversations with American
and Ukrainian scientists that minute traces of radioactive cesium
and strontium are almost certainly present in some, if not all, of
the food grown in this region. That is just one reason why
neurological, endocrinological, gastrointestinal and urinary
illnesses are 15 times greater in the contaminated regions of
Ukraine than in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   About the only item on the dinner menu that can be judged with
some degree of certainty as safe is the gallon jug of Horilka vodka
that Marina's spirited 61-year-old mother has brought. It is only
after several of her ebullient toasts that I work up the courage to
ask Leonid Aniskin the question that has been troubling me since we
visited the sarcophagus together: How much radiation has he
received?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've lost count,'' he chuckles, deflecting my question
with a smile. ``Besides,'' he says, laughing, ``I've developed an
immunity to radiation.'' The silence that follows is broken by his
wife. ``Tell him,'' she says in a low, quiet voice.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he finally admits, one of his teeth fell out.
At first he thought it was nothing, but then another fell out. And
another, until he lost all but his three gold crowns. He had
dentures and bridgework done on the sly, so as not to alert the
medical commission at Chernobyl that rules on whether workers
should be pensioned off due to radiation sickness. ``I was scared
they would fire me,'' he confesses. Disability pay, when it is
paid, which is usually months in arrears, is only about a fifth of
the regular salary at Chernobyl, and Aniskin's job is highly
coveted because it won't be phased out for at least the five years
it takes to build a new sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look so sad,'' he says, reaching out to pat me on the
shoulder. ``It's really all right. I made my choice a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>

Union for The Wall Street Journal from 1996 to 1998. He is now
writing a memoir on Russia in the 1990s.)

   FANTASTICK-JOEL-GREY-STARBEAT _ Joel Grey, famous for his star
turns in the long-running theatrical production, and now movie,
``The Fantasticks,'' and stage and screen productions of
``Cabaret,'' is a man with both a history and a future. ``For me,
it's almost always about the character, what I can learn from doing
it,'' he explains. ``If I get to a place where I think, `I can't do
this,' I know I have to do it. It's scary, but it happened with all
the plays and movies that ever won me any kind of recognition. And

   CROSSING THE THRESHOLD FROM CHILDHOOD TO THE ROCK WORLD
</P>
<P>
   ALMOST-FAMOUS-CAMERON-CROWE-STARBEAT _ Cameron Crowe's best
friend was always music. It didn't judge him, or care that he was a
shy, chubby, geek. Often alone, he wrote obsessively about the rock
'n' roll bands of his era _ the '60s and '70s _ and at 15 was
recruited by Rolling Stone magazine. Now, at 43, he is one of the
hottest and hippest film directors in Hollywood. ``Almost Famous,''
which draws on his memories, is a movie he has wanted to do for
years. ``I think this is 90 percent my own story,'' he admits. And
today's rock scene? ``I feel, somewhere in this country, some kid
is in a garage and about to change it all.'' By Cindy Pearlman.

   BABYBLUES-SWEENEY-STARBEAT _ Julia Sweeney, best known as the
plump Pat in ``Saturday Night Live,'' admits that in creating Pat
she thumbed her nose at Hollywood. ``I thought, `I might not
measure up in the pretty department but I'm going to show you how
funny I can be looking really ugly.'' So she put on a 400-pound fat
suit and a wig and drew pimples on her face. ``After that, I felt a
lot better about myself!'' she laughs. Now this funny, 30-ish
comedian has found success as Wanda in TV cartoon series ``Baby

   FUNNY JULIA SWEENEY: FINDING COMEDY IN TRAGEDY
</P>
<P>
   BABYBLUES-SWEENEY-STARBEAT _ Julia Sweeney, best known as the
plump Pat in ``Saturday Night Live,'' admits that in creating Pat
she thumbed her nose at Hollywood. ``I thought, `I might not
measure up in the pretty department but I'm going to show you how
funny I can be looking really ugly.'' So she put on a 400-pound fat
suit and a wig and drew pimples on her face. ``After that, I felt a
lot better about myself!'' she laughs. Now this funny, 30-ish
comedian has found success as Wanda in TV cartoon series ``Baby
Blues. ``I've finally gotten to use my real voice in a TV show,''
she says excitedly. By Jeanne Wolf. WITH PHOTO.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On his breakthrough hit ``My Name Is,'' Eminem announced that
Dr. Dre, his mentor and record company boss, ``sent me to piss the
world off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit rapper has more than fulfilled his assignment.
</P>
<P>
   With his two multimillion-selling albums of facile,
linguistically inventive word play, Eminem _ whose real name is
Marshall Mathers _ has left a trail of scorched earth in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Billboard magazine editor Timothy White, for instance, attacked
the profane language, drug references and intensely violent imagery
of Eminem's songs as ``making money by exploiting the world's
misery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) censured
this year's ``The Marshall Mathers LP'' for graphic and homophobic
lyrics, including an irreverent reference to late designer Gianni
Versace's sexuality. The organization also took to task Interscope
Records, which distributes and promotes Eminem's albums.
</P>
<P>
   Pop acts such as 'N Sync, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera,
as well as fellow Detroit hip-hoppers Insane Clown Posse, are
brushing off the ashes from blistering attacks he's made against
them in his new songs.
</P>
<P>
   And Eminem's own mother is still pursuing a $10-million
defamation lawsuit for comments he's made about her in songs and in
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those who buy into what Eminem describes as simply
``vulgar humor'' speak even louder. ``The Slim Shady LP'' sold more
than 3 million copies and won two Grammy awards, including Best Rap
Album. And ``The Marshall Mathers LP'' spent eight consecutive
weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard charts.
</P>
<P>
   After that kind of success, Eminem can afford to laugh off his
critics _ even though he's still surprised at the intensity of some
of their reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew, when my music came out, people were gonna be like, `I
can't believe he just said that,''' says the 26-year-old rapper,
who was born in St. Joseph, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, but moved
to Detroit with his mother when he was young.
</P>
<P>
   He now lives in the suburb of Sterling Heights, Mich., and has a
four-year-old daughter, Hailie, with his estranged wife, Kim. The
couple is in divorce proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I thought people would listen to it and take
it for what it was: vulgar humor. To me, I could tell what songs
were serious, all jokes aside, and what statements were too
ridiculous to even believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people ask me, `You joke so much, you say so much ...
When do we know you're joking and when do we know you're not? When
do we know to take you seriously?' You don't. It's your guess. It's
kind of like a mystique I want to leave around me. It's the only
real mystique I've got. As far as my personal life, it's all out
there, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   In more ways than he'd like, actually. Eminem has been in the
news most recently for felony gun and assault charges stemming from
two separate incidents during June in suburban Detroit. In one, he
allegedly pulled an unloaded pistol on an employee of the Insane
Clown Posse. A few hours later, he did the same thing as he
confronted a man he claimed was kissing his wife at a bar near the
couple's home.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases have been remanded to circuit courts, where they're
expected to be heard during September.
</P>
<P>
   The news got worse in early July, when Kim Mathers _ whom Eminem
has ``killed'' in songs on each of his albums _ was taken to a
hospital for attempting suicide, following two Detroit performances
of the ``Up in Smoke'' tour, featuring Eminem.
</P>
<P>
   This is the part Eminem says he has problems with. He can handle
the critics and the moralists, but having to deal with security
issues, media scrutiny and otherwise comport himself like a star,
he says, is not why he's making music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a star,'' he insists. ``However anybody else with
success wants to act like a star, then that's on them, and that's
what they choose to do. I get in my car, I drive to Wendy's, I do
the same (things) that I've always done. I don't act like a star. I
don't try to wear a bunch of jewelry or flaunt that I got a bunch
of money and that. I don't need to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eminem, who's always been accommodating to fans who approach
him for autographs and to talk, is starting to feel the strain of
trying to stay accessible. He recently asked the city of Sterling
Heights for permission to build a fence around his home because of
excessive visits by fans and reporters. The request was denied. And
he acknowledges that frequently being recognized in public ``gets a
little nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   He's loath to cloister himself too much, however, because he
feels that his very strength is his accessibility _ both in person
and through his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more personal I get,'' he explains, ``the more people can
relate to me, relate to my pain, relate to what I've gone through,
my little personal dilemmas, my relationship with my girl, the
things I'm going through with my wife now, with raising a daughter
and trying to juggle a rap career, whatever. I always felt like the
more personal Tupac got, the more I could relate to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marshall Mathers LP,'' meanwhile, continues the path of
rapid-fire destruction that Eminem began on ``The Slim Shady LP.''
Besides Versace, his other direct hits include the late Sonny Bono,
the paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve and rivals Insane Clown
Posse. He makes a baldly prurient verbal advance on actress
Jennifer Lopez and even kills off mentor Dr. Dre _ twice _ in his
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (stuff) he comes up with is just incredible,'' says Sen
Dog of the hip-hop group Cypress Hill. ``To think like he does and
say (what) he does, and the style he brings, is really clever. It's
entertaining, it's funny, it's funky. And at the same time it's
like `Whoa, did he say that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem says the Aguilera slap was retribution for something
she'd said about him on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it galls him that he shares a significant number of
fans with the artists he attacks so venomously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable! I see no connection with them, and I always
find myself grouped up with them, like placed in almost the same
(music) category,'' he says. ``I often find myself lashing out at
that, to show, like, don't put me in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write my own lyrics. I write a lot of my own music. I do a
lot of my own production. I'm not trying to be like anybody else;
I'm trying to sound like nobody else. Nobody teaches me how to rap
or teaches me how to dance and tells me what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my own (music), and they ... well, it's such a lack of
talent. It's so corny. It's sissy music, man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is not that happy.''

FUNNY JULIA SWEENEY: FINDING COMEDY IN TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes a color photo of Wanda (voice of Julia Sweeney) and her
family in the TV cartoon show, ``Baby Blues.'')

 By JEANNE WOLF 
 c.2000 Jeanne Wolf 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julia Sweeney is best known as that overweight, bespectacled and
distinctly androgynous person named Pat, whom she played on
``Saturday Night Live'' and brought to the big screen in ``It's
Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing of the real Sweeney in Pat or most of the
other characters she's created ... until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've finally gotten to use my real voice in a TV show,''
Sweeney says, sounding just like herself as Wanda on ``Baby
Blues,'' the new cartoon series that airs Friday nights on the WB
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney was already a fan of the popular nationally-syndicated
comic strip on which ``Baby Blues'' is based. ``All my girlfriends
who are married and have babies kept telling me about it,'' she
says. ``I started reading it, never thinking it would be a cartoon
series. I thought it was very sharp and funny. Actually, our TV
version is darker and edgier. It doesn't focus as much on moms and
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Baby Blues,'' Wanda (voiced by Sweeney) experiences the ups
and downs of life in suburbia along with her husband Darryl (voiced
by Mike O'Malley) and their new baby, Zoe. The young parents face
challenges from the dysfunctional family next door and Zoe's
terminally hip baby sitter, Bizzy, who is a magnet for bad boys.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the thirty-something Sweeney is still single, she's
had no trouble relating to Wanda's daily struggle to keep her own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I would react pretty much the same way Wanda does
after she quits her job and decides to be a housewife,'' she says.
``There's a lot of frustration in being a suburban wife and mother.
You want to be the best but it makes you crazy half the time. Wanda
is looking for less responsibility and more time for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is one big difference between Wanda and me,'' she
continues. ``Wanda says things to her husband like, `You may as
well chain me to the couch and force me to watch cooking shows,'
because she doesn't get a kick out of being in the kitchen. I
actually love to cook and I'm a big fan of The Food Network,
especially `Hot off the Grill with Bobby Flay,' and `East Meets
West with Ming Tsai.' In the last year I've gone to cooking school
in Mexico and Thailand.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooking, along with traveling, are a reflection of Sweeney's
determination to enjoy life after a devastating couple of years.
Her brother, Michael, died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and she was
diagnosed with cervical cancer, which is now in remission. Sweeney
brought Michael to her home and cared for him, with the help of her
parents, during his last months.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's solution to the anger and frustration she was feeling
was to develop a comedy act based on her experience. ``God Said,
`Ha!''' played in Los Angeles and briefly on Broadway before she
made a movie version with the help of director Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me resists saying that laughter has the power to
heal,'' she says reflectively, ``because I don't want to think of
`God Said, `Ha!'' as some sort of good medicine. But I do think it
can be healing to find comedy in tragedy. When I discovered that I
could make audiences laugh about what I was going through, it was a
great release for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What pleases Sweeney is that ``God Said, `Ha!''' and ``Baby
Blues,'' while radically different in form, style and content, both
push the envelope of what's funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when the audience gets a little nervous and wonders
whether they should laugh or not,'' she says. ``I feel my
experience in life has often been not knowing whether I should be
crying or laughing. I don't like to always make it clear whether
I'm telling a joke or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I hate about a lot of comedy,'' she continues, ``is
that it tries so hard to be obvious about what's funny. It's like
here's the punch line _ and here's laugh track to cue you to know
it's a gag. I've always liked darker humor like you used to see on
`Mash.' It's horrifying and funny at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while Sweeney has earned raves for her original
approach to humor, she didn't grow up thinking she was funny. ``I
think I did get voted `the most comedic girl' when I was in the
eighth grade,'' she remembers, ``but there was sort of a dearth of
comedy in our school anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney attended Catholic schools in her hometown of Spokane,
Wash., and went on to major in economics at the University of
Washington. ``When I went to college I was really interested in
history,'' she recalls, ``but my mother was having a fit because
she'd thought I'd end up being a waitress who'd read history books
on her break. She kept saying, `Business! That's the thing.' So I
took economics.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Sweeney headed for Hollywood but not to
perform. She landed a job in the accounting department of Columbia
Pictures. ``Actually, there are a lot of very funny people in
accounting,'' she says. ``But I didn't adjust very well. There was
something wrong. I knew I could be a good accountant but never a
great accountant. After I got made manager of my department, I
thought, `That's it. You'll be a manager for the rest of your
life.'
</P>
<P>
   For about six months I would drive to work crying the whole way.
Then, one day, I read a review of The Groundlings comedy group and
it said they teach classes to nonprofessionals. I thought, `I want
to go.' And after the first class, it felt so right I could hardly
stand it. My whole life changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney admits she had one more barrier to overcome. ``I was 25
and I didn't have that classic skinny ingenue look,'' she says. ``I
think part of (thumbing my nose) to Hollywood was making myself
into Pat when I started at the Groundlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should say this to a therapist. It was like, `I might
not measure up in the pretty department but I'm going to show you
how funny I can be looking really ugly.' So I put on a 400-pound
fat suit and a wig and drew pimples on my face. After that, I felt
a lot better about myself!''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lies ahead for Sweeney personally or professionally,
she doesn't deny that the trauma she made fun of in ``God Said,
`Ha!''' has changed her forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It deepens you as person,'' she says. ``I want to work on more
important things. Life is too short after you've had cancer to do
something that you don't care about. I'd rather reduce my lifestyle
than do something that leaves me cringing inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm so happy about `Baby Blues' because I love the
writers, I love the cast and we're doing something good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   His best friend was always music, and at many times in his life,
it was his only companion.
</P>
<P>
   The music didn't judge Cameron Crowe, or care that he was shy
and chubby, or had zits, or worse yet that his mother let him skip
two grades, which made the rest of the kids think he was a geek.
</P>
<P>
   Girls ignored him, boys taunted him. So, after school Crowe used
to sit alone in his room with his true, cool friends. The Allman
Brothers, Yes and Black Sabbath understood his pain.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he felt compelled to write about music. At age 15, he sold
his reviews to Creem Magazine and local San Diego rags who paid him
next to nothing for his opinions. A good story brought in a
whopping $10. But the money didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rolling Stone told the kid he was good enough to go on the
road and write stories for them.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he was the coolest guy in town.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 43, he is one of the hottest and hippest directors in
Hollywood. His credits include ``Jerry Maguire'' (1996), ``Say
Anything'' (1989) and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   The former geek, who is married to rock legend Nancy Wilson of
Heart, is getting the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   His new film ``Almost Famous'' debuts on Sept. 22. ``I think
this is 90 percent my own story,'' Crowe admits.
</P>
<P>
   When he started out as a music reporter, it wasn't all sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my first assignment for Rolling Stone, I stood there
begging the guys by the backstage door at the San Diego Sports
Arena to let me in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Crowe wore them down and he was allowed to cross the
threshold from childhood to the rock world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went wild that night. I talked to everyone backstage
including the catering people,'' Crowe recalls, laughing. ``I think
that's the night the addiction set in because I was covering the
Allman Brothers and they were a very dark, inviting situation.
Their bass player had just died. They had a press blackout going
on. And there was this intense feeling of family and togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, it was `us against the world,''' Crowe says. ``And
to puncture that was an amazing feeling. I was allowed to go from
city to city in this cocoon ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The strong memories became the seed for a movie Crowe had wanted
to make for a decade. But he kept getting sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a rock movie first, but then `Say Anything'
took hold. Afterwards, I felt `Singles' (1992) was the right thing
to do,'' Crowe says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in retrospect, I'm glad I waited,'' he says. ``I think
the success of `Jerry Maguire' gave me the opportunity and the
budget to do this one the right way. I look back and shudder at the
thought that `Almost Famous' could have been my first film done on
the cheap with bad actors because no one would have trusted me back
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe knew from the start that the subject matter was a bit
complicated. Real life rockers and their entourages were guaranteed
to ask if they were depicted in any way in the film. But Crowe
explains: ``It's not one band. It's a combination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young guy on the road watching it, I couldn't believe how
complex and thrilling and dangerous this world could be ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe didn't care if things got heated after his stories broke
in Rolling Stone. And occasionally, a peeved band would threaten
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but bands are never upset about the things you
think will upset them. I could write that someone's music was
horrible. But if I wrote that they were wearing an ugly shirt or
that their marriage had painfully dissolved, then they'd get
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was not on the road to be friends with these bands. I
always felt I represented the fans. I was writing from the
standpoint of another normal person sitting at home in his room
wondering about this music,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe grew up in San Diego with his mother who is a psychology
professor and family therapist. (His father died in 1989.)
</P>
<P>
   By age 15, Crowe was writing for Zoo World and Creem. The next
year, he met an editor from Rolling Stone who hired him to go on
the road with top bands. In 1975, when given their choice of
writers, Led Zeppelin picked ``the kid'' to do a cover story on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still didn't feel cool,'' Crowe says, and smiles when asked
how a former geek got to marry a rock star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Nancy through riding in an elevator with her
then-boyfriend,'' he says. ``I was at a festival where Heart was
playing, but Nancy was very shy and protected by her people. Later,
two friends of mine attempted to set us up.'' Nervous about the
whole thing, he refused the date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, I ended up meeting her when I was looking for music for
`Fast Times at Ridgemont High.' I didn't find a song, but I did
find a woman who was unaffected and amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's career is also in the realm of amazing. His ``Jerry
Maguire'' grossed $154 million at the box office, and he is working
on reuniting with its star Tom Cruise, his favorite actor, for a
future project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was the first star who actively said to me, `I want to
play a character in one of your movies. I don't need the leading
man or golden haze around me. Just write something for me,''' Crowe
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, I had a hard time getting big name actors to do
my stuff,'' Crowe admits.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe says he is writing an untitled romance for Cruise to film
next year. Of course, one of his favorite tasks will come when the
script is penned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love choosing the music,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't upset about the sorry state of rock music these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll dies every year and then gets resurrected,'' he
says. ``Right now we're in a lull in a lot of ways. But I remember
feeling this way before Nirvana released `Smells Like Teen Spirit.'
And they re-energized everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel, somewhere in this country, some kid is in a garage and
about to change it all,'' he says.

 By IAN SPELLING 
 c.2000 Ian Spelling 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a very odd career, isn't it?'' says Joel Grey, cracking
up even as he speaks the words.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was 59 years ago that he made his stage debut in
``On Borrowed Time,'' 34 years since he won a Tony Award for
``Cabaret,'' 28 years since he won an Oscar for the film version of
``Cabaret'' and two years since he portrayed Joseph Goebbels in
``The Empty Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I'd known that, except for the technical preparation
one can do, the rest of one's career is up for grabs,'' says the
68-year-old, whose hair is as thin as his waist, but whose eyes and
smile still twinkle. ``You think you can control the elements of
the business and you think that if you do A, B and C, that D will
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd known that so much of A, B and C happens on its own, I
could have saved myself a lot of spinning. But I wouldn't change a
thing. The way my career is, it's the way it was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey flashes an impish grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean I shouldn't have worked hard or been
diligent about the craft, but that I shouldn't have concerned
myself so much with planning and expectation,'' he says. ``You may
or may not be able to do that in other businesses, but it does not
apply at all for performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey fancies himself an actor who can sing and dance, one who
thrives on the stage, but also one who can acquit himself quite
nicely in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   His latest project, a big screen version of the ageless musical
``The Fantasticks,'' taps all of his talents.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which will open in limited release on Sept. 22,
follows the travails of young lovers Luisa (Jean Louisa Kelly) and
Matt (Joe McIntyre), whose relationship is almost ruined by the
machinations of El Gallo (Jonathan Morris), a traveling carnival's
magician. It seems Luisa's and Matt's fathers (Joel Grey and Brad
Sullivan, respectively) hired El Gallo to bring the lovers
together, but he instead tempts them to stray.
</P>
<P>
   Grey and company assembled in the desert near Tucson, Ariz.,
five years ago to make ``The Fantasticks.'' Michael Ritchie, the
director, revived the nearly extinct Cinemascope widescreen format
and shot several of the production numbers live. The film then
languished on a shelf at United Artists, as the studio contemplated
releasing it direct to video.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Francis Coppola, the famed ``Godfather'' director, a
friend of Ritchie's and a newly installed potentate on the United
Artists board of directors, came to the rescue. He, with Ritchie's
blessing, edited the film and fought for its theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay was awful for everybody involved,'' Grey says. ``The
filmmakers were so respectful and slavish, in a way, to the
original material because Tom Jones (book and lyrics) and Harvey
Schmidt (composer) were there and Michael collaborated so well with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they thought they'd opened up the material and,
obviously, it hadn't been opened up enough. It wasn't made filmic
enough, according to the stories I heard from the studio. It's also
my understanding that Francis came in and said, `I think you missed
something here and I've maybe got some ideas about how to make it
better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That Michael was open to that, I thought was great. Francis
cut out about 40 minutes, including several numbers, to focus more
on the story, and here we are. I really like it and I hope it finds
an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   After he wrapped ``The Fantasticks,'' Grey, who is Jewish and
was born Joel Katz, played Goebbels, the German Nazi minister of
propaganda, in the fascinating character study, ``The Empty
Mirror'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   He also portrayed the Ghost of Christmas Past in a telemovie
version of the Charles Dickens classic, ``A Christmas Carol''
(1999), and returned to the Broadway stage last year for Brian
Friel's ``Give Me Your Answer, Do.'' He made time, too, to tackle a
supporting role in ``Dancer in the Dark,'' the new film from
director Lars von Trier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancer,'' won the Palm D'Or at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival
and will kick off the New York Film Festival in September before
opening wider in October. It stars the Icelandic singer Bjork as
Selma, a down-on-her-luck single mother. Only her fantasies about
Hollywood musicals keep Selma sane as she goes blind, fears for her
son's vision, and is put on trial for stealing a neighbor's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the quirkiest, most compelling movies in a long
time,'' Grey says. ``I play a character who is talked about in the
movie and then finally appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a witness in a trial. I make my appearance, and then I do
a number with Bjork. Wait until you see this movie. I know people,
including a great director, who hate it, and I know other people,
including another great director, who think it's a masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey is grinning from ear to ear as he says this. It's obvious
that he still loves the game, that he gets a kick out of mixing it
up. Again, just look a this career: films, theater and television;
comedy, drama and musicals; and starring roles, character bits and
cameos.
</P>
<P>
   He's a man with both a history and a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I follow my intuition and 99 percent of the time I make the
right decision,'' says the actor, who makes a cameo appearance in
``Armistead Maupin's Further Tales from the City,'' a miniseries
that will air later this fall on Showtime. ``It's almost always
about the character, what I can learn from doing it, and what the
character can contribute to the film or the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get to a place where I think, `I can't do this,' I know I
have to do it. It's scary, but that's what makes me jump. It
happened with `Cabaret.'''
</P>
<P>
   It also happened with ``The Music of Chance'` (1993) and ``Give
Me Your Answer, Do,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened with all the plays and movies that ever won me any
kind of recognition. And that fear of `I can't do this,' is what
keeps me jumping even now.''

   LIGHTHEADED
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, you've conquered your fear of heights and
you're ready to celebrate. You're not ready for skydiving and hang
gliding's just not your thing. Airplanes are, well, boring and with
those big balloons, who knows where you'll end up? Climbing a tall
ladder's no fun, so what's left? Why, your own personal, one-man
Parabounce balloon, of course. Tethered to the ground, over water
or even indoors, this 22-foot-diameter, polyurethane-coated nylon
sky chair inflates with helium in about 45 minutes and deflates in
15 minutes. It packs down small enough to fit inside your car
trunk, so you can carry it wherever you want. Parabounce will lift
you up to 100 feet so you can float quietly or, when that gets old,
try the flip chair for 360 degree somersaults. Or just wave to the
neighbors as they sulk with envy. Parabounce comes in yellow for
$20,000 from Hammacher Schlemmer.
</P>
<P>
   TOW 'N' GO
</P>
<P>
   Get me down, you say. You're a water person. No problem. We've
got the gear to give you a one-of-a-kind thrill over, on, or under
aqua pura. Waterskiing is a blast except when your towboat pilot
doesn't show because he's recovering from last night's party.
That's where Solo comes in _ a three-cylinder, 70-hp jet personal
water craft that offers self-service waterskiing and wakeboarding.
All controls, including turning, accelerating, stopping and horn,
are in the tow handle. Solo pulls you at a price tag of $6995.
</P>
<P>
   FLOATING ON AIR
</P>
<P>
   No thirst for that type of adrenaline rush? Maybe you like your
water sports on the mellow side, say, tubing down a quiet river,
fishing or just sightseeing on a calm lake or stream. Pow-R-Tube
with Pow-R-Pack, a motorized inner tube, is just the ticket.
Imagine the looks on downstream tubers' faces as you wave to them
tubing upstream. The system uses a 30-pound thrust Minn Kota
electric motor with five forward and three reverse speeds. You
steer with your feet. Deflated, the unit takes up less space than a
set of golf clubs. The tube will float $580 out of your checkbook,
with the Pow-R-Pack costing an additional $339.
</P>
<P>
   BUBBLE MACHINE
</P>
<P>
   Now that you've seen what's on the water, check out what's under
it with BOB (Breathing Observation Bubble). This underwater scooter
dispenses with conventional scuba gear. Sit comfortably, breathe
normally and smile at the fishes from inside your air-filled, clear
acrylic dome. BOB uses a ballast weight, an air tank and a
battery-powered 40-pound thrust electric motor for cruising at
speeds up to 2.5 knots. A steering wheel and instrument console
complete the $12,000 package. The scooter will dive to 40 feet and
allow you to be submerged for about 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOODNESS' SKATES
</P>
<P>
   Inline skating may be all the rage, but Motosk8s will have every
other skater eating your dust as you smoke by 'em at an effortless
25 mph. The secret is a 22.5cc 1.5-horsepower 8-pound two-stroke
engine that's built right into one skate. The 15-ounce fuel tank
will keep you going for over an hour, and if you run out of gas,
you can skate conventionally to the nearest full-service filling
station and have the gas jockey fill you up. Don't forget to tell
him to wipe the windshield and check your air. If gas prices go any
higher you may find yourself surrounded by econo-minded
Motosk8ters, in which case consider springing for the hop-up kit
(bigger carburator, exhaust and more) to maintain your advantage
with a 35-mph top end. Motosk8s cost $549.
</P>
<P>
   MAGNIFICENT SEVEN
</P>
<P>
   What could be more cozy than a bicycle built for two? How about
a tricycle built for seven? Here's the perfect exercise machine for
large families, Sierra Club corporate board meetings or for taking
the whole neighborhood for a ride. Hand-built in the Netherlands,
this trike uses a heptagon-shaped base so that all riders face each
other. The frame mounts three motorcycle wheels set up like a
tricycle. Everybody grabs onto the circular handlebar. Seven sets
of pedals connect to the chain-drive system. The captain sits at
the rear, looks out for traffic and controls the steering and disc
brake while yelling at the galley slaves to pedal harder. An
exclusive Hammacher Schlemmer offering, the steel tube-constructed
trike sports an automotive paint finish and sells for 16 grand.
Shipping is $200 extra unless, of course, you ride it home. This is
one machine guaranteed to stop for any hitchhiker.
</P>
<P>
   CAT'S MEOW
</P>
<P>
   This automatic self-cleaning litter box is the next best thing
to your cat learning to flush the toilet. When your cat exits the
box, an electric eye signals the sifting comb, which sifts the
length of the box, harvests the ``crop'' and deposits it into an
airtight holding cartridge. The Littermaid cat box is available for
about $200 at all major pet stores and mass retailers.

   DOE PREDICTS A DARK FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy (DOE) says the way electric utilities
currently generate and distribute power could lead to massive
blackouts. A report by scientists at its Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., urges utilities to investigate
using a ''distributed power grid.'' The idea is to add hundreds of
traditional and nontraditional generation and storage devices _
including wind turbines, solar collectors and other generators _ to
the national electric power distribution network. ''Less reliance
on large-scale power plants would give the grid a more stable
foundation,'' says a lab spokesman.

   VALUE OF DNA MAP IN DOUBT
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from several research centers say the much heralded
''working draft'' of the human genome has limited value.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiled in June as a description of the biochemical code for
humans, it is acknowledged to have errors. More significant, only
85 percent of the DNA code has been assembled in the correct order.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the job will take about two years. Locating all the
genes and describing their functions could take two decades.
</P>
<P>
   SEATBELTS INFLATE IN CRASHES
</P>
<P>
   Airbags work best when you sit crash-dummy straight. Trouble is,
people slouch. Behold the BF Goodrich inflatable seatbelt.
</P>
<P>
   ''During a significant crash, the system rapidly inflates a
bladder that runs the length of the belt,'' says a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the existing airbag system, the belt inflates in
the first 10 milliseconds of a crash. Airbags deploy after 25 to 30
milliseconds. In the fraction of a second before airbag deployment,
the belt pushes the occupant into the proper seating position.
Thus, the force of the airbag is better tolerated and the bag
itself offers more protection, especially for kids. The belt's
cushioning also distributes the force of restraint across the body.
</P>
<P>
   SmartBelts will be available in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   SPY GEAR IN THE FACTORY
</P>
<P>
   Technology that was first developed for American spies will help
Ford Motor Co. track inventory and race parts to the right spot on
the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   California-based WhereNet Corp.'s stamp-size devices transmit
ultralow power signals that are so weak they normally disappear in
ambient electromagnetic noise. It's a clever way for one spy to
discreetly find another spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Ford plants, the WhereNet Material Call System receiver grid
listens for signals that let the person searching for parts know
when they are within 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   WhereNet devices may soon appear outside the workplace. The
company says an amusement park may loan parents devices that will
help them track wayward kids.
</P>
<P>
   NARROW TRACKS CUT DATA COSTS
</P>
<P>
   An improved production process makes it possible to construct
silicon recording heads that lay down three times as much data on
magnetic media.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of machining heads, Alditech processes batches of heads
on a single silicon wafer, using a method similar to making
integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a head that can read and write on narrower tracks.
A digital cassette that holds 30 GB of data can now store 100 GB,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Alditech (www.alditech. com) estimates media storage costs will
fall from dollars to pennies.
</P>
<P>
   TRAINING WINGS TAKE OFF
</P>
<P>
   Future Air Force and Navy pilots are getting new training wings.
The T-6A, a military version of Raytheon's Beech/Pilatus PC-9 Mk
II, will replace the aging fleets of Air Force T-37s and Navy
T-34s. The first fully aerobatic aircraft was accepted during a
ceremony at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Built on an all-aluminum frame, the T-6A has a maximum takeoff
weight of 6,500 pounds. The high thrust-to-weight ratio makes for
fast climbs. It can reach 18,000 feet in less than 6 minutes. It
has a 31,000-foot ceiling and true airspeed in excess of 270 mph.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER NIGHT VISION
</P>
<P>
   The elite 75th Ranger Regiment has completed field testing the
next generation of night sights to be used on Army and Marine Corps
M-16s.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing less than 3 pounds, the rugged thermal targeting sights
will also be able to identify targets in bad daylight weather.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, the developer of the sights, says the same technology
can be incorporated into night vision aids for drivers and,
someday, helmet sights.
</P>
<P>
   Having the Ranger's stamp of approval, Sanders hopes to begin
production in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   THREE HULLS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
</P>
<P>
   The first of what may become a new class of fighting ships, the
trimaran warship, has been launched at Vosper Thornycroft's
Southampton, England, shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the length of a football field, the research vessel
Triton is the world's biggest seagoing trimaran.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hull design _ a thin center hull and two outriggers _
was inspired by ocean racing yachts. It allows more open deck space
and is inherently faster and more stable than monohull designs.
</P>
<P>
   The British Defense Evaluation and Research Agency says it will
evaluate the design for its future surface combatant, a ship
intended to replace Type 22 and Type 23 frigates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Builders of Seattle's Kingdome said it was strong enough to last
a millennium. Just a day shy of its 24th birthday, that prediction
came crashing to the ground. In a scant 16.8 seconds the world's
largest thin-shell concrete dome dissolved into a cloud of dust and
debris. Although explosives got credit for erasing the obsolete
sports arena, it was the relentless tug of gravity that actually
did most of the work, explains Mark Loizeaux. The president of
Controlled Demolition Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix, Md., he is a leading
authority on reducing massive structures, and the brains behind the
big bang in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge in demolishing the Kingdome wasn't size, but
geometry. A quarter of a century ago, structural engineer Jack
Christiansen designed the Kingdome to take full advantage of the
inherent stability and strength of the arch. The Romans used it to
build their aqueducts, parts of which are still standing. Running
arches around a circle produces a dome, which is stronger still. It
is simple, strong technology, and a big headache when it's time to
take things apart.
</P>
<P>
   You knock down a building like you tackle a person: You go for
the legs. In buildings, the legs are the columns that hold the
floors and roof in place. This simple formula couldn't be applied
to the Kingdome because it had no legs to kick out. The roof was a
clear arching span suspended atop exterior columns. A massive steel
tensioning ring, 2262 feet long, 2 feet thick and 24 feet wide,
encircled the base of the dome roof at the top of the 40 exterior
columns. It held the arches in place against each other, under
nearly 9 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the ring _ easy work for explosives _ would obviously
drop the roof in one fell swoop. It was also out of the question.
The resulting vibrations from the force of the concrete hitting the
ground could shake nearby buildings to the point of inflicting
serious damage. A more elegant solution was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Two-Step
</P>
<P>
   Working with Rich Riggs and his concrete demolition experts from
Aman Environmental Construction Inc., of Oakland, Calif., the
Kingdome doom-makers decided to bring down the roof in two stages.
Using concrete fragments from the demolished concrete ramps and
bleacher stands, they created vibration-dampening berms that would
act as an impact cushion. ''We didn't know how much it would reduce
the vibration because there was really nothing to compare this
to,'' Riggs says. In the end they decided 12,000 cubic yards of
concrete should cushion the fall of the 70 million-cubic-foot dome.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-January, the overall plan of attack was in place. Crews
began punching in for two 10-hour shifts, seven days a week.
Working around, above and below each other, they tore out 10,000
seats, 5,000 bleachers, miles of roof insulation and wall panels,
and anything else that moved. Explosives experts followed, drilling
nearly 5,500 holes, half of them in the roof's 40 ribs.
</P>
<P>
   One more critical decision remained. And it could be made only
after a live explosive's test. In late February, CDI did a small
blast on a column to determine the best match between explosives
and structure. Some 4,450 pounds of explosives were carefully
portioned among the 5,500 holes, which were then two-way wired to
blasting caps for redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Time To Pray
</P>
<P>
   Success would be a matter of timing. ''We wanted to force one
portion of the structure to move while still holding the other,''
Loizeaux says . To do this, the Kingdome would be almost instantly
cut into six pie-shaped sections. Choreographing this catastrophic
ballet required the creation of imperceptible pauses within what
would appear to be one explosion. The $9 million demolition job
would require 400 primary detonation delays and 600 secondary
delays.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 am March 26, the Kingdome was wired to blow. It is
traditional to demolish buildings on Sunday mornings, as fewer
people are bustling about. At CDI it is also a tradition to pause
for a moment to pray. Then, at 8:32 am, licensed blaster Thom Doud
pushed the button.
</P>
<P>
   The first sequence of explosions took out three of the six roof
pie slices, pulling the structure inward. The second phase of
explosions followed, as key points on the roof ribs and the columns
detonated. After 20 weeks of work, the rest was up to Mother
Nature. As the roof fell, the tensioning ring that had for so long
held up the arches was being used to pull down the exterior
columns.
</P>
<P>
   Before the blast, CDI predicted it would take 17.6 seconds to
drop the dome, leaving rubble as high as 70 ft. standing afterward.
The dome cooperated, falling slightly faster, in 16.8 seconds, and
leaving nothing taller than 25 ft. Even better, 99 percent of the
debris landed within the blast circle. There were only five windows
damaged in nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Loizeaux was exhilarated, but not entirely surprised. ''We don't
blow things up,'' he says. ''We let things fall.''

   PHANTOM FLUSH
</P>
<P>
   Q. Every day, our toilet makes sounds as if it were being
flushed, when no one is near it. What could be causing this to
happen? Is there something we can do to fix it, or do we need to
call a plumber?
</P>
<P>
   _ JUDY BUTLER, TALBOTT, IND.
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a common problem, although it can be quite unnerving
if you hear it for the first time in the middle of the night. You
might think you have an uninvited guest in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The flushing sound is not an actual flush. It's water refilling
the toilet tank. Possibly, there is a flush valve in your toilet
allowing a small amount of water to drain from the tank. You don't
hear the water flowing through the valve into the bowl, but after
several hours, the tank's water level drops to a point where the
water fill valve is actuated, and the tank is refilled with water.
</P>
<P>
   The leak could be the result of improper alignment of the
flapper on the flush valve seat, a slight crack or deterioration of
the flapper or possibly a dirt buildup on the valve seat. If you
are handy, you won't need a plumber to correct the problem. This is
a typical do-it-yourself job. Shut off the water valve to the
toilet, flush the toilet, then empty the water remaining in the
tank. Replace the flapper, and clean the valve seat. The job should
take less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE-HOUSE FAN
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since our home is surrounded by trees that shade the house
and keep it cool, we are interested in using a whole-house fan
rather than having central air conditioning. Please advise us on
how this system works and where it can be purchased. _ ALVIN
SYDNOR, BOOTHWYN, PA.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although a whole-house fan is used for cooling, it does not
actually cool the indoor air. Instead, it replaces the hot indoor
air with fresh air from the outdoors. Even when the outside
temperature is the same as the indoor temperature, cooling is
achieved because air movement helps cool the body by evaporating
perspiration. Air that's moving can feel as much as 10 degrees
cooler than air of the same temperature that is still. Of course, a
whole-house fan is most effective after sunset when it can draw in
cooler night air.
</P>
<P>
   The fan is generally installed in the ceiling beneath the attic
or in an opening cut in the gable end. When activated, the fan
creates a negative pressure that causes warm indoor air to be
pulled into the attic. Cool outside air is drawn in through one or
more open windows.
</P>
<P>
   When the fan is ceiling mounted, it causes the attic space to
become pressurized, and this causes the hot air to be pushed out of
ventilating louvers such as gable or soffit vents. When the fan is
gable mounted, it pulls the air out of the attic. In either case,
it's critical that one or more windows be kept open, not only for
cooling but for safety reasons. Unless adequate makeup air is
supplied, the negative pressure created in the house can pull in
exhaust gases from combustion appliances, such as a gas-fired water
heater. This is obviously dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Gable-mounted fans have hinged louvers facing the outside that
are normally closed when the fan is off and open when the fan is
activated. This can cause condensation problems in the attic during
the winter because the louvers, which are closed for months at a
time, restrict airflow for ventilation. In order to prevent the
attic from being inadequately ventilated during the winter, the
hinged louvers should be held at a fixed open position. I have seen
a number of delaminated roof decks during my inspections that were
caused, in part, by this.
</P>
<P>
   Whole-house fans can be purchased at home centers. They often
come with a manual On/Off switch. However, the fan is more
convenient to operate if this switch is replaced with a timer
switch.
</P>
<P>
   PORCELAIN STAINS
</P>
<P>
   Q. The high mineral content of the water where I live stains
porcelain surfaces, such as the entrance to a toilet trap. These
dark stains are very difficult to remove, even with bleach. What
else can be used to remove them? _ CAROLE MADISON, HOLLYWOOD, FL.
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a common problem in areas where there is a high
mineral content in the water. Fortunately, the dark crust formed by
these minerals can be removed using cleaners that are formulated
specifically for removing mineral stains. These cleaners are sold
at supermarkets and hardware stores. An effective product for
removing these stains is Sani-Flush. One application is usually
enough to remove normal amounts of mineral deposits. Heavy deposits
may require more than one application.
</P>
<P>
   CLEANING VINYL SIDING
</P>
<P>
   Q. The vinyl siding on our garage has mildew on it that is very
difficult to remove. I've tried a specialty cleaner, and I've also
used chlorine bleach. Neither worked. What can I do? MRS. RICHARD
FAYFAR, AURORA, ILL.
</P>
<P>
   A. According to the Vinyl Siding Institute (VSI), you can clean
mold and mildew from vinyl siding using Fantastic, Windex or a
solution of 30 percent vinegar and 70 percent water. The institute
does not recommend using aggressive or highly abrasive cleaners
because they can damage the siding's surface.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on vinyl siding, visit VSI's Web site at
www.vinylsiding.org. Click on the Information Center bar on the
left of the screen, then go to Publications. From there, click on
Cleaning Vinyl Siding. The cleaning chart that is available online
is arranged alphabetically, from Bubble Gum to Top Soil. Fifteen
common stains are covered, and you'll find that, in most cases,
common household cleaners remove them.

similar comforting purpose. By Sophia Kishkovsky.

</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-HORMONE-REPLACEMENT-LIFEBEAT _ Nowadays, it seems as if
only people with a Ph.D. in epidemiology _ and preferably circus
experience _ can juggle all the pros and cons of hormone
replacement therapy, much less make sense of all the conflicting
reports. As if the choices the treatment itself poses weren't
complicated enough, now medical researchers are challenging the
popular notion that the same-size dose fits all women. That means
the million-dollar question facing women of menopausal age _ do I
or don't I? _ may soon be eclipsed by an even trickier one: How
much is right for me? By Kathleen McAuliffe. 1,350 words.

Insider'' and plays Minnie Driver's daughter in ``Beautiful.'' Then
there are the Pepsi ads that catapulted her to fame, in which she

They stock up on loads of plants, tools, fertilizers and other
irresistible items, well aware that we, still partially dazed with
winter delirium, will obediently march out and purchase tons of

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all encountered service animals _ the dogs, cats and
horses trained to help those with disabilities accomplish the
myriad tasks of daily life. Certainly we know the all-star: the
handsome Seeing Eye dog, its skill and dedication shining through
as it guides its master or mistress along a busy city street,
stopping at traffic lights, negotiating sidewalks, curbs and crowds
of people.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us are also aware of the dog's less famous service
brethren _ the hearing dogs who alert hearing-impaired people to
telephone rings, smoke alarms or babies' cries; the specially
trained dogs, cats, birds and rabbits that visit people in
long-term care homes and help alleviate their loneliness and
depression; even the horses that help disabled children and adults
gain vital strength and coordination as well as new confidence
through therapeutic riding programs across the country. According
to the Delta Society of Renton, Wash., a group dedicated to
fostering the partnership between humans and service animals, these
animals are legion _ numbering some 16,000 and growing.
</P>
<P>
   Even better news is emerging for those with disabilities, says
Lynnette Spanola, Delta Society vice president of development and
public relations. Entirely new types of service animals are coming
to the fore. Not only are they expanding the repertoire of animal
skills, they're bringing new help _ and new hope _ to some for whom
assistance from service animals was never before possible.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization Canine Companions for Independence
has pioneered the training of service dogs to perform all kinds of
tasks for disabled people. The dogs can open and close doors, turn
lights on and off, fetch or carry objects and pull wheelchairs. But
that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, for people with epilepsy or other seizure disorders,
there are seizure-alert dogs,'' Spanola says. ``They can give their
owners a warning anywhere from three to 30 minutes ahead of an
attack, allowing them to get to a safe place and prepare for it.
We're not quite sure how the animal knows; it might sense a change
in the owner's smell or energy level.''
</P>
<P>
   For Donna Jacobs, who experienced seizures following a stroke,
and whose dog Patra won the Delta Society's Top Dog award last
year, ``having a seizure dog made the difference between staying at
home _ not being able to work or drive a car _ and being marketing
director of a computer company.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogs, cats and other animals have also been able to alert their
masters _ and, sometimes even more importantly, their masters'
spouses _ to an impending coronary episode. Last year's National
Service Animal of the Year, Dakota, a golden retriever, has done
just that on several occasions for his master, Mike Lingenfelter, a
62-year-old engineer from Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lingenfelter's congestive heart failure had already caused three
serious heart attacks before he got Dakota from a shelter. Now,
when Dakota aggressively nuzzles him, Mike knows to take his
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Dakota even saved his life,'' says Spanola, ``by waking
up Mike's wife in the middle of the night after his blood pressure
had dropped so low he'd stopped breathing.'' Spanola adds, ``Dogs
and other animals have also been used to help people with emotional
or psychological disorders such as agoraphobia.''
</P>
<P>
   She cites the case of New York City librarian Celia Holm, who,
at the recommendation of her psychiatrist, adopted a mixed-breed
dog, Scout. Coupled with the doctor's care, Scout's companionship
and emotional support enabled Holm to overcome her severe,
longstanding fear of open public spaces and eventually re-enter the
wider world, without psychotropic medication.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing new addition to the service-animal menagerie is
the capuchin monkey. Distributed by the nonprofit Boston-based
organization Helping Hands, these smart, dexterous and affectionate
little primates are finding careers as helpmates to a growing
number of the nation's 250,000 quadriplegics.
</P>
<P>
   After five years or more of socialization and training, the
monkeys know how to fetch food and drinks from the refrigerator,
microwave and feed people their meals, scratch facial itches, turn
pages, retrieve dropped objects, insert and remove disks and
cassettes and reposition paralyzed limbs that have slipped from
their wheelchair rests. They also make wonderful companions.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Strong, 51, who was paralyzed in a car accident in the
1970s, has had her ``adorable'' Henrietta for 20 years (capuchins
can live to age 40). If Strong drops her mouth stick, which she
needs to type and press buttons and remote controls while her
caretakers are away, the monkey retrieves it. ``Henrietta helps
take away the uncertainty about what I can do when I'm alone,''
says Strong.
</P>
<P>
   Helping Hands _ which oversees the monkeys' breeding, raising,
schooling and placement _ has so far distributed 60 monkeys to
quadriplegics. Twenty more are in training, and 150 are being
socialized by ``foster'' families. In every sense of the word,
these monkeys are dear: each one costs the organization a total of
$25,000 from initial breeding through successful placement.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of all is that, thanks to the efforts of the Delta
Society, Helping Hands, CCI and other organizations of their kind,
a good dog (or cat, horse or other service animal) is no longer
hard to find. For further information, contact the organizations

<P>
   Nowadays, it seems as if only people with a Ph.D. in
epidemiology _ and preferably circus experience _ can juggle all
the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy, much less make
sense of all the conflicting reports.
</P>
<P>
   As if the choices the treatment itself poses weren't complicated
enough, now medical researchers are challenging the popular notion
that the same-size dose fits all women. That means the
million-dollar question facing women of menopausal age _ do I or
don't I? _ may soon be eclipsed by an even trickier one: How much
is right for me? The answer to the latter question could determine
the response to the former, for dose has a direct bearing on the
treatment's side effects, long-term safety and likely benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to the birth control pill, circa 1960 _ the one that
caused a massive outbreak of swollen breasts, bloating and
depression and even triggered life-threatening complications like
blood clots. It is now common knowledge that the high doses of
hormones were to blame for this epidemic. Today's birth control
pill, which contains five times less estrogen and 10 times less
progestin, is generally considered safe and is tolerated by most
women.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone therapy may be evolving along a similar path. Despite
its sizable health perks _ relief from menopausal symptoms,
stronger bones and possible cardiovascular benefits _ as many as
two-thirds of women who start the therapy stop treatment within two
years. Side effects are the major reasons that women cite, with
many complaining of mood swings, tender breasts, water retention,
irregular bleeding or simply feeling ``crummy.'' Concern that
long-term use of hormones might raise the risk of breast cancer has
further dampened women's enthusiasm for hormone therapy.
</P>
<P>
   What is clearly needed ``is a safer, gentler, more acceptable
form'' of therapy, said Dr. Bruce Ettinger, an endocrinologist and
senior investigator at Kaiser Permanente Medical Program in
Oakland, Calif. To that end, Dr. Ettinger and researchers
nationwide have been studying how women on hormone therapy respond
to reductions of 50 percent or more in the standard prescription of
estrogen (typically 0.625 milligrams of Premarin). Less progestin
is also given because its sole purpose is to counter estrogen's
tendency to promote cancer in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   What is emerging from this research is intriguing, suggesting
that a woman's need for estrogen shifts as she ages. As the
investigators acknowledge, women experiencing a turbulent change of
life frequently require full-strength hormone therapy for symptom
relief. But women whose symptoms have subsided or who are not
bothered by menopause may be able to gain long-term benefits with
fewer side effects by switching to a half-dose regimen. This
approach appears to maintain sufficient bone mass to stave off
fractures from osteoporosis. More tentatively, low-dose regimens
may help lower cholesterol and improve other parameters of
cardiovascular health.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the research is new, and critical questions remain
unanswered. It is not known whether low-dose therapy will offer any
protection against heart disease. Indeed, new research has raised
questions about the cardiovascular benefits of full-dose therapy.
At currently prescribed doses, hormone therapy dramatically
increases coronary blood flow, which is normally viewed as a
positive change. But in some susceptible individuals, it can
trigger blood clots, strokes or heart attacks. A reduced dose of
estrogen, clinicians theorize, would be less likely to overload the
cardiovascular system and trigger the coronary events that the
therapy was to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, more conservative doses are expected to carry less
risk of breast cancer than full-dose therapy, but it could take
decades to determine this.
</P>
<P>
   It does appear, though, that low-dose hormone therapy can often
provide relief from the symptoms of menopause. In a study conducted
by Dr. Ettinger, 138 women who had been using the standard amount
of therapy for an average of nine years were switched to a
half-strength dose of estrogen and were given progestin less
frequently. Only 7 percent of subjects experienced a surge in hot
flashes, leading them to drop out of the trial. The majority
reported complete or substantial relief from menopausal symptoms,
and 85 percent preferred the lower dose.
</P>
<P>
   Studies exploring the effects of low-dose hormone therapy on
bone density are also encouraging. In a three-year trial involving
108 women age 65 and older, researchers at Creighton University in
Omaha gave participants half-strength hormone therapy with a daily
supplement of calcium and vitamin D. Subjects' spine bone mass
increased by an average of 5 percent. ``That rivals the results you
get at high doses of Premarin,'' said Dr. Robert Recker, director
of Creighton's Osteoporosis Research Center and the lead
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Reported side effects in the women, many of whom were using
hormone therapy for the first time in their 70s and 80s, were so
mild as to be virtually indistinguishable from a placebo group.
That is noteworthy. Clinicians, Dr. Recker said, ``were told
without adequate data that the minimum dose for protecting bones
was 0.625 milligrams of estrogen, yet at the same time such a high
dose was not tolerated in the elderly.'' The addition of calcium
may be the secret to why less estrogen can be so effective. Dr. B.
Lawrence Riggs, a professor of medicine at Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., and an expert on hormone replacement therapy,
said estrogen boosts bones' absorption of calcium and prevents its
leakage through the kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   As doctors revise basic concepts, Dr. Ettinger warns, it is
possible that doses will come down even further. Ultralow-dose
therapy is currently being tested and makes the half-dose look
large by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   With investigators at the University of California in San
Francisco, Dr. Ettinger is overseeing a trial of these tiny doses
(less than one-millionth the standard dose of estrogen) in women
over 60. The rationale for the trial stems from a surprising
finding from the research team led by Dr. Steven Cummings,
assistant dean for clinical research at the University of
California, San Francisco. Using new, more sensitive assays to
measure estradiol (the key estrogen produced after change of life),
the group discovered that postmenopausal women fall into two
distinct clusters: Roughly 70 percent produce 5 to 20 picograms of
estradiol per milliliter of blood serum, but about 30 percent make
none at all. And the difference between producing a little versus
none is significant.
</P>
<P>
   Osteocytes, which are cells critical for maintaining bone
health, die off in women who cease making the hormone. And they are
three times more prone to devastating hip and vertebral fractures.
Dr. Cummings suspects that the loss of estrogen may cause cells in
other parts of their body to atrophy as well, perhaps accelerating
cardiovascular decline or degenerative conditions like Alzheimer's
disease. On the plus side, women who produce no estradiol have the
lowest incidence of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This finding challenges what a normal menopause means,'' Dr.
Cummings said. ``The key question is, do women who produce no
estradiol have a bleaker clinical picture overall? And what happens
if we give estrogen at levels to raise older women into the normal
range for their age?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the goal of the ultralow-dose trial. Estrogen will be
administered in such tiny quantities that investigators suspect
that no progestin will be needed to prevent hyperplasia _ something
they will carefully monitor. At the same time, they will look to
see whether the ultralow dose improves bone mass, mood, memory,
cholesterol, vaginal dryness, libido and urinary incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, what should a woman do? Half-dose therapy, say the
investigators, is an option that women who are open to taking
hormones may want to discuss with their doctors. As for ultralow
doses, stay tuned. Medical experts have as yet a fragmentary
understanding of hormone therapy, and the conventional wisdom about
it seems to shift as often as the wind. Women must be ready to
change course as new findings emerge.

   A few months ago, my kids and I stopped at the supermarket
before soccer practice to pick up a loaf of bread, 100 percent
fruit juice and a few other staples. We raced around the store,
sped through the express lane and made it to practice with a minute
to spare. I was proud of my speediness until I unpacked the
groceries and realized that I didn't buy whole wheat bread or the
100 percent fruit juice. I picked up a brown loaf made with white
flour and a beverage that was 100 percent natural, but only 10
percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you've made some similar mistakes. Who could blame you?
With the typical grocery store stocking 50,000 items, twice as many
as a decade ago, it's impossible to read every label, let alone
wade through an entire ingredients list. So we often rely on visual
shortcuts to size up nutritional value _ pictures of fruits and
vegetables on the package must mean it's healthy; grainy-looking
brown bread must be whole wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers know you're in a rush at the supermarket and
some do whatever they can to make their products seem more
nutritious than they really are,'' points out Bridget Swinney,
R.D., of El Paso, Texas, author of ``Healthy Food for Healthy
Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   So you (or I) don't fall into these traps again, Swinney and
other children's nutrition experts went shopping to find the five
most common types of products masquerading as health foods, and
tell you how to spot a phony.
</P>
<P>
   MULTIGRAIN BREADS: A FAKE TAN
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Manufacturers may add caramel coloring or molasses
to bread made with mostly white flour so it will appear darker and
more nutritious, says Sandy Nissenberg, R.D., a Buffalo Grove,
Ill.-based author of children's cookbooks. Then they give the bread
a healthy-sounding name, like ''12-grain,'' ``multigrain'' or even
``whole grain.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, breads made with mostly white flour aren't bad, but
they contain about half the fiber, magnesium, zinc, vitamin E and
potassium, as well as far fewer phytochemicals (healthy plant
compounds) as loaves made with only whole grain flour. That's why
the USDA recommends that half your child's daily six to 11 grain
servings _ a slice of bread, an ounce of cereal or a half-cup of
rice or pasta counts as one _ be whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: See if enriched wheat flour or enriched flour is
the first ingredient. Those are fancy names for white flour _ the
same kind of flour used in white bread, explains Nissenberg.
</P>
<P>
   To find a whole grain loaf, check for the word ``whole'' in the
name of the first ingredient. Or skip the ingredients list and buy
a brand with the words ``whole wheat'' in its name. The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration requires that the only flour in ``whole
wheat'' breads (unlike ``multigrain'' or even ``whole grain''
breads) be whole grain.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Stroehmann 100(percent) Whole Wheat, Pepperidge
Farm Natural Whole Grain, Wonder Stoneground 100(percent) Whole
Wheat, Freihofer's Stone Ground 100(percent) Whole Wheat, Sahara
100(percent) Whole Wheat Pita.
</P>
<P>
   SKIM-MILK PUDDINGS: OIL SLICK
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Manufacturers plaster the phrase ``made with
wholesome skim milk'' or ``made with nonfat milk'' on the label.
You think the pudding is made entirely with skim milk, but, for
creaminess, manufacturers have added several grams of partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil, points out Dr. Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an
associate professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York City. Not only do these puddings end up with
four grams of fat _ the same as those made from whole milk _ but
the type is trans fat, which Ayoob says is as risky for heart
health as saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Look for the phrase ``partially hydrogenated oil''
in the list of ingredients. That's a sure sign that the product
contains trans fat, explains Ayoob. (The FDA is considering a
proposal that would require the amount of trans fat to be listed on
the label.) Choose a brand that is ``fat free'' or is made with
skim milk and canola oil, which is heart-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Fat-Free Jell-O, Swiss Miss Fat Free, Handi-Snacks
Fat Free.
</P>
<P>
   POULTRY HOT DOGS: PLUMPED WITH EXTRA FAT
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: You may presume that poultry hot dogs are made
with low-fat white-meat turkey or chicken. Truth is, many
manufacturers throw in the skin and dark meat for extra moistness.
As a result, most poultry franks give you a paltry fat savings when
compared with their beef counterparts. Furthermore, some brands may
have exactly the same amount of fat as beef franks _ up to a
whopping 13 grams!
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Zero in on the frank's fat content. If each frank
has more than four grams, it's probably made with dark meat and/or
skin. Choose the lower-fat versions instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Oscar Mayer Fat-Free, Ball Park Fat Free, Dietz &AMP;
Watson Gourmet Lite, Butterball Fat Free.
</P>
<P>
   100 PERCENT NATURAL JUICE BOXES: WHERE'S THE JUICE?
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Manufacturers often highlight the phrase
''100(percent) Natural'' on the package and show pictures of fruits
or vegetables. You think you're buying 100 percent juice, but that
claim, and the photos, have nothing to do with the amount of juice
in the product. It simply means the product is free of artificial
additives or preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these products contain only 10 percent or 25 percent
juice,'' says Swinney. ``Since kids like 100 percent juice as much
as they do 10 percent juice, why not buy the product that's
healthier for them?''
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Check the side panel to see the percentage of
juice the product packs. Buy a brand that's 100 percent natural
(also called all-natural) and 100 percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Minute Maid Apple, Orange, Grape or Cherry juice
boxes with calcium; any flavor of Juicy Juice, Mott's, Sesame
Street or Apple &AMP; Eve.
</P>
<P>
   PASTA AND RICE SIDE DISHES: SHRINKING VEGGIES
</P>
<P>
   The disguise: Call it photographic license. The meal shown on
the package is chock-full of veggies. ``Unfortunately, when you
cook the side dish at home, you realize there are hardly any
vegetables at all. In fact, some brands have as little as a quarter
of a teaspoon of vegetables per serving,'' says Ayoob.
</P>
<P>
   Spot a phony: Check the Nutrition Facts label on the package. If
the product doesn't contain at least 20 percent of the Daily Value
of vitamins A or C per serving, it's probably skimpy on veggies,
since these are the nutrients that are abundant in most produce.
</P>
<P>
   Quick picks: Bird's Eye Italian Style Vegetables &AMP; Bow-tie
Pasta, Cascadian Farm Mediterranean Pasta Salad, Green Giant
Broccoli &AMP; Cheese Flavored Sauce (add to pasta or rice).

   Jack is a vegetarian. ``I don't want to kill animals to eat,''
he told his parents one night. Soon, however, his ban on red meat
was extended to chicken, fish and anything with the smallest amount
of fat. He also placed himself on a strict exercise program, doing
sit-ups and calisthenics every day, and running around the school
track every afternoon for an hour. ``At first, we thought it was
great that Jack was into being fit,'' his mother explains. But over
the course of six months, not only did Jack not gain weight, he
lost more than 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin, star of the school play, goes to the girls' bathroom
two or three times a week, puts two fingers down her throat and
throws up before going on stage to rehearse. Her best friends know
what she does but are sworn to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like typical teen-age angst about body image, right? Not
exactly: Jack is 8 years old. Caitlin is 9. According to experts,
these children's stories are becoming increasingly common.
Youngsters today are more concerned than ever about their body
images. Many are developing unhealthy eating habits that can become
full-blown disorders with potentially life-threatening
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At age 3, children already show a dislike for those who are fat,
rating drawings of fat children more harshly than those of
youngsters with disabilities, according to a series of studies
conducted by Ohio State University psychologist Susan C. Wooley.
They also attribute negative qualities to fat people, labeling them
mean, lazy, cheating and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   By early grade school, some children are not only counting
calories, they're using laxatives and diet pills, and forcing
themselves to vomit in an attempt to drop pounds. A study of more
than 3,000 middle-class, fifth- through eighth-graders by
researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina, in
Charleston, found that 40 percent felt fat and/or wished they could
lose weight; 30 percent had already dieted; 8 percent had fasted;
30 percent had pilfered a parent's diet pills or diuretics, and
almost 5 percent had forced themselves to vomit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the study, most of us thought that eating
disorders were pretty much limited to college-age women. To hear
kids as young as 10 years old confess to taking laxatives to lose
weight was eye-opening,'' says Dr. Timothy Brewerton, director of
the Eating Disorders Program at the Medical University of South
Carolina and the study's lead author.
</P>
<P>
   Eating disorders in teens and adults are notoriously difficult
to recognize, and those in children even more so. As a result, such
disorders are often misdiagnosed or missed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young children may be brought to a pediatrician because
they're overeating, refusing to eat or chewing food and then
spitting it out,'' says Dr. Susan Sherkow, a New York City-based
psychiatrist who directs a therapeutic and preventative nursery for
mothers and children with eating disorders. ``But instead of
considering the possibility of an eating disorder, doctors assume
these kids are merely picky eaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Third- and fourth-grade girls are fearful of getting fat, says
Dr. Catherine Steiner-Adair, a clinical psychologist and director
of education prevention and outreach at the Harvard Eating
Disorders Center. What Steiner-Adair dubs ``fat talk'' starts
early. By age 6 or 7, it's not unusual for a girl to ask her mom
``Am I too fat?'' Around age 9 or 10, girls often begin to appraise
their own and each others' appearance and compare themselves with
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Early grade school is also a time when children begin to link
their self-worth to the concept of good and bad. ``I've heard
preteens turn to each other and repeat comments like: 'I'm so fat;
I hate myself.' ... 'Let's be really bad today _ let's eat
dessert!' ... or 'I was so good _ I just had a salad' _ that they
may have first overheard from their parents,'' says Steiner-Adair.
</P>
<P>
   Boys are by no means immune. Steiner-Adair recalls when a boy in
her neighborhood came home from camp and announced that he wanted
'a six-pack.' ``He'd learned from the older guys that 'having a
six-pack' means you're so buff, so muscular, that your lower three
ribs on each side show'', she says. ``I realized that 'fat talk'
was becoming part of a boy's experience, too. They're becoming just
as vigilant about their bodies as girls are.'' Indeed, 28 percent
of normal-weight boys in Brewerton's study reported being
dissatisfied with their weight.
</P>
<P>
   And just when fitting in and looking ``right'' becomes the Holy
Grail, the unpredictable pacing of puberty means that growth rates
and body shapes become as varied as fad diets. There are girls who
are so distraught by their new womanly curves that they believe
starvation is their only option. Unchecked, such erroneous beliefs
and hazardous habits can develop into a diagnosable eating
disorder, putting a child at risk for serious, sometimes
irreversible, medical problems, including stunted growth, the
cessation of menstruation and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, our cultural preoccupation with thinness presents an
unreasonable and, for most, forever unattainable ideal. While we
may tell our kids that real beauty is found on the inside, just
about everything from Hollywood to Madison Avenue, magazines to
music videos, rewards the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Today's kids are the first generation to be raised by parents
who target their heart rates, analyze their body fat and purchase
fat-free cookies. If Mommy moans that she can no longer zip her
jeans, berates herself for having eaten that whole corn muffin or
precisely monitors every last morsel that her child puts in her
mouth, she's not teaching healthy attitudes about food and
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many mothers who struggled with weight issues when they
were young and are so worried that their kids will, too, that they
begin talking about counting calories when their child is in
preschool,'' says Dr. Melanie Katzman, assistant professor of
psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.
``That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   So is eliminating fat from the diet of toddlers and
preschoolers, says Sherkow. ``Kids need a certain amount of fat in
their diet to develop normally,'' she says. ``Fat is not a dirty
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperament also plays a key role. ``There is a high correlation
between kids who have eating disorders and kids who have trouble
coping in social situations,'' says Brewerton. ``Someone who is
inflexible, withdrawn, perfectionistic and obsessional may be at
greater risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Susceptible kids often come from famlies in which one or both
parents are overachieving, overcritical or rejecting, notes
Katzman. ``When a child feels powerless or helpless, eating, or
refusing to eat, is the only way she can exert some measure of
control over her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, parents play a huge role in shaping their child's
self-image and confidence, at least partly through their attitudes
toward food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to help your child avoid an eating disorder is to
stop it before it starts,'' says Brewerton. ``The youngster who has
open communication with his parents, who feels loved regardless of
her achievements, mistakes or looks, will stand strong against peer
and media pressure.''

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Most all of the women I know
are single and have been for a long time. My three best friends and
I have been non-cohabiters since way before we started seriously
eyeballing the wrinkle-vanishing creams on drugstore shelves _ a
grand total of 78 years for the four of us. Do we like our single
state? Sometimes. Would we rather be married? Occasionally. Do we
think we'll ever marry again? Probably not. Why? We're not really
sure, but it's not because we haven't been asked. Not often, but
asked. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Louisiana was the next state
after Florida to issue a ``Choose life'' license plate and the
first state to have a court stop plate sales. If the court's
reasoning stands, the 31-flavor specialty plate business of a lot
of states could be a thing of the past. The U.S. district court
last week made a reasonable point: When states play politics with
license plates, they have to let everyone have his say. (Lane,

   ANTI-ATLANTA _ The SUV-driving mayor of Jacksonville wants
voters to approve a sales-tax referendum today to combat sprawl.
His pitch: ``There's a name for a city that doesn't plan for its
future: Atlanta.'' It's a common approach throughout the South _
Atlanta bashing. Whether it's a referendum, as in Jacksonville, or
an election like last year's mayor's race in Nashville, Atlanta is
a favorite regional punching bag. (Chapman, Atlanta

   DELTA-VOTE _ ATLANTA - Ramp workers this week will be getting
union election ballots _ again. The National Mediation Board is
mailing out ballots for a rerun of last spring's election in which

procedural glitches warranted a new election. (Staff, Atlanta

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: Will you please find the full name of the
mother of director Ron Howard? Ron gave her the role of the
astronaut's mother in ``Apollo 13.'' Did she go to college in
Oklahoma and has she been in other movies?
</P>
<P>
   _ F. Wilson
</P>
<P>
   A: Jean Speegle Howard played Jim Lovell's mother, who is crazed
by the broken TV set in her nursing home. Didn't they know the
mission coverage was being televised? Born in 1928, Speegle
appeared in several films, including ``Cocoon'' and ``The Night
Caller.'' No word on her Oklahoma roots, but Ron was born in
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About two years ago, there was a class action suit against
the manufacturers of Synthroid. Since I signed up for the claim, we
moved and I cannot locate the paperwork to send them a new address.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cyndi Cavalier
</P>
<P>
   A: Knoll Pharmaceutical Co. received final approval of the
litigation settlement in August. More than 778,000 consumers will
receive $111 each if they began taking Synthroid, a thyroid disease
treatment, before January 1995; about $74 each after that date.
Called into question was the product's marketing, not its safety.
</P>
<P>
   Contact the Consumer's Council line at Allan Kanner &AMP;
Associates, (800) 331-1546, or by e-mail
a.kanner(at)kanner-law.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for mustache wax. I have a handlebar mustache.
</P>
<P>
   _ D.H. Frost
</P>
<P>
   A: Barber and beauty supply companies stock it (less than $3 a
tube) _ black, blond, brown, neutral and chestnut. The longest
mustache on record, according to the Guinness Book of Records, grew
on the top lip of Kalyan Ramji Sain of India. Total span? 11 feet,
11 inches. Snidely Whiplash would be green. Q: Can you get the
address for Arnold Schwarzenegger? I want to get in touch with him
because of an article that he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   _ Willard C. Fales
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Mr. Maria Shriver in care of Robert Stein, William
Morris Agency, 151 El Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90212 or
visit www.schwarzenegger.com. Q: I recently mailed letters to some
retired teachers. When I inquired about postage stamps honoring
school teachers, I was told that there weren't any. Could this
possibly be true since there seems to be a commemorative stamp for
about everything else?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonnie Bumpas
</P>
<P>
   A: In a way, yes. ``Currently, we have no stamps honoring school
teachers,'' reports Postal System spokeswoman Barbara Pokorny. A
32-cent commemoratsive stamp featuring a child and adult reading
together, ``Helping Children Learn'' was issued in 1997. Educators
such as Johns Hopkins, Father Flanagan and Mary Lyon have been
honored in the past on ``definitive'' stamps ($1, 4 cents and 2
cents respectively). Still available, a ``definitive'' is a
regular-issue stamp sold over long periods of time. Have an idea
for a stamp? Subjects for stamps should be submitted at least three
years in advance of the proposed issue date to allow sufficient
time for consideration and, if approved, design and production.
Send submissions to: Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, c/o Stamp
Management, U. S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza S.W., Room
4474E , Washington, D.C. 20260-2437.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year, a friend's fiancee attended a wedding in which the
bride played Wagner's ``Bridal Chorus'' on her accordion as she
marched up the aisle. My friend's fiancee has decided she wants to
do the same thing. Is this considered taboo at a wedding, or at
least inappropriate?
</P>
<P>
   If not, should the accordion and the bride's gown be
color-coordinated? Where should she have the bridal bouquet? If her
father accompanies her down the aisle, what should he do, because
both of the bride's hands and arms will be busy moving as she plays
her squeeze box?
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Anything goes at weddings _ this would not be my choice, but
if the bride and groom agree, they can do somersaults up the aisle
if they want. It is their wedding. The black-and-white accordion
fits in color-wise. Dad should be next to or trailing the bride,
depending on the width of the aisle. The bouquet can be waiting for
her at the altar. Q: I'd really like to get my hands on a jacket
like the one James Dean wears in ``Rebel Without a Cause.'' Any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Fairmount Historical Museum in James Dean's Indiana
hometown sells Dean memorabilia (alarm clock, shot glasses, etc.).
The bright red polyester/cotton blend jacket similar to the one he
wore over the signature white T-shirt unfortunately has ``James
Dean, Fairmount, Indiana'' embroidered on the front left side ($35
plus tax, S&AMP;H). To order call (765) 948-4555 or visit
www.jamesdeanartifacts.com. Q: Large red harvester ants are eating
all leaves off a tree and have already killed several trees. I have
been told that a bait is made to kill them, but I cannot find it.
Can you?
</P>
<P>
   _ John P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry. Currently an effective bait is not available to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   The muncher is the Texas leaf cutting ant (Atta texana) also
known as the town ant, cut ant and night ant.
</P>
<P>
   Harvester ants eat seeds and scavenge for food, but they do not
dine on leaves, according to Texas A&AMP;M entomologist John Jackman.
The leaves that leaf-cutting ants strip from green trees and shrubs
are not eaten, but rather taken back to nests and used to raise a
fungus garden (yum). Living in colonies that may exceed 2 million,
these ants feast on this garden growth.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman notes Volcano Leaf Cutter Ant Bait is available, but
only for use in pine forests, through suppliers in East Texas such
as Red River Specialties.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on this ant and other Texas insects, visit
http://insects.tamu.edu. Q: How come the president and vice
president get to use government planes for other than government
business? They showed the vice president with his whole clan _
wife, children and running mate _ arriving in Minnesota, as the
caption under the photo stated, aboard Air Force II for a campaign
stop. This was clearly not government business. The use of the
planes cost the taxpayers a lot of money that I can't justify.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Gothard
</P>
<P>
   A: Candidate Gore is still Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dan Pfeiffer of the Gore/Lieberman campaign: ``The
vice president as both vice president and candidate requires
security. That is why he travels on Air Force II. The campaign pays
for all political expenses accrued when he is on the campaign
trail.'' No harm. No foul. No taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have noticed through the years many women wear their
wedding rings on the right hand. Is this a tradition for widows or
divorcees?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.A.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: In some countries (Spain for example) wedding rings are worn
on the right hand by everyone. Since tradition in the United States
dictates wedding rings are worn on the left hand, moving the rings
to the right is significant. Divorcees often do this (if they have
not sold or reset the stones). Widows, on the other hand, often
continue to wear wedding rings on the left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Moving it to the right hand signals availability.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We enjoy the many exotic pleasures of a septic system. We are
anxious to learn how to clear shower drains of accumulated goop
while still protecting the delicate balance of bacteria in the
septic tank.
</P>
<P>
   Baking soda or vinegar keeps a drain smelling clean, etc., but
does not clear accumulated debris. Our plumber suggests only
occasional snaking by a professional will work. Is there any other
way?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: If the sink is clogged, experienced plumber Bill Kamen of
Superior Septic and Plumbing advises customers to use Liquid
Plumber before giving him a call. This may eliminate the clog. Then
restore the bacteria fighters in the system with a yeast treatment
(one package in one small drain line in each bathroom _ not the
toilet) two or three days later. On a regular basis (once a month)
this yeast treatment (same yeast used to make bread) works well.
The yeast attaches to the grease and retards build up.
</P>
<P>
   No yeast? Use 1/2 cup beer or buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   Although the New York legislature was the first to introduce a
bill recognizing Labor Day, Oregon was the first state to enact
such a law (February 1887). Want to celebrate the achievement of
workers more than once a year? Visit Australia Oct. 7 for Labour
Day and France, Argentina or Egypt for the May 1 celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Heard the one about the mysterious Klingerman virus or the Costa
Rican bananas causing necrotizing fasciitis? Both are false
Internet rumors that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
wants to quash. Before you panic or pass on unfounded stories,
check out www.cdc.gov/hoaxrumors.htm to get the lowdown on the
fabled banana bacterium or a mythical viral infection contracted by
those receiving a mysterious package marked ``A Gift to You from
the Klingerman Foundation.''

   Bundles of fun
</P>
<P>
   For kids not content with mere ogling and cooing over their
latest bubble-gum card acquisition or setting up a fantasy
competition via linked game machines, Bandai's Gundam Wing offer
hands-on, tangible toys for imaginary-world play. Better still,
Bandai bundles two activities into one package as the toys are also
available as Gundam Wing plastic model kits ($5 to $25;
www.bandai.com). When the glueless snap-together figurines are
finished _ complete with weapons, decals and accessories _ they
become effective and interactive posturing models with some 40
points of articulation. A slightly sophisticated motor-skills
challenge and a long-term toy craze all in one. Pretty neat.

   A boost for your roost
</P>
<P>
   If you've got one thing that serves two purposes, that's half
the battle. Fisher Price's Stow `n Go Booster Seat ($20;
www.fisher-price.com) is not only a portable bottom uplifter for
your diapered chair-sitter, it's also a handy-dandy lunch
box/picnic basket/carryall. Folding neatly into a diminutive and
colorful briefcase of sorts, the Stow `n Go is a vinyl-covered,
hard-shelled, zippered storage box with a couple of soft-side
pouches for all your stowing and going needs. Set up, the
porta-booster will strap and anchor to almost any chair, where it
unfurls to form a decently durable, low-back, wee-bum riser.

 &HT;    VH1.com, MTV.com worth the wait _ plus, they're legal
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In some twisted way, we all have Napster to thank for
a new spate of music Web sites from a variety of major media
companies.
</P>
<P>
   While Napster, a peer-to-peer music file sharing program, may
have raised many legitimate questions regarding copyrights and fair
use of music on the Net, the 20 million-plus user base has shown
there is an appetite for online music, news and concert information
from the tiniest teenybopper to the baldest boomer.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, this interesting bit of information was not lost on
MTV and VH1, two of the most popular music brands online or
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago we were bashing MTV for being five minutes late
to the party when it came to having a coherent Web strategy, and up
until very, very recently, that's been true. But somewhere at MTV,
the interactive light bulb finally went on. In fact, enough light
bulbs seem to have gone on over at MTV and VH1 to light up Times
Square, site of the company's corporate headquarters. The new VH1
Web site and the new site for MTV's white-hot hit ``Total Request
Live'' make listening to online music legally fun again.
</P>
<P>
   The new VH1 Web site (www.VH1.com) is a special treat for music
lovers of all ages _ and especially for that strange group in the
middle recently dubbed ``aging GenXers'' by Rolling Stone magazine.
(Memo to Douglas Coupland, author of the book that gave this group
its moniker: Where's our midlife crisis novel? It's clearly
overdue.)
</P>
<P>
   These aging GenXers, who range in age from about 25 to 39, have
been a forgotten group when it comes to online music, yet we are
out there in great numbers. The same Rolling Stone article that
declared Xers officially over the hill also complained they are
``clogging up'' Napster, presumably with all those REM, Talking
Heads, Barenaked Ladies and Sonic Youth files.
</P>
<P>
   So it's especially nice that VH1 has decided to target the GenX
demographic with its new Web site. Go directly to the ``Sound and
Vision,'' and you'll be treated to a variety of audio and video
clips from artists you've heard of (Madonna, the Clash and, yes,
even Spinal Tap) and a few you may have heard of (Shelby Lynne,
Kenny Wayne Shepard, Julianna Hatfield).
</P>
<P>
   There are also picks of the day from spoken-word artists and
comedy albums. The news section features interviews and articles on
artists as diverse as Brit Pop sensations Elastica to a new book
about John Lennon. VH1.com is a well-edited collection of new and
familiar music that should appeal to music lovers who want to
expand their horizons but also keep up with old favorites.
</P>
<P>
   While aging Xers clog up VH1.com, younger fans will want to
bookmark MTV's new site, which is miles ahead of anything they've
tried to do in the past. MTV.com may be able to take home the
trophy for most unsuccessful redesigns, but this time it looks like
they just about got it right.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the site would be pretty close to perfect if it were
easier to get to the extensive Web site for ``Total Request Live.''
For now, fans of this 21st century of ``American Bandstand'' will
have to head over to the pull-down menu for ``shows'' and click on
``TRL.'' But it's worth the journey.
</P>
<P>
   MTV makes it easy for fans to vote for their favorite videos and
possibly win a trip for you and a friend to go to a ``TRL'' taping
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as popular as the videos is show host Carson Daly. For
those of you unfamiliar with the show, Daly is well on his way to
becoming this generation's hipper, cuter and just as overexposed
version of Dick Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can check out ``Carson's Corner'' and read his bio, or
click on a variety of pictures that will make excellent wallpaper
on any teen's computer monitor. And if pictures are your thing,
check out the ``TRL'' photo booth with new pictures of frequent
guests of the show including Jennifer Lopez, Method Man, Alanis
Morisette and Beck. The 'N Sync photos are pretty cute, too.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of ``Total Request Live'' also know their viewers
on and offline like to interact with the celebrities and rock stars
on the show as well as pick their favorite videos. There are plenty
of opportunities to do that here, from chat rooms to a place to ask
questions about MTV and ``TRL'' that are answered in an FAQ
section.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, if you'd like to download music from the MTV site,
you need to go to the ``Xtra section'' _ again more work than we'd
like. The selection is short but worth it, if you're into new
music.
</P>
<P>
   The only complaint we have with VH1.com and MTV.com is that the
navigation of each site is kind of clunky, but the content you'll
find here is worth the minor inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   What vaudeville comic Will Rogers once said about New England
weather also seems to apply to the Web sites from MTV and VH1: ``If
you don't like it, just wait a minute.'' For music fans, these two
sites were definitely worth the wait.

 &HT;    `WinBack' not a winner for long
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Operation WinBack'' starts off with a bang. The
introductory graphics are excellent, and despite a largely
fictional setting, the story line promises a degree of realism that
offers more in common with ``Rainbow Six'' than ``Tomb Raider.''
</P>
<P>
   Realism is clearly a focus of this third-person action game,
which involves a crack anti-terrorism team going into action
against a well-organized terrorist force that has seized control of
a strategic weapons satellite.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good, although the contrived acronym of the
anti-terrorism team, (Strategic Covert Action Team, or SCAT), is
the first hint that things may not turn out as well as they
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, within minutes of entering the actual game action,
one realizes that ``WinBack'' has all the entertainment value of
filing paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   While the graphics are actually quite nice, if leaning toward
the gritty realism end of the spectrum, both the game controls and
the game action are poorly conceived. Despite the third-person
interface, the action is conceptually most similar to that of
``Virtua Cop'' on the Sega Saturn. In ``WinBack,'' the agent makes
his way through an apparently outside environment that is actually
a bidirectional maze composed by artfully placing various objects
in places that will constrain the movement possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This is done in a fairly subtle manner and is not bothersome.
The occasional semi-trailer laid adroitly askew creates a nice bit
of ambience in addition to constraining your freedom of movement.
However, the camera is constantly moving almost perfectly out of
sync with your own movements, thus frequently leaving you exposed
in the enemy's line of sight while you are staring at a concrete
wall 90 degrees away from where the incoming fire is coming.
</P>
<P>
   The firing action is problematic, too. It's apparently not
possible to fire over open sights, but basic sighting is required
through the laser sight first, so firing a shot is a two-step
operation. This isn't too clumsy by itself and actually is a more
accurate simulation of a real handgun-firing process, but when
combined with the movement-camera confusion, leads to a tremendous
amount of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Since the game is linear, with the same enemies in the same
places every time, these challenges can be surmounted by
repetition, but playing an action game by rote is almost
counterproductive. At the end of the day, I say just bag the
operation and let the Crying Lions have the wretched satellite.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Perhaps you're a gadget glutton, or maybe your
trash bin overfloweth with disposable income . . . Either way,
there's something very novel, overpriced and niche-market
functional waiting for you in Sharp's Internet Viewcam ($700;
www.sharp-usa.com), a digital minicam that requires no tape stock,
merely a removable, many-megabyte (four to 32) ``SmartMedia''
memory card and four AA batteries. It weighs in at a respectable
5.2 ounces at roughly the size of a hockey puck. Utilizing
relatively new ``MPEG-4'' digital video compression, this unit
targets the amateur or frugal Webmaster hoping to place thin,
middling-grade streaming motion pictures (or stills) of the
family's last camping trip on the Web or directly into
manageable-sized e-mail messages. Playback on the PC is exclusively
suited to Windows Media Player, a dangerous assumption on Sharp's
part Still, this is certainly a gadget that'll get your gizmo
going.

   TAKING YOUR GAME TO ANOTHER DIMENSION
</P>
<P>
   Bring your PC monitor to ``life,'' virtually, with VR Joy 2000
($70; www.vrstandard.com), a 3-D glasses bundle complete with
adapters and tweak software ``VR Caddy,'' which will turn any
DirectX or OpenGL graphics _ think games _ into simulated
three-dimensional extravaganzas, regardless of 3-D acceleration
programming or lack thereof. Creepy in that ViewMaster Viewer kind
of way, this stunning VR Standard peripheral has an edge over
similar products on the market as it is compatible with ``most''
VGA graphics cards (as opposed to units such as Elsa's 3-D
``Revelator,'' which works best with Elsa's cards and not so great
with everyone else's). The Joy2000's Line Blanker Controller Port
allows users to view ``stereoscopic'' images on the Internet
without additional hardware or software for the 3-D effect. In
fast-paced games such as Unreal Tournament or the bundled, complete
version of Systems Shock II, that effect is uncanny to the point of
distraction, but slower, more fluidly paced games are simply a joy
to play. There's also great viewing potential for your favorite Web
sites or screen saver. Bringing us that much closer to the virtual
reality of ``The Lawnmower Man,'' this is the fully immersive
technology of the day.

 &HT;    For ultimate protection, unplug cable
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Is turning off my netsharing on my cable modem protection enough
for my computer files? I also have a password-protected
screensaver. Is that protection enough against cable modem hackers?
</P>
<P>
   _ Gerry Dupuis, Decatur, GA
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Let's reiterate a few things from an earlier TechSavvy
column. There are pitfalls associated with using a cable modem. The
ultimate way to protect yourself is to unplug the cable from the
back of your PC when you don't need to surf the Web. Another layer
of protection is to turn off File and Print Sharing in the Network
Control Panel on the PC, or FileSharing on the Macintosh, when
you're cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: But the best protection is a firewall. A firewall controls
traffic between your computer and the Internet and alerts you to
intruders. There is protection for Mac and PC. PC'ers can go to
www.networkice.com for BlackICE Defender and Mac'ers to
www.opendoor.com for DoorStop.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: While screensavers can prevent outsiders from accessing
your computer when they walk up to it, they don't protect you from
an open cable modem system.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Hackers would access your computer as if it were a
directory on their computer. They look for an unprotected directory
and ``walk'' right in. Hackers can get their mitts on your files
and do a lot of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Where's a good place to get a rebuilt laptop? Also, I was
looking for a toast for a 60th birthday bash. Where can I find this
on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Ayton
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You take the cake, Bill. Not sure anyone has asked
TechSavvy a question like this. Let's talk used equipment first.
When buying a pre-owned car, you always take a chance if you don't
know what road it's been down. The same goes for computers. Having
said that, computer resellers are worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Surf to IBM's Refurbished PC Warehouse
(commerce-03.www.ibm.com). The wares had a previous life as leased
computers. Mac loyalists can cruise to MacResQ (www.macresq.com/)
or Mac of all Trades (www
</P>
<P>
   .macofalltrades.com/). Of course, you also can find PC and Mac
laptops on eBay (ebay.com/). Keep your eye out for warranty
options.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: After price-checking used models, investigate new
equipment, too. I'd compare and contrast before ruling out
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Now, about that perfect toast for the birthday bash.
We're hip on tapping the power of the Web for anything and
everything, so zip over to
zinnia.umfacad.maine.edu/(tilde)donaghue/toasts.html. There's bound
to be something to your liking.

 &HT;    Long-distance mouse may solve DVD woe
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A reader has sent in a question dealing with a
peripheral matter on digital photography and in the process has
provided me with a lot more information than, I fear, I will be
able to give him.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor describes himself as a ``high amateur''
photographer who once used a professional 35mm single-lens reflex
camera with multiple lenses. We all know people like him _ you look
at their pictures and say, ``Wow, you ought to be a professional.''
They smile and remark that they've already got enough problems,
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have now switched entirely to digital photography,'' Taylor
writes, ``and have used it exclusively on a three-week trip to
Scandinavia and two weeks in the Canadian Rockies. The pictures are
beautiful, and I was able to use my CD writer to make CDs to share
with many of my fellow travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also typical of these ``high amateur'' photographers _
they're unusually thoughtful and unsparing with their talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use ACDSee to view these and it is quite simple, you just
use the mouse wheel to scroll between pictures without having to
load each one. It also does a small amount of editing (such as
giving the pictures names).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Kodak DC265 Camera, and it is great. The Sony
Mavica's pictures are not very good quality, in my opinion. I tried
one out but took it back after the trial. Incidentally, many stores
will allow you to try a camera for 30 days. I tried three different
ones before settling on my first Kodak, and I would encourage
people to do this to find the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentions the Mavica because we discussed that line a few
weeks back. The Mavicas store their images on floppies instead of
memory sticks, a nice idea, but the images made with them do not
compare well with other cameras in the same price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as prints go, I have a HP Photosmart P1100 Printer, and
the picture quality is as good as those from my 35 mm camera. They
do 8x10 pictures of a quality that is outstanding when done on a
photo-quality paper, and 5x7s on regular paper are better than what
I was getting from my old Canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son and his wife come for Christmas, I take pictures, I
print them off and that afternoon, when they go to her mother's,
they have the pictures of our Christmas to share with her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it's hard to get the family around a 19-inch computer
screen. Many of the newer DVD players say they will play Video CDs,
but as far as I can tell these are only for moving pictures
formats. Is there a DVD Player that will play JPEGs?''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know of one, but then I know next to nothing about DVD
players made exclusively for plugging into televisions. However, a
19-inch screen ought to be, in theory at least, nicely viewable
from a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Several firms, I believe, make a long-distance cordless mouse,
effective from clear across the room. Perhaps this would alleviate
your problem if not solve it, and many thanks for all the
information.

   Sad but true: Paranoia is going out of style. The world really
is becoming a treacherous place, and genuine security is getting
harder and harder to come by (OK, maybe paranoia is still somewhat
fashionable). Fortunately, Angel Watch Systems offers numerous
devices to keep tabs on that which is tabable. Its Wall Clock Cam
for example ($240; www.angelwatch.com) contains a high-quality,
wide-angle pinhole camera within its covertly homely face. Suited
to just about any room in which one would expect a nondescript
timekeeper, the Wall Clock Cam offers discreet remote viewing
and/or recording through a standard monitor and/or VCR. The Angel
Watch product line includes innumerable other spy devices such as
the Clock Radio Cam, the Pencil Sharpener Cam or the Thermostat
Cam. And hey, even if your paranoia isn't real, the various units
function normally, too.

   EFFICIENT? COUNT ON IT
</P>
<P>
   The Hewlett-Packard HP12C Financial Calculator ($70;
www.hewlettpackard.com) hasn't changed much since the 1980s but,
like the mouse trap, it's simply too efficient at what it does to
warrant an overhaul. Boasting some 120 functions, the likes of
which only number crunchers can truly appreciate, this calculator
does it all, as far as numbers go anyway. Pardon my Greek, but the
HP12C is nuts on Statistical Analysis (cumulative, standard
deviation/mean/weighted mean, forecasting, correlation coefficient,
yadda yadda yadda); stuffed with business/finance features and
digitally cognizant of TVM (number nerd jargon for Time Value of
Money), making it expedient with loans, savings, leasing,
amortization, interest-rate conversions, bond price and yield,
depreciation methods and whatnot. Perhaps I'm not the most apt
reviewer to review this functional numeric chewer and spitter, but
the financier in my family swears by it. So do millions of other
proud professionals.

   TEST MARKET MARVEL
</P>
<P>
   The latest Internet-enabled Palm clearly demonstrates why
wireless Internet is the future of personal data assistants. The
Palm Vx (www.palm.com; $399) with OmniSky modem (www.omnisky.com;
$299, with $150 rebate for customers who sign up for at least six
months of wireless Internet service) offers quick and easy Net
access to well-known portals such as Yahoo, Excite and Go.com, and
browsing to non-graphic-intensive Web sites. It also supports up to
six POP3 e-mail accounts, a valuable tool for the business
traveler. By comparison, the Palm VII only gives you a ``palm.net''
address and no Web browsing. The OmniSky modem uses AT&AMP;T's wireless
network, offering access in 3,000 metropolitan areas; Atlanta is
the only notable exception. The Internet service is $39.95 a month
for unlimited usage. My favorite feature of this Palm-modem combo,
available now only in Austin and Seattle as test markets, is the
detachable modem, so if you want to Palm sans Internet, you're
holding a svelte 3.9-ounce machine. With the modem, the setup is
about twice as thick and weighs 8.5 ounces, still sleek by any
measure.

 &HT;    This kit should help you survive a storm power outage
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a few days last winter, my cast iron Buck Stove
was the heighth of working technology at my house.
</P>
<P>
   My computer had been reduced to an expensive paperweight. The
big screen TV made a nice perch for Buddy my Maine Coon cat. All
six channels of the sound system were deadly quiet.
</P>
<P>
   All of this because an ice storm knocked out power at my house
for several days.
</P>
<P>
   At many homes, the computers were in better shape than the
people. Laptop computers clicked along on battery power.
Uninterruptable power supplies helped desktop machines shut down
gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most of us humans were cold because the heat was out,
bored because there was no light to read by and no music to listen
to.
</P>
<P>
   I had about $8,000 worth of electronics gear _ computers, ham
radios, test equipment, audio stuff, television and DVD _ but I
didn't own a working flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   All that came to mind last week while I was in a fireplace store
buying replacement glass for the Buck Stove. After stoking it white
hot for the three days I had no power, the heat had became too
much, even for the special tempered glass.
</P>
<P>
   The glass was expensive, but that stove earned my eternal
admiration. It kept a three-story house above the freezing mark and
became the only way I had of cooking. I'd put an iron skillet on
the metal top and cook everything from bacon and eggs to shrimp
scampi.
</P>
<P>
   While in the fireplace store waiting to see how much I'd be
overcharged for the glass, I decided to create a survival kit.
After all, the power goes out at my house two or three times a
year. All the gadgets in the world are useless if your hands are
frozen and your stomach is empty. Besides, it's hard to find that
fancy MP3 player in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, you can divide up the kit into these categories:
</P>
<P>
   Light: At a minimum you need one flashlight for every family
member. But if you've ever tried to read or prepare a meal by the
light of a flashlight, you'll see why I also bought a small,
battery-powered fluorescent lantern. It cost just over $20 and
provides a broad, soft light. Just to be safe, add three or four
large candles.
</P>
<P>
   Communication: Generally speaking, telephone service is more
reliable than electrical service. And many of you already have a
cellular phone. It's a good idea _ in times when the weather is
dicey _ to keep the battery fully charged. And if you don't have a
battery-powered radio, an inexpensive one is a great addition.
Besides providing news about power outages and the weather, it may
end up being your only source of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking: If you have a gas range, you can skip this category. I
don't, so I picked up a butane camp stove for $32. While charcoal
and propane outdoor grills are helpful, the camp stove is a lot
less unwieldy. Just remember that you should never use an outdoor
grill (especially a charcoal one) inside _ hunger is preferable to
carbon monoxide poisioning.
</P>
<P>
   Heating: A fireplace is great. But if you really want to breeze
through a power outage, consider an electric generator. While
you'll find them for as little as $300, you'll probably end up
spending at least twice that. It won't produce enough power to
handle all your electrical needs, but it will keep the electrical
blower on your gas furnace powered up and will handle a few other
lights and appliances. Make sure that you have an electrician
install the circuitry needed to hook the generator into your
household wiring. He'll install a switch that isolates the current
from the generator from outside power lines. Otherwise, your
generator-produced electricity could kill a power company employee
working on what he believes to be dead lines.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the generator, you'll find that the total cost for
your kit is $100 or less. If you ever have to use it you'll find
that being prepared makes you feel even smarter than that computer
geek across the street.

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Louisiana was the next state after Florida
to issue a ``Choose life'' license plate and the first state to
have a court stop plate sales.

   If the court's reasoning stands, the 31-flavor specialty plate
business of a lot of states could be a thing of the past.

states play politics with license plates, they have to let everyone

   Florida has 51 specialty plates. Louisiana, in the spirit of
excess for which the state is noted, has more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   People like the tags, but legislatures like them even more.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of Florida's cars eligible for specialty plates
display one, but that' still a lot of traffic, about 860,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the plates featured universities and endangered
species and veterans groups and nonprofits that don't bother
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   The tags raise money for good causes and legislators get to vote
for something that makes everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   This pleasant arrangement changed in Florida in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Right-to-life groups, the Christian Coalition and House
Republicans successfully pushed for a ``Choose life'' plate but the
late Gov. Lawton Chiles vetoed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   He issued what I always thought was a very sensible veto
message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because a particular political message is able to
garner a majority of votes in the Florida Legislature does not mean
that an official State of Florida license plate is the proper forum
for debate on this _ or any other _ political issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, however, supported the proposed plate and last year
signed a bill to make it part of Florida's specialty tag lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a pending legal challenge, the plates were stamped out
by prisoners at Raiford and arrived in county tag offices a few
weeks ago. They have been overnight tepid sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, though, plate opponents followed a different legal
course and blocked distribution of the plates. In siding with them,
the court ruled the Legislature had put the state on one side of a
heated issue, thus turning tags from workaday car IDs into a forum
for opinion.
</P>
<P>
   It's as though the state picked a political slogan for road
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has chosen license plates as a forum for speech,''
the judge wrote. ``Once it makes this choice, it cannot
discriminate against another viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The court is proving the wisdom of the Chiles' message. If you
want to do a group a favor by printing its political slogan on car
tags, you have to let everyone else have their say, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the Legislature wants an anti-abortion tag, it must
extend the courtesy to abortion-rights people. Or, for that matter,
anyone else with a message -death penalty foes, death-penalty
supporters (''Choose death''), notch babies, gun nuts (''Choose
assault rifles''), antifluoridation activists (''Choose
cavities''), Conch Republic separatists, prohibitionists, flat-tax
advocates, militant vegetarians and their opponents (''Choose
cheeseburgers'').
</P>
<P>
   The state can't only run messages legislators like. And if
that's true in Louisiana, it's just as true in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If the courts rule that license plates must either be a
wide-open public forum or limited to a few strictly state-business
themes, states are going to need to make a few decisions. Either
set up print-your-own-message-here machines at tag offices or cut
back to a few carefully selected themes for license plates.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the Legislature won't want to deal with this and would
go back to a few no-nonsense tags.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine by me. I always stuck with the simple ``Sunshine
State'' tags. Sentiments no court or legislator would gainsay.
</P>
<P>
   I just wish they would make the orange in the middle of the
plates look more orangelike. Who ever heard of smooth, undimpled
oranges? But that's a whole different legal issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you like cartoons, you're not alone. Kids all over
the world are watching Bugs Bunny classics and newer shows such as
``Dexter's Laboratory'' on the 'toon-only channel Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based cable network is beamed into more than 118
million homes in 145 countries around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon Network first aired in the United States on Oct. 1,
1992. Since then, it has expanded its library to include old
favorites, contemporary cartoons and network-created animated
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 'toons on Cartoon Network are heard in 14 languages and
dialects, including Danish, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French,
Italian, Polish, Swedish, Mandarin, Thai, Hindi, Japanese and
Tamil.
</P>
<P>
   Play our geography game by answering the following questions.
You may need to refer to a globe, encyclopedia or computer for
help. Don't forget our super-tough bonus question.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done, submit your answers to News for Kids at NFK
Cartoon Contest, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302. Include your
name, age, school, grade, phone number and address. Three lucky
winners will take home a prize package featuring your fave cartoon
characters, courtesy of Cartoon Network. You must be a
seventh-grader or younger to enter. Entries are due Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   1) Cartoon Network dubs its cartoons into different Spanish
dialects. ``Cow and Chicken'' rules the roost using the Castilian
dialect in this country.
</P>
<P>
   2) Most people in Latin American countries speak Spanish. But
the 'toon viewers in this large South American nation get their
Cartoon Network broadcasts in Portuguese. Name this country.
</P>
<P>
   3) This nation, located at about 14 degrees north latitude and
121 degrees east longitude, receives Cartoon Network's Asia-Pacific
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   4) The Dragonball Z cartoon comes from the Land of the Rising
Sun, but it is tops among viewers in a country that once claimed
the sun never set on its empire. Name both countries.
</P>
<P>
   5) This country receives its broadcast on Cartoon Network's

</P>
<P>
   6) Down under, on this continent, ``The Flintstones'' rock.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    SATs up, but not much
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The good news: Georgia students taking the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) to get into college increased their average
score by five points this year. The bad news: Even with the higher
score, Georgia ranks next to last in the nation. Only South
Carolina students did worse.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Georgia students scored 488 out of a possible 800 on
the verbal part of the test. That's up one
</P>
<P>
   point from last year. They scored 486, also out of 800, on the
math section for a four-point increase. But students nationally
averaged 505 for verbal and 514 for math.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, results from Georgia's new Criterion-Referenced
Competency Test weren't very promising. The exams test the reading,
English and math abilities of the state's fourth-, sixth- and
eighth-graders. In fourth and sixth grade, nearly 33 percent of the
students weren't up to par in English, reading or math. In eighth
grade, about 33 percent weren't up to par in English and reading
and 46 percent failed to meet state standards for math.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. GIVES AID TO COLOMBIA
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton promised last week to give $1.3 billion in
U.S. aid to help fight drugs and rebuild the economy of Colombia.
Clinton traveled to the South American nation to meet with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana, who is working to put years of
civil war and illegal drug trading in his country's past.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cocaine and heroin brought to the United States
comes from Colombia. The aid money from the United States is to be
used mainly to get rid of drug crops, destroy labs where drugs are
made, block shipments and train Colombian security forces to better
protect human rights. Money also will be used to help farmers grow
legal crops and improve the nation's courts.
</P>
<P>
   BLAZES BURN BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   Fires raging out West are not only destroying homes and land,
they're likely to consume more than $1 billion in federal funds
before they're extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Already the federal government has spent $626 million to help
states fight wildfires that have scorched millions of acres from
Montana to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money has gone to pay salaries and support more
than 27,000 firefighters and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration guesses that the loss of businesses,
wildlife, rangeland and forests could exceed $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rains and cooler temperatures helped firefighters battling
blazes in northwestern and central Montana over the weekend. The
rains were greeted as the first real relief after three months of
very hot, very dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   MORE KIDS WITH IMPRISONED PARENTS
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 1.5 million American children, a visit to see Mom or
Dad requires a jail pass. That's a huge increase since 1991, when
936,500 kids had a parent in either state or federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which compiled the statistics, said the
rise is due mainly to the jump in the number of men and women put
in jail during that time period. Most of the children _ 58 percent
_ were under 10 years old, though the total number includes all
kids younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   Kids with parents in federal jails seemed to see their folks
more often than those whose parents were state inmates. About 57
percent of fathers and 54 percent of mothers in state jails said
they had never had a personal visit with their children in prison.
Forty-four percent of fathers and 42 percent of mothers in federal
prisons said their kids had never visited them in jail.

 &HT;    Ruminating on the single life
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Most all of the women I know are single and
have been for a long time. My three best friends and I have been
non-cohabiters since way before we started seriously eyeballing the
wrinkle-vanishing creams on
</P>
<P>
   drugstore shelves _ a grand total of 78 years for the four of
us.
</P>
<P>
   Do we like our single state? Sometimes. Would we rather be
married? Occasionally. Do we think we'll ever marry again? Probably
not. Why? We're not really sure, but it's not because we haven't
been asked. Not often, but asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we're a quartet of femme fatales leaving heartbroken
swains beached on the low tide _ we're not. We are four average
women who married for love, handled disappointment, raised our
children, and who have grown comfortable with going it on our own.
Through the years, each of us has had a sincere offer or two, but
none tempting enough to cause us to consider changing the initials
on our luggage.
</P>
<P>
   We kid around about being irresistible to men, and weave tales
about how our answering machines are loaded with gentlemen callers
requesting our charming company over dinner _ or a Caribbean
cruise. Often, particularly on long
</P>
<P>
   winter evenings in front of the fire, we wax philosophical on
the meaning of life, global warming, and why Robert Redford hasn't
begged us to flee to the Utah hills with him. Sometimes, we wonder
aloud if maybe we're not being too picky. After all, all we want is
. . . everything.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written lately about young women who have opted to
remain single until Mr. Perfect comes along, but vowing not to
panic if he's a no-show. They enjoy careers, buy their own homes,
and some even have families
</P>
<P>
   without a ``him'' in the picture. Good for them.
</P>
<P>
   But my friends and I are single for different reasons. We're of
an age where we think about how good it would be to have a
companion, a hand to hold, warmth in the night, but we also
consider how difficult it could be to live with
</P>
<P>
   someone whose habits were new to us. ``He and I grew up
together,'' one of us will say sadly. The others nod. ``We have
history. First house, first baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of this shared history sometimes makes us angry. We
resent having no one we can turn to and say, ``Remember when we
sent Junior off to kindergarten wearing that big Mickey Mouse
watch? The one with the red plastic band? Remember the proud look
on his face the first time he climbed the stairs of the big old
blue school bus?''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, younger women are deciding they don't need a man
around to complete their lives. A ``great'' one, some say would be
okay, but the single life has its major attractions. No one to
complain about your friends or crack
</P>
<P>
   wise about the bridge club. No cooking if you're not in the
mood, and no whiskers in the wash basin. Time for a career move? No
problem. And the absolute freedom to pack a bag and go traveling
without ever having to say,
</P>
<P>
   ``May I?''
</P>
<P>
   Some solo ladies reckon that marriage would probably be worth
it, but only if the man were ``great'' or perfect. I'm not so sure.
Surely, ``average'' would be easier to love. And marriage, as we
all know, is at best an imprecise state
</P>
<P>
   that needs to be manipulated daily just to keep it running.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving my friends out of it since I can't speak for them, I
have sampled both worlds. Being single isn't bad _ sometimes it's
great fun. But if pressed to tell the absolute truth, I think I
would have to admit that I'd prefer to
</P>
<P>
   have just ``kept on dancing with the guy what brung me.''

 &HT;    Collarbone injury leads to more than skeletal facts
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So much for getting back into the groove for school.
</P>
<P>
   Our first soccer game of the season turned out to be our last
for a while. A hard fall resulted in my son being sidelined for a
few weeks with a collarbone injury. He's recovering nicely, but our
normal routine is still undergoing adjustments to accommodate a
one-armed 11-year-old. The balance of power has shifted among
siblings, and were I not in the middle it would be quite amusing to
observe.
</P>
<P>
   But domestic squabbles aside, the whole episode has highlighted
once again how interwoven technology has become in the fabric of
our everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone, not surprisingly, was an integral player
immediately following the mishap. As I helped my son to the car, I
was swapping cell phone numbers with other parents for future
updates. To and from and at the hospital, the cell phone kept us
linked with the outside world, bringing welcome doses of the real
world in the form of droll concern from his older sibling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to have to stay there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh good, he can stop at the pet store on his way home. Monty
(the lizard) and Moe (the frog) need food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can only use one arm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK. Their food doesn't weigh much.''
</P>
<P>
   Our team, like so many others, uses e-mail to inform parents of
practice times, game schedules and general updates. Once we got
home, lots of good wishes from his teammates and their families
also came via e-mail. So though now we're only on the field in
spirit, we're with them virtually 24/7, thanks to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial shock, the questions began to bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is my clavicle? Where is it? What does it do?''
</P>
<P>
   To assuage both his and my curiosity, I checked the Internet. I
tried several search engines. Ask Jeeves led me to
www.bartleby.com, where I checked the clavicle entry in Gray's
``Anatomy of the Human Body,'' where I discovered an intriguing but
overwhelming wealth of information.
</P>
<P>
   Through AltaVista I found several sites including
www.imcpl.lib.in.us/novind.htm that look inside the human body
showing the skeletal, circulatory, respiratory and digestive
systems along with other information that was right on my son's
level. Those sites helped him visualize where his clavicle was and
what it was connected to, explaining why it hurt when he moved
certain ways.
</P>
<P>
   We also picked up some interesting did-you-know-facts about the
skeletal system such as the fact that the smallest bones are in
your ears and the only jointless bone is in your throat.
</P>
<P>
   At the Children's Orthopaedics of Atlanta site at
www.childrensortho.com/fractures.htm and a similar one at Johns
Hopkins, I found information specific to childhood fractures. Given
my son's great fondness for physical activity, I figured I might as
well bone up on the subject.

 &HT;    Bundles of fun
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For kids not content with mere ogling and cooing
over their latest bubble-gum card acquisition or setting up a
fantasy competition via linked game machines, Bandai's Gundam Wing
offer hands-on, tangible toys for imaginary-world play. Better
still, Bandai bundles two activities into one package as the toys
are also available as Gundam Wing plastic model kits ($5 to $25;
www.bandai.com). When the glue less snap-together figurines are
finished _ complete with weapons, decals and accessories _ they
become effective and interactive posturing models with some 40
points of articulation. A slightly sophisticated motor-skills
challenge and a long-term toy craze all in one. Pretty neat.

<P>
   A BOOST FOR YOUR ROOST
</P>
<P>
   If you've got one thing that serves two purposes, that's half
the battle. Fisher Price's Stow `n Go Booster Seat ($20;
www.fisher-price.com) is not only a portable bottom uplifter for
your diapered chair-sitter, it's also a handy-dandy lunch
box/picnic basket/carryall. Folding neatly into a diminutive and
colorful briefcase of sorts, the Stow `n Go is a vinyl-covered,
hard-shelled, zippered storage box with a couple of soft-side
pouches for all your stowing and going needs. Set up, the
porta-booster will strap and anchor to almost any chair, where it
unfurls to form a decently durable, low-back, wee-bum riser.

 &HT;    Realistic fighting title rewards player finesse
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' by Crave
Entertainment generated a lot of buzz at this year's Electronic
Entertainment Expo. The fighting simulator, based on the
pay-per-view event, featured outstanding visuals and game play.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated title finally hit stores Wednesday, and
Dreamcast owners should be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been disappointed by the clunky graphics, clumsy
control and lack of depth of many boxing and wrestling games,
``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' will slap a smile on your face.
</P>
<P>
   Just like its namesake, ``Ultimate Fighting Championship''
showcases a rich variety of competitors and fighting styles around
the globe. Wrestling, boxing, submission fighting, sumo, jiu-jitsu
and kickboxing are just a few disciplines of the 22 initial
fighters. With this assortment, you can see some interesting
matches. The heavyweight, Andre Roberts, has some devastating
punches, but if he is taken to the mat by a Brazilian jiu-jitsu
fighter, his probability of winning is slim.
</P>
<P>
   You'll get a chance to compete and observe the extensive array
of styles and moves with six different fighting modes. The training
mode is a great starting point to learn the fighting systems and
various attacks of the characters. From there you can move on to
UFC mode and pummel your way to the championship belt. If you want
to develop your own custom fighter, you can check out the career
mode. In this mode, you can choose your fighter's build,
appearance, discipline and list of moves to be used against
competitors in other modes.
</P>
<P>
   A feature that sets it apart from other sports/fighting titles
is the realistic graphics and character animation. Once the
competitors strut through the crowded arena, you know you are in
for a visual treat. Character models are very smooth and lifelike.
The faces are scanned from the actual fighters and mapped to 3-D
models, creating a high degree of realism. Other authentic details
such as tatoos and natural skin tones distinguish each character.
</P>
<P>
   The animation complements the graphic realism nicely.
Motion-capture techniques were used to create the animations, and
it's evident there was a lot of fine-tuning applied to get the
motions just right. Movements are very fluid and don't have that
sluggish feel typical of so many wrestling games. There is also a
good sense of impact when a punch or kick connects.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all of the realistic visuals is the true heart of this
game _ the fighting system. Offense and defense are very balanced.
Button-mashing players may get lucky at other fighting games, but
if they don't conserve their energy and block properly, one swift
uppercut will send them to the floor. Learning how to counter and
defend properly is just as important as tackling and striking.
</P>
<P>
   As good as this game is, it may not be for everyone. This is not
a typical 3-D fighting game. There aren't any ninjas, projectile
attacks or supercharged lightning punch combos. Games like ``Soul
Calibur'' and ``Dead or Alive 2'' are good choices for that type of
fighting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' is a realistic fighting
simulation, and if that's what you're looking for, then this is by
far your best bet.

 &HT;    Fighter likes Sega game's close reflection of himself
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tito ``Bad Boy'' Ortiz is the reigning Ultimate
Fighting middleweight champion. He also is a video game junkie.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz praised Crave Entertainment's newest title, ``Ultimate
Fighting Championship'' for the Sega Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the best fighting games I ever played,'' Ortiz
said over the telephone from Huntington Beach, Calif. ``I play lots
of video games, and it is tremendous how (Crave) can put everything
from the sport of UFC into the video game. They both look identical
to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, 25, is one of the most recognizable faces in the console
title, which also includes such big names as Frank Shamrock, ``Big
Daddy'' Gary Goodridge, Mark ``The Hammer'' Coleman and Maurice
Smith. UFC legends such as Ken Shamrock, Tank Abbott and Dan Severn
disappointingly have been left out.
</P>
<P>
   In the video game, Ortiz looks just like he does in real life:
bleached-blond hair and muscular upper body with his trademark
tattoos on both arms and skinny legs. Ortiz's fighting style is
both submission and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each character in the game, including myself, is accurately
(depicted),'' Ortiz said. ``All of my punches and kicks are exactly
the same. It's like, `Whoa ... I'm watching myself on TV in a video
game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz says his character is the best fighter in the game. At the
E3Expo last May in Los Angeles, Ortiz squared off with Frank
Shamrock in five matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won four of them and let Shamrock beat me in one just to be
nice,'' said Ortiz, with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of UFC's stars, Ortiz thinks the video game will
heavily increase the popularity and understanding of the sport. UFC
is sanctioned in only eight states. Ortiz says once people play the
video game, they will realize UFC does not deserve its ``outlaw''
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are just not educated on the sport because
when it first came out, it was a real bloody,'' Ortiz said. ``Now
it's totally different; UFC has gone through an evolution. The
fighters are so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all about punching and kicking anymore. You have to
use techniques. It's just not the no-holds-barred, bloody sport it
used to be. I train eight hours a day for my bouts, and I am a
professional athlete. This game should give our sport a lot of good
PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is a former college wrestler who attracted the attention
of the UFC after being a sparring partner with Abbott. His most
memorable bout was at UFC XXII, when he took the still-undefeated
Frank Shamrock nearly to the distance. Ortiz charged Shamrock, who
unloaded three powerful elbow strikes to end the fight with 11
seconds remaining in the fourth round.

 &HT;    Olympic Committee welcomes popular endurance sport
 &HT;    By Luma Muhtadie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In September 1994, the International Olympic
Committee held its 103rd annual session. One subject of discussion
was whether to name the relatively young sport triathlon to the
Summer Olympic program as a medal sport.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was yes, and with the 2000 Summer Games
approaching, we can look forward to witnessing an iconic display of
athleticism and determination when triathlon makes its Olympic
debut in Sydney, Australia. With this international stamp of
approval _ and television ratings _ it is expected that the sport
will reach new milestones of participation and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is an ideal host for this historic occasion because
the country has long been supporting triathlon and Sydney offers a
facility of the highest caliber. The famous Sydney Opera House will
be the backdrop for the course, and the transition area _ one of
the most exciting sites for spectators _ will be in front of the
Opera House steps. The opening swim portion of the race will be in
Farm Cove, part of Sydney Harbor; the hilly six-lap bike course
will pass landmarks such as the Conservatorium of Music and
Parliament House before returning to the transition area; and the
three-lap running course will weave its way through the Royal
Botanic Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5K swim, 40K bike route and 10K running distances (0.9,
24.8 and 6.20 miles, respectively) comprise the standard Olympic
distances. But triathlons vary in distances throughout the world.
The most famous long-distance triathlon is the Hawaii Ironman race.
Established in 1978 by U.S. Navy officer John Collins, this event
combined three of Hawaii's established endurance events _ the
Waikiki Rough Water Swim (2.4 miles), the Around the Oahu Bike (112
miles) and the Honolulu Marathon (26.2 miles) _ to form a single
ultra-endurance competition. Fifteen men entered the first Ironman
in 1978, but after Sports Illustrated featured an article about it
in May 1979, the number of entrants in the following year's race
increased to 108. These days, the Ironman attracts 1,500 male and
female competitors each year, and entrants ranging from the most
elite athletes to mothers, business people and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   When ABC's ``Wide World of Sports'' showed Julie Moss making an
unforgettable crawl to the finish line in the 1982 Hawaii Ironman,
the sport of triathlon started gaining participation and popularity
with furious momentum. The word ``triathlon'' was added to the
``Ninth Edition of the Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary'' in
1983. Timex released the ``Triathlon'' watch in 1984 (later renamed
the ``Ironman'') and it is now the top-selling watch in the world.
Triathlon inspired Nike to launch its cross-training ad campaign in
1985, and USA Triathlon boasted 19,060 members last year. (The
group consists of U.S. residents who entered at least one race
during the 1999 triathlon season.)
</P>
<P>
   The competitors, or triathletes, in an Olympic event are
expected to swim, bike and run continuously over varying distances.
The demands of these endurance sports are interrupted only by the
``transitions'' _ the points at which the athletes make a fast
changeover from one sport to another as the race clock continues to
tick away.
</P>
<P>
   During the first transition, competitors emerge from the
open-water swim, peel off their caps, goggles and wetsuits (which
are permitted only in water colder than 68 degrees) and run to the
transition area. There they fasten their helmets, mount their
bikes, slip into cycling shoes and head off for the bike portion of
the race. Wearing a helmet is a mandatory rule set by the
International Triathlon Union. Violating the rule is grounds for
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   During the second transition, the triathletes dismount their
bikes, take off their helmets, slip into running shoes and head out
on the running course that ends at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   In both local and international races, competitors race in one
of three broad categories, each of which is divided into male and
female divisions. The first is the ``elite'' or ``pro'' category.
These are the athletes eligible to compete for the overall title
and, in some cases, prize money. It will be the only medal category
at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The second category is ``junior,'' which covers all athletes
younger than 20 in a given race year. The largest category is
``age-group,'' divided into five-year increments (i.e. 20-24,
25-29. . .) up to 80-84. The women's race on Sept. 16, the day
after the Opening Ceremonies, will be the first event of the Summer
Olympics. The winner will not only bring home the first gold medal
of the 2000 Games, but also the first Olympic gold in triathlon
history. The men's race take place Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But for each of the 50 entrants in each race, it will be a
chance to be part of a monumental event in triathlon history.

 &HT;    Today's slanguage: Teens have a special code all their own
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While paying for my coffee at the grocery store,
I tell the fiftysomething man behind the counter: ``Chi. This
coffee is butters. Here's my cheese. Peace out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?'' he asked. ``What did you say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I was saying, `Cool. This coffee is good. Here's my money.
Bye.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you say that in the first place? You didn't make
any sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's slanguage, man, teen slang.
</P>
<P>
   After collecting teen slang from kids around town and trying it
on adults, I got nowhere. At the office, I told a co-worker: ``Slow
your roll (relax).'' I think she thought I was telling her she was
gaining too much weight. At school, I told a parent, ``The plan is
tight (good). Tell some other rents (parents) to volunteer.'' I got
a blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   So I went to the Drag to show off my newfound vocabulary.
College students will understand, right? I stopped Ben Aaronson,
who said he was enrolled. ``OK, Ben, can you understand this?
`Someone ganked (stole) my books. Monkeys (I messed up), I left
them on the table. It's weak (not good).'''
</P>
<P>
   Ben was perplexed, too. ``Dude, I know what you said but no one
talks like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger teen-agers do, and slang is their ever-evolving way to
communicate with each other. Sometimes it's their special way to
relate to their clique. Sometimes they want to exclude others,
especially their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slang identifies you as a member of a special group,'' said
Donna Jo Napoli, professor of linguistics and expert on slang at
Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pa. ``And when you're 17, you
don't want to speak like your parents or a 23-year-old or a
10-year-old. It's nice to have your own special code to keep people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slang makes us,'' said Katie Baldwin, 16, a junior at Bowie
High School. ``How we talk is who we are and what we think. It's
showing a piece of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Slang isn't new; it was popularized after World War II with the
advent of television. Teens joined in. In the '50s, ``neat'' was so
ubiquitous that it must have become annoying _ but it's still used
today, so there must a lasting appeal. Fifties teens also used cool
cat, cherry (really neat), threads (clothing), kicks (shoes) and
foam domes (stuffed bras), said Mike Ellis, author of ``Slanguage''
(Hyperion, $14).
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, ``score'' meant get some dope. Heavy, far out,
bummer and ``what a trip'' were expressions you might use after you
scored. In the '70s, the Fonz coined, ``Aaayyy.'' TV continued to
have an impact, but now the commercials were influencing the
language. Remember ``Try it, you'll like it,'' from Alka Seltzer?
</P>
<P>
   The '80s brought expressions such as totally rad, so gnarly and
totally tubular _ from the movie ``Valley Girl'' _ all meaning
cool. When Clara Pellar asked, ``Where's the beef?'' in a Wendy's
advertisement, the whole country found inventive ways to capitalize
on the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to U.S. Postal workers resorting to shooting sprees in
the '90s, ``going postal,'' came to mean, well, you know what it
meant. After the release of the movie ``Clueless'' in 1995, ``Like,
oh my God'' came out of every teen girl's mouth. And what about:
Whatever! Not! You the man.
</P>
<P>
   Although teen-agers invent some slang that's unique to their
circle of friends _ ``babe-a-luba'' is a term of endearment Bowie's
Baldwin uses for her friends _ many of their words are not new.
Phat (cool) and da bomb (awesome) originated from the jazz era in
the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slang is recycled,'' Ellis said. ``When more people got radios
and TVs after 1930, words popped up everywhere. Now with the
Internet, it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   But slang isn't necessarily the same everywhere. It differs from
one group to another in high schools and city to city.
Pflugerville's Matthew Bledsoe, 16, who travels the country because
he's a ballet dancer, noticed it this past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skaters don't use the same words as the gangsters, and the
gangsters don't use the same words as the preps, and the preps
don't talk like the nerds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the surfer word ``groovy'' is accepted in Boca
Raton, Fla., but considered weird in Houston. ``In Houston you're
likely to hear street slang, something like `I'm chillin' (hanging)
with my homies (friends) this weekend,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Napoli advises parents not to get riled up about the slang their
kids use, aside from the nasty and degrading words. ``I know that
parents refer to adolescence as the psychotic years, but from the
kids' point of view they want to be different than their parents.
They want their own identity. Using their special language is one
way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So parents, slow your roll.

in talks to buy the U.S. firm Niagara Mohawk for about $3 billion.
The London-based National Grid has earmarked more for further
United States expansion this year, after buying New England
Electric System in March. Niagara, which has been reporting losses,
is seen as too small to compete in the deregulating American
market. By Andre Ross Sorkin.

   INTERNET-BUSINESS (San Francisco) _ IBM, Microsoft and others
are expected to announce proposed standards this week for an
electronic directory that will make it easier for companies to
carry out business-to-business transactions. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-BOURSES (London) _ Euronext, the company that will
combine the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels stock exchanges, has
approached French banks about the possibility of financing for a
bid for the London Stock Exchange. The London exchange was already
in merger talks with Frankfurt. By Suzanne Kapner.
</P>
<P>
   SCULLEY-BROTHERS (Undated) _ John Sculley, the former Apple
Computer chief executive, is making a quiet comeback. For the last
five years, he has run run a small venture capital firm with his
two brothers. It is his way of fulfilling a desire to work with his
family -- and to help proselytize about the virtues of the Internet
without suffering the corporate intrigue that overwhelmed him at
both Apple and at Spectrum Information Technologies. Having fun
while teaching young entrepreneurs, he says, now takes priority
over earning maximum returns. By using their own assets, they do
not subject themselves to the pressure of performing for investors.
Nonetheless, he said, they expect to earn high returns over the
long run. So far, the track record of Sculley Brothers leaves
something to be desired. Three of the five companies they backed
that have gone public _ like many other Web-based businesses since
the Nasdaq shakedown last April _ now trade at rock bottom prices.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Sept. 5:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CAVE-VISITORS (Benson, Ariz.) - Take a sopping wet
underground cavern in a remote corner of Arizona. Add a man-made
entrance with heavy steel doors to keep out the hot desert air, a
misting system to keep the cavern damp and lights to show off a
wonderland of spires, flowstone, soda straws and other
phantasmagorical cave formations. Then add a human being who, in a
one-hour visit, sloughs off some 60,000 skin fragments, 160 million
dust particles, 20,000 clothing-lint particles, 25 quarts of carbon
dioxide gas and 170 watts of body heat. Multiply this by 183,000
visitors to the cave each year. The result is an ad hoc experiment
now under way at Kartchner Caverns near Benson, Ariz., to learn if
it is possible to bring thousands of people into the fragile
environment of a pristine cave without destroying the cave in the
process. By Sandra Blakeslee. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ULTIMATE-LAPTOP (Undated) _ In a paper in the current issue
of Nature, an MIT researcher describes the ultimate laptop _ a
computer as powerful as the laws of physics would allow. So
energetic is this imaginary machine that using it would be like
harnessing a thermonuclear reaction. In the most extreme version of
this computer supreme, so much computational circuitry would be
packed into so small a space that the whole thing would collapse
from its own gravity forming a tiny black hole, an object so dense
that not even light can escape its gravity. By George Johnson.
(1900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-DRUGS (Undated) _ In the 13 years since they were
introduced in the United States, the cholesterol-lowering drugs
known as statins have revolutionized the treatment of heart
disease. Repeated studies have shown they prevent heart attacks and
prolong life, with very few side effects. They have rapidly become
the best-selling prescription drugs in this country. Now, the
latest research indicates that even more people should be on
statins. By Sandeep Jauhar. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALBATROSS (Undated) _ Researchers in France and Germany have
tracked several wandering albatrosses, and their findings are
surprising. As the researchers report in the journal Nature, the
birds do not wander aimlessly during what amounts to a sabbatical
following a year in which they hatch and raise a single chick.
Rather, the albatrosses go to a specific section of the ocean and
stay there. By Henry Fountain. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RACE-RECOGNITION (Undated) _ After a decade of mapping
brains in tasks like recalling numbers, perceiving facial
expressions and using verbs, neuroscientists have recently honed in
on a much more controversial subject: The act of categorizing other
human beings. In recently published papers, two separate teams of
brain scanners joined by social psychologists describe how one
particular part of the brain becomes more active when people look
at members of a different race. By David Berreby. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on coated
seeds that might be used to help farmers overlap winter wheat and
soybeans in the same field; the prospect of genetically modifying
plants to grow coffee without the caffeine; on a die-off of tiger
salamanders at a lake in North Dakota. By Henry Fountain. (700
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MENOPAUSE (Undated) _ For many menopausal women, the
question of whether to take hormones is one of the most crucial
health decisions of their middle years _ and one of the most
confusing. Hormone use relieves the hot flashes and night sweats
that plague many women during menopause, and protects against
brittle bones. But does it help prevent heart disease, as
researchers have long believed _ or could it actually increase the
risk, as at least one new piece of data seems to suggest. In a
package of six stories, women discuss the ways they approach the
therapy and their frustrations with unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   These six, approximately 375-400 words each, may be combined to
form a single coherent story:

   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ In recent months, researchers have pointed to possible signals
of Alzheimer's disease that could allow doctors to detect the
ailment before symptoms start. They have spoken of small areas of
the brain that appear to shrink, and psychological tests that yield
subtle clues. Now scientists think they may have found another
clue: smell. (230 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ With the rate of Caesarean sections on the rise, a leading
group of obstetricians has issued guidelines that may reduce the
number of operations. (220 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ People who want to start exercise programs but feel they don't
have enough time or energy to begin should think again. A new study
suggests that physical activity that lasts just 15 minutes, if done
often enough, may be as beneficial as longer workouts. The report
appeared last week in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart
Association. (260 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Feeling sick to one's stomach may have more to do with the
brain the stomach. Researchers at Ohio State University say they
may have uncovered the reason that, often, people feel nauseated,
even though what ails them has nothing to do with their digestive
tracks. The culprit may be a brain chemical called tumor necrosis
factor, or TNF, which the immune system releases at the first sign
that the body is coming under attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study finds that tough guys seem to have tougher immune
systems, the body's natural defense for fighting off infections,
viruses and the like. (270 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column:
Problems of ``polypharmacy'' or dangerous cocktails of drugs are
increasing, as more and more people live into their 70s and beyond.
By Jane E. Brody. (1275 words)
</P>

 &HT;    Australia through a native son's eyes
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thirty-nine years ago, the new owner of a Sydney
newspaper summoned his political cartoonist and demanded to know
how much he made. $25 a cartoon, came the answer. Too much, the
boss said, and offered to keep him on at half the pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrage,'' the artist shot back. ``I resign.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's how Rupert Murdoch lost a cartoonist and the world of
letters gained Robert Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the witty, woolly art critic of Time magazine, looks
back at his native land in a six-hour documentary starting tonight
on public television. ``Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore'' is a
series of lively personal essays exploring the culture of the
country he departed not long after Murdoch more or less fired him _
a country that will soon be inescapable as the Sydney Olympics
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The title recalls ``The Fatal Shore,'' the 62-year-old author's
classic history of Australia's hard birth as a British penal
colony. The name almost proved prophetic last year, when Hughes
returned to Australia to begin work on the project and was nearly
killed in a car crash. He leans on crutches during most of the film
and still hasn't completely recovered from his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes talked about the series from his home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do Americans have the wrong idea about Australia?
</P>
<P>
   A:They have a whole cluster of wrong ideas. There's this
ingrained American delusion that we're something like Americans.
That your Wild West was paved over with shopping malls, but somehow
it emigrated to Australia _ the Crocodile Dundee fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we're not 6-foot-4 stringy- bark horseback riders with
great big Bowie knives who like to strangle crocodiles before
breakfast. Most Australians live in the cities; it's one of the
most highly urbanized societies in the world. The number of people
who actually live the Outback is small and getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's the biggest difference between the nations?
</P>
<P>
   A:America was founded by two groups of people seeking expansion
of their religious beliefs: the Spanish Catholics in the Southwest
and the Puritans in the Northeast. Both wanted to set up religious
utopias, and this gave rise to that perpetual American belief in
renewal. Nothing of that idealism and periodic looniness attaches
to the colonization of Australia. Australia was a jail. It started
off as a place of punishment, not as a place of reward.
</P>
<P>
   It affects the way landscape is experienced. In America, it's
``Go west, young man!'' _ become freer and richer and better by
going west and seeing the works of God in an unedited form. In
Australia, there was no such expectation. You go out into the bush,
you get lost, you die. The space was the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Has the country changed much since you left?
</P>
<P>
   A:If you had told me in 1964 that 35 years from now, there's
going to be an enormous festival of homosexuals in Sydney (the Gay
and Lesbian Mardi Gras) and it'll be the biggest in the world, and
moreover, it will be so popular among straights that it will
outdraw the visit of the Pope _ if anyone had told me that, I would
have said, ``Yeah sure, and the dog ate your homework.'' Australia
was a deeply homophobic country in 1964. That has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You've written about the sense of shame that many Australians
felt about their country starting as a penal colony. Is the
``convict stain'' still there?
</P>
<P>
   A:The stain is gone. In fact, it's rather a badge of distinction
now to say that your ancestors were convicts. My father's people
came from Ireland in 1837, and I'm very ashamed to say we were
free.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's the hottest issue in Australia these days?
</P>
<P>
   A:When I left, it was communism. Now it's race, the whole issue
of Aborigines. Most Australians of my generation knew nothing about
Aborigines. Growing up in Sydney, I never met one. You'd
occasionally see them chucking boomerangs to make a couple of
shillings off the tourists, but you had no social contact with
them. They weren't even getting work as shoeshine boys.
</P>
<P>
   Q:And now there's a national debate over whether the government
should apologize to Aborigines for past injustices. What do you
think?
</P>
<P>
   A:A formal apology isn't going to bring anyone back to life. But
it's a reasonable thing to do given that the Aborigines want it as
a harmless starting point for future negotiations. If Australians
are prepared to accept Gallipoli and all the heroism of the past,
they should be prepared to take on the guilt, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You were very outspoken last year during a national referendum
that would have declared Australia a republic and severed ties with
the British monarchy. Why did that measure lose?
</P>
<P>
   A:Australians can be brave on the field of battle and ingenious
in facing off against nature but total poltroons when it comes to
electoral politics. Most Australians want a republic. But when it
came time to vote, they fudged.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You upset people recently by saying some of that in the
souvenir program of the Sydney Olympics. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A:Sports Illustrated (which produced the program) asked me to
write a 10,000-word essay, and nowhere was it suggested that I
should avoid political matters. Now all these moldy old monarchos
are saying Mr. Hughes degraded the Olympics by introducing
political debate. Give me a break. When have the Olympics not been
political?
</P>
<P>
   Q:Australia is said to be more sports-crazy than America. Can
that possibly be true?
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes. That doesn't mean they're better at it. But they're very
passionate team-sports followers and have their own team the way
you have a political party.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer solitary sports like fishing. They used to make me play
football (rugby) when I was a kid, and I just hated it. I was a
feeble little creature, and I didn't like being trampled over by
hordes of huge country bastards from Mudgee competing for a greasy
little ball. Some of these kids were enormous, mate.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You talk about sports in the series but don't mention the
Sydney Olympics once. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A:I don't give a (randy pub expression deleted) about the
Olympics. I don't think it's important to understanding Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Q:A lot of people in Atlanta saw the Olympics as a kind of
vindication. You don't feel any of that for your hometown?
</P>
<P>
   A:People think Australia must be really pleased to be put on the
map by the Olympics. I don't think it's within the power of a
sporting event to put a great and complex city on the map. We're
already on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So you won't be at the Games?
</P>
<P>
   A:Hell, no. I am going to Australia in October, but it's to go
fishing out west, not to watch athletes go around a track in so
many nanoseconds.

 &HT;    `Beyond the Fatal Shore' is fun, informative TV
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Hughes describes his homeland as ``spatially
huge, culturally tiny, politically insignificant.'' Not exactly a
sentiment you'll see on bumper stickers in Sydney, but it indicates
Hughes' refreshing honesty.
</P>
<P>
   That outspokenness _ plus insight, perspective, arresting
visuals and just a flat-out wonderful sense of television _ are on
display in ``Beyond the Fatal Shore,'' PBS' six-hour tour of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a grand introduction to what will be the biggest wave ever
of Aussie TV hitting these shores. Sydney's Summer Olympics start
Sept. 15, and NBC's typical saturation coverage will include
sending Katie Couric and crew Down Under for three weeks of
``Today'' shows, starting Sept. 1. And the next ``Survivor'' on CBS
will be set in the Australian Outback; it tapes in October and
starts after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, Time magazine's art critic and author of the 1987 best
seller ``The Fatal Shore,'' a history of Australia, makes this a
series of personal essays. He starts off tonight by visiting the
junkyard to see the mangled car he was driving when a crash nearly
killed him early in the filming, and he ends up Thursday, publicly
campaigning in favor of Australia leaving the British Commonwealth.
In between, he uses his own memories and opinions to talk about his
country's society, history and geography and people.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the ``Crocodile Dundee'' theme park popular in the
American imagination. He takes us to a gay pride parade, the
beaches, a fashion show, a right-wing radio talk show, rugby games,
government buildings, Aborigines digging for water, pornographers
making a movie in a field.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he and his camera crew turn, Hughes finds something
that is amazing. He visits a golf course in the Outback that
doesn't have a single blade of grass. The ``greens'' are made of
sand mixed with diesel oil, and the duffers carry a small patch of
Astroturf with them, placing it down to hit each shot. Even
stranger than that is ``Old Sydney,'' a tourist attraction where
faked but incredibly realistic floggings are performed while
schoolchildren watch. After that, a kangaroo just doesn't seem all
that noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who's been an expatriate for 35 years and has a strong
love-hate relationship with his native land, is full of opinions.
The lobby of the national capitol looks to him ``like a really bad
Holiday Inn'' and he refers to Queen Elizabeth II as ``Queenie.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hughes' eye for art makes ``Fatal Shore'' a visual treat. He
uses fast-motion photography, extreme close-ups and saturated,
vibrant colors, so that parts look like a David Lynch film (but in
a coherent way).
</P>
<P>
   PBS documentaries (including those by way of the BBC, which this
is) have a high reputation, but sometimes they can be spinach TV _
good for you, but you're always aware you're being fed something
nutritious. Hughes has spread out a banquet that will feed your
mind, but it's yummy as well. It's what nonfiction TV ought to
always be.

   READER-AUTHOR-TOURS (Undated) _ The list of writers who are
turning tours into reading vacations is dominated by self-help
authors with a spiritual bent like Neale Donald Walsch, the author
of ``Conversations With God,'' who in June took readers on an
eight-day tour of Peru timed to coincide with the summer solstice
sunrise over Machu Picchu. But there are also published historians
and even a poet who are leading people on tours ripped from their
chapters, whether it be a stroll down Shankill Road in Belfast or a
trip to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. By Doreen Carvajal.

 &HT;    Dads scopes out what women want in men
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ever since Freud raised the question (and probably for
eons before that), men have been asking, ``What do women want?''
The editors of Dads ($2.99) magazine try to provide answers in a
survey of women readers. Nearly half of respondents wanted more
(and better) sex. Others wanted more romantic gestures such as
hidden notes or surprise dates and more help around the house. When
asked what adult-education classes they would send their husbands
to, their choices were massage, ballroom dancing, money management,
cooking, minor household repairs and ``interpersonal skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched last Father's Day for men who take parenting seriously,
the September/October issue of Dads also features a cover story on
ESPN anchors Chris Berman and Dan Patrick talking about life on and
off camera.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Just desserts: Anne Byrn takes the cake with a flattering
article in this week's People ($2.99). Byrn is lauded for her
innovative cookbook, ``The Cake Mix Doctor'' (Workman, $14.96). By
experimenting with cake mixes, the Nashville food writer found ways
to turn standard recipes into something special by adding various
ingredients such as buttermilk or orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to sample Byrn's orange chiffon cake, St. Louis pastry
chef Tim Brennan gave the recipe a thumbs up. ``I usually have an
aftertaste for chemicals,'' he says of processed foods. ``But that
was special.'' Byrn does draw the line, however, at using canned
frosting: ``It's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hefty reading: If magazines get any bigger, readers will have
to use luggage carts to take them home. The September In Style
($4.95) has 702 pages, not including a thick advertising insert.
Once you wade through page after page of glossy fashion and
cosmetics ads, you'll find an ample number of articles about Drew
Barrymore, Sharon Stone and other celebrities. ``NYPD Blue'' star
Kim Delaney talks about her campaign to feed hungry children, and
Heather Locklear and husband Richie Sambora show off their stunning
Pacific beach house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Good Vibes: Women subscribers to Vibe ($2.95) will get a bonus
publication with their October issue. Written by the magazine's
female staff and free-lance editors, Home &QR; Girl addresses the areas
of lifestyle, health, beauty, fashion and travel with an
urban-music sensibility. The launch issue features Eve of the Ruff
Riders on the cover and includes articles on Carmen Elektra and
Kobe Bryant. There's also an interesting layout showing the hottest
hairstyles _ and hairstylists _ from Atlanta, Chicago, New York and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick read: JazzTimes ($4.95) celebrates its 30-year
anniversary with a special edition covering three decades of music
history. Some of the country's finest jazz writers, from Nat
Hentoff to Stanley Crouch, offer their insights and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rolling Stone ($4.95) features a two-page cover foldout of
Gisele Bundchen and an in-depth account of her rise from a
volleyball -loving 14-year-old in a small Brazilian village to that
of a supermodel who makes $7,000 an hour. Less glamorous but more
substantive is Charles M. Young's piece on Ralph Nader and why he
is willing to sacrifice Al Gore in the presidential race.

   SCI-CAVE-VISITORS (Benson, Ariz.) - Take a sopping wet
underground cavern in a remote corner of Arizona. Add a man-made
entrance with heavy steel doors to keep out the hot desert air, a
misting system to keep the cavern damp and lights to show off a
wonderland of spires, flowstone, soda straws and other
phantasmagorical cave formations. Then add a human being who, in a
one-hour visit, sloughs off some 60,000 skin fragments, 160 million
dust particles, 20,000 clothing-lint particles, 25 quarts of carbon
dioxide gas and 170 watts of body heat. Multiply this by 183,000
visitors to the cave each year. The result is an ad hoc experiment
now under way at Kartchner Caverns near Benson, Ariz., to learn if
it is possible to bring thousands of people into the fragile
environment of a pristine cave without destroying the cave in the
process. By Sandra Blakeslee. (2100 words)

   SCI-ULTIMATE-LAPTOP (Undated) _ In a paper in the current issue
of Nature, an MIT researcher describes the ultimate laptop _ a
computer as powerful as the laws of physics would allow. So
energetic is this imaginary machine that using it would be like
harnessing a thermonuclear reaction. In the most extreme version of
this computer supreme, so much computational circuitry would be
packed into so small a space that the whole thing would collapse
from its own gravity forming a tiny black hole, an object so dense
that not even light can escape its gravity. By George Johnson.

   SCI-HEART-DRUGS (Undated) _ In the 13 years since they were

known as statins have revolutionized the treatment of heart
disease. Repeated studies have shown they prevent heart attacks and
prolong life, with very few side effects. They have rapidly become
the best-selling prescription drugs in this country. Now, the
latest research indicates that even more people should be on
statins. By Sandeep Jauhar. (1500 words)

   SCI-ALBATROSS (Undated) _ Researchers in France and Germany have

following a year in which they hatch and raise a single chick.
Rather, the albatrosses go to a specific section of the ocean and

   SCI-RACE-RECOGNITION (Undated) _ After a decade of mapping
brains in tasks like recalling numbers, perceiving facial

   SCI-MENOPAUSE (Undated) _ For many menopausal women, the
question of whether to take hormones is one of the most crucial
health decisions of their middle years _ and one of the most
confusing. Hormone use relieves the hot flashes and night sweats
that plague many women during menopause, and protects against
brittle bones. But does it help prevent heart disease, as
researchers have long believed _ or could it actually increase the
risk, as at least one new piece of data seems to suggest. In a

   _ Feeling sick to one's stomach may have more to do with the
brain the stomach. Researchers at Ohio State University say they
may have uncovered the reason that, often, people feel nauseated,
even though what ails them has nothing to do with their digestive
tracks. The culprit may be a brain chemical called tumor necrosis
factor, or TNF, which the immune system releases at the first sign

CHINA FILES CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CHRISTIANS ARRESTED DURING
WORSHIP  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The authorities have filed formal criminal charges
against 85 of the 130 evangelical Christians arrested during an
illegal worship service nearly two weeks ago in central China, a
human rights monitoring group in Hong Kong said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All those detained at the Aug. 23 service in Henan province were
members of the China Fangcheng Church, which _ with its claim to
have 500,000 members _ is one of the largest of the house churches.
The house churches refuse to join with the government-run
Protestant Church.
</P>
<P>
   Three Taiwanese-American evangelicals from California, on a
covert, short-term mission, were arrested along with the Chinese
worshipers and deported soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The large-scale prosecutions, if they proceed, would represent
an escalation of the government's longtime war against defiant
Christian groups. In recent years, while fines and temporary
detentions have been used to harass house churches in many regions
and cities, only a relatively few leaders are known to have been
formally charged and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But last year the government issued harsher rules against
``cults'' after it witnessed the organizing power and tenacity of
the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement, which draws on
Buddhism, Taoism and traditional healing theories. The authorities
have applied the cult label to a number of evangelical Christian
groups, even though outside experts say their practices fall well
within the Christian tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Chinese constitution, citizens have freedom of
religion. But China remains a one-party state, where all social
organizations must have government or Communist Party sponsors, and
religious groups that refuse to register with official bodies are
regarded as deviant and threats to stability.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, the
rights monitoring group in Hong Kong that reported the criminal
indictments Monday, faxed to reporters a copy of an arrest notice
dated Aug. 25 for one of the Fangcheng members, Chen Zhouniu. It
charges him with ``using an evil cult to obstruct justice,'' which
means he is likely to receive a long prison sentence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Illegal Protestant groups are believed to be surging in China
despite the campaign to stamp them out. The approved,
non-denominational Protestant Church, which accepts government
control, says it has more than 10 million members, many of whom say
they are not happy with the situation but can still can engage in
genuine Christian worship.
</P>
<P>
   But more assertive evangelical groups have, according to various
estimates, gained at least 20 million to 50 million followers.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of such groups say God and the Bible are their masters
and they cannot accept guidance from the officially atheist
Communist Party. They also reject the government's restrictions on
religion, such as the bans on the baptism of anyone under age 18
and on public proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   A similar split bedevils the Catholic Church in China. The
official ``Patriotic'' church, with some 4 million members, refuses
to give the Vatican say over the appointment of bishops. Priests in
the underground Catholic Church, which claims at least 8 million
worshipers, accept the pope's authority and are often arrested or
fined.

A PHRASE THAT MAY DIE, BUT WILL NEVER SURRENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let others argue the case for the  &UR; old guard &LR; ,'' Al Gore said in
his Los Angeles acceptance speech. ``We're the  &UR; new guard &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan two days earlier, the vice president scorned ``the
failed ways of the  &UR; old guard &LR; ,'' and one night before, his choice
for vice president, Joseph Lieberman, asked the Democratic
convention, ``Are we going to elect the  &UR; old guard &LR;  that created
the problems or a  &UR; new guard &LR;  that will continue to work solving
them?''
</P>
<P>
   From this we can safely assume that Democrats have formulated a
rhetorical strategy to get around the In party's traditional ``time
for a change'' problem. ``My goodness,'' exclaimed the CNN analyst
William Schneider as the slogan was repeated, ``they've been in for
eight years _ how can they be the  &UR; new guard &LR; ?''
</P>
<P>
   As the old song goes, wishing will make it so. The daring idea
is to take the ``new'' out of newcomer and the ``in'' out of
incumbent. How? By hanging the  &UR; old guard &LR;  label on the
challengers, those who have been the Ins for the past two terms
cast themselves as the contrasting  &UR; new guard &LR; . No such audacious
reversal has been suggested since Adlai Stevenson countered the
charges of a ``mess in Washington'' by saying that the GOP slogan
in 1952 should be ``Throw the rascals in.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fair-minded reader will note, the scholarly function of
this linguistic column during a presidential campaign is to
examine, with scrupulous nonpartisanship, the roots of its catch
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guard dies, but never surrenders'' (`` &UR; La Garde meurt,
mais ne se rend pas &LR; '') was supposed to have been said by Count
Cambronne on June 18, 1815, rejecting the Duke of Wellington's call
for Napoleon's surrender after the Battle of Waterloo. He did not
say ``the  &UR; old &LR;  Guard''; indeed, Cambronne went to his grave
denying that he ever said anything of the sort, which was one of
the last times anybody denied making a historic utterance. (I erred
recently in attributing the wrong gender to  &UR; La Garde &LR; .  &UR; J'en suis
desole &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that the count had said, simply and forcefully,
 &UR; merde &LR; ! _ an expletive of excrement, which sounds like  &UR; meurt &LR; ,
the French for ``dies.'' Gen. Anthony McAuliffe of the United
States, rejecting surrender at Bastogne in the World War II Battle
of the Bulge, is also suspected of having used a more forceful
expression than his recorded ``Nuts!'' But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cambronne did say, ``The Guard dies,'' etc., whence
comes the  &UR; old &LR;  Guard? Evidently this was the familiar name of the
Imperial Guard of Napoleon I, cited in an 1809 message to the
emperor as  &UR; la vieille Garde &LR;  and repeated by him in his final
adieu in 1814: ``Soldiers of my  &UR; Old Guard &LR; : I bid you farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase was not extended beyond the specific Napoleonic
troops until applied to ``grim sea grenadiers'' by the American
novelist Herman Melville, in ``White Jacket'' in 1850, who called
them ``hearty old members of the  &UR; Old Guard &LR; .'' The phrase
continued to have an affectionate, loyal-veteran connotation until
1880, when supporters of a third term for President Ulysses S.
Grant wore medallions proclaiming `` &UR; Old Guard &LR; '' on them;
Democrats reacted by using the phrase as a description of
Republican reactionaries.
</P>
<P>
   That is the current sense. Aware of this, a conservative
Republican group in the 1970s, the Young Americans for Freedom,
named its publication The  &UR; New Guard &LR; . But in political
terminology, anything can be freely swiped. In this case, that is
what the creative Gore word-slingers seeking to keep the Democrats
in office have done in their coordinated effort to derogate the
freshness of the Bush challenge.
</P>
<P>
   CLASS WARFARE
</P>
<P>
   After the Democratic presidential nominee posed the choice in
the election as being between ``the people'' and ``the powerful,''
he was chastised by GOP leaders as advocating  &UR; class warfare &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore launched out talking about populism,'' charged Karl
Rove, Gov. George W. Bush's chief campaign strategist, ``about
 &UR; class warfare &LR; .'' The next day, on the stump, the GOP
standard-bearer himself denounced his opponent as ``a candidate who
wants to wage  &UR; class warfare &LR;  to get ahead.'' Unfortunately, much
of the sting in the charge was lost because Bush was seen and heard
on television pronouncing the phrase as ``class war fore,''
inviting derision.
</P>
<P>
   Who coined the phrase? The Oxford English Dictionary spotted a
heading of  &UR; class warfare &LR;  in George Bernard Shaw's ``Fabian Tract
41,'' written in 1892; it was not picked up until 1927, when Aldous
Huxley, in an essay in ``Proper Studies,'' wrote about ``those who
would interpret all social phenomena in terms of  &UR; class warfare &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   However, a useful new database _ the Making of America, a joint
project of Cornell and the University of Michigan _ permits
detailed examination of 19th-century American texts. Assiduous
research by Kathleen Miller, my departing research assistant,
reveals a use of the phrase in London's Aug. 17, 1867, Spectator.
The editorialist urged ``some grand effort to settle the Irish
question'' and put forward a conservative idea about land reform,
noting that there was ``no confiscation in this plan, no plea for
raising that cry, no summons to  &UR; class warfare &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   From that day to this, the charge of instigating  &UR; class warfare &LR; 
has been used as an antidote to populist ideas.
</P>
<P>
   WILLKIE LIVES
</P>
<P>
   After Al Gore denounced the  &UR; old guard &LR;  and other powerful
interests, the relatively moderate Joe Lieberman was asked if the
Democratic proposals would cause him to take a populist line.
``Political rallies tend not to be places for extremely thoughtful
argument,'' he told The Wall Street Journal. Rather, he said that
the Gore policy proposals were ``quite moderate'' and added, ``You
have some rhetorical flourishes.''
</P>
<P>
   That reminded political-history buffs of Wendell Willkie, GOP
nominee in 1940 against FDR, who warned in the campaign that ``if
the present administration is restored to power for a third term,
our democratic system will not last another four years.'' After his
defeat, Willkie undertook a diplomatic mission for President
Roosevelt and was asked how he could square his cooperation with
his earlier charges. In testifying before Congress in a way that
infuriated Republicans, Willkie grinned and let the cat out of the
political bag: ``It was just a bit of campaign oratory.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that's called ``rhetorical flourishes.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS RETURNS, EAGER TO PASS SPENDING BILLS
 &HT;    670&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-LIST-0905
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress returns from its August break Tuesday with
members of both parties eager to wrap up a few compromises on
spending bills, exchange partisan barrages, and resume full-time
campaigning by the first Thursday in October.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton invited Democratic congressional leaders to
meet with him Tuesday in the White House to publicize their goals
for the upcoming end-of-session negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton said his
priorities include raising the minimum wage, new education
programs, prescription drug coverage, a patient's bill of rights, a
small package of targeted tax cuts and paying down the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and union lobbyists are also asking him to hold
firm in his threats to veto eight of the 11 unfinished
appropriation bills unless Congress removes the portions that they
say would weaken workplace or environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have counted 46 very destructive anti-environmental riders,
and we want clean bills _ with the riders out,'' said Mary Beth
Beetham, legislative affairs director at the 380,000-member
Defenders of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican-controlled Senate will act on its own
priorities when it reassembles at noon Tuesday, said Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's focus for the first two weeks in September will
be on the completion of the remaining appropriations and the China
(trade) bills, and on the votes to override the president's vetoes
of our bipartisan bills to end the marriage penalty and the death
tax,'' Lott said in a letter to all GOP senators. He also plans to
conduct votes on a Republican bill that would change the rules for
pension plans and raise the amount that savers can put into their
Individual Retirement Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which reconvenes Wednesday, will try to override
Clinton's tax-bill vetoes, finish work on appropriation bills and
pass some non-controversial measures, said Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lame duck status hasn't weakened his negotiating
skills, said Republican operative Robert Rusbuldt, executive vice
president of the Independent Insurance Agents of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is going to want to milk every last cent and
every last program he cares about out of this Congress. It's his
last shot,'' Rusbuldt said. ``Members of both parties will be
itching to get out of town, but he's not going to be as concerned
about their campaigns as he is about his agenda and political
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other veteran Congress-watchers said they expect Congress
to spend the next five or six weeks negotiating compromises on its
only must-do set of laws _ the annual spending bills that will fund
the government's routine operations in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most agreed on these likely outcomes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Though only two of the 13 annual appropriation bills have been
passed and signed into law, a few more will be passed in September.
The rest will be bundled into one giant bill negotiated between the
White House and Congress in early October.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other popular measures likely to become law include a $1
increase in the $5.15 minimum wage, modest tax relief for some
targeted groups like college students and beer wholesalers,
permanent approval of normal trade relations with China, higher
immigration quotas for high-tech workers and a rollback of cuts
made several years ago in the size of Medicare payments to nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The adjournment rush, partisan distrust and the skepticism in
Congress about details could delay action on plans to add
prescription drug benefits to Medicare and to protect the rights of
patients who use health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Until a new president is elected, gridlock will prevent any
major changes in the ``non-discretionary'' two-thirds of the $2
trillion annual federal budget. That portion pays down the debt and
finances Social Security, Medicare, civil service and military
pensions and other entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, gridlock will protect the big money, which is in
entitlements, so there will be funds left for debt reduction,''
said Robert Bixby, executive director of the bipartisan, fiscally
conservative Concord Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the president wants more than the Republicans do on the
$600 billion or so in discretionary spending that is in the
appropriation bills,'' Bixby said. ``It looks like the Republicans
will fight him viciously for a few weeks, and then cave in, add the
usual amount of pork-barrel spending and go home, where they will
blame him for the amount they agreed to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   At a liberal Washington think tank, the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, legislative director Ellen Nissenbaum also said
she expects a compromise without a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we have a series of short-term resolutions (to keep
the government operating in October while negotiators meet) remains
to be seen,'' she said. But with big budget surpluses forecast,
``there's simply less incentive for a fight over the numbers than
there was in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Franc, vice president for government relations at the
conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, there was a night-and-day difference between the
parties, but today it's shades of twilight,'' Franc said.
</P>
<P>
   While anticipating ``lots of screaming and dueling press
conferences,'' he also predicted that a lot could be accomplished
in Congress from Sept. 15 to Oct. 1, when most Americans will be
more interested in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is, the Olympics will suck a lot of oxygen out of
Capitol Hill,'' Franc said.

   BENSON, Ariz. _ Take a sopping wet underground cavern in a
remote corner of Arizona. Add a man-made entrance with heavy steel
doors to keep out the hot desert air, a misting system to keep the
cavern damp and lights to show off a wonderland of spires,
flowstone, soda straws and other phantasmagorical cave formations.
</P>
<P>
   Then add a human being who, in a one-hour visit, sloughs off
some 60,000 skin fragments, 160 million dust particles, 20,000
clothing-lint particles, 25 quarts of carbon dioxide gas and 170
watts of body heat. Multiply this by 183,000 visitors to the cave
each year.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an ad hoc experiment now under way at Kartchner
Caverns near Benson, Ariz., to learn if it is possible to bring
thousands of people into the fragile environment of a pristine cave
without destroying the cave in the process. Kartchner is the first
major show cave to open in the United States in several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State Parks system, which owns the land, is trying,
with some difficulty, to balance the interests of visitors with
those of preservationists. Arizona has spent more than $28 million
on monitoring systems and on a visitors center, two man-made
entrances, 1,100 feet of concrete tunnels and 1,225 feet of trails
that lead visitors to large showrooms inside the cavern. One of
these, the Throne Room, is now open. A second, the Big Room,
probably will not open for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are signs that the cave is drying out _ compared
with years before the cave opened last November, the average
temperature is up 1 degree and in some spots humidity dropped by
half a percent and evaporation rates quadrupled. And without enough
moisture, Kartchner's formations will stop growing and their colors
will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Travous, director of Arizona State Parks, said that the
changes could be explained by the construction, which is still
under way, and the severe drought in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of leading cave scientists and the two men who
discovered the cavern 26 years ago are worried that park officials
are not heeding signs that the cavern may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kerbo, a leading authority on cave management for the
National Park Service, recently visited Kartchner Caverns. Although
he praised the commitment of the state park officials, he pointed
out problems with lighting, misting, air locks, data collection and
a new proposal to sample cave air and moisture with a system of
plastic tubing called cave suckers. ``It would be better to install
electronic sensors'' to understand changes in cave microclimates,
Kerbo said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tufts, co-discoverer of the cave who now does lunar and
planetary research at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said:
``Our main concern is that they don't seem to be on top of data
collection. It's one thing to have a problem and know it and
another to have a problem and not know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufts and his caving buddy, Gary Tenen, who today owns two Alpha
Graphics stores in Tucson, found the cave in 1974 when they crawled
into a cavity in the Whetstone Mountains and smelled ``eau de bat
guano'' coming from a three-inch hole in a wall of limestone. They
widened the hole, crawled in and discovered an untouched,
two-and-a-half-mile long, richly decorated ``living'' cave, meaning
its formations were still growing.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that large numbers of amateur cavers would destroy the
pristine cavern simply by exploring it, the two kept the cave's
existence a secret. In 1978, they told the Kartchner family, which
owned the land, about the cave, and in 1988 the family sold it to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, we realized that the best way to preserve the
cavern was to develop it as a commercial show cave so that it would
remain under watchful eyes,'' Tenen said. In unsupervised caves,
people cannot seem to stop themselves from breaking off stalactites
that took 10,000 years to grow, writing on walls and strewing
garbage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In opening the nation's newest cave, the developers of Kartchner
have been able to employ state-of-the-art principles of cave
conservation that are being used to maintain and restore older
caves in other parts of the United States and in Australia, France
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Kartchner Caverns is a twisted maze of passageways that open
into two main galleries with 100-foot-high ceilings and 26 smaller
rooms. Apart from spectacular stalactites, stalagmites and columns,
many of the formations sound good enough to eat or put in a living
room at home: fried eggs, bacon, popcorn, turnip shields, soda
straws, draperies, cave cotton, coral pipes, birdnests and miles of
moonmilk, a soft, white claylike substance on cave walls. Some of
the formations are blood red. A viscous mud of unknown depth lies
in many passages, holding water from past floods.
</P>
<P>
   From April to September each year, 1,000 to 2,000 myotis bats
turn one corner of the cave into a bat maternity ward. That corner
will be off limits to visitors then, Travous said. A variety of
microbial life plus 38 invertebrate species munch on bat guano or
each other year round.
</P>
<P>
   Like most limestone caves in the world, Kartchner was formed
when rain water combined with carbon dioxide in the air and carbon
in the soil to form a weak acid solution similar to soda pop. As
this acidic water trickled through limestone, it picked up calcium
in the rock. When it reached air in underground passages carved by
water running underground, each droplet gave up carbon dixode gas
and left calcium carbonate in tiny rings that grew into the yummy
sounding cave formations.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge at Kartchner is that this wet underworld lies in a
desert where the surface evaporation rate is 800 times greater than
inside the cave. If completely opened to surface air, the cave
would dry out in a week, Travous said.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening it to the public, scientists spent two years
taking baseline measurements of air and soil temperatures, relative
humidity, evaporation rates, gases and airflow patterns within the
cave.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extremely fragile environment, said Robert Buecher, a
civil engineer who led the monitoring study and is a leading
authority on cave climates. The original entrance allowed very
little air exchange with the surface, he said. If the humidity were
to drop just 0.7 percent from its average before development, to
98.7 percent, he said, the evaporation rate would double and start
to dry out the cave.
</P>
<P>
   Cave climates are tricky and often counterintuitive, Buecher
said. For example, one winter the cave flooded and the relative
humidity went down instead of up. This was because the flood water
was slightly colder than the cave air and, just as a glass of iced
tea in summer collects moisture, the cold water condensed moisture
out of the cave air.
</P>
<P>
   But people are the biggest threat to cave health, Kerbo said. At
Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, people snap off and carry away
2,000 to 3,000 pieces of cave formation each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who goes into a cave leaves behind a belly button
full of lint, skin cells and dust,'' said Tom Aley, owner and
director of the Ozark Underground Laboratory, a cavern dedicated to
teaching and research in Protem, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   People carry enough dust on the surface of their clothing fibers
to cover the area of two tennis courts, said Neville Michie, a cave
climate expert at Macquarie University in Marsfield, Australia.
Walking through a cave, each person drops one microgram of dust per
second, Michie said. The dust travels to the corners of a cavern
and dulls the formations. Skin cells and lint, which are heavier
than dust, accumulate near trails in nasty-looking grayish black
mats or can even hang from the ceiling in ``lintcicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Flakes of skin are little life rafts for bacteria that float
into the cave and compete with native bacteria, often taking over.
Moreover, most lint contains phosphates from detergents, and
phosphates are essentially fertilizers for algae, which can take
root in the cave formations and cause them to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which can change the
deposition rate of calcium carbonate, slowing the growth of
formations. And, of course, people add heat.
</P>
<P>
   All of these problems were anticipated at Kartchner, Travous
said. The entrances and tunnels were dug at the same level of the
natural opening, which prevents air from leaving the cave in a
chimney effect. The visitor center, parking lot and other
structures were built downhill within a different drainage system.
Two huge walk-in freezer doors at each entrance serve as airlocks
to the entrance tunnel and prevent surface air from coming into the
cave.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the tunnel, visitors pass through a smaller third
door that leads to trails for viewing cave formations. Misters,
like those used on vegetables in a supermarket, are on round the
clock, adding two to three gallons of water per hour to the cave.
</P>
<P>
   The trails have 18-inch-high curbs for catching lint and skin
cells, which tend to fall straight to the ground. Trails are hosed
down every night. Lights are turned on only when tours pass through
an area.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Travous said, only 20 people at a time
are allowed on a tour and are watched by two guides.
</P>
<P>
   As for keeping an eye on the cave's climate, 13 monitoring
stations for temperature, humidity and evaporation rate are located
along the tour route and in deeper recesses of the cave. The ``cave
sucker'' system of tubing is being installed in hope of automating
data collection.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if all these measures were working to protect the cave,
Travous said, ``We sure hope so,'' but added, ``We still don't know
what is acceptable change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cave is one degree warmer and the humidity is lower in
some places,'' Travous said. ``But if we go back and look at
monitoring data from the past, we've seen these higher temperatures
before. Plus the cave will flood again.''
</P>
<P>
   But many scientists familiar with Kartchner Caverns are worried
that some of the steps taken to protect the cave may ultimately
contribute to its drying out. While the freezer doors keep hot air
out of the cave entrance, the tunnels contain so much air that they
may significantly alter air flow inside the cave, Kerbo said.
</P>
<P>
   The misters might change air flow patterns and temperatures,
Kerbo said. Introduced water could concentrate on mudflats and
other surfaces in a way that interferes with natural processes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Buecher said he was worried that data now being collected by
hand were not being compared to baseline. ``If they were, someone
would have sounded the alarm,'' he said. ``The cave is definitely
drying out.''
</P>
<P>
   Travous said that he planned to hire a cave specialist and a
cave scientist to improve monitoring. Scientific advisers will be
invited back at some point, and the idea for cave suckers is being
re-assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under pressure from the Legislature to finish
construction and be fully open to the public,'' he said. ``But we
won't neglect good science in the process.''

METAL STRIP THAT DAMAGED CONCORDE LIKELY FROM A CONTINENTAL
AIRLINES PLANE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A metal strip that investigators believe may have led to
the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde last July apparently came
from a Continental Airlines DC10 that had taken off from the same
runway only minutes before the Concorde, the French agency
investigating the disaster said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that an identical metal band that is believed to
have gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge chunks of
rubber to pierce the plane's fuel tanks, was reported missing by
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characteristics of the missing piece seem identical to
those of the metal piece which was found on the runway after the
accident on July 25, 2000,'' a statement issued by the French
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from its headquarters, Continental said the piece
could well have come from a Continental plane that was on its way
to Newark, N.J., from Charles de Gaulle airport outside of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative agency's latest statement came on a day when
Air France officials said they believed it was unlikely that the
remaining sleek-needle nosed supersonic jets belonging to Air
France and British Air would fly again before April, at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Air France, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said at a
press conference that a team of 20 experts was working with the
government and the plane's manufacturers to try to come up with
modifications that would insure the safety of the plane. The
modifications would then have to be tested, and only then would Air
France and British Air _ the only two airlines that fly Concordes _
discuss whether to return the aircraft to service.
</P>
<P>
   The French agency described the piece of metal that may have
triggered the crash that killed 113 people as ``a part of a hood on
the plane's reverse thrusters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Continental said the 17-inch by one-inch piece
of metal found on the runway was ``similar'' in shape to a piece
found missing from its DC10. The piece, it said, was ``missing from
the space between the fan reverser and the core door on the right
wing engine.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of such a piece, the statement said, ``does not
affect the safe operation of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, French investigators disclosed that one of three
daily runway inspections aimed at removing debris such as the metal
strip had been skipped on the day of the crash because of a fire
drill. The runway thus had not been thoroughly inspected for about
12 hours before the supersonic jet took off, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that the piece had fallen off the Continental
flight pointed out that the runway inspections would not have
prevented the disaster.

ROCKS FROM MARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do scientists determine that a rock on Earth came from
Mars rather than someplace else?
</P>
<P>
   A. The best idea scientists have of the geochemistry of Mars
comes from the two Viking robots that landed on Mars in 1976.
Findings from the robots' weeks of readings of things like the
Martian atmosphere are compared with the chemical signatures of
meteorites found on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The first such object confidently identified as Martian was
reported in 1983. A rock 17.5 pounds and 8 inches in diameter was
picked up in 1979 at the Elephant Moraine near McMurdo Sound in
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped in bits of glass in the object, designated EETA 79001,
were some so-called noble gases _ neon, argon, krypton and xenon _
strikingly similar in abundance to those of the Martian atmosphere,
as determined by the Viking missions.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite bearing the organic molecules that raised
suspicions in 1996 that there might have once been biological
activity on Mars was one of only 12 identified up to that time as
having come from Mars. Found in 1984, it is named Allan Hills
84001. However, experts believe that many other fragments of Mars
probably lie unrecognized in meteorite collections.

 &HT;    Duck ad campaign quacks up stunning interest in AFLAC
 &HT;    By Scott Leith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Love him or hate him, AFLAC's talking duck is proving
hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know the critter: A white duck that insistently
quacks ``AFLAC'' in commercials about the Columbus-based
supplemental health insurer.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign kicked off during CNN's New Year's Eve coverage
last year, and AFLAC has been stunned by the response. The third
duck commercial just appeared, and more are in production.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first two months of 2000, we had more leads than in the
last two years,'' said Kathleen Spencer, senior vice president of
corporate communications at AFLAC. The company says it has sold
some 7,000 toy ducks on its Web site, which otherwise focuses on
long-term disability insurance and dental insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In an advertising-saturated world, having a hit ad character is
like finding gold in a salt mine. Taco Bell's Spanish-speaking
Chihuahua was a hit as a toy, as were Coca-Cola Co.'s white polar
bears, launched in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea the level of carryover interest that the
campaign would create,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   AFLAC is spending about $35 million on advertising. Kaplan
Thaler Group of New York created the duck campaign, while
Fitzgerald &AMP; Co. of Atlanta handled the media buying. The TV duck
has no name, but the voice is provided by comedian Gilbert
Gottfried, while the duck itself was created by Stan Winston
Studio, a California company that worked on Jurassic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the stuffed toy ducks were boosted when the host of
CNBC's ``Power Lunch'' had one on his desk this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, AFLAC's duck is limited to appearances in the
United States, even though AFLAC's biggest market is Japan.
</P>
<P>
   AFLAC will first test-market the campaign before taking it to
Japan, where a goofy U.S. ad might not work. ``Here, the idea of a
duck that is sort of persistent and a little bit pushy _ I guess
you would say it fits,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a hit character doesn't assure an ad firm's future with a
company. Taco Bell dismissed the Chihuahua's creator,
TBWA/Chiat/Day, following sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   But success can also be enduring. Coca-Cola Co. gets $50 million
a year through licensing the Coke name and other trademarks. Coke
is happy that people want merchandise _ including toy polar bears _
but the main reason for licensing is trademark protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't use the brand name in categories other than soft
drinks, we can lose it,'' said spokesman Scott Jacobson. ``That's
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said Coke doesn't aim for merchandise sales. ``It's not
like the Disney-type approach, where you look at it and say, 'How
do we create this franchise that can snowball into more revenue?'''
</P>
<P>
   John Cavanagh knew the polar bears would be a hit, so the Coke
licensee asked if he could sell stuffed versions. His company,
Cavanagh Group International, still distributes hundreds of
thousands of the bears each Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polar bear has become an icon of the company,'' said
Cavanagh.

 &HT;    Delta ramp workers face new vote on union
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines ramp workers checking their mailboxes
this week may suddenly feel a sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the National Mediation Board is mailing a second
round of election ballots to 9,900 ramp workers eligible to vote on
whether they want to be represented by the Transport Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The first election, held in February, was declared invalid by
the Mediation Board because of procedural errors and actions by
Delta that the board ruled inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In that election, just 17 percent of nearly 10,800 eligible
workers at Atlanta-based Delta voted to join the TWU. A majority
had to return ballots to the Mediation Board for the union to win.
</P>
<P>
   The TWU appealed the results, and in July the Mediation Board
declared the vote invalid because it mistakenly disclosed to Delta
the number of election authorization cards supporting the election
and accidently sent cards marked for a different election at United
Airlines to 241 Delta workers.
</P>
<P>
   The board also said it found ``substantial evidence'' that Delta
supervisors discussed management's opposition to the TWU during
required employee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer workers will vote in the second election because some have
retired, quit or taken new posts since the first vote, said Jeff
Osborne, a TWU organizer. The Mediation Board will count ballots in
the second election Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the vote is going to improve,'' Osborne said. ''There
is some possibility that this will go through.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote earlier this year was essentially the first large-scale
union vote ever at Delta, the least-unionized carrier in the
airline industry. Pilots, who joined the Air Lines Pilots
Association more than 60 years ago, are its only large organized
group.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the airline believes it acted
properly in the original election and will comply with Mediation
Board rules in the rerun. ''We trust that our employees will make
their opinions known and vote overwhelmingly to remain
union-free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The TWU had been organizing at Delta more than three years,
telling workers a union contract would provide better job security
and protection against cutbacks such as those that riddled the
company during a mid-1990s financial slump.

 &HT;    Florida city's tax campaign rolls on theme of bashing Atlanta
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The mayor of Jacksonville, Fla., sits high and comfy
in the SUV and stares into the camera:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a word for a city that doesn't plan for its future:
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV ad then cuts to the downtown Atlanta traffic at rush
hour. Traffic stalls. Horns honk. Commuting hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their traffic congestion is among the worst in the nation,''
Mayor John Delaney intones. ``Years ago, Atlanta was called a city
on the rise.''
</P>
<P>
   He wraps up the 30-second commercial with, ``We can't let
Atlanta happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is ammunition Delaney and his allies are using to
persuade voters to support The Better Jacksonville Plan, a
half-cent sales tax referendum on the ballot today. If approved, as
expected, it would help raise more than $2 billion for traffic,
environmental and economic development projects in Jacksonville,
pop. 700,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   But it could anger metro Atlanta residents, seeing it as a
particularly virulent strain of Atlantis bash-itis. The affliction
crops up regularly across the Southeast, particularly during
election season.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Jacksonville, Nashville, Tenn; Memphis, Tenn.;
Charlotte, N.C.; Raleigh, N.C.; Greenville, S.C., and beyond love
to hate Atlanta. As the Southeast's economic and cultural
juggernaut, Atlanta is an easy target for the region's second-tier
municipal strivers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the barbs serve as friendly banter between competing
towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is envy, of course,'' says Bill McCoy, director of
the Urban Institute at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte.
``Envy of the development and growth. Envy, partially, of the job
creation. And it's the New South city that got the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the criticism, though, is dead on: Traffic is lousy
here. And metro Atlanta leaders have done such a poor job planning
for growth that the federal government cut off road-building money
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The metro region loses 50 acres of tree cover daily. Commuters
average a nation-leading 34 miles a day behind the wheel. Daily
smog alerts are routine during the summer. And more than 880,000
newcomers flocked to the 20-county metro Atlanta region during the
1990s, crowding schools and roads.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't explain the churlish, anti-Atlanta diatribes,
like those spewed during Nashville's mayoral contest last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk about Atlanta, I talk about a place that people
work so that they can earn enough money so they can live somewhere
else,'' mayoral candidate Murray Philip said during the campaign.
His Web site's motto: ``Committed to stopping the move to become an
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip lost the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has become the prime symbol for metropolitan
'sprawl,''' another candidate, Richard Fulton, wrote in his
Vision-In-Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton lost, too.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is ``universal shorthand for urban sprawl,'' candidate
Bill Purcell said. ``I don't have to spend a lot of time plotting
out for people what can go wrong with a city's development.''
</P>
<P>
   During a televised debate, Purcell said: ``I don't want to be
Atlanta, either. Anyone who wants to be Atlanta, obviously, could
leave right now and, assuming I-24 is open, could be there
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Purcell won.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's new mayor didn't return phone calls last week. But
Purcell insists he's not anti-Atlanta. ``I don't consider it
Atlanta bashing,'' he told the Wall Street Journal. ``It's simply a
shared thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Shared, obviously, by many, including Georgia politicians who
have long played the anti-Atlanta, anti-Sin City card. Every state
harbors an anti-capital bias, of course. But it's rare when a
capital area's own politicians trash the capital, as former Fulton
County Commission Chairman Mitch Skandalakis did when he ran for
lieutenant governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kick Atlanta's ass,'' Skandalakis said in a commercial, ``and
bring it in line before the city of Atlanta kills the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta boosters chuckle at the criticism. Better to be talked
about, they say, than ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we have our problems is because so many people are
attracted to the region,'' said Bill Thornton, assistant executive
director of the Georgia Municipal Association. ``We must be doing
something right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat McCrory, the boyish mayor of Charlotte who is not above
dissing Atlanta, agrees. Along with a hundred other North Carolina
movers and shakers, McCrory visited Atlanta earlier this year to
experience firsthand the region's sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken both good and bad about Atlanta,'' said McCrory,
who got caught in a traffic jam during his visit. ``Charlotte has
an advantage over Atlanta because we can learn what didn't work in
Atlanta. ... I've said on the campaign trail that I don't want to
repeat Atlanta's mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Wheeler admits to a schizophrenic relationship with
Atlanta. The long-time Charlotte City Council member and frequent
Atlanta visitor fears Charlotte isn't learning from Atlanta's
land-use and road-building mistakes. Yet she loves Atlanta's
big-city esprit, especially the shopping amenities found at Lenox
Square and Phipps Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I take a little drive around, to find what's
redeeming about Atlanta, I can't find it,'' said Wheeler, a
Charlotte mayoral aspirant. ``The development in Buckhead is not
visually appealing and the congestion is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried her comments might come across as too harsh, Wheeler
backpedaled. McCrory too insisted he wasn't denigrating Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jacksonville's mayor professed great affection for Atlanta
a half dozen times during a 10-minute interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love your city. I love your city. I don't love your
traffic,'' Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he visits Atlanta maybe six times each year for
business or pleasure. Delaney said Jacksonville admires Atlanta as
a boy admires an older brother. He gushed over Atlanta's cultural
offerings. Heck, even some of his best friends, he said, live in an
Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope,'' Delaney said, ``is to be come Atlanta without the
warts.''

AMAZON.COM REVISES PRIVACY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid growing controversy over consumer privacy online,
Amazon.com Inc. revised its privacy policy, carefully detailing how
it now uses customers' personal information and how it may sell
that data in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In a new privacy statement now posted on Amazon.com's Web site,
the Internet's biggest merchant informs shoppers that it may hand
over their information if it sold some or all of its businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the unlikely event that Amazon.com Inc., or substantially
all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course
be one of the transferred assets,'' the company wrote last week.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's decision comes at a time when federal regulators
are closely monitoring the information-gathering practices of Web
sites. As a leader in the online marketplace, selling everything
from books to washing machines, Amazon.com also has become known
for its skills in mining customer data.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Federal Trade Commission sued Waltham-based
Toysmart.com Inc. after the online toy seller collapsed and then
tried to sell customer data _ despite promising its consumers it
would never do so. Both sides have agreed to a settlement, but the
case remains in limbo mainly because no serious buyer has stepped
forward.
</P>
<P>
   David Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester Research of
Cambridge, Mass., said Amazon.com may be trying to avoid the same
sort of legal entanglements that Toysmart.com now faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make their policy more visible, so they
don't get slammed later,'' Cooperstein said. ``If they come clean
on what they plan to do with the data, people can't complain
later.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, industry observers have been highly critical of
Amazon.com's privacy statement, saying it was too lengthy and vague
to help online shoppers. Under the former policy, Amazon.com told
customers it did not sell or swap their personal information. But
it added that it might decided to do so in the future ``with
trustworthy third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amazon.com's revamped privacy statement, the Seattle company
now provides details on its data collection practices and where
that information might end up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value the trust our customers place in us, and we wanted
them to have as clear a picture as possible of what we're doing and
not doing when it comes to the information they give us,'' Jeff
Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 23 million customers, Amazon.com has an enviable
database of names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and shopping
records. As a customer peruses its Web site, Amazon.com also can
track customers as they click on items such as the latest Harry
Potter book or the ``Complete Idiot's Guide to Sex on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new policy statement, Amazon.com revealed that it has
e-mailed offers to ``selected groups of Amazon.com customers on
behalf of other businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com also shares customer information with its partners,
including companies that help Amazon.com fill orders, deliver
packages and analyze data. And the company may receive information
about customers from other sources and then add that data to its
own files.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Cooperstein said Amazon.com's clarified privacy policy
should help the company in the long term as consumer advocates and
federal regulators continue to scrutinize Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``in the short term, customers may look at the policy and
decide not to do business with them,'' said Cooperstein.

<P>
   In the 13 years since they were introduced in the United States,
the cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins have revolutionized
the treatment of heart disease. Study after study has shown these
drugs prevent heart attacks and prolong lives, with very few side
effects. It is estimated that 5 million people are taking the
drugs, which have rapidly become the best-selling prescriptions in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the latest research indicates that even more people should
be on statins, not only those who already have heart disease _ or a
strong propensity for developing it, like diabetics or smokers _
but many who do not, including, perhaps, even young men with high
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statins have had a greater impact on heart disease than
anything that's come out in the past 50 years,'' said Dr. Antonio
Gotto, dean of Cornell University Medical College and an
educational consultant for several pharmaceutical companies that
produce statins. ``They are very safe drugs. I think their downside
is very low.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other experts say that the statins are too new
and too expensive to start prescribing them to everyone who might
benefit. The drugs can cause liver and muscle toxicity in up to 1
percent of patients. Some early studies showed a small increase in
violent deaths, including suicides. Though subsequent studies did
not confirm this result, the potential exists, as with any drugs,
for toxic side effects in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have 10 years of data on these drugs,'' said Dr.
Michael Criqui, professor and chairman of family and preventative
medicine at the University of California at San Diego. ``We need
20.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem doctors now face is deciding when the drugs'
benefits outweigh their risks. For some patients, it is easy.
``We're definitely undertreating patients with known cardiovascular
disease,'' Criqui said. These patients alone would swell the ranks
of statin takers by 20 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   For others, there is more of a debate. ``We don't have
sufficient data to recommend statins routinely for young people,''
said Dr. Eric Brass, professor of medicine at at the University of
California at Los Angeles and chairman of a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee that last month voted not to
allow statins to be sold over the counter. ``There is a potential
for unrecognized toxicity.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing everyone can agree on is that statins are extremely
effective at lowering cholesterol. They work by inhibiting an
enzyme called HMG CoA reductase that is necessary for cholesterol
production, resulting in a cholesterol deficit within liver cells.
Because cholesterol, a fatty substance, is essential for all
cellular function, the liver cells start making surface receptors
to gobble up the cholesterol floating by in the blood, thereby
lowering the level.
</P>
<P>
   Though cholesterol is essential for life, when its concentration
gets too high in the blood, it can be a killer. At high
concentrations, cholesterol burrows into blood vessel walls where
it attracts immune cells that feed on it. The cells, fattened on
the cholesterol, turn into ``foam'' cells, which pad the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a fatty plaque, which can continue to grow as more
cells migrate into it. If the plaque ruptures, by mechanisms that
are poorly understood, platelets, the blood cells responsible for
clotting, can stick to the wounded plaque, forming a clot that can
impede blood flow. Starved for oxygen, the tissue supplied by the
blood vessel dies.
</P>
<P>
   The first statin was discovered in 1976 by Japanese researchers
working on molds. The first statin in the United States, called
lovastatin, came out in 1980. Early clinical trials showed it to be
more effective, with fewer side effects, than other
cholesterol-lowering drugs at the time, like gemfibrozil and
niacin. The Food and Drug Administration approved it as a
prescription drug in 1987.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Statins are believed to ameliorate cardiovascular disease in
many ways besides simply lowering cholesterol. They appear to
stabilize fatty plaques, relax blood vessels and inhibit clotting.
They may promote growth of new blood vessels, as reported by Tufts
University researchers in the September issue of Nature Medicine.
Some experts believe that, like aspirin, they may soon be used to
treat heart attacks immediately after they occur.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, their benefits do not seem to be limited to the
heart. A recent study of more than 6,000 patients showed that
statin use reduced the risk of hip fracture by 50 percent in
elderly patients with osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people taking statins has grown enormously over
the past few years. According to IMS Health, a group that tracks
prescription drug sales for the pharmaceutical industry, statins
now account for $8.1 billion in drug sales, 6 percent of the total
United States prescription drug market and more than any other
class of drugs. (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like
Prozac and Paxil, are second.) Last year, sales of atorvastatin
alone, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, grew from $2.44 billion to
$3.56 billion, a 46 percent rise. The total number of statin
prescriptions grew by 20 percent during that time, three times the
average for other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients have had very good results. Enid Durant, a
77-year-old Brooklyn, N.Y., woman with diabetes and high blood
pressure, recently started taking Lipitor on the advice of her
doctor. Within a few months, her total cholesterol level had
dropped to 160 from 220 (below 200 is considered normal), and she
suffered no side effects. Her doctor was pleased with the results,
and so was she.
</P>
<P>
   But at $3 a pill, the drug has become an almost prohibitive
burden on her fixed income. Even with her private insurance, she
has to pay $30 a month for the pills, of which she takes one a day.
``Of all the drugs I take, Lipitor is the most expensive,'' she
said. ``I know it's helping me, but I don't know if I can keep
taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nanette Wenger, a professor of medicine at Emory University
and chief of cardiology at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta,
argues that the cost of these drugs must enter into the debate over
who should take them. ``If these drugs were priced like aspirin,
there would be a loud public outcry for them,'' Wenger said. Though
she opposes selling them over the counter, she said she hoped that
increasing volume would eventually drive down their costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have priced Lipitor competitively and
attractively,'' said Andrew McCormick, a spokesman for Pfizer. He
added that a portion of the drug's revenues was used to defray the
costs of expensive clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Gotto of Cornell, who was the lead author of a 1998 study
showing that statins prevented heart attacks in patients with
normal levels of LDL (``bad'' cholesterol) but low levels of HDL
(``good'' cholesterol), says he wants to see the drugs sold over
the counter soon. But pharmaceutical companies must sharpen their
message to get this approved, he said. ``I think the companies need
to make a case that this is not for money, but that it's a public
health issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some patients, statins are cramping more than just their
wallets. Joyce Litchfield, a 70-year-old woman with heart disease
living in Queens, started taking pravastatin, made by Bristol-Myers
Squibb, two years ago. After a few months, she developed arm pain
and went to her doctor. He said it was muscle inflammation caused
by the drug. He told her to stop taking it, and her pain went away.
</P>
<P>
   She recently started taking a low dose of another statin. Though
her pain has not returned, her cholesterol level remains high. Her
doctor is planning on doubling her dose, she said, but she is
worried about the pain coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Though experts agree that patients who already have heart
disease should be on a statin, they do not agree on when statins
should be used to prevent heart disease in the first place. For
example, a study published in The Journal of the American Medical
Association in July found that high cholesterol levels in young men
resulted in more cardiovascular disease and death in later years.
The research raised the question of whether young men with high
cholesterol levels should start taking statins.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year-old with high cholesterol but no other risk factors
for heart disease, Brass of UCLA said, would do well to modify his
diet and begin an exercise regimen before starting lifelong drug
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew Muldoon, a cholesterol researcher at the University
of Pittsburgh, says available data on statins cannot rule out
long-term risk. ``We have studies that show statins don't cause
cancer within a five-year period,'' he said. ``Of course, neither
does smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves Judith Wyman, a 52-year-old New York City
aerobics instructor with high cholesterol but no other heart
disease risk factors, a bit nervous about the drugs. Last year, her
total cholesterol was 245 and her doctor brought up the idea of her
starting a statin. She decided to hold off, making some changes in
her diet and exercise habits. On a recent checkup her cholesterol
level had dropped to 225. She said she preferred lowering her
cholesterol the natural way. ``For me it was almost a pride
thing,'' she confessed. ``I lead a healthy life. Why should I have
to take this pill?''

PERSONAL HEALTH: AS PRESCRIPTIONS PILE UP, RISKS DO, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 88, Nathan, a New York businessman with a sharp, clear mind,
was still going to work every day. Then an episode that resembled a
ministroke landed him in the hospital, where numerous medications
were administered.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Nathan's mind and memory had turned to mush. The
family was ready to put him in a nursing home when, at a
knowledgeable relative's request, the drug regimen was reviewed and
several drugs of questionable necessity were discontinued. Nathan
soon returned to his previous mental state and was able to continue
working for several more years.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five-year-old Anne of Boca Raton, Fla., also had a sharp
mind and good memory until two potent drugs she was given for
rheumatoid arthritis, along with six or seven others for related
health problems, led to such severe mental deterioration that she
became unable to communicate with her favorite brother. Within
weeks of being taken off the two arthritis drugs and Valium, she
began to come back to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nathan and Anne were the victims of polypharmacy, a
``poisonous cocktail'' _ as some doctors put it _ of three, four or
more drugs that may have side effects that render the treatment
worse than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no precise statistics on the incidence and
consequences of polypharmacy, experts report that it is an
increasingly common problem now that so many people live into their
70s and beyond, when nagging physical discomforts and chronic
health problems often arise. In various studies, 10 percent to 20
percent of hospital admissions for older people were found to
result directly from adverse reactions to prescribed medications.
</P>
<P>
   Causes and Consequences
</P>
<P>
   In a report several years ago in The Journal of General Internal
Medicine, Colleen A. Colley, a pharmacist, and Dr. Linda M. Lucas,
then both at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Portland, Ore.,
described the problem in detail and offered numerous suggestions to
remedy it. Though polypharmacy is by no means limited to the
elderly, they noted that twice as many medications were prescribed
for patients 65 and older than for younger ones, and that older
people used seven times as many over-the-counter drugs as the
general adult population.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of visits to doctors in the United States end with
a written prescription, partly the result of patients' expectations
that ``modern medicine should provide an antidote for every
symptom'' and partly to save the doctor's time, the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of polypharmacy is now being aided and abetted by
direct marketing of prescription drugs to the general public and by
the increasing availability of and publicity for herbal and other
nonprescription remedies with drug effects and side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients have two or more physicians and use multiple
pharmacies, so no one person knows every drug they are taking.
Given the high cost of many drugs and the lack of Medicare coverage
for prescriptions, many patients hoard leftover drugs and take them
on their own when symptoms return. Finally, changes in drug
regimens, and sometimes in the physical appearance of drugs, can
confuse patients who may end up taking the wrong drug, too much of
the right one or two or more similar medications for the same
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Polypharmacy can become a vicious cycle in which side effects
caused by one or more medications are ``treated'' with yet another
drug that has side effects of its own. And, two or more different
drugs taken together can sometimes interact to cause serious
complications. The problem is worse in older people in part because
they metabolize drugs more slowly, resulting in a buildup of toxic
doses.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, a complicated medication regimen or the occurrence of
side effects may result in noncompliance: the patients simply stop
taking the drug or take it less often than prescribed, reducing its
therapeutic benefit. This may prompt the doctor to increase the
dose or prescribe yet another drug to control the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In one study of patients discharged from a hospital, the more
medications that were prescribed, the greater was the number of
errors the patients made in taking them. Those discharged with six
or more medications had an error rate of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways patients and their doctors can avoid the
hazards of polypharmacy. They start with the patient _ or patient's
advocate _ acting as a responsible partner in his or her health
care. First and foremost, don't expect a drug to be the solution
for every symptom.
</P>
<P>
   Many health problems are best treated with adjustments in diet
and exercise habits, stress management or simple behavioral
changes. For example, rather than a sleeping pill to treat
insomnia, changes in habits like caffeine use, naps or bedtime
routines may solve the problem without a drug.
</P>
<P>
   When any drug is prescribed, patients should insist that the
name, purpose, dosage instructions and possible side effects,
especially those warranting a call to the doctor, be provided both
orally and in writing. Patients should also be told when to expect
an improvement and, for drugs that treat hidden symptoms like
elevated blood pressure or cholesterol, they should be kept
informed of progress, or lack of it, being made toward the desired
therapeutic goal.
</P>
<P>
   At each visit to a doctor, especially one new to the patient, it
is crucial to provide a complete list of the kinds and amounts of
every drug being taken, including over-the-counter medications and
herbal remedies, which may have the same drug effects or side
effects as a prescribed medication or may interfere with the
effectiveness of a prescribed drug.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the herb St. John's wort can impair the
effectiveness of several important drugs, including the heart drug
digoxin (Lanoxin) and the antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil).
Some experts suggest a ``brown bag'' approach, in which patients
put all their pills, including vitamins, in a bag and bring them to
the doctor for review. Even if you always see the same doctor, a
periodic review of what you take can help prevent polypharmacy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   When you are given a prescription and are told why, be sure to
fill it and take it as prescribed. Noncompliance with doctor's
orders _ taking too little or too much of a prescribed drug _ is a
major cause of polypharmacy. Complicated dosing schedules can also
interfere with compliance.
</P>
<P>
   If, say, you are taking one drug four times a day, another three
times a day and a third twice a day, ask the doctor if an
adjustment can be made to reduce the chances that you might forget
or get confused. Many drugs used for chronic health problems are
available in several dosage forms, including time-released, which
may permit a reduction to only one or two doses a day.
</P>
<P>
   Unpleasant side effects also lead to noncompliance with a
prescribed regimen. Rather than discontinuing a drug or reducing
the dosage on your own, tell the doctor about side effects you
cannot tolerate; often another medication can be substituted or a
change can be made to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, try to fill all your prescriptions at the same
pharmacy, where a record is kept of what you are taking.
</P>
<P>
   And before buying over-the-counter or herbal remedies, check
with your pharmacist to see if any will interact badly with drugs
you are taking.

AMAZON.COM REVISES PRIVACY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid growing controversy over consumer privacy online,
Amazon.com Inc. revised its privacy policy, carefully detailing how
it now uses customers' personal information and how it may sell
that data in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In a new privacy statement now posted on Amazon.com's Web site,
the Internet's biggest merchant informs shoppers that it may hand
over their information if it sold some or all of its businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the unlikely event that Amazon.com Inc., or substantially
all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course
be one of the transferred assets,'' the company wrote last week.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's decision comes at a time when federal regulators
are closely monitoring the information-gathering practices of Web
sites. As a leader in the online marketplace, selling everything
from books to washing machines, Amazon.com also has become known
for its skills in mining customer data.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Federal Trade Commission sued Waltham-based
Toysmart.com Inc. after the online toy seller collapsed and then
tried to sell customer data _ despite promising its consumers it
would never do so. Both sides have agreed to a settlement, but the
case remains in limbo mainly because no serious buyer has stepped
forward.
</P>
<P>
   David Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester Research of
Cambridge, Mass., said Amazon.com may be trying to avoid the same
sort of legal entanglements that Toysmart.com now faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make their policy more visible, so they
don't get slammed later,'' Cooperstein said. ``If they come clean
on what they plan to do with the data, people can't complain
later.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, industry observers have been highly critical of
Amazon.com's privacy statement, saying it was too lengthy and vague
to help online shoppers. Under the former policy, Amazon.com told
customers it did not sell or swap their personal information. But
it added that it might decided to do so in the future ``with
trustworthy third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amazon.com's revamped privacy statement, the Seattle company
now provides details on its data collection practices and where
that information might end up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value the trust our customers place in us, and we wanted
them to have as clear a picture as possible of what we're doing and
not doing when it comes to the information they give us,'' Jeff
Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 23 million customers, Amazon.com has an enviable
database of names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and shopping
records. As a customer peruses its Web site, Amazon.com also can
track customers as they click on items such as the latest Harry
Potter book or the ``Complete Idiot's Guide to Sex on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new policy statement, Amazon.com revealed that it has
e-mailed offers to ``selected groups of Amazon.com customers on
behalf of other businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com also shares customer information with its partners,
including companies that help Amazon.com fill orders, deliver
packages and analyze data. And the company may receive information
about customers from other sources and then add that data to its
own files.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Cooperstein said Amazon.com's clarified privacy policy
should help the company in the long term as consumer advocates and
federal regulators continue to scrutinize Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``in the short term, customers may look at the policy and
decide not to do business with them,'' said Cooperstein.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An autumnal air mass will encompass most of the Middle West and
Northeast Tuesday as sprawling high pressure moves southeast from
Ontario. Despite ample sunshine, daytime temperatures will average
10 to 15 degrees below normal over most of the region. Brisk
breezes from the Northeast will amplify the chill near the coast.
As winds diminish at night, scattered frost will develop in many
rural valleys near the central and northern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Locally heavy showers and thunderstorms will persist in the
sultry air from northern Florida to the Carolina coast. Farther
west, it will not be as hot as recent days over the southern
Mississippi River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, sunny and very warm weather will cover southern
sections. Meanwhile, the interior Northwest will be cool and
showery.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: GLOOMY SUMMER &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While heat in the South and West captured headlines throughout
the summer, the Northeast was exceptionally cool and dull. In
Binghamton, N.Y., the months of June, July and August together were
the second coolest on record. The record for summer chill was set
in 1992. The month of July was the coolest ever measured there.
Binghamton also had only 42 percent of the possible sunshine during
the three-month period, setting a new record for lack of summer
sunshine. Indeed, there were 100 fewer hours of sunshine than in
1977, the previous gloomiest summer. &QL;

IF YOU LIKED THE BOOK, YOU'LL LOVE THE TOUR GUIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DOREEN CARVAJAL 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paperback books have long made popular traveling companions, but
in this year of haute vacations truly avid readers bring their
favorite authors on journeys along with the antacid tablets and
rollaway luggage.
</P>
<P>
   For the package price of $2,650 plus additional airfare to
India, would-be travelers can glimpse one of the fabled wonders of
the world (the Taj Mahal) while led by one of the wonders of the
advice best-seller list (Deepak Chopra).
</P>
<P>
   Or they can join a roving-reading club guided personally by
Wayne W. Dyer, the author of self-help books like ``Your Erroneous
Zone,'' on an autumn trip to the Umbrian hills of Italy and the
mystical hometown of St. Francis of Assisi. On the 11-day, $3,947
tour of Italy and France, Dyer pledges to share his ``insights and
experiences of some of what life has taught me'' and an intimate
Yom Kippur dinner in the unlikely village of Lourdes, with its
Roman Catholic shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally avoid tours like the plague,'' said John McShane,
a Dallas lawyer and loyal reader of Dyer's books. Yet McShane is
poised to join the coming European trip after savoring an excursion
with Dyer to Peru's Machu Picchu in May and an earlier backpacking
safari in Tanzania with Richard J. Leider, the self-development
author.
</P>
<P>
   For McShane, these intellectual flights to far-off places are
the only chance to ``get to know your favorite author as a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Such curiosity is drawing travelers to locations they had no
intention of visiting. It's their opportunity to join an instant
book tour and to observe the mettle of literary heroes as they deal
with missing buses, lost tickets or a spontaneous decision by
fellow travelers to marry on the Nile.
</P>
<P>
   The list of writers who are turning tours into reading vacations
is dominated by self-help authors like Chopra and writers with a
spiritual bent like Neale Donald Walsch, the author of
``Conversations With God,'' who in June took readers on an
eight-day tour of Peru timed to coincide with the summer solstice
sunrise over Machu Picchu. But there are also published historians
and even a poet who are leading people on tours ripped from their
chapters, whether it be a stroll down Shankill Road in Belfast,
where violence erupted this summer among Protestant paramilitary
groups, a trip to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia or a moonlit
meeting at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Authors have long trolled for readers on luxury cruises,
delivering lectures and then moving on. But these tours are far
more physically and mentally demanding, with authors expected to
offer daily workshops and to play the role of host, one as genial
as Fantasy Island's Roarke.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Chopra, the best-selling sage of alternative
medicine, is taking about 350 of his readers on the road in two
separate tours, to Israel and his native India. He will lead
travelers on a pilgrimage that includes a de rigueur stop at the
Taj Mahal along with less standard perks like yoga sessions and
daily primordial sound meditation with Chopra himself.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which is featured on the author's Web site,
www.chopra.com, also promises the possibility that participants
will meet the Dalai Lama (``subject to his holiness' schedule'').
The reading requirement for the trip is, naturally, Chopra's latest
title, ``How to Know God: The Soul's Journey Into the Mystery of
Mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Chopra said he started leading tours to places like Egypt, Bali
and India about six years ago. Typically his trips are a mix of
tourism and daily workshops on spiritual themes. Most of his trips
have been organized by travel operators, but his latest tour to
India is organized by the author's California-based Chopra Center
for Well Being.
</P>
<P>
   The transcontinental book tours do sap ``a lot of energy,''
Chopra said. ``But it gives me a lot of fulfillment to take people
to places where wisdom traditions were, in a sense, born. Last year
I took a group of people to Egypt, and we sailed along the Nile for
a week. I was able to explain to my readers the sources of my
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these tours are organized by a handful of travel
operators like Visions Travel in Los Angeles, Power Places in St.
Croix and Cross Cultural Journeys in Sausalito, Calif. Visions
Travel started its literary matchmaking service early in 1979, but
initially it could attract only lesser-known authors, said Abbas
Nadim, the company's founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a shift in the last five years, with more
mainstream authors who are interested in doing this,'' said Nadim,
who is constantly trolling for authors to join tours. ``It's no
longer New Age per se _ the crystal and UFO authors. Before, our
clients used to be mostly middle-aged divorcees, 90 percent of them
women. But now, with a new breed of authors like Deepak Chopra and
Marianne Williamson, we're getting more professionals and
couples.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the authors strike individually tailored deals with
travel operators, charging a fee for participating or taking a
percentage of the profits plus, in some cases, free accommodations
for themselves and family members, Nadim said. Certain writers also
place restrictions on the number of fellow travelers, to as low as
15, but others are willing to lead tours with as many as 400.
</P>
<P>
   Such crowds can be a little disconcerting for some authors,
although the large group is divided into subsets. Walsch, a former
radio personality who has had a string of best sellers with his
``Conversations With God'' series, said he had participated in his
first tour in June at the invitation of Power Places with 150
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to lead a retreat in Bali next May, but he said
that in the future he would probably limit his participation in
tours. ``It feels like it's the only one I will do; I wouldn't want
to do more than one a year,'' Walsch said. ``I want people to come
see me for $20 a lecture rather than $3,000 for a tour. It's kind
of a high-end activity, and I realized after I finished the
experience that it was lovely, but only for those readers who can
afford it, and that's a small percentage of my readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tours are purposely kept small. Frank Costello, the author
of three books on Irish history and a former press secretary to Ray
Flynn, the former Boston mayor, is currently helping to lead a tour
of Northern Ireland with 15 travelers who range in age from their
late 20s to early 70s and include a teacher, a judge, an investment
banker and a lawyer. The theme of the trip is the exploration of
the political divide in Northern Ireland. The seven-day tour has
taken the group on a stroll of Shankill Road with helicopters
hovering overhead, as well as to a lunch in Derry with John Hume, a
winner of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to broker a
solution in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is a work in progress,'' said Costello, who is
involved in a tour for the first time. ``It will give me future
ideas for writing, and it's prompting other topics I can write
about.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If I have to describe what it's like for me, I'm
quite tired. It is a performance that requires stamina and the
focus of a lot of people asking questions and asking them sometimes
twice. It makes you a better listener because you've got to stay
ahead of the game.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Leider, the author of books like ``Repacking Your
Bags'' and ``The Power of Purpose,'' said he was reinvigorated by
his 23-day trips into the Tanzanian bush, where his dozen readers
can reflect on their lives amid the rhythms of African life,
hunting game with local tribes or digging for tubers.
</P>
<P>
   The friendships that develop between like-minded readers are
almost as critical to the trip as an author's participation.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Zacher, 39, a massage therapist from Venice, Calif., had no
desire to travel to Egypt but bought a ticket to join a tour of
more than 400 people led by Caroline Myss, author of self-help
books like ``Why People Don't Heal and How They Can'' and ``Anatomy
of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went by myself because I had a friend who had to cancel,''
said Zacher, who will follow the same author to Ireland this month.
``I didn't want to go alone, but it turned out to be an incredible
experience for me. I was thrilled because it really brought me into
the group. I made a couple of lifelong friends on the journey.'' It
was on that trip that two of Zacher's fellow travelers
spontaneously decided to marry on a boat in the Nile.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the travelers sign up for more trips. Visions Travel
estimates that as many 70 percent of its clients return for other
book tours.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Kennedy, a time-share saleswoman in Brigantine Island,
N.J., has joined her favorite author, Marianne Williamson, on four
trips _ to Egypt, Bali, Alaska and Greece _ and has plans to take
part in the author's ``Rebirth of a Nation'' tour of Williamsburg,
Va., and Washington in late October. That tour will also feature
the writer and historian R.B. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done the other kind of package tours that are like 20
different countries in 32 hours,'' Kennedy said. ``But they're not
memorable because there's no connection with the others. You tend
to be an individual, whereas with Marianne everybody knows everyone
in three days and it becomes a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Curtan, 59, is a veteran of three Myss tours. But Curtan, a
retired personal manager from Los Angeles, confessed that he wasn't
comfortable with some spiritual seekers drawn by the author's
message of healing. ``I come from eight years of Jesuit education,
and I'm not much into that stuff,'' he said. ``Caroline attracts
her share of the New Age seekers. I just don't hang out with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtan has signed up for Myss' tour of Ireland even though he
only recently recovered from breaking an ankle on a hiking trip
during his last tour with her, in May, to Machu Picchu. He said he
would like to take more book tours because of the chance to be
``stimulated intellectually, spiritually, to have good
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like giving my spirit a real workout,'' he said. But
there's no ticket for his true desire.
</P>
<P>
   An avid fan of Harry Potter novels, Curtan said that what he
really yearned for was a magical tour: joining the young wizard's
creator, the author J.K. Rowling, for a disappearance at platform
9} for a scenic ride on the scarlet steam engine of the Hogwarts
Express.

LAPTOPS AREN'T BLACKHOLES _ YET _ BUT THE ULTIMATE ONE MAY BE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the corporate enthusiasm over the unveiling of each new
generation of computer chip (last month Intel announced that its
Pentium 4 would be packed with 42 million transistors performing as
many as 8.4 billion operations per second), consumers may be more
apt to feel a sense of dread. Once again the expensive desktop
computers and laptops they were so proud of have become outmoded,
destined to join the scrap piles of unsalable equipment
accumulating in closets everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's law, which holds that computing power doubles
approximately every 18 months, therefore sometimes seems less a
blessing than a curse. But the law cannot hold forever, and Seth
Lloyd, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offers hope that the end is
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper in the current issue of Nature, Lloyd describes the
ultimate laptop _ a computer as powerful as the laws of physics
would allow. So energetic is this imaginary machine that using it
would be like harnessing a thermonuclear reaction. In the most
extreme version of this computer supreme, so much computational
circuitry would be packed into so small a space that the whole
thing would collapse from its own gravity forming a tiny black
hole, an object so dense that not even light can escape its
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a rather dangerous device to hold on one's
lap _ ``Opening the lid,'' Lloyd warns, ``voids the warranty'' _
there is a serious purpose to his theoretical tour de force: to
plumb the absolute limits nature sets on computation.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like Lloyd's Ultimate Laptop is likely to ever roll off
the assembly line at some future Apple or IBM. But his effort, part
of a relatively new discipline called the physics of information,
gives computer engineers an ideal to aim for. More importantly,
this exercise in extreme computer science may help deepen the
understanding of the connections between physics and information,
and explore the notion, popular among many theorists, that the very
processes of nature can be thought of as computations.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law, named for its formulator Gordon Moore, a founder of
Intel, has continued to hold true because of the dexterity with
which engineers have been able to inscribe smaller and smaller
circuitry onto silicon computer chips. As the components of the
circuits are squeezed closer and closer together, they can exchange
information at increasingly faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been predicting the demise of Moore's law pretty
much since it was posited in the early '60s because some
manufacturing technology was about to run out,'' Lloyd said. ``But
Moore's law is a law of human ingenuity rather than of nature.
Predictions of its demise have been wrong because people are
ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, engineers have continued to find ways to make the
circuits smaller and faster.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishingly tiny components on a chip can be thought of as
switches that can be in two positions, either on or off _
representing a bit of information, 1 or 0. Minuscule as they seem,
each of these devices is typically made of about a billion atoms.
But laboratories are already experimenting with computers in which
a bit is stored by a single atom that can spin clockwise or
counterclockwise, indicating a 1 or a 0. And who is to say that the
grain could not someday be even finer with subatomic particles like
quarks or gluons or even the hypothetical superstrings harnessed to
encode and manipulate information?
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the limits of nature must prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believe the laws of physics,'' Lloyd said, ``then the
fundamental constants of nature should tell us where Moore's law
absolutely has to end, where we can't miniaturize any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd approached the problem like a consumer in the market for a
new laptop. ``If you're going out to buy a computer,'' he said,
``you have two basic questions: how fast is it and how much memory
space does it have?'' Those are the ingredients of computing power.
He assumed that his laptop would have about the same dimensions as
a contemporary one, weighing a kilogram, 2.2 pounds, and occupying
1 liter of space.
</P>
<P>
   First he set out to determine how fast his ultimate laptop could
compute. The limiting factor here is energy: the faster a computer
runs, the more voracious its appetite. So what would be the maximum
possible energy available to a portable machine?
</P>
<P>
   One could speculate endlessly on the future of battery
technology. Seeking a more fundamental answer, Lloyd looked to
Einstein's special theory of relativity. If every particle of the
laptop's kilogram of mass is converted into energy according to the
equation E(EQ)mc2 , the answer is 8.9874 x 1016 joules _ or in more
familiar terms, 25 million megawatt-hours, the amount of energy
produced by all the world's nuclear power plants in 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine would be cannibalizing its own mass to perform its
operations,'' Lloyd mused. No engineer from Eveready or Duracell
could ever squeeze more juice from a chunk of matter.
</P>
<P>
   There would be obvious practical considerations to controlling
(and computing with) what would amount to thermonuclear fusion.
(Lloyd speculated that the computer's ``circuitry'' might consist
of electrons and antimatter positrons, signaling each other with
gamma rays.) But the details are unimportant. Ultimate computer
science is not about what is probable but what is possible. The
rest can be left to the engineers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to determine the maximum speed one can get
from all that energy _ how rapidly the little switches can be
flipped between 1 and 0, carrying out their calculations. Here
Lloyd turned to quantum mechanics, the quirky rules that govern the
behavior of subatomic particles _ specifically, Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle, which shows how time is related to energy.
One multiplies pi by the number called Planck's constant and
divides by twice the available energy. Applied to the ultimate
laptop, the answer is 5.4258 x 1050 operations per second _ about
10,000 trillion trillion trillion times speedier than the Pentium
4. A computer that fast could never be obsolete _ not in this
universe, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   These limits would hold true no matter what kind of
technological breakthroughs lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether you're computing with vacuum tubes
or transistors or using quarks and gluons or something even more
exotic like superstrings,'' Lloyd said. Relativity and quantum
mechanics promise that is as fast as the ultimate laptop can be.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it matter how the computer is designed. The energy can
be used to power one extremely fast processor or many slower ones.
Either way, the maximum possible number of operations per second is
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he had put an upper limit on speed, Lloyd wanted to see
how big he could make the machine's memory _ how many bits of
information could be stored and manipulated at those blazing
speeds. Every atom or even every electron could be used to register
a 1 or a 0, depending on which way it was spinning. But to store
the maximum amount of information, the little processors would have
to be free to assume as many different states as possible. At
intense energies, information might be encoded not just by the spin
of a particle but also by the speed and direction in which it was
moving inside the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to take full advantage of the memory space available,
the ultimate laptop must turn all its matter into energy,'' Lloyd
explained. ``A typical state of the ultimate laptop's memory looks
like a thermonuclear explosion or a little piece of the Big Bang!
Clearly, packaging issues alone make it unlikely that this limit
can be obtained, even setting aside the difficulties of stability
and control.''
</P>
<P>
   An object like this, so packed with energy that its particles
are as free as they can possibly be, is said to be in a state of
maximum entropy. Though more commonly thought of as a measure of
disorder _ a vaporized laptop being less orderly than one at room
temperature _ entropy can also be used to calculate the amount of
information something can hold. (The orderly atoms in a crystal can
occupy fewer possible states and hold less information than the
swarming atoms in a gas.)
</P>
<P>
   For the ultimate laptop, the maximum entropy corresponds to an
information capacity of about 2.13 x 1031 bits _ a billion trillion
times more than today's laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving so vast a memory might not be as unrealistic as it
sounds. In a kilogram of matter there are approximately 1,025
atomic nuclei, each of which could store a bit without vaporizing
the entire mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can get quite close to the ultimate physical limit of
memory without having to resort to thermonuclear explosions,''
Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Until this point, Lloyd had been constraining himself to a
laptop with a volume of one liter. By imagining it even smaller, he
knew, he could pack the kilogram of particle-size components even
tighter, speeding up the information flow and shortening the time
it takes to do long, step-by-step calculations. He would be
sacrificing memory (there would be less room to store information)
for speed _ a common tradeoff in designing computers.
</P>
<P>
   So in the final act of his thought experiment, he programmed the
ultimate laptop to solve a formidable problem (cracking a secret
code or something like that) and imagined it shrinking and
shrinking _ to the size of a wallet, then a credit card, then a
postage stamp. Smaller and smaller until its radius is a mere
centimeter (10-2 meters), then a millionth of a meter (10-6 ), then
a billionth (10-9 ).
</P>
<P>
   When the laptop has shrunk to 10-27 meters (a billionth the size
of a proton), it crosses what is called the Schwarzschild radius:
So much mass is packed into so little space that the whole thing
collapses, sucking itself into a tiny black hole.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may be convinced that they already own a black hole
laptop, imploding at the worst possible moments and irretrievably
swallowing data. Owning the real thing would surely be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to some theories, however, information thrown down a
black hole does not disappear, but is displayed on the hole's
surface. Each pixel of this screen would occupy one square Planck
length, 10-35 by 10-35 square meters, the smallest area conceivable
by the laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   Some theorists, in fact, believe that the information about
everything that falls into any black hole is projected in this
manner _ that each one of these sink holes is, in a sense,
processing information. Taking the vision even further, some
imagine all the particles in the universe trading bits of data as
readily as they trade energy _ the universe as a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the long-term consequence of this work is
not building a black hole computer, which would be a dangerous
thing to do,'' Lloyd said, ``but seeing whether we can understand
how nature itself processes information.''

HINTS OF ALZHEIMER'S FOUND IN THE NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio, Mass.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent months, researchers have pointed to possible signals
of Alzheimer's disease that could allow doctors to detect the
ailment before symptoms start. They have spoken of small areas of
the brain that appear to shrink, and psychological tests that yield
subtle clues.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists think they may have found another clue: smell.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in this month's American Journal of Psychiatry,
researchers say that problems identifying aromas may indicate early
Alzheimer's, but only when the patients do not realize that
something is amiss with the sense of smell. A sense of smell often
declines with age.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. D.P. Devanand, who practices at the New York State
Psychiatric Institute and teaches at Columbia, based the theory on
a study of 90 patients who were suffering memory problems or
cognitive impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers kept track of 77 of the patients for about two years
and found that 19 ended up with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The patients were given a multiple-choice test in which they
were exposed to 40 smells, among them peanuts and menthol, and
asked to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the results, Devanand observed that while a poor
sense of smell was not a predictor for Alzheimer's, patients who
did badly on the test, but said they had no problems with their
sense of smell, appeared more likely to develop the disease.
</P>
<P>
   CHILDBIRTH: New Guidelines for Reducing Caesareans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the rate of Caesarean sections on the rise, a leading group
of obstetricians has issued guidelines that may reduce the number
of operations.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention announced that, for the third year in a row, surgically
assisted deliveries were up, after a period of decline that began
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3.9 million births in this country in 1999, 22 percent
were Caesarean, the study found. That represented a 17 percent
decline in vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The study prompted a series of recommendations by the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The group cautioned
that simply comparing Caesarean rates from hospital to hospital was
unwise, because some hospitals have a higher concentration of
at-risk women more likely to require the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But the group said there were steps hospitals could take to
reduce the number of such operations. Among them: improved training
for residents and postresidents in how to assist vaginal delivery
with tools like forceps and vacuum devices.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the group said, hospital management decisions may
affect the Caesarean rates. Increasing the presence of nurses and
other employees who support women in labor can also increase the
number of natural deliveries, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   OUTCOMES: For Exercise, Every Minute Counts
</P>
<P>
   People who want to start exercise programs but feel they don't
have enough time or energy to begin should think again.
</P>
<P>
   A new study suggests that physical activity that lasts just 15
minutes, if done often enough, may be as beneficial as longer
workouts. The report appeared last week in Circulation: Journal of
the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount of time spent exercising, not the length of
each session, appears to be most important, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   They said they hoped their findings would encourage out-of-shape
people daunted at the prospect of one-hour or even half-hour
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on surveys taken in 1988 and 1993 of
more than 7,000 men with an average age of 66. The men were asked
to give their medical histories and to describe their exercise
routines.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys suggested that those who worked out in short
sessions had the same heart-disease risk as those who worked out
longer, as long as the same amount of energy was expended in the
short sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In a second study published in Circulation, researchers found
that people who reported engaging in more intense forms of physical
activity had a lower risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   People who reported walking three or more miles per week,
considered moderate, had a 10 percent reduction in risk, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who engaged in activities like jogging, tennis,
swimming or aerobics showed decreases in risk of as much as 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The studies involved participants in the Harvard Alumni Study.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPTOMS: Sick in the Head, and in the Stomach
</P>
<P>
   Feeling sick to one's stomach may have more to do with the brain
than the stomach. Researchers at Ohio State University say in a new
study that they may have uncovered the reason that, often, people
feel nauseated, even though what ails them has nothing to do with
their digestive tracts.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit may be a brain chemical called tumor necrosis
factor, or TNF, which the immune system releases at the first sign
that the body is coming under attack. The factor acts on a part of
the brain stem that regulates the digestive tract, including
vomiting, said the study published in The American Journal of
Physiology: Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably the mechanism evolved to protect us from
eating fairly nasty things,'' said Dr. Richard C. Rogers, a
neuroscientist at the university, who wrote the paper with his
wife, Gerlinda Hermann, a research scientist.
</P>
<P>
   While that trait is useful for illnesses caused by poor food, it
is unclear how, if at all, it affects people suffering from other
ailments that commonly cause nausea, like chronic arthritis, AIDS
and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: Fighting Off Fevers, Aggressively
</P>
<P>
   Real men don't get colds.
</P>
<P>
   Or they should be less susceptible to them, anyway, because a
new study finds that tough guys seem to have tougher immune
systems, the body's natural defense for fighting off infections,
viruses and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and the
University of Nebraska have found that moderately aggressive men
had higher levels of two types of lymphocytes that help control the
immune response.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published in a recent issue of Psychosomatic
Medicine, were based on a study of 4,415 men ages 30 to 48.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers asked the men a series of questions to determine
how aggressive they were. The men were asked about actions as
diverse as skipping school and fighting with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the men who were more aggressive were found to have
stronger immune systems, highly aggressive men appeared to lose the
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   There are several possible explanations. Historically, man in
the wild fared best by being aggressive in finding food and
protecting his family. But those behaviors, the researchers said,
risked injury _ and infection. Perhaps in response, stronger immune
systems evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas A. Granger, an author of the paper who teaches
biobehavioral health at Penn State, said the researchers' data was
limited to men, but he noted that, in general, women appeared to
have stronger immune systems than men.

   FLIGHT-DELAYS (Undated) _ Labor Day marked the end of the second
consecutive summer of chronic flight delays and cancellations
across the United States. Yet despite the expenditure of billions _
and repeated warnings over the past decade that the air traffic
system was approaching gridlock _ there is still no relief in sight
for frustrated flyers. Indeed, most experts now believe that
delays, which have risen nearly 50 percent in the last five years,
will get worse, not better. The Federal Aviation Administration,
which runs the air traffic system, predicts that by 2010 the number
of airline passengers will rise 59 percent, to 1 billion. About 70
percent of that increase will occur at the country's 28 largest
airports. A special report by Laurence Zuckerman and Matthew L.

<P>
   After a decade of mapping brains in tasks like recalling
numbers, perceiving facial expressions and using verbs,
neuroscientists have recently homed in on a much more controversial
subject: the act of categorizing other human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In recently published papers, two separate teams of brain
scanners joined by social psychologists describe how one particular
part of the brain becomes more active when people look at members
of a different race.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists involved in both studies emphasize that the work does
not mean racial differences are more scientifically real than, say,
ghosts or leprechauns _ both of which would also produce measurable
effects in the brains of people who were scared of them. Nor are
the scientists surprised that looking at people from a different
race causes changes in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything causes changes in the brain,'' said Elizabeth
Phelps, a neuroscientist at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   But the two papers are the first published efforts to map
exactly what happens in the brain when it perceives a racial
difference. It is the first time neuroscientists have published
papers on the kinds of messy questions many prefer to leave to
social psychologists and sociologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really stands out in this work is the union of social
psychology, neuroimaging and psychiatry,'' said Allen Hart, a
social psychologist at Amherst College who worked on one of the
studies, which appeared in the Aug. 3 edition of the journal
NeuroReport. ``Social psychologists have been heading toward the
study of emotions and group perception, and the imagers have been
heading towards mapping emotion. And now we've met.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams _ Hart and his colleagues, who used a magnetic
resonance imaging scanner at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston, and a Yale-NYU collaboration _ focused on the amygdala, a
well-studied cluster of nerves that lies deep inside each brain
hemisphere. Because of its involvement in strong emotions, memory
and learning rules, the amygdala is a promising target for research
on how perceptions of race could affect the brain, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Work on animals and people suggests the amygdala behaves like a
spotlight, calling attention to matters that are new, exciting and
important to know more about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning area,'' said Paul Whalen, a neurobiologist at
the University of Wisconsin who was the amygdala expert on the
Massachusetts General study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really seems to be about noticing,'' said Phelps, a
co-author of the Yale-NYU paper. ``It's involved in grasping that
something is emotionally significant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts General experiment, scientists placed four
men (two who described themselves as black and two who said they
were white) and four women (divided the same way by race) in an MRI
scanner. As they lay in the tunnel, with the machine banging and
clanging as its powerful magnets shifted alignment, the subjects
saw photographs of black and white faces flash by.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI device feeds magnetic signals into a computer, which
turns them into an image in which the parts of the brain with
concentrations of glucose and oxygen _ the fuel of brain-cell
activity _ are ``lit up.'' The earliest scans in the Massachusetts
General experiment showed the subjects had nearly equal amounts of
amygdala activity no matter whose pictures were flashed.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising, Whalen said, because in a novel setting
``the amygdala fires to everything at first.'' But after a short
time had passed, one set of pictures elicited more firing up than
the other. White subjects showed lower amounts of amygdala activity
when they looked at white faces; blacks showed less amygdala
activity when they looked at blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the authors noted, did not look at other areas of the
brain (the amygdala is branched into many other regions). Nor did
it link amygdala activity to any particular behavior or prejudice.
Indeed, after the tests, the subjects said they felt no strong
emotions about the photographs, one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The other study, being published Tuesday in The Journal of
Cognitive Neuroscience, tried to address this by relating amygdala
activity to particular states of mind. Conceived by Phelps and
Mahzarin Banaji, a social psychologist at Yale, this experiment
used only white subjects. They found that those whose amygdalas
fired up most at the sight of blacks were those who scored higher
on two other measures of unconscious feelings about blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 subjects in the Yale scanner saw pictures of young men of
both races. Days later, the researchers gave the subjects two other
tests to measure their unconscious responses to blacks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In one, the subjects sat at computers and classified the
photographs by race at the same time as they classified words
flashing on the screen as either ``good'' or ``bad.''
</P>
<P>
   When they take this ``implicit association test,'' Banaji said,
many Americans (most whites and half of blacks) are measurably
quicker to associate positive words like joy, love and peace with
whites and negative words like cancer, bomb and devil with blacks.
The responses are outside conscious control, Banaji said. People
whose conscious political positions are egalitarian and antiracist
are often upset to find that they, too, were quicker to be positive
about whites and negative about blacks.
</P>
<P>
   True to Banaji's expectations, she said, most subjects in this
study showed a preference for white faces over black. And those who
showed the most unconscious preference were those whose amygdalas
showed the most activity when they looked at black faces.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale-NYU team also showed the photographs again to the
subjects while electrodes measured how strongly the muscles around
their eyes were preparing to blink. Unconsciously preparing to
blink is a response to something alarming, and the amygdala is
clearly on the circuit of brain areas that creates the response,
Phelps explained.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing a subject's level of amygdala activity at the sight of
black faces, the team's paper says, also allowed them to predict
how he would score on the startle measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see the amygdala effect in everybody, but when we
did see it we found we could make the prediction,'' Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second experiment, the NYU-Yale group showed a new batch of
subjects a set of famous faces _ including Joe Namath, Tom Cruise,
Denzel Washington and Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought perhaps familiarity with a person would remove the
effect,'' Phelps said. And, in fact, with famous faces, the racial
difference in amygdala reactions disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it could also be an effect of fame, rather than
just that these faces were familiar,'' Phelps said. ``We don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, authors of both papers emphasize that there is a lot
they do not know. Neuroimagers do not map the whole brain any more
than tourists on a tight schedule would visit every block in
Manhattan. The scientists concentrate on one landmark at a time,
which leaves open many questions about what is happening in the
other parts of the brain to which the amygdala has connecting
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the uncertainty, neuroscientists interviewed about the
two papers were uncomfortable with issues like stereotype,
prejudice and identity. But they believed that those issues were
relevant to their field. The reason, several said, is that there is
no such thing as ``the brain.'' Each brain is different, having
been shaped by its environment.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of a person's environment is other people. So one
of the most important ways that a brain is shaped is by
experiencing how other brains judge its owner. That deserves more
attention than it has gotten, several researchers said. For
example, the NeuroReport paper notes that brain scanners have
generally used photos of white faces when they studied how ``the
brain'' reacts to ``the face.'' If blacks respond differently to
white faces than do whites, that fact will have to be taken into
account, the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent work, ``we in neuroimaging have attempted to
minimize the differences among people,'' said John Gabrieli, a
brain researcher at Stanford. ``We have people do things like
memorize nonsense words, as if we could somehow get at pure
thought, unmediated by the environment. It's not clear to me why
we've had many studies of things like short-term memory for numbers
before we had even one on the social influence of brain function.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many questions, the scientists hesitate to speculate
about what the amygdala work means. Among the theories, there is
``bottom up'' _ the amygdala, always seeking important information,
notices a racial difference and that perception then goes into the
conscious thoughts. But there is also ``top down'' _ racial
thinking, picked up from other people, teaches the amygdala that
race is important to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Very likely, Whalen says, the best explanation will have a bit
of both top and bottom in it. It could be that the mind is tuned to
racial difference in a way it is not to others, he speculated. At
the same time, he said, ``learning trumps everything else'' in the
life of the brain. For example, he expects that the amygdala of a
black person raised among whites would ``scan'' like that of a
white person. ``It's not the color of the skin of the person in the
magnet,'' he said. ``It's what color the eyes are used to seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their unease about venturing into what one journal
recently dubbed ``social neuroscience,'' none of the researchers
doubts that the work will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it's preliminary and impossible to interpret at
this point,'' Whalen said of the studies. ``But that doesn't make
the answers any less interesting.''

` MARCEL PROUST ' :   A LIFE TRANSFORMED, MARCEL'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcel Proust never cared much for the art of biography. ``A
book,'' he wrote, ``is the product of a different self from the one
we manifest in our habits, our social life and our vices.'' In his
own case, certainly, there was a ludicrous gap between his life and
art. A sycophantic snob and posturing dandy, he frittered away his
youth _ and his father's money _ trying to ingratiate himself with
the idle rich; in his masterpiece, ``Remembrance of Things Past,''
he would transform those frivolous experiences into a luminous
meditation on the nature of time and memory and loss.
</P>
<P>
   In his tedious new study of Proust, Jean-Yves Tadie _ the editor
of the Pleiade edition of ``Remembrance of Things Past'' _ seems to
share his subject's suspicion of biography. He whines that the
adult Proust never revealed his inner life in his correspondence,
and makes the odd complaint that George Painter, the author of the
best-known biography of the writer to date, succumbed ``without any
qualms'' to the temptation ``to draw from the novel in order to
explain, or understand, the life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tadie's own biography, it turns out to be quite devoid of
any compelling insight into Proust's character or work. Tadie
writes that he has tried ``to depict the individual in so far as he
is a type: the child of a middle-class family, a pupil at the Lycee
Condorcet, a student at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques, an
asthmatic, a `young poet' who wrote more letters than he received,
a person who took the waters at seaside resorts.'' In doing so, he
adds, he has tried to avoid ``the tedium of anecdotes that are too
specific'' _ a decidedly bizarre approach for any biographer, never
mind one writing the life of an author whose entire work was
grounded in a specificity of social and psychological detail.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tadie has done a persuasive job of explicating the
intellectual influences on Proust's work _ from Balzac and Zola
through Ruskin, Wagner and Carlyle _ he has failed in this volume
to give the reader an appreciation of ``Remembrance of Things
Past'' or the workings of the novelist's imagination. ``Marcel
Proust,'' which has been clumsily translated from the French by
Euan Cameron, lacks the eloquence and evocative power of Painter's
two-volume biography (originally published in 1959 and 1965) and
even pales next to William C. Carter's plodding biography (``Marcel
Proust,'' Yale University Press), published earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The author's claim that ``nowhere in this lengthy book will you
come across a single insignificant fact'' is credible only if you
think of this volume as a kind of doctoral thesis on the
step-by-step evolution of ``Remembrance of Things Past'' _ that is,
a blow by blow by blow account of how the novel developed from one
draft to another; how friends, acquaintances, trips and
observations were gradually worked into the ever-expanding
manuscript. Tadie assumes that the reader not only is familiar with
every aspect of the 3,000-page ``Remembrance of Things Past'' but
also possesses a working knowledge of such earlier works as ``Jean
Santeuil'' and ``Contre Sainte-Beuve.'' He does nothing to convey
the power _ or weaknesses _ of Proust's books; nor does he
illuminate the author's compulsive need to translate his
experiences into words.
</P>
<P>
   As for his observations on Proust's emotional life, they tend to
fall into two categories. Bland generalization: ``like all
parents,'' Tadie observes, ``his own inspired in him love as well
as hatred, imitation and opposition, inspiration and the will to
destroy.'' And patronizing speculation: of the novelist's fear of
rats, he writes, ``Had Proust been psychoanalyzed, which he never
was, the psychoanalysts would no doubt furnish an explanation for
it, linking it to anality and masochism.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many earlier biographers who have emphasized the
role that Proust's obsessive relationship with his mother played in
shaping his sensibility, Tadie argues that it was his father, an
eminent physician, who was ``present throughout his work.'' He
notes that Proust adopted his father's medical outlook in defining
love as an illness or disease and that many of his descriptions
were couched in the language of symptoms and diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Tadie's other observations will be highly familiar to
readers of earlier biographies. Once again we hear about Proust's
efforts to insinuate himself into high society. Once again we hear
about his frustrating pursuit of young men, who withdrew from his
suffocating need for control (the most notable, perhaps, being the
mechanic Alfred Agostinelli, who became a primary inspiration for
the character Albertine). And once again we hear about his
asthmatic retreat into a cork-lined room from which he would emerge
with increasing infrequency.
</P>
<P>
   Like Painter, Tadie tries to show the real-life antecedents of
characters in ``Remembrance of Things Past'' and trace the genesis
of particular novelistic incidents. And like Ronald Hayman (the
author of a succinct one-volume life of Proust that appeared in
1990) he emphasizes the role that World War I had on the shape of
the novel: by forcing a delay in publication, it gave him time to
expand and elaborate his story, to create the famously layered
architectural edifice the book became.
</P>
<P>
   Painter and Hayman, however, said all this with considerably
more style and acuity in their respective books. In contrast,
Tadie's biography feels like a ponderous academic exercise _ an
exercise designed not for the reader's edification or pleasure but
to showcase the author's own erudition and prodigious capacity for
research.

NEON SURREALISM REQUIRED; CLOTHING OPTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Nev.)  By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACK ROCK DESERT, Nev. _ It was the middle of the night in the
middle of nowhere, and under a frigid Nevada sky about 75 men and
women wearing nothing but body paint and their own bravado were
cavorting on the barren lake bed here in temperatures that would
make your average coyote flinch.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the first _ and only _ performance of ``Phallus
of the Man and Yoni Gate,'' an electronic opera composed by Pepe
Ozan, dealing with the complex relationships between men and women
and of course the lost city of Atlantis. Besides the naked dancers,
the opera featured two abstract sculptures of genitals, a calypso
band and a narrator prone to lines like ``We now must consult the
Atlantian mystic.'' All of which left its standing-room-only crowd
_ there are no seats in the desert _ with a profound sense of awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it means,'' said one smiling spectator who
would not divulge his name. ``But it sure is different.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was the common refrain and attraction of many of
the 25,000 visitors who flooded this year's Burning Man festival,
the annual alternative-arts fair that has steadily become one of
the nation's foremost showcases for art of the obscure, the
outrageous and the just plain odd.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which ended on Monday after a weeklong run on this
arid strip of desert some 120 miles north of Reno, has an artistic
manifesto of ``radical self-expression.'' Visitors looking for
surreal sights were not likely to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The festival was founded in 1986 by Larry Harvey, a Bay Area
artist who built and cremated an 8-foot-tall effigy of a man on
Baker Beach in San Francisco. The annual ritual quickly evolved
into a popular summer festival for artists and hipsters, and, over
the years, Harvey's simple effigy has grown into a 40-foot wood and
neon extravaganza, burned to the cheers of thousands of rabid fans
on the Saturday before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering moved here in 1990 after crowds and fire worries
prompted organizers to seek more wide open spaces. As news of the
festival has spread, Burning Man has become a yearly pilgrimage for
thousands of performers and artists as well as Internet techies,
adventurous yuppies and other counterculture aficionados, many of
whom trek hundreds or even thousands of miles to attend. Flags from
Sweden, Israel, Italy and Ireland billowed over camps this year, as
did rainbow banners and pirate skulls.
</P>
<P>
   On a walk across the desert fairgrounds, called ``the playa,'' a
casual visitor might encounter anything from a school of neon fish
suspended by wire on the heads of a dozen bicyclists to a
50-foot-long mechanical dragon replete with fire-breathing skills
and a New Orleans brass band playing ``You Are My Sunshine'' inside
its metal gut. Turn the other way, and you may find yourself facing
a satyr, an angel or maybe just another naked person. (It's not
just opera anymore.)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere cars with complete cocktail lounges mounted on their
frames zipped across the desert plain and an RV outfitted with a
pair of 15-foot Tesla coils spit tendrils of lightning into the
air. There was even more traditional work like ``The Faces of
Man,'' by Dan Das Mann, with a series of three tall sculptures made
of wood, copper and grass. Turned toward the center of the camp,
the copper face also included a pair of burning eyes from which a
steady stream of burning fuel fell. And there were the spontaneous
entertainments, ranging from campfire conga sessions to heartfelt
post-Beat poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate in freedom and expression,'' said Darin
Greyerbiehl, a San Franciscan who was standing outside his campsite
watching some 300 topless women, all decorated with variously
colored swirls of the festival's ubiquitous body paint, ride by on
bicycles. ``You can either go look for it, or wait and it'll come
to you. Either way it's something you're not going to see anywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   One Burning Man volunteer who went by the name Swervegirl said:
``Gearheads, punks, freaks, geeks, hippies _ they all come here. It
is radically inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival's free-to-be-you-and-me attitude attracts a variety
of other pleasure seekers, namely middle-aged nudists and other
sexual adventurers. Not surprisingly it also draws many fans of
illegal psychedelic drugs like LSD and ecstasy. Officers from the
Bureau of Land Management, which shares jurisdiction over the land
where the festival is held with the local police, issued about
three dozen citations for drug use, said Jim Graham, a festival
spokesman. He said there were also a handful of arrests on drug
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Burning Man officials say their event is unique among
alternative events, pointing out its duration _ a week, not a night
_ and its emphasis on community. The age range of Burning Man
visitors also tends to be older, with about half falling between 25
and 35 and at least 10 percent older than 45. That range might be a
result of the festival's sometimes steep entrance fees _ this
year's latecomers paid $250 _ a price that Burning Man officials
say is justified by the cost of renting the land, fulfilling
federal environmental obligations and running the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, there are the daily challenges of the
desert, where temperatures can soar above 110 degrees by midday and
then plummet to near freezing at night. (Burning Man may be the
only festival in the world where the ticket stub reads, ``You
voluntarily assume the risk of serious injury or death by
attending.'')
</P>
<P>
   The weather during the weekend festivities included torrential
rains, a six-hour dust storm and overnight temperatures in the low
40s. About 1,000 people left on Friday after 50-mph winds ripped up
tent stakes and sent desert detritus flying. Several events were
postponed or canceled because of weather.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Being desert bound, Burning Man visitors also trade amenities
like indoor plumbing and running water for the less glamorous
trappings of propane stoves and overflowing Port-a-Potties. Ice and
water are at a premium. Dust-caked hair and mud-battered shoes are
the norm, as are dust masks when the wind kicks up billowing clouds
of white sand. Tents are packed side to side, and noise often
echoes through the night.
</P>
<P>
   Laid out on a giant circular grid stretching across 5 square
miles, the festival campgrounds, called Black Rock City, include a
24-hour cafe (latte: $3), an airstrip, a pair of daily newspapers,
a medical area and more than half a dozen ham radio stations. The
city is divided into streets and avenues, complete with street
signs. In the center of the circle is a large area devoted &UR;  &LR; to the
outdoor sculpture that is the festival's defining symbol, the
40-foot Burning Man.
</P>
<P>
   Those near the center of the circle are asked to establish
``theme camps,'' with attractions ranging from trampoline sports to
a yoga center devoted to Elvis. Many of these camps are elaborate,
with mini-nightclubs and lounges tucked into tents and outdoor
stages flowing from the fronts of trailers. Other theme camps
include steel towers, wooden pyramids or makeshift movie houses.
What results is a giant circular promenade dotting the desert night
with flashing lights and pounding music.
</P>
<P>
   As the mishmash of images might suggest, there is little stock
put in creating a cohesive message about the festival. Press
material for the festival, in fact, goes to lengths to say what
Burning Man is  &UR; not,  &LR; including ``a pagan event,'' ``a '90s
Woodstock'' or ``a hippie festival.'' Organizers prefer to call the
festival ``a populist phenomenon,'' ``a social experiment'' and
``an alternative to mass culture and consumer society.''

   On Saturday night, however, the only populist phenomenon at work
seemed to be pyromania. After ``the Burn,'' as the immolation of
the Burning Man is called, artists took turns torching their own
work, all to raucous cheers. Crowds roamed across the playa from
fire to fire, warming their hands against the flames and basking in
the satisfaction of another successful festival. In the distance
neon fish zipped and Tesla coils zapped, and primitive screams
filled the night. It was, in short, a scene to inspire big
thoughts.

SCIENTIST'S STUDY OF WANDERING ALBATROSSES MAY HELP THEIR
SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wandering albatross did not earn its name by just sitting
around. The seabirds, the largest in the world, spend more than 90
percent of their life over the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere,
and through banding and satellite tracking, they have been shown to
travel tens of thousands of miles in a breeding season foraging for
food.
</P>
<P>
   But wandering albatrosses breed only once every two years, and
much less has been known about where they spend their nonbreeding,
or ``sabbatical,'' year in the Southern Ocean, the great unbroken
ring of water south of Africa, Australia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a French researcher has started to fill in some of the gaps
in the wandering albatross' existence. The birds, he discovered, do
not quite live up to their name: they do not wander aimlessly
during their sabbatical year. Rather, each tends to fly to its own
part of the ocean, often thousands of miles from its nesting
ground, and stays there until it is time to breed once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``From band recovery, we knew a few things about where these
birds were going,'' said the researcher, Henri Weimerskirch, of the
French Institute for Polar Research and Technology in Beauvoir,
France. ``But we hadn't known what the birds were doing during the
whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Weimerskirch's work, reported in the journal Nature, is in the
preliminary stages, with data from only a few albatrosses collected
so far. But as more is learned about their travels, he said, more
might be done to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   For these days, wandering albatrosses often do not return from
their journeys. Instead, they become the incidental victims of
commercial fishers, including those for bluefin tuna and Antarctic
sea bass. The birds go after baited hooks on long lines as they are
played out by the fishing boats, and are dragged underwater to
their deaths as the lines sink.
</P>
<P>
   Mitigation measures, like weighting the lines so they sink more
quickly, have been practiced in some fisheries over the past
decade, but they have not been enough to protect the wandering
albatross or others of the roughly 20 albatross species in both the
northern and southern hemispheres.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering albatrosses have declined in all seven of their major
breeding grounds during the past several decades, to the point
where there are only about 15,000 pairs left (the birds mate for
life).
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Gales, a marine biologist with the Tasmanian Fish and
Wildlife Service in Hobart, Australia, and an expert on the effect
of long-lines fishing on seabirds, said that knowledge of where the
birds spend their nonbreeding year could eventually lead to
regulations that would close parts of the Southern Ocean to fishing
at certain times of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal would be to make the fishery ecologically
inert, with no bycatch problem,'' using various mitigation
techniques, Gales said.
</P>
<P>
   John Croxall, head of higher predator research with the British
Antarctic Survey, said Weimerskirch's work was a good start. The
goal would be to gather enough location data about the various
endangered albatross species, and then to overlay it with
information about fishing patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the options are to restrict location or timing or method
of fishing, or some combination of all three,'' Croxall said.
</P>
<P>
   What has limited data collection in the past is the relatively
large expense and, given the limitations of battery life, relative
unreliability, of satellite tracking over long periods.
Weimerskirch, with his colleague Rory Wilson, is the first to use a
simpler, less power-gobbling technology, to log the birds' latitude
and longitude. It is one that was previously used to track some
marine creatures, and borrows a bit from a navigational method used
by sea captains of old.
</P>
<P>
   A band around the bird's leg is fitted with a small
battery-powered device, less than one inch square and weighing
under an ounce, that includes a light sensor, a clock set to the
starting location and a memory chip for storing data. The device
records the time of dusk and dawn every day, and from that
calculates day length, which can be used to determine latitude (the
length of a given day varying with north-south location).
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the time of dusk and dawn to the time at the
starting point, the device can also log longitude, just as sea
explorers once tracked how far east or west they had traveled from
the prime meridian at Greenwich, England, by carrying a clock set
to Greenwich time and comparing it with the local time.
</P>
<P>
   While not as accurate as satellite tracking, the light-sensing
device is precise enough to show the region of the Southern Ocean
where the birds are spending their time. And, Weimerskirch said,
his data so far shows that during their off-year, males and females
go separate ways. The females head north, toward more tropical
latitudes, while the males go toward Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   For both sexes, the activity level is far lower than during the
breeding year, when the birds are constantly circling around their
nesting region. In the sabbatical year, with no need to gather food
for their families, they can ride the winds using their 10-foot
wingspan and expend less energy. And they are molting as well,
Weimerskirch noted, which makes flying difficult, adding more
incentive to take things easy.
</P>
<P>
   Just why the birds prefer one spot over others is not known. But
Weimerskirch speculated that they might be going to an area that
they know has food and where there is less competition. Since the
birds live 50 or 60 years, they have plenty of previous experience
to rely on.

WOODSTOCK ON THE VOLGA: PROTEST AGES INTO SINGALONG 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A sea of music fanatics and thrill-seekers drink and
sway blissfully to songs of peace and love in a muddy field. It
could be a Grateful Dead concert, or Woodstock just half a world
away. Call it Woodstock on the Volga.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, thousands of Russians make the journey to the
Grushinsky Festival, known as Grusha, held on a riverbank between
two cities, Samara and Tolyatti, Russia's auto industry center. The
festival celebrates bard music, a genre identified with the Soviet
cultural thaw of the 1960s and the subsequent growth and popularity
of allegorical songs as a creative and spiritual outlet. Today
conditions are different, but the songs of contemporary bard
musicians seem to serve a similarly comforting purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Various theories trace the origins of bard music to Soviet
prison camp songs, soldiers' ballads, prerevolutionary romances and
even the songs of the wandering minstrels of centuries ago. Some
bard songs even sound like American country music, but by any
measure, Russians are much more likely than the average American to
pick up a guitar and sing with their friends, all of whom have
dozens, sometimes hundreds of songs committed to memory. It is all
part of the seemingly infinite national capacity to recite verse.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of bard songs even sound like Deadheads when they talk
about what the music means to them. One of those soaking up the
vibes with his wife and two small sons at this year's festival was
Mikhail Ovcharenko, owner of a bodyguard service in Samara.
``People don't communicate with each other enough,'' Ovcharenko
said. ``We live in a big crowd. Here everyone is equal, everyone is
naked.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs always unite,'' he added. ``Everyone sings the same
song. Everyone is singing in the same harmony, in unison. Maybe
that's why there's such energy here. These songs are kind, they're
about love and family. Maybe it's a difficult time, maybe these are
cruder times, but here we're in concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovcharenko enjoyed music and vodka around a makeshift picnic
table built with friends who have been going to the festival for 20
years. Their leader, Valery Klyushkin, arrives two weeks in advance
to stake out their favorite spot. Every little tent city has its
own whimsical name, usually an inside joke, and its own traditions,
united by a repertory of the best-loved bard songs and other
musical favorites, like the Beatles. ``What we hear here lasts us
for the whole year,'' Klyushkin said.

   This summer's 20th anniversary of the death of Vladimir
Vysotsky, a beloved actor and bard, has produced a host of
television retrospectives and concerts in his memory. Vysotsky's
angry songs about the degradation of Soviet life, sung in his raspy
voice at private gatherings and passed around on hissing
reel-to-reel recordings, were the soundtrack to a thwarted
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life, a dumb thing,'' he sang of himself in one of his last
songs. Since his death from alcohol-induced heart failure,
Vysotsky's lyrics have all been published, a monument of him in a
Christlike pose has been put up in central Moscow, and he is
regarded as a kind of people's poet, quoted as often as Alexander
Pushkin and by a broader swath of people.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the enduring popularity of Vysotsky and other bards,
the genre has been declared dead as often as rock music has in the
United States. Critics charge that it has sold out to the
saccharine dictates of the market and been taken over by a
pseudocollective spirit that undermines the music. Some critics are
especially irritated by the fashion for singing bard songs in
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now bard singing is like fascism,'' said Alexander Marchenko,
a Moscow musician and composer who has created arrangements for
contemporary bards. ``It's a chamber genre meant to be sung in the
kitchen. Now they want to make it into a mass genre and say it's so
spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``Songs of Our Century,'' a two-part easy-listening
collection of classics performed by popular bards in chorus and
with instrumentals, has topped Spice Girl knockoffs on the Russian
pop charts and inspired knockoffs and pirated editions of its own.
Helped by word of mouth, the first recording sold nearly 100,000
cassettes and CDs a month when it was released in early 1999 _ a
figure unheard of in Russia's struggling, payola-plagued pop music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The bards behind ``Songs of Our Century'' call their work a
mission. ``In a time when the animal instinct rules, we must stand
against this,'' Sergei Nikitin told an audience of several thousand
at the start of a concert tour promoting part two of the
collection. ``I am absolutely certain these songs will live in the
21st century.''

</P>
<P>
   Galina Khomchik, a singer in the project who performs cover
versions of other bards, says that Russians today suffer from a
lack of honest friendship and love and that bard songs help
compensate for the lack of spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Such qualities, it seems, are in demand outside Russia as well.
The concert tour has gone to New York, Seattle and San Francisco,
where emigres nostalgic for the bard tradition have sung along to
their favorite songs. Even non-Russians in former Soviet republics
still sing to the bards, in Russian, underscoring that it is a
quintessentially Soviet genre. Bards from Russia also tour the
Baltic countries, and festivals are held in Ukraine and Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site www.bards.ru, based in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, has
the lyrics to 17,000 bard songs. In Moscow huge halls that do not
always sell out for pop stars are packed for the bards, and several
bard cafes serve blini and vodka to accompany live performances in
an intimate setting.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, in fact, bards are becoming professional
musicians who make a living performing. But hundreds of so-called
amateur song clubs around Russia remain centers of the bard
movement, which the Communist Party once tried to control.

   ``Our club was closed three times in Soviet times,'' said a
Smolensk bard, Alexander Makarenkov, who recalls having to get the
censor's approval for songs to be performed at festivals. In poorer
provincial cities like Smolensk, which is near the Belorussian
border, it is now lack of money that makes life hard for local
bards. As for the words, freedom of expression sometimes means they
have less of a message to convey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If before people sang in allegories, now we can speak
openly,'' said Sergei Pogorely, a bard from Karelia, a region
bordering Finland. ``Something has even been lost with this
possibility, just as literature has suffered.'' Bard songs suffered
less, he said, because they are one of the most democratic kinds of
Russian literature. And politics and pain are not completely absent
from today's lyrics. A song about the war in Chechnya took first
place at a bard festival in St. Petersburg this spring.

   Stas Stanyulevich, a wholesale dairy products distributor who
organizes a festival in a forest outside Moscow in the early
autumn, says that what used to be a way of escaping the authorities
has became a way to fill a void that money cannot satisfy. ``Before
it was dangerous to talk in the city; the authorities didn't allow
it,'' Stanyulevich said. ``So people came out into the woods, where
they could talk and sing freely. In the first years of reform,
there was such a rush to make money. Now people either have it or
they don't. If they don't, they realize they won't. If they do,
they want to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nouveau-riche Russians come out here with a car full of vodka.
Adventure travel has become very popular, the more extreme the
better. Now they want something for the soul.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The $42 million man lasted one game.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway was supposed to ignite a sagging offense, but the
new wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys suffered a season-ending
knee injury in Sunday's 41-14 loss to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the team's battered ego shifted to Galloway's torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee on Monday. He was
carted off the field late in the fourth quarter after planting the
foot in the AstroTurf during a downfield block.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have any serious tears,'' team owner Jerry Jones
said. ``He had a little bruising with the bone. He's obviously down
and very distressed about it. He basically told the doctor and me
there's no issue, as far as him rehabbing and coming back next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a ``mild''
concussion, and is listed as ``day-to-day'' for Sunday's game in
Arizona, Jones said. Aikman was dizzy and had headaches at a Dallas
hospital Sunday night, and he likely will not play Sunday against
Arizona if those symptoms continue today.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion was not as serious as the one he had in last
year's game in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, sacked only 19 times last year, was sacked four times in
the first half against Philadelphia. His day was over when Eagle
lineman Hugh Douglas dragged him to the turf with seven minutes
left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second time in Aikman's 12-year career that he
failed to complete a pass in a game. It was his ninth concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys replaced Galloway by activating Arkansas rookie
quarterback Clint Stoerner off the practice squad Monday. He will
be the No. 2 quarterback _ behind Randall Cunningham _ if Aikman
does not play in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, by the way, has a sprained right thumb and is
``questionable'' for the Cardinals game.
</P>
<P>
   As for Galloway, a major piece of the revamped offense leaves a
major void. He signed a seven-year, $42 million contract this year
and immediately was designated Aikman's chief receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, Wane McGarity or James McKnight will be moved to
the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's departure means Rocket Ismail is elevated to No. 1
receiver. He caught a career-high 80 passes last year, most of them
after longtime receiver Michael Irvin suffered a season-ending neck
injury in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo admitted being ``embarrassed'' about his head
coaching debut. The hardest part of the week will be getting the
players to forget the Philadelphia massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to do it is by finding out what we did wrong,
correct the mistakes, and go about our business,'' Campo said.
``We've got some good football players on this team and I expect
them to bounce back, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said offensive tackle Erik Williams will be fined an
undisclosed amount by the team for being thrown out of Sunday's
game. He was ejected after a flagrant penalty late in the fourth
period.

 &HT;    Call it arena (naming) football
 &HT;    By Tom Walker

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Big business in the U.S. is spelled s-p-o-r-t-s.
</P>
<P>
   The average price a corporation was willing to pay to attach its
name to a sports arena or stadium rose to $5.6 million per year in
1999 from $2.7 million just two years earlier, Business Week (Sept.
11) says.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades of this deal making has created the likes of Arco
Arena (Sacramento), 3Com Park (San Francisco), RCA Dome
(Indianapolis), Continental Airlines Arena (New Jersey) and
Phillips Arena (Atlanta), with other companies scrambling to put
their names on remaining stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are unimpressed, however. A recent survey showed that
the shares of one-third of the companies whose names adorn sports
facilities fell after the deals were made.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate issue, Forbes (Sept. 18) says the values of 31 pro
football teams range between $741 million for the Washington
Redskins to $305 million for the Arizona Cardinals. The problem for
team owners, says Forbes, is that ``with the rich prices
professional football teams command these days, owners often have
to do their own two-minute drill: quickly increase revenue and pay
down a lot of debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Forbes profiles James Kennedy, chairman and chief
executive officer of Cox Enterprises.

   ``The survivors of the bitter (correction) will be mean and lean
and able to take the entire Internet industry to ever-greater
heights,'' writes author Paul Erdman. But Erdman tells investors to
``beware of new IPOs of companies that do not promise to produce a
positive cash flow and profits within 18 months.''

   Can entrepreneurs with non-tech, non-Internet companies find
venture capital _ or VC, as it's called? Inc. (September) says yes.
In 1999 alone, more than $3 billion in venture capital funds were
invested in non-tech companies, and 7 percent of all companies in
which venture capitalists invested were non-tech.

   Hostage taking has become a lucrative business, and top
corporate executives are among the favorite targets, says The
Economist (Sept. 8). Kidnapping for ransom has risen 70 percent in
the last eight years. Most are in Latin America, but kidnappings
have risen sharply in former Soviet Union states and in Asia. The
way to reduce kidnapping is to show that it does not pay, the
magazine says. Ideally that means capturing and punishing the
kidnappers, but it may also mean making it illegal to pay a ransom,
as in Italy and some other countries.

BUSH ACCUSES GORE OF `WASHINGTON DOUBLESPEAK' ON DEBATES

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROMEO, Mich. _ Declaring ``it's time to elect people who say
what they mean,'' Gov. George W. Bush swept through two hotly
contested states Monday and derided Vice President Al Gore for
rejecting his proposal for three handpicked debates.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential campaign entered the critical period that
begins on Labor Day, Bush hammered at Gore's honesty and
credibility, tying him to some of the evasions of the Clinton
years. Before a pompom and placard waving crowd in the Chicago
suburbs, Bush reminded enthusiastic throngs of Gore's defense for
making fund-raising calls from his White House office in 1996: that
``no controlling legal authority'' barred such activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get rid of all those words like `no controlling
legal authority,''' Bush said, campaigning in shirt sleeves with
his running mate, Dick Cheney, at his side. ``We need plain-spoken
Americans in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after Bush rebuffed a schedule set up by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has sponsored debates
since 1988, and put forth a plan of his own, he recounted how Gore
had once said he would debate ``anytime, anywhere,'' and then
rejected Bush's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, the words about anytime, anywhere don't mean
anything,'' Bush said, calling Gore's rejection of his debate
proposal ``an interesting example of kind of the Washington
doublespeak.'' Bush repeated like a mantra, ``It's time to get some
plain-spoken folks in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The throngs gathered in a schoolyard in Naperville, Ill., began
chanting, ``No more Gore. No more Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``When we tell you something, we mean it. When we say
we're going to do something, we're going to do what we say. That's
what America hungers for. America wants leadership that lifts its
spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his aides flatly rejected Bush's proposal on Sunday,
saying the Republican nominee was trying to limit viewers, instead
of accepting the three 90-minute debates proposed by the
commission, which would be broadcast by all three major television
networks. Two of Bush's suggested hourlong appearances would be on
talk shows that rival networks have said they would not broadcast.
Bush did agree to one presidential debate sponsored by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rally on the grounds of the Naperville North High School
began a Labor Day swing that carried him through Illinois, Michigan
and Pennsylvania, all states that President Clinton carried four
years ago. Recent polls have shown Gore pulling ahead in all three.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush's rally, a spirited crowd hoisted placards like
``Hunters for Bush'' or ``Gore in Hand is Worth Half of a Bush.''
Bush then marched in a Labor Day parade that was led by fire trucks
and emergency vehicles with sirens wailing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he spoke at the peach festival here in Romeo, once again
needling Gore for refusing to debate ``anytime, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, that must depend on what the definition of `anytime'
is,'' Bush said, in an allusion to Clinton's evasive use of the
word ``is'' when questioned about his affair with a White House
intern. ``Or maybe that depends on what the definition of
`anywhere' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush was off to Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday he plans to give out more details of a prescription
drug plan while barnstorming across Pennsylvania. Karen Hughes,
Bush's communications director, said he was focusing on swing
voters and noted that Romeo was in Macomb County, the original home
of the so-called Reagan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again Monday, Bush tied his Democratic rival to
Washington and to big government. ``My opponent and the folks up in
Washington want to empower bureaucrats and make the health
decisions for America,'' he said. ``They want more power in
Washington. They want the planners and deciders, the folks that are
telling you how to think, in power.''
</P>
<P>
   He also contrasted the two men's approaches to tax cutting and
the federal surplus. ``We understand the surplus is not the
government's money,'' he said. ``The surplus is the people's
money.'' Bush has proposed a sweeping tax cut of $1.3 trillion
across 10 years while Gore has called for tax cuts of less than
half that and more spending on social programs like college
education and home health care.
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize his points, Bush held up four dollar bills as he
spoke, and ticked off how he would use a projected federal surplus
of about $4 trillion over a decade. Just two weeks ago, Bush
stumbled over his explanation as he made similar remarks. Monday,
too, he initially seemed uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would devote $2 trillion to Social Security and he
took away two dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Next he said that he would allot $1 trillion to ``making sure
that our defense is strong,'' even though he has called in the past
for roughly $45 billion of the surplus to go to the military over a
decade. But then after talking about defense for a few more
sentences he caught himself and said that the $1 trillion covered
both military and domestic priorities like education and a Medicare
prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bush got to his tax cut, he handed one of the dollars
to a man in the crowd. ``I want 1 trillion, roughly a quarter of
the surplus, to go back to the people that pay the bill,'' Bush
said. ``I want the working families to put their money in their
pockets.''

ISRAEL OPENS LOCAL TELEPHONE AND INTERNET SERVICE TO COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 By WILLIAM A. ORME JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government announced on Monday that it
was ending the state telephone company's monopoly on domestic
telephone and Internet service, taking a long-resisted deregulatory
move that sets the stage for the company's sale to private
investors later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bezeq, the state-owned telephone company, will now face
competition for the first time in Israel's local telephone and
high-speed Internet market, just months before the government plans
to divest its majority stake in the $5 billion enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Unionized telephone workers protested the decision with a
partial work stoppage, but the government vowed to proceed with
plans to grant telephone and data transmission licenses to new
wireless networks and long-established cable television operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is now completely open,'' Communications Minister
Benjamin Ben-Eliezer declared after signing a decree setting out
the new rules for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders for the new 15-year telecommunications licenses must be
at least 20 percent Israeli-owned and must provide service within a
year of approval, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
   The state monopoly on domestic telephone and Internet service
has come under intensifying criticism as a costly anomaly for a
country that is a spawning ground for digital telecommunications
technologies and that had long since opened its long-distance and
mobile phone service to fierce internal competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have high-speed Internet access, we don't have
cable modems, we don't have all these things we hear and read
about,'' said Katrin Lemter, a telecommunications industry analyst
at Bank Hapaolim in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over domestic telephone deregulation and the
privatization of Bezeq pits its powerful government-allied union
against the politically influential cable television operators,
whose regional monopolies have become the cash-rich keystones of
diversified media empires.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cable companies won this round, they cannot offer
phone service unless Parliament amends current telecommunications
laws _ a protracted process even if Prime Minister Ehud Barak
manages to keep his minority coalition in power to the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming there is a government, it could take several
months,'' Lemter said. ``If there is no government, it could take
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Before then, foreign telecommunications companies are expected
to enter the marketplace with new fixed-point wireless systems for
household telephone and high-speed Internet service. The government
said that within a month it expects to issue tenders for networks
using wireless local loop and multipoint distribution systems,
which both permit wireless phone service from fixed locations.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bezeq still hopes to be the first to offer a new
high-speed Internet connection to its customers, the government has
not yet decided whether this would give it an unfair advantage over
new entrants in the deregulated telecommunications market. Cable
television companies may also be authorized to provide high-speed
Internet service in the coming weeks, Ben-Eliezer said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bezeq has already weathered the loss of its long-distance
monopoly and is one of three competitors in Israel's cutthroat
cellular phone market. Analysts say its stock is undervalued
compared to European state phone companies with similar reach and
revenues, but still-unresolved regulatory issues make it difficult
to assess Bezeq's market value to foreign investors, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of a majority stake in Bezeq would represent the first
major privatization initiative by the Barak administration, which
inherited several stalled divestiture plans from the previous
government. Minority government holdings in commercial banks are
being gradually sold off through the stock market, but resistance
from unions and from within the prime minister's own party have
effectively halted plans for the deregulation and eventual
privatization of state-owned military companies and the national
power company.
</P>
<P>
   The Bezeq union has promised to fight privatization unless it is
satisfied with the new pension fund arrangements _ and unless Bezeq
gets a head start in the race to provide high-speed Internet
access. The union has wide support in the parliament's Finance
Committee, which must approve any privatization deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid that once the company's status changes, new
owners will come, as we have seen in previous instances, and will
try to change existing agreements,'' the head of the Bezeq workers'
union, Shlomo Kfir, said Monday. ``That's why we want to safeguard
the rights of employees and retired employees. Without that I don't
think that we'll agree to any measure -- neither competition nor
privatization.''

COURT EXPECTED TO DECIDE FATE OF JOINED TWINS ON TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ England's Court of Appeal heard a request on Monday to
decide whether doctors can proceed with an operation separating
joined twins that would sacrifice the life of one to save the
other. The infants' parents have objected to the plan, even though
doctors say both children will probably die if the surgery is not
performed.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that raises conflicting moral, religious and ethical
questions, the parents are seeking to overturn a decision by the
High Court on Aug. 25 that gave surgeons the go-ahead to separate
the girls. The appeals court is widely expected to make its
decision on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie and Mary, false names used by the High Court to preserve
their anonymity, were born on Aug. 8 in Manchester, joined at the
pelvis. Jodie is said to be bright and alert, but Mary is more
passive and relies on Jodie for heart and lung functions and lives
only because she is attached to her.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court judge, Robert Johnson, giving the court opinion
10 days ago, reasoned: ``For Jodie, separation means the
expectation of a normal life; for Mary it means death.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester medical team said there was an 80 percent to 90
percent chance that if the twins remained joined, both would die in
three to six months as Jodie's heart fails under the burden of
supporting more than just herself.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, both Roman Catholics from a remote community in an
unidentified European country, came here to have the children when
they realized that they were joined and that their home country
lacked sophisticated medical centers. The parents were not in court
Monday. But their lawyer, Simon Taylor, submitted a statement from
them that said: ``We cannot begin to accept or contemplate that one
of our children should die to enable the other one to survive. That
is not God's will. Everyone has a right to life, so why should we
kill one of our daughters to enable the other one to survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a second principle arising out of the couple's religious
belief, Taylor told the three-judge appellate panel: ``They don't
want either of their daughters to be actively killed. But they also
say, `We recognize the dire prognosis without separation, and we
don't want to prolong matters by active treatment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Parker, a lawyer assigned to represent Jodie, said there
was no reason to believe that the girl would not have a normal life
expectancy if separated from her sister. ``We must look at it not
that something is being done to Mary to hasten the end of her life,
but that something is being done to Jodie in order to restore to
her, her own integrity and bodily system,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   But the parents argued that separation would not guarantee a
good result for Jodie and that the isolated place where they lived
could not provide the care that she might need. It would be
``arduous for her and arduous for the family,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The case has sparked expressions of dismay and concern from
religious, judicial and medical groups. But it has also provoked
threats from more activist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The judges on Monday agreed to a plea for official anonymity for
a witness from the Manchester hospital after hearing that doctors
there were already receiving hate mail. ``This is the sort of case
where feelings run high,'' said Adrian Whitfield, representing the
Central Manchester Healthcare Trust. ``Ethical positions can run to
extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Alan Ward called on Monday for a second medical opinion
to obtain confirmation of what he called the ``wholly bleak
prospect'' for Mary. A specialist from Great Ormond Street
Children's Hospital in London was assigned to see the twins and
report back to the court on Tuesday. Taylor said the parents'
stance reflected principles of English law that even if there was a
medically futile situation, there was no obligation for doctors to
give treatment that prolonged life.
</P>
<P>
   Ward remarked solemnly: ``Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven. That is their case.''

SECURITY COUNCIL TO ASK FOR REASSESSMENT OF PEACKEEPING PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The five permanent Security Council members
plan to use their collective influence this week to call for a
revision of how peacekeeping costs are divided among member
nations, a move that would _ at least on paper _ help Washington in
its battle to reduce U.S. assessments.
</P>
<P>
   The review of peacekeeping bills, which has to be conducted
through a committee of member nations, would be intended to help
put the faltering and cash-strapped peacekeeping department on
firmer financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   The five permanent members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and
the United States _ will meet on Thursday as part of a separate
Security Council ``summit within a summit'' during a meeting of
more than 150 government leaders. Both the full 15-member council
and its core of permanent members will issue declarations for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent members' final draft statement calls for adjusting
the payment scale for peacekeeping costs ``in light of changed
circumstances.'' The scale was established in 1973 to cover an
operation in Sinai and has never been revised.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the permanent members, who hold veto power, were
asked to pay a premium for peacekeeping on top of their fair share
of costs based on their national economies. Other industrial
nations paid just their share. Smaller or poorer nations paid as
little as 10 percent or 20 percent of what they would usually be
charged. A complex formula of special discounts claimed by many
nations further skewed the system.
</P>
<P>
   Based on 1973 economic figures, for example, the United States
was assessed more than 30 percent and China less than 1 percent, a
gap that has rankled U.S. officials in recent years. Russia is
still assessed as if it were the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   China has generally acknowledged that the system is out of date
and unfair, given the changes in the economic fortunes of many
nations. Saudi Arabia and Singapore, for example, pay minimal
amounts. But Chinese officials have refused to agree to a
significant increase in their bill.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that with the economy of Hong Kong now included
with that of the rest of China, Beijing will no longer be able to
make a case for poverty, even taking into account its large
population.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Congress has already ruled that the United States
will pay no more than 25 percent of its bill _ when it pays at all.
That contributes to an ever-widening U.S. debt, because member
nations do not recognize moves like that from individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   Reopening formal debate on a new payment scale will take a long
time, diplomats said, because 189 countries will all have opinions
to offer and limits to negotiate. But lobbying by the permanent
council members will help the process.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the five permanent members will recommend in their
statement this week that the financial base of the United Nations _
both the regular budget, which is assessed separately, and
peacekeeping costs _ ``must accurately reflect the capabilities and
responsibilities of every member state.''

 &HT;    Falcons sorely in need of defensive additions
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just like this time a year ago, the Falcons were sore
on the day after their season opener. This time, though, the wounds
didn't seem to hurt as much.
</P>
<P>
   Winning has that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves and his players were still uplifted by Sunday's
36-28 win over the 49ers in the Georgia Dome. There weren't a lot
of chances to gloat last season, when the Falcons were 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win an opening game against a team in our division is
really big,'' said Reeves, whose team lost its opener last year
17-14 to the Vikings. ``(But) We do have some injury situations
that are going to be key for us ... getting ready for Denver
(Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the Falcons have been getting pounded
physically.
</P>
<P>
   Already short-staffed on the defensive line and at linebacker,
the Falcons incurred more damage at both positions Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Backup weak-side linebacker Chris Draft will miss Reeves' first
trip back to Denver since the Broncos fired him after the 1992
season. Draft aggravated a hamstring injury Sunday. With rookie
reserve linebacker Mark Simoneau (groin pull) out at least two more
weeks, the Falcons have just four other linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   One, middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, has a sprained wrist. The
only healthy reserve, Jeff Kelly, has almost no experience outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are more likely to add a linebacker rather than a
defensive lineman to the roster today, but both are possible. The
Falcons are about $1 million under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we can bring anybody in at that position,''
Reeves said. ``We have got to look at linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons would have to clear roster room to add players.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said it's no sure thing that starting defensive end Brady
Smith, who has been out nearly four weeks with a groin pull, will
be back. His absence left the Falcons with just six defensive
linemen Sunday. Many teams dress eight defensive linemen; not many
dress fewer than seven.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right defensive tackle Shane Dronett was walking around
Monday with his left elbow in a sling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the opposite of hyperextending it,'' said
Dronett, who expects to play against the team that drafted him in
the second round in '92. ``It was fine at first, but later it got
stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, running back Jamal Anderson, who surprised
everyone by carrying 24 times for 77 yards in his first game since
missing the final 14 games last year with a torn right anterior
cruciate knee ligament, said he was not as sore as he had been
after his first preseason action a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being smarter about it,'' Anderson said. ``I ice it after
the game, then get home, wait a couple hours, and ice it again.
It's something I'm going to have to stay on top of. A lot of times,
guys will swell up, but mine's not doing that and that's good.''

DIFFERENCE IN JETHAWKS' SEASONS LIKE `NIGHT AND DAY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER, Calif. _ It was a chilly greeting to say the least,
but not much worse than I expected. Fact is, I had braced myself
for the icy stares and ruffled grumbles I received as I stepped
inside the clubhouse of the Single-A Lancaster JetHawks.
</P>
<P>
   As I stood there, with seemingly all eyes focused on me, I
couldn't help but respect the young ballplayers who were giving me
the cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I was the one who wrote the article last year about
the JetHawks, an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners and at the time
the worst team in all of professional baseball. It was an article
that ruffled feathers and hurt feelings, one that was tough to
write and just as difficult to read if you were a member of the
JetHawks' team or front office.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an honest account of a professional baseball team and
professional players suffering through an almost embarrassingly
dismal year, a human drama we felt was important to tell.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes the truth hurts.
</P>
<P>
   This was my first time back to Lancaster since the article
appeared .... and the first chance the JetHawks had to tell me, or
in this case show me, what they thought of it.
</P>
<P>
   I had returned to write about the JetHawks' amazing
transformation from the worst team in pro ball to one of the best.
They start the California League playoffs this week after
dominating both halves during the regular season, finishing 89-51,
and are favored to win the overall title.
</P>
<P>
   As I stood there in the clubhouse, getting big-leagued by a
group of minor-leaguers, it was clear why these JetHawks are so
much better than the ones I wrote about last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's JetHawks act, play and function as a team. Their
collective reaction toward me proved that right down to the photo
copies of last year's story _ which were plastered on the walls of
the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Lancaster has undergone a complete talent overhaul
from a year ago _ only four players return from last year's
embarrassment. But talent only goes so far in baseball, especially
in the minor leagues, where personal goals of advancement sometimes
clash with the team's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   When things finally simmered down with the help of manager Mark
Parent, assistant Dana Williams and the Lancaster front office I
returned for a second attempt when the JetHawks closed the regular
season in Lake Elsinore last week.
</P>
<P>
   This time, instead of icy staredowns I was met by the gentle
smile of Harvey Hargrove, a center fielder who suffered in
Lancaster last year and seems rejuvenated by the success this
season.
</P>
<P>
   If Hargrove had any hard feelings, he didn't show them as he
explained how much fun he was having and the reasons the JetHawks
are so much better.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of muffled grumbles I got a handshake from batting coach
Dana Williams, who was upset with me and told me why as we sat in
the visiting dugout in Lake Elsinore. When he was finished, he just
smiled and tried to explain the differences between this season and
last.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, an old-schhol baseball guy who made it all the way to
Triple-A before his playing days finished, was frank when he
discussed the JetHawks of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had a saying `You can't make chicken salad out of
chicken s---,'' Williams said. ``And there's a little truth to
that. I think (new manager Mark Parent) has done a good job, but I
thought (last year's manager Darrin Garner) and I did a good job
with what we had. But position by position we're just 100 percent
better than we were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   True. The JetHawks have benefited from the addition of a number
of players from the Mariners' low Class-A Wisconsin club, including
pitchers Scott Atchison (14-6, 3.90 ERA) and Chris Mears (11-8).
Last year's Lancaster pitching staff was a disaster, made up of a
handful of hurlers recovering from major arm injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The offense got a boost from outfielder Juan Silvestre, another
Wisconsin call-up and a blue-chip prospect in the Mariners system.
</P>
<P>
   He toyed with Cal League pitchers through the regular season,
batting .303 with 29 home runs and 133 RBI. Shortstop Antonio
Perez, acquired by Seattle from Cincinnati in the Ken Griffey Jr.
trade, is hitting .276 with 17 home runs and 62 RBI in addition to
playing stellar defense.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Craig Kuzmic, who split time last year between Wisconsin
and Lancaster, is hovering around .300 with 19 home runs and 102
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the JetHawks have more talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everyone's having a good year,'' Williams said.
``And that turns into wins. It's been fun, it's always nice to win.
I'm not saying we didn't have fun last year, we did. I thought we
still went out and did our work like we were supposed to. It's just
that when you win it makes it a lot more fun to come to the
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, at first hurt that he wasn't given a shot to move up
to Double-A out of spring training, detected an improved atmosphere
in Lancaster almost immediately. Confidence soon followed after the
JetHawks rallied for some early-season wins, which hardly ever
happened a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like night and day,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the JetHawks found ways to lose. When it wasn't the
pitching letting down the offense, it was the offense not
supporting the pitching. There were defensive letdowns, mental
mistakes, poor attitudes, finger-pointing and a lack of confidence
in manager Garner who never seemed comfortable at the helm and was
reassigned by the Mariners after the season.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that Lancaster was usually a beaten club before
taking the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were going out, and in a way, almost knowing we
were going to lose,'' Hargrove said. ``There was just so much going
on. One night it was the fielding, one night the pitching and one
night the hitting wasn't coming through. So there was a little
animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy would go out and throw a good game and we wouldn't score
runs, so he'd be a little upset. And then vice-versa, we'd go and
score runs and the pitching staff (would falter). It was a long
season, we played 140 games and it gets frustrating. People get
upset because they're not performing well individually or as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   This year guys are arriving early, eager to get their work in
and then play.... and usually win. There's good-natured banter
around the batting cage and in the dugout, and there's an obvious
level of respect for Parent, the former major-league catcher who's
captured the attention of baseball people with the work he's done
as a first-year manager.
</P>
<P>
   Parent says he won't be back in Lancaster next year, hopeful
that he's earned the chance to coach or manage at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Between the new players, the improved attitude and Parent, the
JetHawks are flying high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go out and know we have a legitimate chance to win
every night,'' Hargrove said. ``Last year we hurt ourselves even in
the clubhouse. At 6:30 it would be like, `Oh man we have to go out
and play a game.' Not that we necessarily went out and feeling that
way, but in the back of everyone's mind, it had to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent deserves some credit for the improvements. His commanding
presence and big-league experience are hard to ignore. But it's
also his game management and preparation. The JetHawks don't beat
themselves on the field or in the dugout, and people are noticing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that last year's staff wasn't as good but I just think
that (Parent and his staff) have done a better job of staying on us
and going out and handling our business the right way,'' Hargrove
said. ``Not that we didn't do that last year, but I think we could
have done that a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's JetHawks are doing many things a lot better, and it
shows. &QL;

HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY: WHY WOMEN DO IT, OR AVOID IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 1st take can run as is; 2nd and 3rd takes are the words of
women talking about hormone replacement therapy.) 
 By LAURA MUHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many menopausal women, the question of whether to take
hormones is one of the most crucial health decisions of their
middle years _ and one of the most confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the hormones relieve the hot flashes and the night sweats
that plague many women during menopause, and they protect against
brittle bones.
</P>
<P>
   But does it prevent heart disease as researchers have long
believed or does it make no difference to a woman's heart disease
risk, as some studies are now hinting? And what about breast
cancer? With some studies indicating long term use may slightly
increase a woman's risk and others failing to find any increase,
where does the truth lie and how much should women worry? Then
there are the questions of weight gain and mood swings. While many
women believe that estrogen replacement makes them gain weight but
soothes their moodiness, these effects are not found in scientific
studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find yourself trying to decide which is the lesser of the
evils,'' said Beryl DuMont, 55, an office administrator from North
Hanover, N.J., and one of a half-dozen women who recently discussed
their feelings about hormone replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you take estrogen to prevent one problem and risk getting
another one that you don't have and might otherwise never get?''
DuMont wondered. She stopped her first hormone treatment because of
a bad reaction but is considering a second.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of women who take or have taken hormones
for the symptoms of menopause range from 10 percent to more than 40
percent, with factors as diverse as education and geography playing
roles. One study published last year in The Annals of Internal
Medicine found that college-educated women and those living in the
South and West were significantly more likely to use hormones than
those living in the Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the American College of Preventive Medicine,
only about a third of women who use hormones take them as
prescribed, something that may reflect women's fears about the side
effects of such medication.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is this: In the short-term, hormone replacement
therapy controls the hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness
experienced by many women during menopause. In the long term it
also decreases a woman's risk of osteoporosis, the brittle-bone
disease that can lead to life-threatening fractures. Estrogen also
appears to increase a woman's level of good cholesterol and reduce
the bad, while promoting blood clotting.
</P>
<P>
   However, numerous studies have pointed to a link between a
slightly higher risk of breast cancer and hormone use, and two
reports published this year suggest the risk is greatest in women
taking both estrogen and progestin, as opposed to estrogen alone.
</P>
<P>
   That came as a surprise to many researchers who had believed
estrogen was the primary culprit in the breast cancer-hormone link.
It also was demoralizing because progestin is given in combination
with estrogen specifically to lower the risk of endometrial cancer,
a risk that increases more than tenfold when a woman takes estrogen
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Also this year, one of the most widely held assumptions about
hormone replacement therapy _ that it helps prevent cardiovascular
disease _ was called into question. Just two weeks ago, researchers
reported that estrogen did nothing to slow the progression of heart
disease in women whose arteries had already been partly blocked by
it. Whether estrogen prevents heart disease remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   More definitive results will come in 2005, when results from the
first large-scale, long-term study of hormone use become available.
But that comes as small comfort to women now trying to decide
whether to take, or continue taking, hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Some try to circumvent the issue by experimenting with estrogens
derived from plant sources, believing that these so-called natural
estrogens are less likely to cause long-term side effects than
synthetic estrogens. Yet there is little research to prove either
effectiveness of the herbs or the lack of side effects, said Dr.
Lila Nachtigall, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the
New York University College of Medicine and one of the nation's
leading experts on hormone replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women think that if it's over the counter or herbal or called
a nutrient, that means it's safe,'' Nachtigall said. ``They don't
realize that it doesn't have FDA approval; they don't know that it
can be sold without quality control, without science.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the decision a woman makes can involve any number of
factors: her personal and family health history, her physical
symptoms, her feelings about taking medication, her doctor's
opinion and how much she trusts it, what friends have told her
about their experiences during menopause.

</P>
<P>
   What follows is what some women had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Valerina Quintana, 51, director of the University of Arizona
Career Development Center in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a person who likes taking medication. I keep a small
bottle of aspirin in my medicine chest, but it usually expires
before I get through it. So when I started menopause two years ago,
I thought, ``OK, this is a natural part of life, I can get through
it naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   My problem was the mood swings. Outside, I was the picture of
calmness and coolness, but inside, I was going crazy. I'd go to
social functions and have to leave, because I felt weepy. Once, I
was driving and I couldn't remember how to get where I was going.
Another time, I forgot the name of a colleague I had worked with
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   My primary care physician gave me a prescription, but I put off
getting it filled because I didn't like the idea of taking
synthetic hormones. Then I went to a lecture by a naturopath about
natural hormone replacement therapy. I really liked what I heard.
Afterward, she gave everyone a free 30-minute consultation. She
told me, ``You look healthy; you should be able to go through this
with herbs.'' She suggested chaste berry and dong quai, but when I
tried them, I felt like I needed something more. So I went to a
compounding pharmacy (a pharmacy that makes up its own drugs from
approved ingredients). The pharmacist asked about the frequency of
my symptoms and came up with a prescription based on that; she
called my doctor to get his OK.
</P>
<P>
   Now I take a daily troche containing tri-estrogen with
progesterone, but they're natural, plant-based phytoestrogens,
instead of being molecularly altered so they can be copyrighted. I
also use a testosterone cream that I rub into my arms; it's also
from natural sources, not artificial ones.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, the mood swings started evening out and the hot
flashes went away, although I will admit that my memory hasn't
improved as much as I'd hoped; I recently started taking ginkgo
biloba to see if that would help. The best part is that I don't
have any side effects. My friends who are taking synthetic hormones
say their breasts swell, and they sometime have spotting, but I
don't have any of that.
</P>
<P>
   I feel really good about what I'm doing. I like the fact that my
prescription is based on my symptoms, so it's uniquely my own; when
you go to a doctor, they give you the same prescription as everyone
else, and we're all different.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl DuMont, 55, of North Hanover, N.J.; office assistant,
Scottish Widows Investment Management
</P>
<P>
   I get migraines, which have always been linked to my period. It
used to be three a year, but when I started menopause last year, I
started getting them every week.
</P>
<P>
   My gynecologist said estrogen might help and rattled off a whole
ream of other benefits, too: it's supposed to help your bones, your
general well-being.
</P>
<P>
   I was concerned because seven years ago I had a breast lump
removed; it was benign, but at that time, the surgeon said to me,
``Under no circumstances go through any form of hormone replacement
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked my gynecologist about it, though, she said that
just because I started taking hormones didn't mean I had to stay on
them. That was a good point, and probably why I finally said,
``Yes, I'll try it.''
</P>
<P>
   She prescribed the estrogen patch; I was supposed to use it for
three or four weeks, then add progesterone. But when I read the
brochure that came with the package, I got nervous. It talks about
breast cancer and endometrial cancer, which scared me because I
have endometriosis. But I thought, ``My doctor knows my medical
history, and she's still recommending that I try it, so I guess it
must be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, I didn't feel better while I was taking it. I
was irritable, even more tired than I had been, and I kept waking
up at night, although whether that was because of the estrogen
itself or because I was afraid of it, I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a month, I got a migraine that didn't go away for
five days; my hands were also swollen and tingly. I called the
doctor's office and they said I was having a reaction and that I
should stop.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm in limbo. I just do not know what to think about this
stuff. I'm supposed to go back to the doctor next month, and I
haven't ruled out giving hormones another try.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, I'm going to talk to my pharmacist; he's
big on alternative medicine, and I thought I would ask him for
something herbal. I know it's unproven, but so many people are
doing all right with it; maybe it will help me, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Goldman, 59 of Forest Hills, N.Y.; retired
</P>
<P>
   There's one simple reason I'm not taking hormones: family
history.
</P>
<P>
   My brother died of prostate cancer, and my mother, who's 89, had
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   I have her body: we're both short, broad-boned women. When I
look at her I think, ``What happened to her could happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, I'm at high risk because I got my period at a very early
age and never had children. So why take more chances?
</P>
<P>
   I've talked it over with my doctor, but she's never pushed me
one way or the other. The last time I went in, I was having a lot
of mood swings; I told her, ``I can't stand this; maybe I should go
on hormones.'' She said she had no objection to my trying it for
six months as long as I had a mammogram before and after. She gave
me the prescription, but I just didn't have the guts to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   My sister-in-law was on hormone replacement therapy; she got
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   My sister-in-law's sister was on hormone replacement therapy;
she got breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   I thought: ``What do I need this for? It's not worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   One gynecologist _ a friend, not the one that I go to _ said
that if I were at risk of osteoporosis, it would be a different
story. But when I had a bone scan, probably about five years ago,
my doctor laughed and said, ``There are people who would kill for
your bones,'' because they're so thick and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease is a very big issue for me because my father died
of it but I have been increasing my aerobic activity, going to the
gym and doing things like that to counteract that risk.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also lucky because hot flashes have never been as much of an
issue for me as they are for some women.
</P>
<P>
   I hate them, but when one hits, splashing my face with ice water
is usually enough to relieve it. I know one woman who had to take a
change of clothes with her to restaurants, because she'd get
drenched. My whole outlook on hormones might have been different if
that had happened to me.
</P>
<P>
   The other good thing is that I was retired by the time I started
menopause, so I could tough it out in private.
</P>
<P>
   I sold advertising for one of the networks, and it would have
been very difficult meeting with clients and dealing with hot
flashes at the same time.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Diane Hill, 52, of Monroe, La.; lawyer
</P>
<P>
   I started taking hormones five years ago. My doctor was the one
who brought it up. It was the first time I'd gone to her, and when
she took my history, she asked me about symptoms of estrogen loss.
At the time, I was having hot flashes; they weren't keeping me up
at night, but I was waking up in a pool of water.
</P>
<P>
   My doctor said she recommended hormone replacement therapy, and
gave me some samples. After I tried them for a while, I went ahead
and filled the prescription.
</P>
<P>
   I do feel better physically, but the truth is, I'm concerned
about taking this drug. I'm not a person who readily takes
prescription medicine for anything, and when I first got the
samples, I read all the package inserts and looked it up in medical
journals, so I'm aware of some of the medical dangers of taking
hormones. On the other hand, estrogen loss seems to be a precursor
for osteoporosis and some of the other deficiency ailments of the
aged, and therefore I think there are some benefits to having
(supplemental) estrogen in my system.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't take it as prescribed. I take it three days a
week, and on the other days, I'm using soy and herbs _ black cohosh
specifically _ which I learned about in my reading. I feel better
about herbal supplements, because they're natural, not synthetic.
They do help, but not enough for me to completely cut out the
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   I've haven't told my doctor exactly what I'm doing; I don't
think she'd approve. All I've said is that I'm not taking the
hormones every day, but that I am taking them regularly. I think
she suspects, but she doesn't ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that I will be able to drop the usage to one to two days
a week, but right now I'll stay on them. It's probably been a year
since I've fiddled with it. I seem to have a good combination now,
where I can take it three days a week and go about my business.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still experimenting with my body to see what I need, and
I'll probably continue the estrogen until I find some other way of
accomplishing my goals _ of feeling as healthy as I did 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Lang, 54, of Huntington Woods, Mich.; assistant
superintendent for elementary education, Bloomfield Hills school
district
</P>
<P>
   I've been on hormone replacement therapy for six or seven years.
What drove me to it were the hot flashes. You're burning up from
the inside out, turning beet red, and you get horrible sleep
disturbances. I have a demanding job, and I can't perform in peak
condition when I'm exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks (of starting on hormones), the hot flashes
stopped. But the real surprise was how much it improved the quality
of my life in ways I hadn't expected.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been having memory problems; I'd forget words or switch them
around, which was debilitating, since I give a lot of speeches as
part of my job. But I never associated the problem with menopause
until I started taking estrogen and realized that I was no longer
having trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem I hadn't attributed to menopause was
depression. I chalked it up to my kids growing up and leaving home.
But as soon as I started on hormones, that disappeared, too, and my
energy returned. I did have problems with breakthrough bleeding,
which isn't something you want to deal with after you haven't had
your period for a while.
</P>
<P>
   They tried a D&AMP;C, then increased my progestin, but I gained a
lot of weight. I seriously considered going off hormones because of
that, but I kept coming back to how much better it made me feel.
Now I'm taking a new drug, femhrt, which is a synthetic and has a
smaller dose of progestin. I'm feeling much better.
</P>
<P>
   But I will admit the breast cancer piece is worrisome. The only
person in my family who had it was my maternal aunt, and I decided
she was far enough removed in the family tree to not make that a
major factor in my decision.
</P>
<P>
   But my friends and I talk about the risk a lot. We can get
really philosophical that more of us are going to die from heart
disease, but the truth is, we still worry, and all of us are going
to wonder if we made the right decision if we get breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The way I've dealt with it is to step back and look at the whole
picture. I've concluded that my quality of life is so good I'm not
willing to give that up for what may be in the future. Instead, I
try to get mammograms regularly, do monthly self-examination _ and
stay on top of the literature.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Landy, 58, of Oakton, Va.; senior associate with Caliber
Associates, a behavioral research firm
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, the choices were easier a decade ago, when I
started taking hormones. Back then, it wasn't ``should we or
shouldn't we?''; it was, ``Oh my God, there's something that can
help!'' The recommendation from my physician was, ``Take this.'' So
I did.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's so much information out there that it's gotten very
confusing. For instance, there's heart disease in my family, and
for a long time I thought I was protecting myself against it by
taking hormones. I've been very disappointed to read the latest
studies that say that may not be the case _ although I'm still not
convinced we have the full picture. Earlier this year, I went off
hormones for three months; I was concerned because my breasts were
always swollen and tender, and I weighed 20 pounds more than I did
when I started.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the tenderness and swelling went away, and I
dropped 4 pounds. But the night sweats and hot flashes _ one of the
reasons I started taking hormones in the first place _ returned
with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, I had to take a business trip, and I was
miserable. Every two hours, I had a hot flash. I perspired so much
that my suit was soaked; I was so embarrassed. I thought, ``Enough
already!'' and went back to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me a prescription for Prempro, and I started taking it
again _ but only every other day, which seems to control the hot
flashes without causing other symptoms. That's something I decided
to do on my own, though. The prescription is for every day, and I
haven't been back to the doctor to say, ``Is this OK?''
</P>
<P>
   There are probably good reasons for me to be taking this. Around
the time I started menopause, I had a bone density study that
showed some loss. But I still worry. I recently had a Pap test that
showed atypical cells. Even though a repeat didn't find any sign of
a problem, I can't help being concerned. Is there a connection to
the hormones? Should I get off this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   I haven't made up my mind as to how long I'll stay on hormones.
I'd like to try discontinuing them periodically to see what the
impact is. In the meantime, I just hope I'm doing the right thing.

<P>
   YELLOW PINE, Idaho _ Back in Utah, they are inmates at Bluffdale
State Prison. But out here in the fire zone, they strut proudly in
black T-shirts proclaiming themselves members of the Flame 'N' Go
Hotshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in this program makes all the difference,'' Bart Clark,
33, a six-time felon who has spent 11 of the last 15 years in
prison, said Friday morning before shouldering his backpack on a
hill acrid with smoke. ``Now I can tell my 4-year-old son that his
dad isn't in prison, he's out fighting fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day since mid-May, Clark _ convicted most recently
of kidnapping _ and the rest of his 20-man crew have been outside
the wire, battling blazes across the West. The Utah program began
in 1985, and as inmate-firefighters this year, the crew is far from
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In this devastating fire season, one in six crew members
fighting fires by hand is a convict, drawn from state prisons in an
enterprise that most everyone involved seems to see as benefiting
all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there are special considerations, on account of
their being inmates,'' said Mike Melton, a Forest Service official
in command of the firefighting effort about 20 miles from this tiny
town, deep in the mountains of central Idaho. ``But frankly, we're
glad to have any help we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Other federal officials say the inmates have been invaluable,
providing a much needed, well-trained and well-supervised
reinforcement to resources that have worn thin.
</P>
<P>
   At wages that average $1 an hour, the use of inmates is a
bargain, one that might ease the taxpayers' burden in a year in
which federal firefighting costs will exceed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And in conversations here in Idaho and in their Utah prison
home, these inmates also described themselves as blessed, seeing
fire as a vehicle that has brought not only a taste of freedom but
an opportunity to redress old wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my life, I took things from other people, and now it's
time to give something back,'' Tommy Phong, 33, said, puffing a
cigarette in the early morning chill as he and the crew prepared to
head out. After more than 13 years in prison, Phong, who was
convicted of armed robbery, is scheduled to be paroled early next
year, and he said he hoped his three summers fighting fires would
prepare him for life outside of prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that time you're in prison, what's on your mind is to get
out on the street,'' Phong said. ``And from my first years as a
firefighter, I've seen what it is like.''
</P>
<P>
   As the inmates loaded their gear, they were only one hub in a
swirl of activity at the fire camp, home to forest rangers, college
students, paramedics and skiers apparently unfazed by having
prisoners in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some of the inmate crews, we get an extra security
briefing, and the women are supposed to walk around in pairs,''
said John Cataldo, 28, a ranger in Alaska's Denali National Park
who is on temporary fire duty in Idaho. ``But everyone treats the
Flame 'N' Goes like a regular hotshot crew.''
</P>
<P>
   The Utah team is the only crew of inmates to hold a federal
designation as ``hotshots,'' slang for top-ranking Type I status.
They wear the T-shirts, not the orange prison jumpsuits assigned to
inmates from California and some other states and _ under state
policy _ are accompanied by unarmed escorts from Utah's Department
of Corrections, not the gun-carrying guards common to some other
inmate camps.
</P>
<P>
   With wages that can reach $5.55 an hour, the Utah crew is better
paid than other inmate teams, though the rate is just a fraction of
civilian wages. A civilian firefighter with the same elite status
would make about $15 an hour plus overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But in all the heady rush, the prisoners have also been given a
sobering reminder that firefighting is not without risk. Two fellow
inmate-firefighters were killed last week in Utah in a lightning
strike, raising questions about just how much value might be
attached to an inmate's life.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Utah has paid only for the inmates' funerals, and
state officials say they cannot be confident that the two prisoners
will become eligible for federal death benefits of nearly $150,000
that is routinely paid to firefighters slain in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we signed up, we had to sign a waiver that released the
state from any liability,'' Michael Kinikini, 33, a member of that
team and a convicted robber, said at the Utah prison this week.
``But the bottom line is that we're out there protecting public
land, and if we die, the compensation should be the same as for
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two men killed, Michael Bishop, 27, had spent seven years
in prison for attempted murder, while Roger Braithwaite, 26, had
spent three years behind bars after a conviction for vehicular
homicide. Both were within 36 months of their scheduled parole
dates, a prerequisite for consideration in the Utah crew, and both
had been moved to minimum-security quarters, another requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't too proud of him when he first went in to prison,''
Dan Bishop of Riverton, Utah, said of his late son. ``But I became
very, very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   By official count, some 25,000 firefighters are now involved in
battling dozens of blazes across the West.
</P>
<P>
   That count includes ground crews, air squads, fire engine
personnel, and an army of supervisors and support personnel, said
Neil Hitchcock, a federal fire manager who coordinates the use of
firefighting resources.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 people belong to crews assigned to the fire lines,
Hitchcock said. Of these, more than 2,000 are inmates, according to
estimates provided by regional fire centers, with most operating in
California, home to the nation's largest inmate-firefighter
program.
</P>
<P>
   With an overall force of 60, divided among three 20-person
crews, the Utah prison-firefighting program is one of the smallest
in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to California's, which is spread across 38
conservation camps, another large program exists in Nevada and
numbers about 900 inmates. Wyoming, Idaho and, most recently, Texas
are among states that have begun smaller operations.
</P>
<P>
   In no state are the inmates compelled to serve as firefighters,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Utah program stands out in part because its
inmate-firefighters are routinely permitted to travel outside the
state, so that its teams have been in the lead this summer in
battling some of the nation's largest fires.
</P>
<P>
   But still, federal officials say that the contributions by other
programs have also been widely felt, because the widespread use of
inmates on fires in California, for example, has freed civilian
crews to focus on blazes in Idaho and Montana, which have been
hardest hit this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In every state, the inmates are led by state forestry officials
who guide them in firefighting techniques and relay directions from
fire commanders. And though the rules imposed on inmates vary from
state to state, a common denominator is a ban on participation by
sex offenders or suspected escape risks. There have been no
reported escape attempts or other incidents of misconduct involving
inmates in the firefighting this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want anybody with any rabbit in them,'' said
another inmate, Bryan Kawa, 32, of South Ogden, Utah, who was
convicted on a weapons charge. Kawa, like other prisoners, is
housed in a minimum-security dormitory, 30 men to a room, when he
is not on the fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advocates of prison-firefighting programs are those
who argue that they make good economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the state prison population now stands at
162,000, it costs $21,000 a year to house a prisoner behind walls
but just $13,000 a year at one of the conservation camps, said Mack
Reynolds, a corrections official who supervises that state's
program.
</P>
<P>
   In California and some other states, the incentives offered for
prisoner participation include early release, with a one-day credit
in time served typically offered for every day that an inmate works
on the fire line. In Utah, however, sentences are fixed, which
state officials say is a reason that they provide more pay.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisoner-rights advocates, led by the American Civil
Liberties Union, have campaigned for broad changes in the law that
would require that inmates be paid at least minimum wage and be
made subject to other labor-protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Carol Gnade, the group's executive director in
Utah, said she had mixed feelings about the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, we encourage prisons to get more involved in
giving opportunity to prisoners,'' Gnade said. ``But at the same
time, they should extend that to the same kinds of protections that
other people receive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Utah inmates and their escorts described compensation as
just one reward. ``We get up on top of mountains where no one else
has ever been,'' said Kawa, who is scheduled to be released in
January after 11 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a zoo in there, and it's ugly,'' Ben Van Zandt, 35, a
corrections officer, said of Bluffdale prison, home to 5,000
inmates. ``A lot of these guys have spent many years in that zoo.
And what this program does is to help them move from the zoo to the
outside world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's foreign policy aides say he plans a
diplomatic whirlwind in New York over the next three days,
including what one senior official called ``the last real chance''
to jump-start the failed talks between Israel and the Palestinians
and what may be prove to be a tense session with China's president
over Beijing's continued missile exports to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Those meetings are part of a jammed schedule for Clinton, who
arrives in Manhattan on Tuesday for one of his last opportunities
for major foreign policy accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly intent on not sitting on the sidelines while the
presidential campaign speeds into its last two months, Clinton
plans to announce American support for a plan to establish a
permanent United Nations operation, based in New York, for planning
and preparing peacekeeping operations that could be deployed
quickly. At present, they have to be organized on an ad hoc basis.
But Clinton also plans to use the meeting of more than 150 world
leaders to insert himself in an array of simmering world conflicts
_ from the Middle East to Cyprus to the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said in a
lengthy interview over the weekend that much of Clinton's time will
be spent on one last effort to reconstruct a deal between the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel. Clinton is said to want that foreign policy achievement
more than any other in his short time left in office, and he
watched in frustration and anger as it slipped from his grasp at
Camp David in the early morning hours of July 25.
</P>
<P>
   He put most of the blame on Arafat, who was unwilling to sign on
to any agreement that gave him only partial sovereignty over
contested parts of Jerusalem. Arafat also was apparently unwilling
to go along with Clinton's alternative proposal, to announce a
settlement on all issues except Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later likened the sessions to ``going to the dentist
without having your gums deadened.''
</P>
<P>
   In advance of this week's meetings Clinton dispatched Dennis
Ross, his special Middle East envoy, and CIA Director George Tenet
to try out new formulations. ``There needs to be some flexibility
that would indicate we have some chance of getting real momentum
here,'' Berger said. ``If we are not any further than we were in
Camp David, it will be tough to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Berger have contended that Arafat's
inflexibility was the chief obstacle to an agreement at Camp David.
American officials have made it clear that little has changed since
then.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that currently there are no plans for three-way
meetings between Arafat, Barak and Clinton. Instead, the president
will shuttle between the two at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, starting
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   No other meetings are formally scheduled, but Clinton's aides
have already laid out a plan for at least two more days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the atmosphere of the chaotic week at the United
Nations may work against Clinton's hopes. In the seclusion of Camp
David, the president could shut out distractions and some of the
outside pressures bearing down on the leaders in the heat of their
talks. News blackouts were easy to manage, because the press was
kept miles away. Cell phones do not work at Camp David, leaving
just a few land lines for each delegation.
</P>
<P>
   New York will be the opposite: Arafat will be negotiating with
other Arab leaders just blocks away, and Barak will be talking as
he entertains American Jewish groups and others with a strong
interest in how a deal is constructed. Thousands of reporters will
be milling about; the delegations will have every form of
communication at their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ideal atmosphere,'' one former senior official who
was deeply involved in past negotiations said recently. ``I think
the effort is to get enough progress to justify more meetings or
maybe whisking them back to Camp David at the end of the week.''
Berger said he believes any thought of reconvening at Camp David is
premature; nonetheless, Clinton's schedule for week's end has been
left vague, save for a few New York appearances on behalf of his
wife's candidacy for the New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting on Friday with President Jiang Zemin of China
may be Clinton's last chance to show that he has made a lasting
imprint on American relations with China. He has not seen Jiang in
more than a year, and not since the two countries reached agreement
over China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Although
Clinton contended that the trade accord would yield broader
diplomatic benefits, encouraging China to be more cooperative in
dealing with hot spots around the globe, so far there has been
little evidence of a change in China's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, under increasing political pressure at home because of
the scope of China's market-opening concessions, is not likely to
be in a mood to offer Clinton much. Moreover, while the House
approved the WTO accord in the spring by a surprisingly large
margin, the Senate has yet to act. Passage there seems all but
assured, but the Republican leadership has yet to schedule a vote,
part of an elaborate maneuver for political advantage in the last
days of the congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that even as the administration works to secure
Senate passage of the trade bill, ``we will be pressing the Chinese
on the question of implementation'' of the WTO accord. Those are
code words for American concern that China will drag its feet on
market openings and continue its efforts _ stepped up in recent
months _ to control Internet content in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said earlier this year that such efforts were fruitless
and that eventually, the openness spawned by increased commercial
contacts would undermine the Communist Party's power. He is
unlikely to repeat that prediction, which presumably angered
China's leaders, to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   One focus of the Friday meeting will be to win Jiang's assurance
that China's missile exports to Pakistan, its longtime ally against
India, will cease. ``We have to get this resolved and we are
seeking further commitments on restraint,'' Berger said. But he
quickly added that he did not expect an accord at this meeting. The
two men are expected to see each other again after the presidential
election, at a meeting of Asian leaders. But by then Clinton's
powers will be all the more diminished in China's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Berger also said that the two men will discuss Taiwan at some
length, for the first time since the island's longtime opposition
won the presidential election. China made threatening indications
to Taiwan before the election, in an effort to keep independence
forces far from power, but has been far more moderate since the
Nationalist Party lost. Still, there has been little communication
between Beijing and the new government in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been urging flexibility, restraint and dialogue and we
have had more success on one and two than three,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's U.N. speech on Wednesday will also endorse a report,
issued by a special advisory group to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
that a permanent peacekeeping structure be created in New York.
That would sidestep the awkward process of re-creating a
peacekeeping structure each time U.N. forces are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle we are supportive of what is in the report for a
peacekeeping operation,'' Berger said. ``It parallels what we have
been recommending for several years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday ends the second straight summer travel season of chronic
flight delays and cancellations across the United States, and
despite spending billions of dollars and repeated warnings in the
last decade of impending air traffic gridlock, there is no solution
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most experts now believe that delays, which have risen
nearly 50 percent during the last five years, will become worse,
not better.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic
system, predicts that by 2010 the number of airline passengers will
rise 59 percent, to 1 billion. About 70 percent of that increase is
expected to occur at the country's 28 largest airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything on the drawing board right now
that you can say with any credibility is the answer,'' said Kenneth
Mead, the inspector general of the Transportation Department,
parent agency of the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish there was a silver bullet,'' said Jane Garvey, the FAA
administrator, ``but there is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the nation's air travel system reached its
current crisis can be traced back to one of the government's most
successful economic initiatives _ airline deregulation _ and to one
of its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the FAA's
attempts to develop a new air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale that involves so many disparate interests shouting
one another down _ from grass-roots organizations to large
corporations to municipalities to labor unions _ that politicians
in Congress and the White House have simply let the system drift
for years.
</P>
<P>
   A recent review by Mead's office found that the FAA and the
Transportation Department do not even have the tools to determine
the precise causes of most delays.
</P>
<P>
   And so the airlines blame the FAA, charging that the hours
planes sit idling on runways and the countless appointments missed
by passengers because of an antiquated air traffic control system
cost more than $5 billion last year alone. The FAA counters that
airlines knowingly schedule more takeoffs and landings at major
airports than the system can handle. And both the FAA and airlines
attack Congress for not appropriating enough money to fix the
system, as well as regional authorities for preventing the building
of new runways at congested airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten down to a big finger-pointing contest,'' said
Thomas Brantley, national vice president of the Professional
Airways System Specialists, the union of technicians who maintain
the FAA's air traffic control equipment. ``The reality is,
everybody's got blame to share.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors at work, too.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years of economic growth has filled airplanes to near
capacity, even as consumers complain about high fares. An unusual
spate of thunderstorms this summer frequently left controllers with
few avenues to reroute air traffic. United Airlines, the world's
largest carrier, canceled more than 20,000 flights during the
summer, largely because of labor disputes, adding to the burden on
passengers and other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that thunderstorms and the growth in passenger
demand are predictable events that the system should handle without
passengers' waiting half a day or more to reach their destinations.
And those passengers are seething.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we are having typhoons,'' said Sharon Mantel, a
drug company sales representative traveling to Chicago from
LaGuardia Airport one morning in July. ``Shouldn't technology be
able to handle this? It's not like the airplane was invented
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the answer to air traffic control gridlock, whenever it
comes, will involve new technology that lets controllers track more
planes in the sky _ and, possibly, economics that let market forces
allocate the system's scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
   Any changes, however, must guarantee the same level of safety.
</P>
<P>
   TRAFFIC CONTROL IN TRANSFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, life was much simpler for airlines and air
traffic controllers. Government regulators told the airlines when
and where they could fly, and how much they could charge.
Bureaucrats made sure every city was served and that popular cities
had no more service than they could handle.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback was that flying was expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation of the industry in 1978 transformed air travel into
mass transportation. It also hit the industry like an earthquake.
Venerable carriers disappeared; low-fare upstarts came and went.
The survivors established so-called hubs at major airports,
increasing their efficiency by flying passengers in, transferring
them to other planes, and flying them on to their final
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the airline industry carries three times as many
passengers as it did in 1978 at average fares that are 40 percent
lower, adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But while the industry was transformed, the air traffic control
system has remained virtually unchanged. At its heart are a
collection of ground-based navigation beacons and radar stations
that divide the 3.5 million square miles of airspace over the
continental United States into lanes, literal highways, along which
most airplanes are dispatched single file, like railroad cars.
</P>
<P>
   Because radar _ developed for the military in World War II _ is
arguably better at spotting attack planes than tracking friendly
jets, the FAA has long stipulated that planes be separated by at
least five miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. That clogs
the routes taken by the 20,000 scheduled flights each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of guys with slide rules, pocket protectors and tape
on their glasses figured this out a long time ago,'' said William
Blackmer, the top safety and technology expert at the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association, the union for 15,000 FAA
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   When a storm hits, controllers begin closing off individual
highways and spacing planes farther apart, regardless of original
scheduling, contributing to delays on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the weather is perfect, departures are not spread
evenly throughout the day: For a hub to be successful, planes must
arrive and depart in waves. Airlines also try to provide frequent
service from their hubs for the convenience of business travelers,
who pay the highest fares.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that inviting everybody to travel when they prefer
means fewer planes arrive or depart on time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mead, the Transportation Department's inspector general, found
that airlines frequently schedule flights beyond an airport's
capacity even in perfect weather, let alone factoring in bad
weather, when departure and arrival rates can be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at New Jersey's Newark International Airport one
day earlier this year, Mead said he found that during one four-hour
period, airlines had scheduled more planes to take off than could
be managed by the tower. Last year, Newark had the second highest
number of delays recorded by the FAA, after O'Hare International
Airport at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines, which uses Newark as a hub, said it had
spread out arrivals and departures to stay below the airport's
capacity throughout the day. It also has replaced smaller airplanes
with larger ones, to keep takeoffs and landings flat while
accommodating more passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we scheduled fewer flights, then people couldn't travel,''
said Greg Brenneman, Continental's president. ``It is not incumbent
on the airlines to be the least common denominator here. It is
incumbent on the government to have a system that allows people to
travel when they want to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Several government commissions have urged expanded use of
secondary airports to ease the strain on the system. Southwest
Airlines, the country's seventh-largest carrier, has had enormous
success bypassing major airports, providing frequent service
between cities like Baltimore and Providence or Dallas and Houston.
That has helped Southwest achieve the best on-time performance of
any major carrier. But the other airlines continue to favor the hub
system.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines would like to see busy airports enlarged. That is
what both United and American Airlines executives have said they
would prefer at O'Hare, for instance, where they operate hubs. But
residents near O'Hare have opposed any expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde Jr., the region's Republican congressman, has
joined with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Chicago, to
back construction of a new airport south of the city _ but the
airlines have said they would not fly there.
</P>
<P>
   Most other major airports also have difficulty expanding, either
because there is no space, as is the case at Newark and New York's
LaGuardia Airport, or because of opposition by area residents. From
1995 through 1999, only three new runways were put into service at
the 28 biggest airports, according to the Transportation
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of 50- and 70-seat jets has also increased air
traffic congestion. These jets are rapidly replacing
propeller-driven planes on many commuter routes and are often
preferred by passengers. But unlike prop-driven planes, which fly
at lower altitudes and can take off and land on shorter runways,
these jets require similar facilities as their bigger cousins,
adding to the competition for space on the ground and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were just 35 of these smaller jets in the
nation's fleet. Last year, there were 407. The Transportation
Department estimates the number will grow 25 percent annually,
becoming 19 percent of the total domestic fleet by 2011.
</P>
<P>
   FROM BRAINSTORM TO BOONDOOGLE
</P>
<P>
   The growth in air traffic was supposed to be easily managed by a
sophisticated control system that the FAA began developing in 1981.
In the wake of that year's air traffic controller's strike, when
11,000 controllers were fired by President Reagan, the FAA began
looking for a system that could manage more traffic with fewer
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   What came to be known as the Advanced Automation System, was the
centerpiece of a 10-year, $12 billion plan to modernize air traffic
control. Though the overall system of radar and navigation beacons
was unchanged, the plan promised to save billions of dollars by
enabling controllers to ``work smarter, not harder,'' the FAA
administrator at the time said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a gigantic white elephant. In 1994, after
its cost had tripled, the system's capabilities were shown to be
much less than promised and it was still 10 years from completion,
the FAA decided to scale back the project. The cost, according to
the General Accounting Office, amounted to $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The failure was just another example of the FAA's storied
incompetence in procurement: For years, the agency has been rebuked
by members of Congress and outside critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Aviation Administration currently lacks the
organizational, management, and financial wherewithal to keep pace
with the dynamic aviation community,'' the National Civil Aviation
Review Commission, a panel set up by Congress, concluded in 1996.
The Commission also warned at the time that ``rapidly growing
demand combined with a reduction in capacity, as the result of
continued reliance on outdated equipment, will bring our nation's
aviation system to gridlock soon after the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has shown some improvement in the last five years. For
one thing, Congress mandated a five-year term for the
administrator, slowing the turnover at the top.
</P>
<P>
   After the debacle with the Advanced Automation System, the FAA
adopted a more modest approach to modernizing air traffic control _
a strategy Garvey, the administrator since 1997, sums up as ``build
a little; test a little; deploy a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA replaced its old mainframe computers with newer models
and installed color radar displays. System crashes, which in the
1990s frequently forced controllers to track jets on slips of
paper, are now rare.
</P>
<P>
   But many problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   The original $12 billion modernization program that was supposed
to be completed in 1991 now has a budget of $40 billion through
2004 with no completion date scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The new mainframe computers that form the heart of the air
traffic system are IBM models built in the 1990s that have already
gone out of production. The FAA could not buy IBM's newest machines
because they would not run JOVIAL, the 1960s-era programming
language used in the system's software.
</P>
<P>
   JOVIAL, which stands for Jules Own Version of the International
Algebraic Language, was created by programmer Jules Schwartz 40
years ago as part of a contract for the Strategic Air Command. The
FAA plans to switch to a more modern computer language, but the
transition ``is very complex and it is going to take literally
years,'' said William Shumann, an agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also had high hopes for a plan called the Wide Area
Augmentation System, intended to use the constellation of military
satellites that make up the Global Positioning System to enable
planes to fly virtually independent of controllers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be operating by 1998, but also proved much
more complicated _ and expensive _ than the FAA first thought.
</P>
<P>
   The system was made available on a limited basis last week, but
is not scheduled to be completed until 2002. Few believe it will
make a significant contribution toward reducing delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA parades these acquisitions before Congress like they
know what they are getting, but they haven't figured out yet what
they need,'' said Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of air freight carriers, frustrated by the
FAA's failures, is developing its own air traffic system using
satellites. Under this system, each airplane broadcasts its
location and identity to all other airplanes. Every cockpit has a
display screen, a miniature version of those in air traffic control
centers, that tells pilots the flight paths and altitudes of other
airplanes in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Because pilots and controllers have more precise information
than is provided by the current radar-based system, airplanes can
fly closer together, as well as land and take off more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pilots must wait for clearance from the tower before they
take off. But with the satellite system, if the crew saw that it
had the necessary three-mile separation from the previous take off,
they could decide on their own to depart.
</P>
<P>
   The new system has been tested in the Midwest. Executives with
United Parcel Service, which is leading the news system's
development, said they believe it can be useful at the UPS hub in
Louisville, Ky. But the FAA, which has been working with the cargo
carriers, has some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if the second pilot leaves before he has the three
miles?'' asked David Ford, the FAA official in charge of developing
such systems. ``Who gets credited with the operational error?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the FAA is working on deploying a series of discrete
systems designed to improve the efficiency of takeoffs and landings
at busy airports and to allow some airplanes to fly more direct
routes. But these improvements will not come close to addressing
the long-term growth in air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can make some changes,'' said Steven Brown, the
FAA's acting associate administrator for air traffic services.
``Those will be marginal _ not unimportant, but marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   REVOLUTIONIZING THE AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   Such talk fuels critics who say that the only way to end the
impending gridlock in the skies is to junk the FAA _ or junk the
economics on which its management of the air traffic system is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Federal air traffic control services are paid for by taxes on
airline tickets, cargo and fuel. Users like commercial airlines do
not pay any more to use the system than private pilots; small
planes get the same priority as jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the resources are not priced properly,''
said Richard Golaszewski, a consultant who has advised the FAA and
several European countries. ``In fact, they are not priced at
all.'' That means that airlines have no incentive to limit their
use of air traffic control services even at the most crowded
airports.
</P>
<P>
   For years, economists have urged the government to switch to a
fee-based system that would force users to pay for the services
they use. Raising prices at peak hours would put pressure on
airlines to reduce congestion. They might also switch service to
underutilized secondary airports, or replace some smaller jets with
less frequent service on bigger planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the unfinished business of deregulation,'' Golaszewski
said. ``We have taken off all of the controls on what airlines can
do, but we haven't done anything to balance demand and capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates go farther and say that the air traffic control
system needs to be separated from the FAA and handed over to a new,
independent entity that would operate like a business.
</P>
<P>
   A plan that the Clinton administration sent to Capitol Hill in
1994 as part of Vice President Al Gore's campaign to reinvent
government never got out of committee, even though the House was
still controlled by Democrats at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Various privatization proposals have been floated in Congress
during the years, but none have made any progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I'll do all I can to kill this idea,'' Rep. James
Oberstar, a Democrat from Minnesota who was then head of the House
Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee, recalled in a
recent interview, referring to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Oberstar, now the ranking minority member on the committee, said
that privatizing the FAA would not break the aviation gridlock.
``Who is to say that the private sector is going to do a better job
than the public sector?'' he said. ``The same private sector that
brings you delays?''
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA, he added, is already beginning to act more like a
business. Congress passed legislation a few years ago creating a
15-member advisory council to supervise the agency. A bill passed
this spring directed the council to hire a chief operating officer
to run the air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also increased the FAA's budget by $10 billion during
the next three years to $40 billion. And it required that funds
collected from ticket taxes be spent only on aviation-related
projects, such as expanding airports, rather than being used to
finance other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is to give these things a chance and see if
they won't make a difference,'' said Phil Boyer, president of the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a longtime opponent of air
control system privatization whose 360,000 members make up more
than half the licensed private pilots in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that the FAA has been given too many chances
already. Mead, the inspector general, said that Congress has been
asking the FAA since 1993 to assign a cost to each of the services
its provides, as a prerequisite to charging user fees. Congress
finally ordered that study in 1996; the FAA now says it will be
completed at the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent public outcry about flight delays, interest in
privatization is on the rise again. Six years ago, when the Clinton
administration floated its proposal, the concept was relatively
new. Today, several countries, including Germany, Canada and New
Zealand, have successfully contracted air traffic services to
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nav Canada, the only private company in the world to run a
national air traffic control system, has proven the most intriguing
to policy makers in Washington. Before the nonprofit corporation
was set up in 1996, the Canadian air traffic control system
suffered many of the same problems that plague the FAA: Its
equipment was antiquated, and a proposed replacement was behind
schedule and far over budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nav Canada has managed to reduce air traffic delays,
cut costs and revamp its technology. A cost-accounting system
enables the company to charge users by the flight. Managers who
worked under both systems say the new arrangement has enhanced
safety, precisely because regulation and operations have been
assigned to two different organizations. Airlines in the United
States would like to be able to pay Nav Canada to control some
domestic flights, but for now there is no mechanism for Nav Canada
to accept such payments.
</P>
<P>
   Some staff members on Capitol Hill have drafted a privatization
proposal modeled on Nav Canada and are looking for a senator to
sponsor it. Many analysts say the alternatives _ inching along with
current plans or returning to tighter government regulation of air
travel _ are unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that if we have one more summer as bad as this
one, or even one worse than this one, finally it will force the
issue,'' said John Meyer, a retired economics professor at Harvard
who is in favor of introducing user fees.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: OHIO GETS READY TO COMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI  &UR; _  &LR; We waited a long time for the public to get
interested in this election, but now in southern Ohio you can see
the signs. Literally. The lawns are full of ads for candidates who
want to be the next congressman or state representative. This must
be what they mean when they talk about grass-roots politics.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are extremely important, says John Cranley, a
26-year-old Democratic congressional candidate. ``That's what I see
as the uniqueness of the district. People will put a sign up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranley, a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, is the
youngest person running for the House of Representatives this year.
MTV is following him around, doing a documentary about the race.
The constant presence of the cameras has been a big help in
recruiting campaign volunteers. ``They've got a lot of very
intimate footage,'' Cranley says. ``They come when I get up and
say, `Are you going to puke this morning?' Which I do a lot. The
stress is enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only a couple of dozen congressional races in this
country that the pros regard as up in the air. At this point, the
First Congressional District of Ohio isn't one of them. Last time
around, the popular mayor of Cincinnati, Roxanne Qualls, ran
against the incumbent, a conservative Republican named Steve
Chabot, and she got buried in the conservative Catholic
neighborhoods to the west of the city. Cranley, who is Catholic,
opposed to abortion and from the west side, figures he can win if
he can manage to lose the district where he grew up by only 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   My sister used to baby-sit for Cranley when he was a toddler, so
she gave him a party the other day, in a neighborhood where Qualls
got a grand total of 16 percent of the vote. Throwing a
meet-the-candidate party is akin to a corporal work of mercy. The
country is full of people who are dying to tell you why they'd be a
better representative/state legislator/road commissioner than the
entrenched incumbent. There is a severe shortage, however, of
places for them to give their pitch. At the Democratic convention,
Rep. Harold Ford, the keynote speaker, recalled the critical moment
when he discovered the concept of kindergarten graduations as a
turning point in his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Cranley understands. ``Church festivals are my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the shortage of swing voters in the area, half the people
in attendance at the party were Republican friends of my parents.
They sat listening as Cranley denounced Chabot for voting against
nutrition programs for pregnant women, infants and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are women who opted not to have abortions. To be
pro-life we have to be consistent,'' he said. Cranley's passionate
defense of anti-poverty programs may not have had much impact on
the Republican seniors, but it did soften one Democratic woman, who
dropped her plan to yell at him for being anti-choice.
</P>
<P>
   Several guests volunteered to put up signs, but in this
neighborhood people will commit their lawns before they commit
their votes. I don't know if Cranley has a shot at the House seat _
Chabot seems pretty energetic. But it's heartening to know we still
have graduates coming out of Harvard Law worrying about the WIC
program and the earned-income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   People in Ohio expect a lot of attention at election time, as
befits their standing as residents of a swing state. There was a
certain amount of hurt feelings the other day when George W. Bush
flew here for a fund-raiser at the home of a wealthy friend and
didn't stop to do any campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, we're used to the idea that Bush and Al Gore see us
as the motorcade route between La Guardia Airport and the Hilton
banquet hall. Wham, bam, traffic jam. But Ohio needs more tender
handling.
</P>
<P>
   A deeply unscientific survey of conservative Catholic senior
citizens on the western side of Cincinnati suggests the most
popular guy on either ticket is Joe Lieberman. ``I liked him even
better before he got partisan,'' said one of the men. The male
Republicans seem happy enough with Bush, but the women are
disappointed they can't fall in love with him the way they did with
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had better hang around next time he swings through. The
signs are not all good.

RETURNING CONGRESS JUGGLES LEGISLATION WITH ELECTION CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aware that what they do in the next few weeks may
help determine who controls the federal government next year,
members of Congress return from recess this week for a final
session compressed by the election campaigns and dominated by tax
cuts, education, health care and government spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority's first step will be trying to override
President Clinton's vetoes of their two top tax priorities _
repealing the marriage tax and the estate tax. But the efforts to
override the two vetoes have little chance of success, Republican
aides say. The votes, like much else that will happen this month,
are meant mainly to provide fodder for the political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have been pressing for concessions from the
Republicans on two health care fronts: a bill to expand patients'
rights in dealing with insurers and legislation to add payments for
prescription drugs to the Medicare program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert is especially interested in
trying to broker a deal on the long-stalled patients' bill of
rights, and a one-vote shift in the Senate _ Sen. Zell Miller,
D-Ga., has been appointed to replace the late Sen. Paul Coverdell,
a Republican _ could make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, the Senate almost surely will pass a major bill
that will establish permanent normal trade relations with China,
even though Senate Republicans are still holding back on this
priority of the Clinton administration, trying to use it as
leverage in negotiations with the White House over the broader
legislative agenda. There is also broad support for overhauling the
nation's bankruptcy laws to tighten the conditions under which
people can seek debt relief. And Congress will also likely pass a
$1 increase in the federal minimum wage, as Democrats have been
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Battles between Congress and the White House over government
spending have been a perennial September feature since the
Republicans took control of the Legislature in 1994. This year,
however, lawmakers will be under pressure to reach early agreement
with the president so they can go home to campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is likely to provide more money for education, but to
support exactly what school programs remains unclear. Many other
domestic spending bills are pending, and their final shape is in
flux. It seems likely that, as in the past, Clinton will force the
Republican-led Congress to increase domestic spending overall as
the cost of leaving town in time for down-to-the-wire campaigning
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to imagine we can do everything that needs to
be done, but by and large there is some prospect for successful
conclusion,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   And in these final days of the session, every vote cast and
every horse traded carries exceptional weight in what appears to be
a close political race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the mother of all endgames, because the House, Senate
and presidency are all at stake,'' said Mark Isakowitz, a
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers return from the recess that began before the
national political conventions, they confront a new political
calculus. When they left in July, George W. Bush was ahead in the
presidential polls. Now Vice President Al Gore appears to have
closed the gap.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that control of Congress, especially the narrowly
divided House, may depend not on the coattails of the presidential
candidates, but more on what the lawmakers actually do, and how the
public perceives their work, in the closing weeks of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as they enter the session, Republicans have not shown a
coordinated strategy on how to deal with the White House and
congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Tom Delay, R-Texas, the Republican whip in the
House, said he was ``surprised'' by an Aug. 28 letter sent by
Hastert to Clinton proposing to work together over the next month
to find ``common ground'' on increasing the minimum wage. While
Delay refrained from criticizing Hastert, his aides made it clear
that he would not have sent such a letter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, with the end of the fiscal year approaching on
Sept. 30, the Republicans do not appear to have settled on what
approach to take with the White House in budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On the big issues of social policy, meanwhile, Democratic
leaders in Congress, the White House and the Gore campaign appear
to be working in concert and framing a unified message. But some
Republican Congress watchers said that the Bush campaign had tried
to keep congressional Republicans at arms length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, Gore and Gephardt have message coordination,
particularly on prescription drugs, Medicare and HMO reform;
Republicans don't,'' said Marshall Wittman, director of
congressional relations at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
research institution. ``Bush is almost implicitly running against
Republicans on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The heated debate between Bush and Gore over prescription drug
benefits reduces the chance that congressional Republicans and
Democrats will resolve their differences there. While the full
House has passed a version providing subsidies to private insurers
that cover some drug costs, the Senate Finance Committee has not
voted on a bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have gained strength in the Senate and could try
again to pass a patients' bill of rights like the one the House
approved, but they would still need to rely on Republican votes
that are not firm. Some compromise would probably be needed on how
many people the bill covered and what rights aggrieved patients
would have to sue their insurers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a strong chance that Congress will restore some
money it cut from the Medicare program, increasing payments to
hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and other caretakers for the
elderly. Senate Republicans, though, do not agree with the health
care providers that there is a huge need for this step, and the
size of any increase remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The various policy differences and political jockeying will be
on display from the start. On Thursday, the House leadership has
scheduled a vote on overriding Clinton's Aug. 31 veto of the bill
to phase out federal inheritance taxes. Next week, there will be a
vote in the House on overriding Clinton's veto last week of the
repeal of the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that ending of the federal estate tax would
be too costly and would mainly benefit wealthy people. The White
House said the federal government would lose revenues of $100
billion in the first 10 years and $750 billion more in the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because 65 Democrats voted in favor of abolishing the estate
tax, congressional Republicans initially expressed optimism that
the House would strike down Clinton's veto and hand the president
an embarrassing defeat. But it appears that some Democrats will
reverse themselves, that some who missed the first vote will side
with the president, and that the veto will be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try overrides on the tax bills; that will be
unsuccessful,'' predicted a top aide to a Republican House leader.
``Then we'll pivot and say to Democrats and Clinton, you can't
spend it either. Our alternative will be to pay down debt and
protect Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   But the aide added that House leaders had yet to reach an
agreement on such a course of action. ``The big dogs have to sign
off on it,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans must also devise a strategy to deal
with the White House on the 13 spending bills that must be enacted
by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 to keep the government
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed 12 of the 13 bills and the Senate has
approved eight. Two, a $288 billion measure for defense and a much
smaller bill for military construction, have been signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto eight of the spending bills,
setting the stage for fights over issues like providing money for
school construction, hiring more teachers to reduce class size and
setting aside more federal lands for wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are seeking to paint the administration as the
recalcitrant party, emphasizing that a mere $30 billion, out of a
budget with more than $600 billion in discretionary spending, is
what separates their bills from what the White House wants to
spend. They even note that they are providing the amounts the
president wants for his school construction and class reduction
programs, though, unlike the administration version, the Republican
bill gives local school districts an option of not spending the new
federal aid for those purposes. But White House officials say the
difference is less about amounts than about how the money is to be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say any problems reaching agreement with the
administration will benefit them and their presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to work this time,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate Republican campaign
committee. ``It's going to help Governor Bush because he will
demonstrate that he's the guy who can reach across party lines and
govern. It will illustrate the Clinton-Gore administration's
inability to govern on a bipartisan basis. Let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I., said that on social policy
the standoff in Congress will help his party. ``The fact of the
matter is the American people support the Democratic caucus issues
_ prescription drugs for seniors, a patients' bill of rights,
education for our future _ and those are the issues that our
Republicans are trying to bill themselves as champions of, but it's
just not working,'' said Kennedy, who is chairman of the House
Democratic campaign committee. ``The American people know it's the
Democrats that are truly on their side.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: LOOKING PAST THE TYPICAL DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: This was originally budgeted as a REVIEW) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of us steeled against an Olympic onslaught of
kangaroos, koalas and Crocodile Dundee kitsch, ``Australia: Beyond
the Fatal Shore'' offers a protective coating for the brain. Robert
Hughes' six-part series is not the only program to ride the
coattails of the Sydney games, but it is the only one to explode
the myths and cliches that others mindlessly indulge. ``Croc Hunter
Holiday,'' the title of a Travel Channel documentary, says it all
about the standard glimpse at Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' work is of a different order, sharp cultural criticism
that is also entertaining. It is driven by a distinctive blend of
qualities. Because Hughes grew up in Australia but has lived abroad
for 35 years, he has a lovingly intimate yet detached perspective.
His ideas are enhanced by inspired visual imagery and crisp
cinematography; you might expect that, knowing that Hughes built
his reputation as an art critic.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger surprise is how well his on-screen presence holds the
series together, with an amused, probing, literate commentary that
makes him the most engaging of guides. He may be the only person
ever to emerge from a near-death experience wryer than ever, his
already acute sensibility sharpened, and not a smidgen of
sentimentality added. (The six-hour series will be shown from 9
p.m. to 11 p.m. ET, Tuesday through Thursday on PBS.)
</P>
<P>
   As Hughes says at the start, he was filming this series when he
was nearly killed in a car crash. On camera here, he walks with a
cane to observe the mangled car for the first time and seems shaken
all over again, rightly pointing out that no one should have
escaped from such a mess. His bones were shattered, but as he wrote
in a Time magazine essay last year, when he saw death there was no
``tunnel of white light with Jesus beckoning at the end, as
featured in the memoirs of a score of American K-mart mystics.'' He
emerged as skeptical as ever about an afterlife but ``crazily
happy'' to be alive in this one, determined to embrace every
minute.
</P>
<P>
   That tone pervades the series, as he flees from emotional
indulgence and quickly moves on to examine how much truth might be
behind the stereotypes of his home country, like the fun-loving
Aussie and the romanticized outback. The answers are never simple,
and the complexity is often captured by resonant images.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit bats swarm into a beautiful midnight-blue sky that turns
out to be dotted with Sydney skyscrapers. The bats are invading the
city at nightfall, ``reminding us the bush is never far away,''
Hughes says at the end of Episode 2, ``The Dead Heart.'' That
episode suggests that while the mythic Australia is about the
outback, true Australians dream of a home in the suburbs. When he
visits the remote city of Perth in Episode 3, ``Money, Class and
Power,'' he discovers that the nouveau riche mansions built during
the 1980s boom look like suburban houses ``inflated with a bicycle
pump.''
</P>
<P>
   A jumbo jet decorated with an almost psychedelic swirl of
Aboriginal art becomes the perfect metaphor for the clash of
culture and race examined in Episode 4, ``Before Trousers,'' whose
title refers to the Aborigines' term for the years before white
settlers arrived.

   Everywhere Hughes finds the push and pull of cultural forces
that goes back to Australia's days as an English penal colony
(chronicled in his absorbing 1987 book, ``The Fatal Shore''). In
tonight's opening episode, ``Body and Soul,'' he goes to Sydney's
colorful gay and lesbian Mardi Gras, a parade that recently drew
more people than the pope's visit there. But for every
``larrikin,'' the caricatured boozy hedonist, Australian history
has offered a countervailing ``wowser,'' a bluenose.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts between the descendants of the prisoners shipped to
Australia in the 18th century and the descendants of free settlers
still echo. Hughes visits his childhood home, a large
upper-middle-class house whose new owners have maintained its
refined Georgian style. The camera approaches it from a child's
angle, so the house looks as palatial as it did to him as a boy.
Now it prods him to notice that the idea of a nearly classless
society ``is one of the great illusions Australians like to spin
for themselves.'' A nation with more than its share of gamblers,
Australians choose to believe that luck rather than heredity or
skill is the basis for success. Theirs is ``the meritocracy that
dare not speak its name,'' he says in one of the witty phrases that
glide through his narration.
</P>
<P>
   The delusion that we have no rigid class hierarchy applies to
Americans just as easily as Australians, though Hughes doesn't need
to say so. There are so many similarities, and equally revealing
differences, between the United States and Australia that at times
he allows them to speak for themselves, and sometimes makes his
point explicitly. `` `Reconciliation' is the new buzzword of
Australian politics,'' he says in his episode on Aboriginal
culture, without mentioning how the issue reverberates in the
United States, both in black-white racial tensions and the history
of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Aborigines want white Australians to apologize for having
taken their land. Hughes visits Ayers Rock, the monolith in the
desert, which in 1986 was returned to the Aborigines yet remains a
tourist trap. Simply mentioning the rock is a political statement,
depending on whether it is called Ayers Rock or Uluru, the
Aboriginal name that has been restored. The natural wonder has been
``reduced to a totem by political and social wrangling,'' Hughes
says. ``Before Trousers,'' one of the richest episodes, includes an
interview with a middle-aged woman from the so-called ``stolen
generation,'' Aboriginal children taken from their parents in the
first half of this century to be raised by whites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Whatever similarities the series implies, Hughes is most
emphatic about the great defining differences between America and
Australia. In frontier America space meant freedom; in Australia
the vast space was literally one big prison. And because America
was founded as a religious utopia and utopias do not exist, we were
``doomed to disappointment.'' With its roots as a penal colony,
Australia ``had nowhere to go but up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad there is no companion book to Hughes' series, but
there is a charming alternative in Bill Bryson's current best
seller, ``In a Sunburned Country'' (Broadway Books), which
approaches Australia from the opposite perspective. Where Hughes is
an insider come home, Bryson is the outsider enthusing about his
discovery of Australian culture. Though his book is not nearly as
substantial or thoughtful as the Hughes documentary, it is an
intelligent, breezy tour in which the witty author is delighted by
Australia without being blinded by its stereotypes. He especially
likes the prime minister who disappeared by walking into the sea
and was memorialized with a swimming pool. Even that much
thoughtfulness is rare, as a glance at next week's television
programs about Australia suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel's ``Extreme Australia'' (9 p.m. ET,
Monday) is a snoozy documentary largely about geology, snakes and
platypuses. It is useful if you want to be reminded of why you
dozed through natural history class. The program does not actually
play the song ``Kookaburra'' (``Kookaburra sits in the old gum
tree''), but the high school aura was so severe I heard it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Travel Channel begins ``Australia Week'' on Monday with
``Croc Hunter Holiday'' (not available for review), a new special
in which Steve Irwin, the host of the Animal Planet show
``Crocodile Hunter,'' tours the country with his family. Then from
Tuesday through Friday ( 8 p.m. ET), the Travel Channel will repeat
an Australia-themed special. Most have that deadened travelogue
tone and one (``Freshwater Crocs'' on Thursday) has Irwin cooing at
the sweet behind of a kindly freshwater crocodile. Evidently it's
the saltwater crocs that'll kill you.
</P>
<P>
   However banal their narratives, even these lesser programs
suggest that it is nearly impossible to take a bad photograph of
Australia. Whatever the Olympics bring, there is this consolation:
At least everything will look pretty. And if the ``Kookaburra''
song gets stuck in your head, here's a hint: it can easily be
displaced by ``Waltzing Matilda.''

POLYMER-COATED SEEDS MAY ENABLE RELAY PLANTING FOR WHEAT AND
SOYBEAN CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   M&AMP;M's melt in your mouth (and not in your hands!) because, as
the old TV commercial said, they are covered by a thin candy shell.
</P>
<P>
   A Purdue University agronomist is testing whether a similar idea
will work for seeds as a means of increasing farm efficiency. Using
a thin polymer coating developed by the Landec Corp. of Menlo Park,
Calif., the agronomist, Tony Vyn, is testing whether coated seeds
can be used to help farmers overlap winter wheat and soybeans in
the same field.
</P>
<P>
   Relay planting, as the technique is known, is practiced with
wheat and soybeans in southerly parts of the Midwest. The problem
in more northerly parts, like Wisconsin and northern parts of
Indiana and Illinois, is that planting the soybeans early enough so
that the existing wheat stalks are not damaged by the planting
machinery often results in soybean plants that are too spindly and
high when the wheat harvest occurs. Thus much of the soybean crop
is destroyed in harvesting the wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The polymer-coated seeds, which should be on the market in a few
years, work like a timed-release aspirin, delaying seed germination
by about two weeks until heat and moisture in the soil break down
the coating. That would allow farmers to plant soybeans early,
without damaging the wheat, and yet produce soybean plants that are
short enough to be missed when the wheat combine cuts through the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Vyn said that the coating could also include a fungicide to ward
off mold that can rot seeds. Fungicides maintain their activity
longer in colder soil, so putting a coated seed into the ground
earlier would have the added advantage of protecting it longer.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL DECAFFEINATION
</P>
<P>
   Decaffeinated coffee usually gets that way through an industrial
process that uses a solvent, commonly ethyl acetate, to remove the
caffeine from the bean. But what if coffee (and tea) could be grown
without caffeine?
</P>
<P>
   That is the prospect of new research by scientists in Japan and
Scotland who have cloned the gene responsible for an enzyme that
plays an important role in caffeine production. Their work was
reported in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The enzyme, called caffeine synthase, acts as a catalyst in the
final two steps in the caffeine-making pathway in the coffee or tea
plant. So the researchers suggest that a transgenic plant, with
this gene sequence inactivated, could produce decaf coffee beans or
tea leaves.
</P>
<P>
   That is one genetically modified plant that might actually find
favor among some members of the public.
</P>
<P>
   DYING AMPHIBIANS
</P>
<P>
   Die-offs of frogs and other amphibians are still occurring in
parts of the United States, and although researchers in some cases
have been able to pinpoint a cause, the phenomenon remains
something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent die-offs involved tiger salamanders at a
lake in North Dakota. Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey
first noticed sick salamanders in May; by July, population counts
were far below the previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Geological service researchers have blamed a type of virus
called an iridovirus for most of the deaths in North Dakota.
Iridoviruses have also been linked to other salamander die-offs in
recent years, and the researchers say that they are probably the
cause of other die-offs this summer, including the deaths in late
June of hundreds of spring peeper frogs at Acadia National Park in
Maine and of wood frogs, bullfrogs and salamanders in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   What is still not known is whether the die-offs, which are not
limited to this country, are short-term events or a part of a
longer-term phenomenon that is only now coming to light. Among
theories being investigated to help explain the population declines
are increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation (due to thinning of
the ozone layer), pesticide contamination and rising temperatures.

JAPANESE GYMNAST STRIVES TO HONOR FATHER AND COUNTRY WITH GOLD
MEDAL

<P>
   TOKYO _ Naoya Tsukahara bounced up and down on the trampoline
that had been lowered into the floor. Up and down and up and down
again, then suddenly, in a split second, he lofted himself high
into the air and did two graceful, twisting, vertical somersaults
before landing, like a butterfly, on his tiny feet.
</P>
<P>
   In that momentary performance, at the end of a recent, sweaty
three-hour practice session with the Japanese men's gymnastic team,
is a flash of deja vu. For that peculiar pretzeled somersault, a
hallmark of Naoya's performance, is a derivation of Japan's most
famous gymnastic stunt, the ``moon'' somersault. It was concocted
by his father, Mitsuo Tsukahara, who used it 28 years ago in Munich
to win his first individual Olympic gold medal, on the horizontal
bar, scoring a 9.9 out of 10 in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would fold my body and somersault in the air while
twisting,'' the elder Tsukahara said. ``What Naoya does is twist
his body while keeping it straight. The style is different, but the
basic skills are those of the moon somersault.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a chance that Naoya will use that somersault to do
something that his father never did _ win an individual gold medal
in the all-around men's gymnastic competition. He won the silver in
the all-around at last year's world championships, and the gymnast
who beat him there, Nikolai Krukov, damaged his Achilles' tendon
this past spring and is not expected to be in peak condition in
time for the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, which begin on
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's a possibility,'' Naoya's father said of his son's
odds for a gold medal. ``He has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Tsukahara's performance in Sydney may also help
restore some of Japan's glory of years past, when the country
seemed to be a breeding ground for top male gymnastic talent. In
the 1960s and 70s, when Mitsuo Tsukahara was flying around the gym,
the Japanese men's team was the only real challenger to the
powerful, state-supported gymnasts from behind the Iron Curtain.
The Japanese team won five straight gold medals from 1960 to 1976,
edging out the Soviet Union each time. Tsukahara was on the last
three of those teams, and he also won six individual Olympic medals
_ two gold, one silver and three bronze.
</P>
<P>
   A vault that still bears the father's name, the Tsukahara, was
first performed about 30 years ago by Mitsuo Tsukahara. It consists
of a cartwheel with a quarter-turn followed by a backward
somersault. The maneuver marked the first time a gymnast had
performed a 360-degree somersault while vaulting, and
revolutionized the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really unique and very original and it just changed all
of vaulting completely,'' Peter Kormann, the U.S. men's Olympic
coach, said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has not won a gold medal for gymnastics since the Los
Angeles Olympics in 1984, when Koji Gushiken struck gold in the
all-around competition and on the still rings, and Shinji Morisue
won a gold medal on the horizontal bar. ``It will be extremely
significant if Naoya wins a gold medal,'' said Kenji Takamiya, a
reporter who covers gymnastics here at the sports newspaper Nikkan
Sports. ``Japanese people will be moved, and, more importantly,
Japanese companies will increase their support for gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gymnasts here are almost entirely dependent on corporate
sponsorship. But a decade of economic decline, coupled with the
dwindling fortunes of Japan's gymnasts, has resulted in diminished
financial support for the sport. Takamiya said that even Daiwa
Bank, long known as a backer of gymnastics here, has cut back its
support.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Naoya Tsukahara or any other member of the Japanese
team in Sydney could change that. ``The Japanese gymnastics world
is in critical condition,'' Takamiya said. ``My guess is that the
only way to save it is for Naoya to win a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of air-conditioning at the Asahi Gymnastics Club, where
Naoya works out, is a telling sign of the times. The two small,
portable air-conditioning units are pushed around the gym to cool
the areas where Naoya and his team members are working out. The
chalk that the gymnasts use to coat their hands hangs heavy in the
air, irritating eyes and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Asahi Mutual Life Co. supports the gym, which has long been home
to many of Japan's best gymnasts. It is a family affair for the
Tsukaharas, with Mitsuo serving as the director and men's head
coach and his wife, Chieko, also a former Olympic gymnast, serving
as the women's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Naoya travels to Sydney, he will carry along an ivory seal
bearing his name that his mother gave him, repeating one of his
father's traditions. ``I think Naoya will end up in the top 10, but
whether he wins a gold, silver or bronze medal, I can't say,''
Chieko Tsukahara said. ``The abilities of the top 10 male gymnasts
in the world are so close that a lot of it will have to do with
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes the family is blessed with good luck. Her husband,
for example, won one of his gold medals for the horizontal bar on a
day when a knee injury he had suddenly subsided during the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in working hard on training so that you can
capitalize on luck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Naoya follows a rigorous workout schedule, practicing for two or
three hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon. Asked
what the family talks about over meals, he paused for a moment and
smiled before saying, ``Gymnastics, of course.'' Naoya is studying
business administration at Meiji University, but spends much of his
spare time in the gym, a habit that gives his father pause. Mitsuo
Tsukahara recalls spending more time training _ and regretting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practiced more, but I think you can practice too much,'' he
said. ``The thinking about this has changed since my time.`
</P>
<P>
   Naoya's coaching has also differed from his father's and it has
become something of a curiosity here. One might have expected his
father to serve as his coach, but instead, when Naoya was starting
junior high school, his father retained a Chinese coach, Wu Jie, to
train him. Wu, a top Chinese gymnast, was in Japan studying
Japanese and looking for a part-time job when Mitsuo Tsukahara
hired him.

<P>
   Foreign coaches are still an oddity in Japan, so heads really
turned in 1994 when Tsukahara brought in his old friend and rival
Nikolai Andrianov, a chain-smoking former top gymnast from Russia,
to coach his son. Andrianov won seven medals at the Montreal
Olympics in 1976, including a gold in the all-around, leaving
Tsukahara to pick up a bronze medal in the same event. Both Naoya
and his father credit Andrianov with raising Naoya's skills to
international standards and with giving him the confidence he would
need to compete in world championships. ``I wanted Naoya to have a
proper coach, and at the time, Chinese and Russian gymnasts were on
top of the world,'' Tsukahara said.
</P>
<P>
   Now his son is a contender for similar distinction, but the
Tsukaharas deliberately downplay his talents and prospects by
severely limiting his exposure to the news media. A recent
interview with Naoya after a two-hour training session with the
Japanese team was limited to precisely 15 minutes, although his
parents were far more generous with their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won my medals I was happy, of course,'' the elder
Tsukahara said. ``But before I won them, I always felt like I was
under a lot of pressure to win, like people were pushing too
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The moon somersault that contributed to the elder Tsukahara's
lore in Japan got its name from the day he first attempted the
maneuver in competition: July 20, 1969, the day that Neil Armstrong
walked on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The father's experiences convinced him that the biggest
contribution he now could make to Naoya is to keep reporters at a
safe distance. He is particularly wary of the idiosyncratic
Japanese television scene, with its emphasis on slap-stick humor
and embarrassment. ``They often ask things like what's your
favorite food, what hobby do you have, who's your favorite star and
would you like to teach her how to do a somersault on TV,'' Mitsuo
Tsukahara snorted. ``TV can come after the games, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strategy has worked, because Naoya seems
preternaturally calm and self-possessed for one with so many hopes
resting on his exaggeratedly broad shoulders. He is famous for
telling his father that he did not need his company in the waiting
room during the Olympics in Atlanta, Naoya's first Olympic
competition. ``He sent his father back out to watch the action,
telling him, `You don't have to come with me, Papa,''' Takamiya
said.
</P>
<P>
   Naoya said he could sense that there were great expectations for
him at the Olympics. ``But my state of mind really hasn't
changed,'' he said during the brief interview, ``although having
said that, I would add that I do have higher spirits these days.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest concern is injuries, a fear his mother shares. He
has a keen sense of his boundaries and accepts them. ``From now
until the Olympics, I will not try to stretch too much, reach too
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has been practicing since first grade, deciding then to give
up a passion for soccer for his parents' sport. His father said
Naoya lost some enthusiasm for gymnastics in his adolescence, but
Naoya himself has a different recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was little, I have been in this environment,'' he
said. ``I've played in this gym since I was young. So it feels
natural that this is what I'm doing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NUUK, Greenland _ During World War II, when Henry Larsen took a
Royal Canadian Mounted Police ship, the St. Roch, into the fabled
Northwest Passage, his boat was frozen in Arctic ice through two
winters, only emerging at the eastern end after 27 months.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the St. Roch II completed a voyage over the same
route in one month, including leisurely overnight stops at
communities visited by the namesake boat half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Tuktoyaktuk, near Canada's border with Alaska, the
boat traversed all of Canada's Arctic without encountering pack
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concern should be registered with the fact we didn't see any
ice,'' the skipper, Sgt. Ken Burton of the Mounties, said on Sunday
over a maritime telephone as he took the police boat into open
waters across Baffin Bay from Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Safely out of the passage, he said: ``There were some bergs, but
nothing we saw to cause any anxiety. We saw some ribbons of
multiyear ice floes, all small and fragmented, and were able to
steer around them.'
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians' ice-free passage through their nation's northern
waters is the latest evidence that Arctic ice is melting in the
summer more extensively than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In a trend that scientists attribute to changing winds and
rising temperatures, submarine sonar probes indicate that the
thickness of polar ice is only 58 percent of what it was in the
1950s. Satellite photographs show that the polar ice cap at the
time of maximum summer melt _ about now _ has been reduced by about
6 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know enough about the Arctic to know if this is
global warming, climate change or maybe we were just plain lucky,''
Burton said as he took his boat south, planning to arrive in
Halifax on Oct. 9 or 10 and New York a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way the crew of the St. Roch and a support ship, the
Simon Fraser, found a chilling reminder of how harrowing the Arctic
can be: a skull and the graves of six men believed to have perished
in the late 1840s as part of the ill-fated Franklin expedition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1845, Sir John Franklin set out from Britain with 128 men and
two ships, the Erebus and the Terror, trying to find the Northwest
Passage. The ships were last spotted frozen in the ice in 1847, but
their fate has remained a mystery. In the decade that followed, 32
rescue parties searched for the ships and their crews.
</P>
<P>
   Until two weeks ago, only about 30 bodies had been recovered.
Autopsies of those earlier bodies indicated that some men had died
of lead poisoning from canned food and that the starving survivors
had resorted to cannibalism before they, too, perished in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Mounties were led to the six newly found graves by Louie
Kamookak, an Inuk hunter who once heard his grandfather tell of how
he had fashioned an ice pick from a knife he had found at an old
campsite where plates and knives were scattered about.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the six grave sites, there was a cooking and
fire pit that looked like it had been used for an extended period
of time,'' Burton said. The bodies were found on a desolate beach
in the Todd Island group, about 30 miles south of Gjoa Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Kamookak, a self-described Franklin buff, has said that by using
tales from village elders, he has been able to locate many markers
and artifacts left by early Arctic explorers, including as many as
seven more Franklin sites. He told the Canadian Press: ``There's
other stuff. But one day I'm hoping to write my own book, and I'm
saving it for that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and environmentalists are trying to figure out if
commercial ships will be able to cross the Canadian Arctic on a
regular basis in the late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a risky venture,'' Burton said, ``but the day of
the famed Northwest Passage, the shortcut to the Orient may be just
around the corner.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The possibility of such a maritime route has intrigued
sovereigns and ship captains since the time when Queen Elizabeth I
wished Martin Frobisher godspeed as he sailed from London, bound
for the Arctic, in 1575. He was not successful. The passage was
first navigated in 1903 by Raold Amundsen, a voyage that took three
years.
</P>
<P>
   A shipping channel over the top of North America would cut 5,000
miles off the Panama Canal route now used by freighters going from
Rotterdam to Yokohama. Not by chance, one passenger who traveled on
the St. Roch II for a few days this summer was a reporter for a
Rotterdam newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the ship through the 10,000-mile maze of channels
and islands that constitutes the Northwest Passage, Burton
cautioned that the Arctic ``is a very fickle environment.'' He was
speaking shortly after leaving Pond Inlet, an Eastern Arctic town
where the three crew members of a Norwegian boat attempting the
passage were recuperating after their boat flipped over.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he knew of two other boats that successfully
navigated the passage this summer: a New Zealand sailboat, the
Evco, which is now heading to Greenland, and the United States
Coast Guard cutter Healy. In late July the U.S. ship, a new
icebreaker, had to cut through heavy ice in areas where, one month
later, the St. Roch II found open water.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is essential, Stephen Rybak, spokesman for the St. Roch
II, said from Vancouver, where he is raising money to restore the
original St. Roch, which is deteriorating from dry rot.
</P>
<P>
   Before shipping executives try a northern short cut, he warned,
their captains should know that they will have to slip through two
``gates'' _ one off Barrow, Alaska, the other in the McClintock
Channel, a north-south waterway in the middle of the Canadian
Arctic. There, winds can clog channels with ice.

 &HT;    Diamondbacks, Braves to square off in pitching showdown
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sensing movement in the continental plates, the
baseball press did what is paid to do last July 31 when Curt
Schilling went back home and joined the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The press promptly rushed to judgement.
</P>
<P>
   The Sporting News determined Schilling and Randy Johnson as
``baseball's most formidable 1-2 punch.'' Baseball Weekly, with
Schilling giving a thumbs-up from the cover, called his move from
Philadelphia the best of trading season that ``puts the
Diamondbacks pitching staff over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons were even made to the Sandy Koufax-Don Drysdale
reign of terror that defined the Dodgers' first years in Los
Angeles. And why not? In their final eight seasons together when
they dominated the National League, Koufax and Drysdale led the
league in strikeouts seven times. Schilling and Johnson in the last
eight years have led the NL in strikeouts six times, with Johnson
destined to make it seven this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many writers now, that everybody has to have
something different or something new,'' Greg Maddux said. ``It was
appropriate at the time, an appropriate thing to write about and
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Atlanta Braves have their first opportunity to
respond. With the Diamondbacks in town for a three-game series
starting tonight, Johnson faces Tom Glavine in the first game with
a Maddux-Schilling match-up following Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, except for Glavine, the quartet has not exactly been
at the top of its game lately. But forget about that. Each has a
deep big-game history. Just recall Schilling's shutout performance
at Turner Field May 6 for the Phillies, when just six days after
coming off the DL, he was still hitting 95 mph in the ninth inning,
when he struck out the side.
</P>
<P>
   This week is a reminder that even in the midst of the game's
unprecedented offensive boom, September should be about pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare, especially right now with the offense the way that
it is, to have a series where pitching will get so much of the
attention,'' said Glavine, whose 18 wins leads the NL.
</P>
<P>
   After losing 10-1 at Florida last Saturday, Schilling has lost
four of his last five starts, giving up 17 earned runs in 20
innings to bottom-feeders Milwaukee, Montreal and the Marlins.
Johnson, after a 14-2 first half, is 3-3 since the All-Star break
with opponents batting nearly .265 against him. In the first half,
they hit .193.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been a whole lot of fun to be around the past
month,'' Johnson said last week. ``It's been frustrating. I take a
lot of pride in what I do and feel like I'm not doing what I'm
supposed to be doing since the all-star break.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Johnson could be pitching right-handed and the same hype
that warmed up the Schilling trade would perk again this week. The
reason: the fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys are known for being power pitchers and striking
people out and lighting up the radar gun,'' Glavine said. ``And
Greg and I don't. We get people out with ground balls or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come watch Greg and me pitch, you're not going to leave
the ballpark with this feeling of `Wow.' But with Randy and
Schilling, you might. There might be 10 or 15 punch-outs. That's
what grabs peoples' attention. Strikeouts and the long ball are the
fashionable thing in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling and Johnson make some interesting comparisons to
Koufax and Drydale. The two Dodgers over the last eight years they
pitched together struck out a combined 3,760 batters, just 149 more
than the two Diamondbacks, and made the All-Star team 12 times
compared the Schilling's and Johnson's nine.
</P>
<P>
   But Glavine and Maddux comes closer to Koufax and Drysdale in
victories (288 to 273) over those eight years and actually have a
best winning percentage (.693) of the three duos. Glavine and
Maddux's ERA (2.86) can't match Koufax and Drysdale (2.74), who
recorded more shutouts (70) in their last eight years than Glavine,
Maddux, Schilling and Johnson combined (59).
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be surprised when someone who hit it fair off Koufax
and I'd be surprised whenever anyone would have a stable front leg
against Drysdale,'' said Braves broadcaster Don Sutton, a
21-year-old rookie in the 1966 Dodgers rotation, which wound up
being Koufax's final season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought two different styles of pitching. But the things
you could always count on was that they were going to make their
starts, they were going to stay out there until you took a fork
lift out there to go get them and you knew when they were out
there, you had a chance to win every ball game. Not some of them or
most of them but you had a chance to win every one.''
</P>
<P>
   All those traits will be evident these next three nights at
Turner Field, where style will clash, if not intent. Five weeks
after Schilling returned to his old hometown, the game finally gets
to grade a trade that set a million tongues wagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dominant whether you get outs with fly balls, ground
balls, strikeouts,'' said Atlanta's John Burkett, who has witnessed
12 years of major league pitching. ``It doesn't matter. You're
doing it. The guys have a low-3, high-2 ERA, they're doing it every
fifth day, don't miss any starts. I think that's impressive. That's
dominant. It doesn't matter how it gets done.''

CBS AND ABC OBJECT TO BUSH'S PROPOSAL FOR DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two television networks that were left out of Gov. George W.
Bush's plan to impose his own schedule of debates declared Monday
that they had no intention of carrying presidential debates
sponsored by rival networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush proposal, announced on Sunday after intense
negotiations with officials of six cable and broadcast networks,
has thrown into turmoil the work of the Commission on Presidential
Debates, the panel created in 1987 by the Democrats and the
Republicans to avoid squabbling over the debates. Since the
creation of the panel, no candidate has gone so far as Bush has
gone to circumvent its work.
</P>
<P>
   But on the campaign trail Monday, Bush said that by rejecting
his proposal, Gore was ducking debates and going back on his word
to face off with him at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, the commission's executive director, said that the
panel has asked officials of both the Bush and Gore campaigns to
meet in Washington this week to work out an agreement under which
Bush would consent to the commission's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe our proposal is the best one,'' Brown
said. ``I believe the campaigns when they say they want to debate
in a way that reaches the maximum number of people, and the way to
do that is to implement the commission's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the commission announced its plans for three
90-minute debates in October on college campuses in Boston,
Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis, a plan that Vice President Al
Gore quickly endorsed. On Sunday, Bush unveiled his own proposal,
which would include the commission-sponsored debate in St. Louis,
but would substitute the others with two one-hour encounters, one
next week on a prime-time edition of ``Meet the Press'' with Tim
Russert on NBC, and the other on Oct. 3 on CNN's ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission was established not only to eliminate this sort
of jockeying, but also to ensure that the debates could be seen by
the most viewers across as many channels as possible. In one debate
in 1992, for instance, 92 million viewers tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   But executives of networks that were turned down by Bush made it
clear that they would not devote air time to what they viewed
chiefly as promotional opportunities for Russert and King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it might be in the interest of some of the
parties involved to call them debates, but these are basically
versions of existing talk shows, and we don't normally air other
people's talk shows,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS
News.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, the executive vice president of ABC News, echoed
Heyward, saying, ``It's very unlikely we would cover other
networks' programs, and that is essentially what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC News and CNN said Monday that they would make their
debates available to competing networks in what is known as a
``clean feed'' _ a transmission that leaves off the originating
network's identifying symbol in the corner of the screen. In
addition, NBC and CNN said they would carry each other's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush continued to batter each other with the debate
issue Monday. While aides to Gore called Bush arrogant for his
rejection of the commission plan, the Bush camp reminded reporters
that the vice president had agreed to debate the governor anywhere,
anytime. Gore has said he would do the debates on ``Meet the
Press'' and ``Larry King Live'' if Bush agrees to the commission
debates.
</P>
<P>
   And though Gore insisted he would never agree to Bush's
conditions, aides to Bush said they remain convinced that if
pressure were brought to bear on the vice president to appear with
Bush on the two programs, other networks would be compelled to put
the debates on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do suspect that if Al Gore were to show up on `Meet the
Press,''' said one top Bush official who demanded anonymity, ``all
the networks, with their dedication to public service, would be
hard-pressed not to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, however, that many of the networks were feeling
slightly uncomfortable over any role they might be playing in
subverting the work of the debate commission. Privately, some
broadcast journalists expressed outrage at what they viewed as the
networks allowing themselves to be used by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here is a maneuvering for position, and
journalists should be very wary of getting roped into that,'' said
Heyward of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, CBS was among the networks that made a pitch to
Bush for a debate on ``Face the Nation.'' Heyward explained,
however, that he made it a condition that such a debate could only
happen if the commission's plan fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get drawn into where the network broadcasts
were used as bargaining chips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its offer letter, CNN wrote both campaigns that its debate
would ``encompass a typical `Larry King Live' format.'' The network
proposed two coin tosses _ ``one for seat preference and one for
question order'' _ and asserted that the program would not take
viewer calls or use video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wheatley, vice president of NBC News, said his network had
long ago made an offer to both camps for a ``Meet the Press''
debate. ``And in recent weeks,'' he added, ``as it became clear
that there was going to be further discussion on the nature of the
debates, we pressed home that request, saying that `you could have
a `Meet the Press' in prime time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, NBC found itself in the position of being championed by
the Bush campaign over the debate issue. In an e-mail message to
reporters Monday, Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said Gore was
now ``backpedaling'' from a commitment made months ago to debate on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes the first debate should allow for more
than just sound bites; it should feature an in-depth discussion of
the issues and have tough questioning,'' Fleischer wrote. ``Having
the first debate on `Meet the Press' will allow such an exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley, however, brushed aside any suggestion that the Bush
campaign was using NBC as a means of undoing the commission. He
added that scheduling the program in September would be a service
to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our proposal gives the public an opportunity
to give these men a chance to debate a month earlier,'' he said.
``Otherwise, the commission debates don't begin until October.''
</P>
<P>
   For the debate commission, the Bush plan is a potentially
serious disruption of its mission. ``All the debates have been in
communities, on campuses, or in towns,'' Brown said. ``These are
the single set of political events that the public still thinks
belongs to them. We believe taking them to communities where
thousands of young people can participate is a very good thing that
can't take place if you do two debates in television studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she hopes to be able to convince Bush's aides that
the commission plan is an enhanced version of the proposal they
have offered. ``We think campuses are preferable to studios,'' she
said, ``and we belive that six networks are preferable to one or
two.''

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP THAT FAVORED NADER ENDORSES GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Friends of the Earth, an environmental group
that had endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and
seriously flirted with supporting Ralph Nader in the general
election, has decided to endorse Vice President Al Gore, officials
with the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement, which will be announced in Oregon on Tuesday,
is another sign that Gore is moving swiftly to consolidate his
support in the Democratic Party's liberal wing, much of which had
balked at supporting him up until just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Earth, considered the most left-leaning of the
three national environmental groups that endorse candidates, has in
the past sharply criticized Gore and the Clinton administration on
a variety of issues, including their support for fewer restrictions
on global trade and their failure to do enough to slow global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, said in an
interview on Sunday that the organization's political action
committee had agonized over whether to support Nader, the Green
Party candidate for president, because he shared their views on
trade and many other major issues. By comparison, the group said in
a statement, it ``knows the environmental disappointments with
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blackwelder said the organization concluded that endorsing
Nader would be tantamount to helping to elect Gov. George W. Bush,
the Republican nominee. And he said that Gore's environmental
positions were far better than those of Bush, which he asserted
would ``plunge us into a dark age'' of environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the reality here,'' he said. ``In the United
States, third parties do not get elected to the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Blackwelder asserted that Gore would spend more
money on environmental programs, select more environmentally
concerned judges for the federal bench and appoint more
environmentally conscious administrators to federal agencies than
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though Friends of the Earth is relatively small and has little
money to invest in campaigns, it is potentially influential with
liberal voters. Blackwelder said he and other leaders of his group
would be traveling to swing states where Nader has been running
strong, including Oregon, Washington, New Mexico and Michigan, to
encourage potential Nader voters to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, the two
other national environmental groups that publicly support national
candidates, have already endorsed Gore.

COMMENTARY: A RUSSIAN DINOSAUR
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk was a tragic but
incredibly illuminating example of the transition the world, and
Russia, are now going through from the Cold War system to the
globalization system. Unfortunately, there's always some guy down
the line who hasn't gotten the word yet. In this case, it was
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Putin, this ain't your father's Soviet Union anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Russian TV following the Kursk tragedy, Putin
defended his government and laid out his priorities: ``I will be
with the army. I will be with the fleet. I will be with the
people.'' As Time magazine's Paul Quinn-Judge noted in a commentary
from Moscow, Putin still believes that ``the needs of the state
always come first; individual concerns come a distant second.``
</P>
<P>
   Not in this era. What happens when a country like Russia plugs
into globalization _ into global free markets, telecommunications,
media and the Internet _ is that individuals become empowered, even
super-empowered. That is, their ability to gather information
themselves, earn a living and assert their will directly _ as
individuals _ greatly increases thanks to globalization and the
falling of walls everywhere. Moreover, when everyone starts to know
how everyone else in the world is living, which also happens in
globalization, individuals start to demand the same things. And
they get angry when their leaders don't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk incident showed just how much the Russian people are
starting to get this, and how little Putin does. Why did Putin and
his generals resist asking for foreign help until it was too late?
Because they feared it would sully the honor of Mother Russia's
army and puncture Russia's pretense to still being a superpower.
But the families of the Russian sailors, who knew foreign help was
available, told them: ``I don't want to hear about Mother Russia,
or Father Russia. I want Yuri, Boris and Oleg off the ocean
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The message those parents sent to Russia's leaders was that
``until further notice, you better have a good reason to risk a
Russian soldier's life,'' remarked the Israeli political theorist
Yaron Ezrahi, whose book, ``Rubber Bullets,'' documents how Israel
went through a similar transformation. ``They sent a message that
while national honor still matters, individual life and individual
aspirations now matter too. They are now viable competitors with
national honor _ and may matter even more. So it's not only
Americans who don't want to die for abstractions anymore. It's also
Russians.``
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Russian newspaper Izvestia ran a front-page picture
of the crew of the Kursk, under a remarkable headline: ``The Price
of National Pride _ Human Lives.'' Such a headline, with such an
equation, would have been unthinkable in the Cold War, but it is
utterly normal in globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Putin can still send Russian soldiers to die in Chechnya,
because many Russians still perceive that as a war of no choice
against a real internal threat. But with the collapse of the Cold
War system, they do not perceive an external threat. Indeed, most
Russians would like to emulate America today, not bury it. And vice
versa. Americans also prayed for the Kursk to be saved. Because
without the Cold War psychological framework, the Kursk disaster
was not seen as an enemy loss. It was seen as a human loss.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that Russia will now have to fold its army and
navy? Of course not. Russian nationalism and national security
interests haven't gone away. But they now have a viable competitor
in shaping Russian decision-making: the aspiration of individual
Russians for personal security and personal fulfillment _ which
today's globalization system encourages, by giving more Russians
the information, connections, power and incentives to act on their
own for their own betterment.
</P>
<P>
   So everything is still possible with Russia. It's still possible
that an autocratic Russian leader will try to restore Russian
military power and provoke a war with the U.S. Yes, that is still
possible. But in today's era of globalization it is much less
sustainable. Because Russians will not automatically put up with
pain and sacrifice anymore just to preserve some national symbols.
Not in this world. That was the Kursk's crew's last message _ a
message Russian leaders ignore at their peril.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday ends the second straight summer travel season of chronic
flight delays and cancellations across the United States, and
despite spending billions of dollars and repeated warnings in the
last decade of impending air traffic gridlock, there is no solution
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts now believe that delays, which have risen nearly 50
percent during the last five years, will become worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic
system, predicts that by 2010 the number of airline passengers will
rise 59 percent, to 1 billion. About 70 percent of that increase is
expected to occur at the country's 28 largest airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything on the drawing board right now
that you can say with any credibility is the answer,'' said Kenneth
Mead, the inspector general of the Transportation Department,
parent agency of the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish there was a silver bullet,'' said Jane Garvey, the FAA
administrator, ``but there is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the nation's air travel system reached its
current crisis can be traced back to one of the government's most
successful economic initiatives _ airline deregulation _ and to one
of its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the FAA's
attempts to develop a new air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines blame the FAA because of an antiquated air traffic
control system. The FAA counters that airlines knowingly schedule
more takeoffs and landings at major airports than the system can
handle. And both the FAA and airlines attack Congress for not
appropriating enough money to fix the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten down to a big finger-pointing contest,'' said
Thomas Brantley, national vice president of the Professional
Airways System Specialists, the union of technicians who maintain
the FAA's air traffic control equipment. ``The reality is,
everybody's got blame to share.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors at work, too.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years of economic growth has filled airplanes to near
capacity, even as consumers complain about high fares. An unusual
spate of thunderstorms this summer frequently left controllers with
few avenues to reroute air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to air traffic control gridlock, whenever it comes,
will involve new technology that lets controllers track more planes
in the sky _ and, possibly, economics that let market forces
allocate the system's scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
   TRAFFIC CONTROL IN TRANSFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, life was much simpler for airlines and air
traffic controllers. Government regulators told the airlines when
and where they could fly, and how much they could charge.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation of the industry in 1978 transformed air travel into
mass transportation. Today, the airline industry carries three
times as many passengers as it did in 1978 at average fares that
are 40 percent lower, adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But while the industry was transformed, the air traffic control
system has remained virtually unchanged. At its heart are a
collection of ground-based navigation beacons and radar stations
that divide the 3.5 million square miles of airspace over the
continental United States into lanes, literal highways, along which
most airplanes are dispatched single file, like railroad cars.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has long stipulated that planes be separated by at least
five miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. That clogs the
routes taken by the 20,000 scheduled flights each day.
</P>
<P>
   When a storm hits, controllers begin closing off individual
highways and spacing planes farther apart, regardless of original
scheduling, contributing to delays on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the weather is perfect, departures are not spread
evenly throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Mead, the Transportation Department's inspector general, found
that airlines frequently schedule flights beyond an airport's
capacity even in perfect weather, let alone factoring in bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   FROM BRAINSTORM TO BOONDOOGLE
</P>
<P>
   The growth in air traffic was supposed to be managed by a
sophisticated control system that the FAA began developing in 1981.
In the wake of that year's air traffic controller's strike, when
11,000 controllers were fired by President Reagan, the FAA began
looking for a system that could manage more traffic with fewer
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   What came to be known as the Advanced Automation System, was the
centerpiece of a 10-year, $12 billion plan to modernize air traffic
control.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a white elephant. In 1994, after its cost
had tripled, the system's capabilities were shown to be much less
than promised and it was still 10 years from completion, the FAA
decided to scale back the project. The cost, according to the
General Accounting Office, amounted to $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Aviation Administration currently lacks the
organizational, management, and financial wherewithal to keep pace
with the dynamic aviation community,'' the National Civil Aviation
Review Commission, a panel set up by Congress, concluded in 1996.
The Commission also warned at the time that ``rapidly growing
demand combined with a reduction in capacity, as the result of
continued reliance on outdated equipment, will bring our nation's
aviation system to gridlock soon after the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A NEW STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   After the debacle with the Advanced Automation System, the FAA
adopted a more modest approach to modernizing air traffic control _
a strategy Garvey, the administrator since 1997, summed up as
``build a little; test a little; deploy a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA replaced its old mainframe computers with newer models
and installed color radar displays. Computer system crashes, which
in the 1990s frequently forced controllers to track jets on slips
of paper, are now rare.
</P>
<P>
   But many problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   The new mainframe computers that form the heart of the air
traffic system are IBM models built in the 1990s that have already
gone out of production. The FAA could not buy IBM's newest machines
because they would not run the 1960s-era programming language used
in the system's software.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also had high hopes for a plan called the Wide Area
Augmentation System, intended to use the constellation of military
satellites that make up the Global Positioning System to enable
planes to fly virtually independent of controllers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be operating by 1998, but it also proved much
more complicated _ and expensive _ than the FAA first thought.
</P>
<P>
   The system was made available on a limited basis last week, but
is not scheduled to be completed until 2002. Few believe it will
make a significant contribution toward reducing delays.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the FAA is working on deploying a series of discrete
systems designed to improve the efficiency of takeoffs and landings
at busy airports and to allow some airplanes to fly more direct
routes. But these improvements will not come close to addressing
the long-term growth in air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can make some changes,'' said Steven Brown, the
FAA's acting associate administrator for air traffic services.
``Those will be marginal _ not unimportant, but marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   REVOLUTIONIZING THE AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   Such talk fuels critics who say that the only way to end the
impending gridlock in the skies is to junk the FAA _ or junk the
economics on which its management of the air traffic system is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Federal air traffic control services are paid for by taxes on
airline tickets, cargo and fuel. Users like commercial airlines do
not pay any more to use the system than private pilots; small
planes get the same priority as jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the resources are not priced properly,''
said Richard Golaszewski, a consultant who has advised the FAA and
several European countries. ``In fact, they are not priced at
all.'' That means that airlines have no incentive to limit their
use of air traffic control services even at the most crowded
airports.
</P>
<P>
   For years, economists have urged the government to switch to a
fee-based system that would force users to pay for the services
they use. Raising prices at peak hours would put pressure on
airlines to reduce congestion. They might also switch service to
underutilized secondary airports, or replace some smaller jets with
less frequent service on bigger planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the unfinished business of deregulation,'' Golaszewski
said. ``We have taken off all of the controls on what airlines can
do, but we haven't done anything to balance demand and capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates go farther and say that the air traffic control
system needs to be separated from the FAA and handed over to a new,
independent entity that would operate like a business.
</P>
<P>
   A plan that the Clinton administration sent to Capitol Hill in
1994 as part of Vice President Al Gore's campaign to reinvent
government never got out of committee, even though the House was
still controlled by Democrats at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Various privatization proposals have been floated in Congress
during the years, but none have made any progress.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA is already beginning to act more like a business.
Congress passed legislation a few years ago creating a 15-member
advisory council to supervise the agency. A bill passed this spring
directed the council to hire a chief operating officer to run the
air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also increased the FAA's budget by $10 billion during
the next three years to $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent public outcry about flight delays, interest in
privatization is on the rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Nav Canada, the only private company in the world to run a
national air traffic control system, has proven the most intriguing
to policy makers in Washington. Before the nonprofit corporation
was set up in 1996, the Canadian air traffic control system
suffered many of the same problems that plague the FAA: Its
equipment was antiquated, and a proposed replacement was behind
schedule and far over budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nav Canada has managed to reduce air traffic delays,
cut costs and revamp its technology. A cost-accounting system
enables the company to charge users by the flight. Managers who
worked under both systems say the new arrangement has enhanced
safety, precisely because regulation and operations have been
assigned to two different organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that if we have one more summer as bad as this
one, or even one worse than this one, finally it will force the
issue,'' said John Meyer, a retired economics professor at Harvard
who is in favor of introducing user fees.  &QL;

AS DIPLOMACY LOSES LUSTER, YOUNG STARS FLEE STATE DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At 32, Mona Sutphen, smart, driven and possessed of
that quality so elusive in Washington, an easy personality, was
known as one of the best and the brightest in the West Wing of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   As executive assistant to the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, she was trusted to work on the most sensitive foreign
policy matters. She sat through the tough crises, including whether
to bomb Iraq and how to rescue an American pilot downed in enemy
Yugoslav territory. Had she wanted, Sutphen, who was on loan from
the State Department, could have gone to the heights of the U.S.
Foreign Service: political counselor at an embassy, assistant
secretary of state or an ambassador. Perhaps even the top job one
day.
</P>
<P>
   But those peaks did not look so great to Sutphen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning to the State Department and a future of
writing cables that she felt nobody important read, she took her
passion for foreign affairs to an Internet company. She is a prime
example of what policy experts say is a crippling problem at the
State Department: talented diplomats are leaving for careers that
they believe have more power and prestige in the new global
economy. And college graduates who used to rush to take the Foreign
Service exam no longer bother.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as the State Department, the institution responsible
for American diplomacy around the world, is finding it hard to
adjust to an era in which financial markets pack more punch than a
Washington-Moscow summit meeting. It is losing recruits to
investment banks, dot-com companies and the Treasury and Commerce
Departments, which have magnified their foreign policy roles. Some
are turning to idealistic private organizations that work in risky
environments abroad, a far cry from the days of the Cold War, when
the State Department was the only place to be.
</P>
<P>
   When Sutphen prepared to leave the State Department this spring,
the Foreign Service made her decision easier because, while it took
great pride in her as a woman of African-American heritage, it
offered her nothing that she found challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end there was nothing on the horizon that I really
wanted,'' she said. After the hothouse of the National Security
Council at the White House, and having served in Bosnia and
Thailand, the ``idea of being the third political officer on the
Israeli desk is very difficult.'' Instead, she chose to join the
Manhattan office of Currenex, a Silicon Valley Internet company
that specializes in business-to-business foreign currency trading,
at a salary of more than $100,000 _ more than twice her government
pay _ plus stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of prestige and power at the State Department has not
gone unnoticed around Washington or inside the department itself.
What to do about it has consumed study groups and consultants and
caused internal hand-wringing among the top echelon of State
Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the department was so worried about the problem that
two years ago it commissioned a study from a consulting firm,
McKinsey &AMP; Co. The results , with recommendations to be carried out
this year, were not flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Young diplomats told the consultants that they were frustrated
by slow promotions in the bureaucracy compared with promotions
based on merit in the private sector. They questioned the relevance
of their work. ``The best for what work?'' parried one respondent.
</P>
<P>
   They were dismissive of what they described as a demoralized
management. They complained that the department was unresponsive to
the demands of two-career couples, especially when sending
diplomats abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``The War for Talent'' _ tellingly renamed
``The War Against Talent'' in the department's corridors _ quoted
one diplomat as saying, ``You've joined the supposedly elite
Foreign Service and you have terrible managers _ people who've been
promoted to get them out of other people's hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the department, the U.S. Commission on National
Security/21st Century, set up by the federal government to study
the nation's needs for its national security architecture, has
taken a particular interest in the failings of the State
Department. The commission's executive director, Gen. Charles G.
Boyd, said he had been taken aback by the difficulty the department
had in ``retaining and recruiting quality people.''
</P>
<P>
   At elite graduate schools specializing in international
relations, deans say that the Foreign Service has slipped down the
totem pole as a career choice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, smart graduates who want to join government are heading
for the Departments of the Treasury or Commerce, said Mark L. von
Hagen, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University.
Others gravitate toward nongovernmental organizations and to the
World Bank. ``It reflects the generally diminished role of the
State Department in foreign policy,'' von Hagen said.
</P>
<P>
   The new director-general of the Foreign Service at the State
Department, Marc Grossman, who is in essence the department's chief
personnel officer, acknowledged the problem when he appeared before
the Commission on National Security recently.
</P>
<P>
   The dropout rate for one of the five groups of diplomats who
entered the State Department in 1992 or 1993 was 32 percent, he
said. For another group in that two-year period the dropout rate
was 23 percent, although it was only 12 percent for two other
groups. From 1994 to 1997, the dropout rate has hovered around 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department's personnel department said
they did not have statistics to compare this dropout rate with
previous decades. Nor, they said, had the department done any
analysis to determine whether those who had left in the 1990s were
considered the most talented.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most senior officials at the State Department,
Undersecretary of States Thomas R. Pickering, who has served for
nearly 40 years and has been ambassador to eight countries, said he
did not believe that the dropout rates differed ``so wildly'' from
the past, particularly in the era of the Vietnam War when many
dissenters quit.
</P>
<P>
   But Boyd said that ``anecdotal'' evidence suggested that good
young diplomats had quit in the 1990s and that the dropout rate was
higher than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And for all those who are leaving, there are believed to be many
who are more than qualified but are not considering the Foreign
Service. Last year, said the undersecretary for management, Bonnie
R. Cohen, there was a ``significant'' drop in the number of
candidates who, after passing the written and oral exams of the
Foreign Service and the security checks, accepted an offer to join
the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means young people are looking elsewhere for other
jobs,'' said Cohen, who is in charge of budgetary and personnel
matters for the department.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Money _ in particular the large financial packages from merchant
banks that also offer stimulating work in the global economy _ is
proving an important, though not overriding, reason for officials
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The average starting salary for a new Foreign Service officer is
$32,500, Cohen said. This is less than some customer service agents
make at Verizon's union telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Peter E. Bass, 37 _ who after a meteoric career left the State
Department this summer to join Goldman Sachs as the chief of staff
for the bank's president and chief operating officer, John L.
Thornton _ is one of half a dozen officials who have been enticed
away in the last several years by Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to gain a knowledge of the financial world, the global
economy and capital markets, which are the key for global
prosperity,'' Bass said, explaining his decision to leave. He had
been deputy assistant secretary of state for energy and sanctions,
involved in policy toward Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wall Street salary was also a lure. ``When the
difference in money is arithmetic, it's bearable; when it's
geometric, it becomes harder and harder,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Grossman is appreciated as the new face of
personnel, though, is that he acknowledges that money is not the
only reason for losing good people. He knows, he said, that in
order to attract and keep talent, the department must evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department has to change from being one that went and
observed to one that sees itself in a more active world,'' Grossman
said. ``I can't give more people more money but I can give jobs
that are seen as more active and less passive.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be a hard argument to win. Many of the fields that
Grossman talks about being new to the State Department _
international trafficking in people, the environment, empowering
poor women _ are often handled by other American agencies operating
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, for example,
now operate at a number of American embassies. Rather than being
proud of this expansion, American diplomats view these agencies as
competitors for whom, they say, embassies perform the role of
``concierge.'' At the American Embassy in London, for example,
fewer than 20 percent of the officials belong to the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   There are other hurdles: most notably, the archaic way the State
Department hires people and treats them once they get inside. It
can take up to two years before a candidate, who has taken the
written exam (general knowledge, focusing on international affairs)
and the oral exam (problem solving) and passed the security
clearance, is invited to join the Foreign Service.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who have recently left the State Department argue that
the substance of the work must also change if good people are going
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a culture where you are told to make notes and send
them forward,'' said Spence Spencer, 38, who quit this summer after
12 years and three tours abroad. ``A lot of it is staffing to make
sure your boss looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, who celebrated his departure over several glasses of
wine at a recent lunch, left on a high note. He reached a cherished
goal: equipping 30 court buildings in Kosovo with computers, fax
machines, photocopiers, typewriters, generators and metal
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the department's Human Rights Bureau, Spencer
said there was much more in the field of human rights that he would
like to do at the State Department but felt he would be unable to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such disdain for the community of nongovernment
organizations at the State Department,'' said Spencer, whose
passion is elections, police, justice and the other ``soft'' issues
that crop up in regions of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``At State, you can't talk to these organizations with ease,''
he said. ``So you are left talking to each other.'' Spencer is
joining Public Strategies Inc., a company based in Austin, Texas.
He will specialize in public affairs for European companies
exporting to the United States and plans to do pro bono work for
international nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Another diplomat, Cynthia R. Bunton, 46, who dreamed of joining
the State Department from age 12, speaks four languages and has
served in a number of posts abroad. Now that she is back in
Washington, the department is unable to find a way to use her new
expertise in intellectual property rights, an increasingly vital
issue for American business.
</P>
<P>
   As the consul in Naples, Italy, for political and commercial
affairs, she became an expert in property rights and for the past
year has been on loan to the Recording Industry Association of
America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bunton said she realized the importance of economics in
diplomacy several years ago and decided to concentrate on music
piracy. ``The question is: Do I go backward and become a political
officer again _ which I have been all my life _ or go out into
private industry?'' she said. She still feels loyalty to the State
Department, but she is leaning, she said, toward leaving.
</P>
<P>
   One of those on the U.S. Commission on National Security, Leslie
H. Gelb, said that in order to keep people like Sutphen, Bass,
Spencer and Bunton, the State Department must make fundamental
changes to regain the prestige of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department will be able to attract anyone it wants
when once again the building becomes the center of making foreign
policy and foreign policy strategy,'' said Gelb, who is the
president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good people want to work at places that are at the center of
things.''

 &HT;    GM fills the garages of some lucky Olympic hopefuls
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a crowded Atlanta street, Kevin Young pulls over
and lowers the passenger-side window on his Pontiac Grand Prix.
``Hey, you like my new car?'' he calls to a familiar passerby.
</P>
<P>
   Nice, yeah. And free.
</P>
<P>
   The car is a gift from General Motors. With the Sydney Games on
the horizon, GM and co-sponsor, the United Automobile Workers, put
100 has-been and wanna-be Olympians behind the wheel of new cars
since December. The promotional venture carries with it a $3.5
million price tag.
</P>
<P>
   This is as close as some lucky athletes will get to hitting the
lottery. The cars come with no strings attached. Forget about
taxes, GM is handling that. And you keep your new car whether you
made the Sydney Olympic team or not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Young, whose best days were two Olympics ago in
Barcelona, didn't even bother to show up for the Olympic
track-and-field trials this summer to audition in the 400 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila also was given keys to a Grand Prix _ though the
women's pole vault world record-holder earned an estimated $500,000
last year in prize money, performance bonuses and other sponsorship
from Reebok and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Price-Smith, 37, retiring after her fourth Olympics was
handed the equivalent of a gold watch by the automaker _ a GMC
Envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Pro tennis players Jill Craybus and Jackie Trail both landed
Pontiac Montanas, though neither made the Sydney team.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Catherine Hearn, a 41-year-old kayaker who drove off
in a GMC Envoy.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 58 percent of the supposed Olympic hopefuls failed to
earn spots on the Sydney team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really set any objectives as far as a minimium
number (of Sydney Olympians),'' offered Matt Pensinger, sports
marketing manager for General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, GM's Team Behind the Team program turned over keys to a
hodge podge of recipients, with an average age of 27 years and more
than a quarter of the athletes over 30 _ 16 of whom didn't make the
Olympic team. It also rewarded 22 past Olympians, though 10 failed
to make the Sydney team.
</P>
<P>
   A handful, like Dragila, earn a nice living in their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Stacy a professional athlete?'' asked Ken Holder, a UAW
spokesperson for the program. ``I guess I didn't realize that. This
is the first I've heard about her having that kind of income.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the JK Group., which manages corporate philanthropic
programs, was hired to weed through the 1,800 applications before
passing them on to an athlete advisory group of ex-Olympians,
co-chaired by Grant Hill and Dorothy Hamill, and including Carl
Lewis, Evelyn Ashford, Bob Mathias, Pablo Morales and Kristi
Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered whether they were (professionals) a little bit,
yeah,'' said Hill, the NBA star. ``I don't know what other people
did, but I looked more for those who were in need and could truly
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the program benefitted the likes of rower Sarah
Garner (Buick Regal), who never had a chance for the 1996 team
because her old clunker blew a clutch while she was driving to the
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole specter of athlete support is a dicey subject
during an Olympic year, perhaps never more so than with the U.S.
Olympic Committee under new controversial executive director, Norm
Blake, who has expressed a willingness to link dollars to Olympic
medals. His bottom-line approach is to reward the medal winners and
sports that drive up TV ratings and attract corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, the U.S. Olympic Committee will provide monthly
support totaling $12.4 million to 850 athletes (an average of about
$15,000 annually per athlete) _ three-quarters of whom were in
training for Sydney and the rest for the 2004 Winter Games. That
doesn't count another $8 million in athlete support doled out
through something called Venture 2000, nor other grants or the
hundreds of athletes employed by Olympic sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, does the performance by General Motors, with 42 of
100 recipients making the Olympic team, mirror USOC efforts?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee isn't saying, but its own consulting
firm recently found that 40 percent of USOC support goes to sports
that rarely if ever win medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not release the names of athletes who receive our
support, or the figures (they receive),'' said Mike Moran, a USOC
spokesman. ``The only time we'll release the names or figures is in
response to athletes who say in the media, `I don't get any support
from the USOC.'''
</P>
<P>
   Here, General Motors _ domestic automobile sponsor of the USOC _
couldn't be more public, going so far on its website as to publish
the athletes' application letters and photos of each of them with
their new vehicle. It's good promotion for the millions they spent,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to award a similiar allotment of vehicles prior to the
2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, followed by another 100 cars
before the 2004 Athens Games.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of recent scandals afflicting the Olympic movement,
GM officials sought to provide direct help to athletes. Governing
bodies for the various sports _ such as USA Track and Field and
U.S. Swimming, for example _ were asked to provide a list of
Olympic hopefuls. That doesn't mean the governing bodies are all on
top of their game, however.
</P>
<P>
   Take hurdler Kevin Young.
</P>
<P>
   At the Barcelona Olympics, he set a world record of 46.78
seconds in the 400-meter hurdles, but he's evolved into the Howard
Hughes of the sport since 1994, rarely seen on the track and
showing his age (34 this month) when he's bothered to compete.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1994 that Young moved from Los Angeles, buying a
sprawling ranch home on 13 secluded acres north of Atlanta for
$359,000 _ hardly the purchase of a starving athlete. His car
collection included a Mercedes-Benz, Lexus SC 300 and Honda. He
signed a $100,000-a-year contract with Nike after the Barcelona
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he stopped competing and came upon hard times. He recently
moved to New York and his cars were ``sold to pay off some debts,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   So news that he fit the ``hopeful'' description and was awarded
a car surprised many in the sport _ including Derrick Adkins, 400
hurdles champ at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's funny because I applied and I didn't get it,'' said
Adkins, who retired after being eliminated in the semis at the
Olympic trials. ``I was closer than Kevin to making (the team). He
wasn't even there.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a flaw, GM says it's with the track federation.
``We're certainly not experts on who is a hopeful and who isn't,''
said Pensinger, GM's sports marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Track managed the most receipients, with 10 of the 19 new car
owners making the Sydney team _ most getting a Grand Prix. Water
sport athletes drove off in the purest luxury, Cadillac Devilles
</P>
<P>
   The best return on investment came in sailing (2), shooting (2),
tae kwon do (2), synchronized swimming (3) and men's water polo (4)
where they all made the team. The worst in boxing (2), swimming
(2), tennis (2), volleyball (3), table tennis _ where none made the
team.
</P>
<P>
   So in the future, how do you ensure car keys get in the hands of
Olympians? Grant Hill offered a solution bound to bring a smile to
athletes' faces _ give everybody that applies a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough and you have to have cutoff number, but it would be
nice to be able to help everybody,'' Hill said. ``And General
Motors can do that _ they have enough money.''

RUSSIAN MEDIA MAGNATE REPORTS KREMLIN IS TRYING TO SILENCE HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.20001995 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One of the country's media moguls, Boris Berezovsky,
said on Monday that a senior Kremlin official had ordered him to
transfer his holdings in Russia's primary state-owned television
channel to the state, or face the prospect of going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky made this assertion in a letter addressed to
President Vladimir Putin that was made available on Monday to The
New York Times and other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I agree to the ultimatum, television information will cease
to exist in Russia and be replaced by television propaganda,
controlled by your advisers,'' Berezovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``By issuing this ultimatum to me, you have in essence
put an important question before the country _ do non-state media
have the right to exist in Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Berezovsky did not detail the nature of the legal
threat he said he was facing, but said he was given two weeks to
dispose of his 49 percent holding in the television channel.
</P>
<P>
   In response, he said, he had decided to transfer that holding
``to journalists and other representatives of the creative
intelligentsia,'' for a form of ``public'' television.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the letter was nonetheless significant
because it underscored the unrelenting campaign by the Russian
president to take large holdings away from the oligarchs who took
them over under preferential conditions during the last decade, and
wielded them on the Kremlin's behalf, but now have taken a more
critical line toward Putin and his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was said to have been incensed when, during the
unsuccessful sea rescue of the nuclear submarine Kursk, the
Berezovsky station, ORT, aired interviews with family members of
the crew who were highly critical of the government's handling of
the failed operation.
</P>
<P>
   In his two-hour session with Kursk family members, Putin vented
his deep-seated anger at Russia's media barons, according to a
transcript in the weekly Vlast magazine, published by Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have embezzled enough, bought up the media and are now
manipulating public opinion,'' Putin said of them.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Putin's government arrested Vladimir Gusinsky, another
media baron, and held him at the notorious Butyrskaya Prison for
four days on embezzlement charges that were dropped after Gusinsky
met with Putin's chief-of-staff. Gusinsky then left the country and
has not returned.

 Waiting to Sell Merged Stock Has No Tax Advantage 
 &HT;     BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: I purchased shares in Snyder Oil Co. many years ago. It merged
with Santa Fe Energy Resources to become Santa Fe Snyder, and now
it has merged again with Devon. Devon gave me 0.22 shares of its
stock in exchange for every share of Santa Fe Snyder I owned. I may
want to sell some of my Devon shares before long. Must I wait 12
months to take advantage of the reduced tax rate on long-term
capital gains?
<P>
   A: You can sell your shares immediately, if you wish, and you
still will be able to categorize your gain as long term. That's
because the merger was considered a nontaxable event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, when a corporate merger takes effect and you trade
one stock for another, it is a nontaxable event and both your cost
basis and holding period carry over,'' says Internal Revenue
Service spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the long-term and short-term tax rates
can be significant.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in the 28 percent tax bracket, the tax on your
long-term gain will be capped at 20 percent. That's a tax saving of
$800 for every $10,000 worth of gains.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in the 15 percent bracket, the long-term tax will be
capped at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   First Sold, First Served
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that the IRS expects you to use the first in/first out
method when you sell part of your holdings in a stock _ unless you
inform your broker in advance specifically which shares you are
selling. But what if you hold shares in the same stock with two
different brokers? If you sell shares held by Broker A, but your
earliest share purchase was with Broker B, would the IRS assume
that you are selling the shares held by Broker B?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can understand why you would ask that question, because the
tax code often seems irrational and procrustean.
</P>
<P>
   But not in this case.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell shares held by Broker A, then the shares held by
Broker B don't figure in the calculation. If you are using the
first in/ first out method, then the shares you sell would be the
shares you bought first in your Broker A account.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, you will want to sell shares on which you have a
capital loss, to offset your taxable income. If you have only
gains, then you might find it best to sell shares on which the
gains are long term _ meaning that you have held the shares for at
least a year and one day. That's because of the markedly lower tax
rates on long-term capital gains. (See the item above.)
</P>
<P>
   As you indicate, you may also have the option of telling your
broker which shares you are selling _ assuming that you made more
than one purchase with that broker.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that is rarely, if ever, possible if you use a
broker that operates strictly online. Most such brokers aren't set
up to accommodate customers that way.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the penalties you pay for the opportunity to
trade securities at bargain-basement commission rates.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Sign Over Certificates
</P>
<P>
   Q: I notice that you commented recently about the virtues and
drawbacks of holding stock certificates, rather than depositing
them in a brokerage account. I have an account with E-Trade, and
want to sell some stock for which I hold the certificate. They have
asked me to sign the certificate over to them. Must I do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The certificate is official proof that you own your shares. If
you surrender ownership, then you must surrender the ownership
document.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: Suppose you want to sell your car. Do you
think anyone would buy it if you didn't hand over your ownership
papers?
</P>
<P>
   Well, come to think of it, somewhere in this wondrous world you
might find someone who will pay for the car and let you keep the
papers. But I don't think you will ever find a stockbroker who is
quite that intellectually challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stupidity: Don't forget to demand a receipt from
your broker, indicating the name of the company whose stock you are
selling, the number of shares you signed over and the certificate
number.

MANY VOTERS WARY OF CANDIDATES' RELIGIOUS TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ All the talk of faith and religion in the presidential
campaign might be expected to gain the attention of a voter like
Sarah Dotson, 28, who rose early Sunday morning to attend Mass at
Holy Ghost Roman Catholic Church here.
</P>
<P>
   She had noticed, all right. And that was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it makes me a little uncomfortable,'' said Dotson,
who clutched a prayer book as church bells pealed. ``I've heard
enough from the candidates about how they pray. I want to hear how
they're going to keep the economy going.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters could scarcely miss the expressions of religious faith by
candidates in this presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, declared a
``Jesus Day'' in his state. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
nominee, has described himself as a born-again Christian who often
asks himself, ``What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Leiberman of Connecticut, the Democratic
vice-presidential nominee, who is an Orthodox Jew, has urged that
religious faith play a stronger role in American life.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the soul baring by candidates, more than three dozen
voters interviewed around the country in the past few days
expressed little interest in weighing the religious convictions of
candidates in choosing the next president.
</P>
<P>
   As Kim Cart, a 29-year-old store clerk in Vinton, La., put it,
with a chuckle, ``As long as he's not into Satanic rituals, I
really don't care about a politician's religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who consider themselves religious, like Dee Bobbitt,
a 47-year-old waitress who teaches Sunday school and helps clean
the First Assembly of God Church in suburban Houston, did not place
much emphasis on the religious views of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care more if they're smart,'' said Bobbitt, who thinks
President Clinton ``has done a wonderful job,'' no matter that he
might not agree with her views on the sinfulness of drinking,
smoking, dancing and gambling, not to mention sex outside marriage.
``I'd like to say that it does matter if a president is religious,
but it just doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed also tended to express a skepticism about the
sincerity of the religious views of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Doby, a 41-year-old truck driver from Stockton, Calif.,
shook his head with impatience at the religious ponderings of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a way to try to get votes, that's all,'' said Doby,
who added that he did not believe in God. ``I'm jealous of people
who can go to church and find solace. I can't. Some people can, and
that's cool. But it's got nothing whatsoever to do with running the
country. It just doesn't have any relevance, and they ought to stop
talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaunessy McNeely, a 21-year-old nursing student, who attended
Riverside Baptist Church here, said she could not help noticing
that politicians are mostly like to preach to the choir or keep
quiet if they think an audience is not receptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus Day in Texas _ how hard is that?'' McNeely said
laughing, adding that it was scarcely a profile in religious
courage for Bush to issue such a proclamation in a state with so
many evangelical Christians. ``Is he going to go to San Francisco,
to Manhattan, and say, `Rah, rah, Jesus?' If he does, then I'll be
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   David Carey, a 48-year-old Roman Catholic who works for an
insurance company here, said he appreciated that candidates were
trying to ``invoke a higher moral standard.'' But Carey said it was
folly to try to assess which candidate seemed to be more religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the candidates talk about religion, I just ignore them,''
he said. ``It says more about what the politicians think of the
voters, and what they think the voters want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a few voters said the candidates should be talking
more about religion, not less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morals of the country are shot, and God is the only way to
bring things back,'' said Bruce Abel, a 53-year-old kitchen
designer, who was on his way to Riverside Baptist Church here.
``Belief in God has shaped this country from the founding, and
God's hand needs to be in politics today.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton had been more religious, Abel said, the nation would
not have been forced to endure the sex scandal that nearly drove
him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Clinton getting elected was all part of God's plan,'' he
said. ``It was part of a lesson for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters said it was healthy for candidates to talk about
religion, as long as they did not push a particular faith.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Goldberg, a 57-year-old math teacher from Shawnee
Mission, Kan., said he thought it was odd that people seemed
uncomfortable talking about religion but did not so much as shrug
over the saturation of sex and violence in today's culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that garbage out there, I would hope it would be
permissible to talk about God, too,'' Goldberg, an Orthodox Jew,
said. ``To me, religion is equated with morality. So I don't have a
problem with that. But it crosses the line when you promote a
particular religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates, Leiberman tended to be seen as the most
sincere about his expressions of faith. ``He doesn't just say it,''
Cart said, ``he lives it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rosenberg, a 61-year-old real estate investor here, who
described himself as a nonpracticing Jew, said he also admired
Leiberman. Nonetheless, Rosenberg said he wished the senator would
stop talking so much about religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion shouldn't be used as a marketing tool,'' he said,
supporting the call by the Anti-Defamation League for Leiberman to
refrain from talking about his religion. ``It's a private deal, so
keep it private.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among voters who said their religion shaped their voting,
there was plenty of disagreement about the political will of God,
judging from the disparate views among people who shared pews in
the same church.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Loper, a 61-year-old secretary who attended Holy Ghost
Church, said her convictions would prevent her from voting for a
candidate who supported abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's against church teachings,'' Loper said. ``It can't be any
clearer.'' She said she would be voting for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carrigan, 33, who also attended Holy Ghost, said his
faith also shaped his ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``My religion inspires my politics,'' Carrigan said. ``The
church calls us to social action and justice, to take care of the
less fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be voting for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Few voters seemed more troubled by the religious talk than John
Price, a 52-year-old management consultant, who was drinking coffee
at an outdoor cafe here.
</P>
<P>
   Price, a former resident of Oklahoma, recalled a conservative
politician in that state running on a campaign that focused on
``God, guns and gays.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Bush and Gore for making statements that ``smacked
of the cult of Jesus,'' appeals that he said risked dividing the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way religion is going to be an issue in the campaign
for me,'' Price said, ``is if somebody tries to force it on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he checked his watch, put down his coffee, and announced he
was in a hurry to leave.
</P>
<P>
   He was running late for church.

FIRESTONE REACHES ACCORD WITH UNION TO AVERT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE with RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for Bridgestone/Firestone and the union representing
8,000 of its workers reached a tentative settlement on Monday,
averting a strike that could have deepened the tire maker's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, reached at 2:30 a.m. after five days of marathon
talks, gives most union members a hefty pension increase and a
large pay raise, ranging from 12 percent to 25 percent over three
years, depending on a worker's base pay.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the United Steelworkers of America praised the
settlement for its generosity. Bridgestone/Firestone officials
hailed the accord because it would prevent a shutdown threatened at
9 of its 11 U.S. factories. ``The new agreement involves gains in
all areas,'' said Wayne Ranick, a union spokesman. He said the
ratification vote might take about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Katz, a professor of industrial relations at Cornell
University, called the agreement ``a pretty solid package,''
adding, ``Recent union settlements have been 3 to 4 percent a year,
and this seems much stronger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to repair its image and to recall and replace 6.5
million tires linked to accidents and scores of deaths,
Bridgestone/Firestone, a Japanese-owned concern, could have ill
afforded a strike. Union officials said a strike would have badly
delayed efforts to produce replacement tires, a process the company
says will take at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, federal officials said they were investigating
whether three Firestone brands were connected to 88 traffic deaths
in accidents possibly caused by tread loss or blowouts. In an
unusual move, federal regulators warned consumers on Friday that
1.4 million additional Bridgestone/Firestone tires the company has
refused to recall could pose safety risks and should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts said the union's strategy of threatening a strike
when Bridgestone/Firestone was so vulnerable appeared to have paid
off. Despite a reputation for fiercely battling unions, the
company, whose U.S. unit is based in Nashville, was far more
generous in the new settlement than one reached in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement took a rancorous 27 months, including a 10-month
strike during which the company enraged the union and the entire
labor movement by hiring 2,300 permanent replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Solomon, Bridgestone/Firestone's chief negotiator, said the
company was pleased with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the settlement is very fair and competitive for
both sides,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``We believe we
will be able to maintain our competitive position.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, actually three different agreements covering
nine plants, will give most of the 8,000 workers a retroactive
cost-of-living raise next month of about $1.60 an hour. That money
comes from a cost-of-living reserve that the company had not
distributed for several years because workers had not achieved
certain production goals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the workers will receive a raise of 20 cents an
hour when the contract is ratified, another 20 cents an hour on
Sept. 1, 2001 and 25 cents an hour more on Sept. 1, 2002. Beyond
that, the workers will receive quarterly cost-of-living
adjustments, no longer contingent upon their meeting production
goals.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the workers will receive raises of at least $2.25 an
hour over the contract's three years. Under the expired contract,
pay ranged from $9 an hour for new workers to $19 an hour for
experienced ones.
</P>
<P>
   At a picnic at a worker's home near the company's plant in
LaVergne, Tenn., nearly 100 union members were drinking beer,
playing volleyball and rejoicing. ``We came out real good,'' said
Mike Solomon, who has worked in the plant for 25 years. ``Now we
can get back to the business of building tires. We got a lot of
replacement tires to build. I think it's a good deal for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers were also jubilant about the pension increase. At
most of the factories, the settlement will lift the monthly pension
for a worker who retires with 30 years' experience to $1,500 a
month, from the old level of either $1,020 or $1,230, depending on
various factors.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Russell, who has worked for 12 years at the LaVergne
factory, said he was delighted by what would amount to an increase
of nearly 50 percent for many retirees. ``Everybody feels so good
about the contract,'' he said. ``The last eight years, they've
taken so much away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement also improves death benefits and
grievance procedures, and gives more weight to a workers' seniority
when factories fill certain jobs and work shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The union had threatened strikes at six factories covered by a
master contract that expired on April 23. They are in Akron, Ohio;
Decatur, Ill., Des Moines, Iowa; Noblesville, Ind.; Oklahoma City;
and Russellville, Ark. The strike would have also involved three
other factories _ in Bloomington, Ill., LaVergne, Tenn., and Warren
County, Tenn. _ covered by separate contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Under Monday's settlement, the LaVergne factory will be covered
by the master agreement, while Bloomington and Warren will still
remain under separate contracts.

temporary detention have been used to harass underground churches,
relatively few leaders are known to have been formally charged and

   CHRONIC FLIGHT DELAYS TIED TO DEREGULATION
</P>
<P>
   Most experts now believe that delays in the nation's air traffic
system, which have risen nearly 50 percent in the last five years,
will get worse, not better. The Federal Aviation Administration,
which runs the air traffic system, predicts that by 2010 the number
of airline passengers will rise 59 percent, to 1 billion. About 70
percent of that increase will occur at the country's 28 largest
airports. The story of how the nation's air travel system reached
its current crisis can be traced back to one of the government's
most successful economic initiatives _ airline deregulation _ and
to one of its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the
FAA's ill-fated attempts to develop a new air traffic control
system.

<P>
   The Israeli government announced that it was ending the state
telephone company's monopoly on domestic telephone and Internet
service, taking a long-resisted deregulatory move that sets the
stage for the company's sale to private investors later this year.
Bezeq, the state-owned telephone company, will now face competition
for the first time in Israel's domestic telephone and high-speed
Internet market, just months before the government plans to divest
its majority stake.

   INTERNET INITIATIVE PLANNED

intended to help locate products and services and automate business
transactions. Over 20 companies will initially endorse the
proposal, and the backers said they eventually planned to turn the
idea over to one of several Internet standards bodies in an effort
to make it a broadly backed initiative.

NEW INTEREST REPORTED IN LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Euronext, a company to be formed by merging the Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam bourses, has held exploratory talks with two
French banks about raising money to bid for the London Stock
Exchange, people close to the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Euronext approached BNP Paribas and Societe Generale after last
week's hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange by OM Gruppen AB,
the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm exchange. OM's surprise
offer postponed a shareholder vote that was to decide the fate of
London's planned merger with Deutsche Borse of Germany and the
Nasdaq stock market of the United States to form a Pan-European
exchange called iX.
</P>
<P>
   The people familiar with Euronext cautioned that an outright bid
for the London Stock Exchange was not imminent, as the company must
first vote on its own merger on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have increased the number of banks we are talking to, to
consider the present situation with the London Stock Exchange,''
said a person close to Euronext, who refused to be identified
further.
</P>
<P>
   Another person described the discussions as a ``chess move'' _
just one in a series of steps that Euronext is taking until it
unveils its full strategy sometime after the shareholder vote. The
Paris bourse will own 60 percent of Euronext, the Amsterdam
exchange will own 32 percent, and Brussels will hold 8 percent with
plans to offer the shares later this year.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Paris bourse declined to comment on the
situation, as did a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Euronext approached the London Stock Exchange about an alliance
last May, but was rebuffed. The details of those discussions were
never disclosed to shareholders. Euronext has repeatedly stated its
interest in linking up with the London Stock Exchange.

FIRESTONE AGREES TO RECALL 62,000 TIRES IN VENEZUELA 
</HEADLINE>
  By   LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Facing the threat of criminal and civil
actions here, Bridgestone/Firestone agreed on Monday to recall
62,000 tires that the Venezuelan government says had defects that
appear to have played a role in the deaths of at least 60 people in
automobile accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Ruh Rios, director of the Consumer Defense and Education
Institute, a government agency, announced the measure at a news
conference here and praised the company, which accounts for about
half of all tires sold here, calling its action ``a good sign.''
But he made it clear that Venezuela intends to press ahead with its
investigation into allegations that the company knew of defects in
tires manufactured here and in the United States and tried to cover
them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measure in no way exonerates Firestone from what we have
been pointing out, which is the shared responsibility of Firestone
and Ford in the design and selection of an inadequate tire,'' Ruh
said. He added that the prosecutor general will determine what
further action Venezuela's government will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, the Venezuelan consumer has won a battle'' and has
been ``somewhat compensated,'' Ruh added. ``But the consumer and
Indecu,'' the Spanish-language acronym by which the agency is
known, ``are still on a war footing, because we do not feel
satisfied by this type of action.''
</P>
<P>
   All but a handful of the fatal accidents being investigated by
the consumer protection agency occurred when Ford Explorer sports
utility vehicles with Firestone tires went out of control and
flipped over on highways here after their tires shredded or
exploded. For that reason, Ruh said on Monday, Ford also has a
moral and financial responsibility to Venezuelan consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggest to the Ford Motor Co. that they study a series of
measures to see if they too can aid in the search for the truth,''
he said. ``We don't blame the tire alone'' for the accidents, he
added, saying that an appropriate response by Ford would be to
``withdraw this model, substitute them and pay owners'' some form
of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The two varieties of Wilderness AT tires to be replaced, at an
estimated cost of $6.4 million, include, but are not limited to,
those often used on Ford Explorers. Ruh said the tire replacement
program would begin on Thursday and continue for about a month and
that it would affect not only Ford Explorers and other sports
utility vehicles but also some pick-up trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls made to the Bridgestone/Firestone plant in
Valencia, about 90 miles southwest of here, were referred to the
company's public relations representatives, and Ford did not
respond to requests for comment. A Firestone spokesperson, Milagros
Hinojosa, confirmed the tire recall but deferred further comment
until after publication of an announcement that she said would be
published in Venezuelan newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford have been under mounting fire
here since Venezuelan officials began their inquiry, alerted by a
similar investigation in the United States. Ruh said the Firestone
recall marked a significant shift from the company's previous
position, which was that ``only 3,000 tires imported from the
United States in 1995'' had the manufacturing defects and that
tires made in Venezuela did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to investigate, because we continue to receive new
complaints'' of faulty tires on Ford Explorers, Jorge Dominguez,
chief of the consumer protection agency's investigative division,
said in an interview this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The agency now estimates the number of accidents that occurred
after Firestone tires shredded at 74 and says that at least 60
Venezuelans died as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Ruh said that while his agency did not have the power to file
criminal or civil charges, both Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone
would be sent citations on Tuesday ordering them to participate in
a ``conciliation process'' at the consumer protection agency's
offices here next week. The purpose, he said, is to see if the
companies are willing to provide compensation to complainants.
</P>
<P>
   If that process fails, Ruh said, the government would then begin
an administrative procedure that could result in fines of up to
$11,600 per violation. But that money would paid into the
government's coffers, not to the victims of tire blowouts on
highways here or to their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the consumer protection agency recommended to the
office of the federal prosecutor that an investigation into
possible criminal negligence on the part of both Ford and
Bridgestone/Firestone be started. In addition, lawyers here have
said they plan to file civil damage suits here and in the United
States on behalf of people injured or killed in Firestone tire
blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   Such a process, however, promises to be long and difficult.
Venezuela has virtually no consumer liability legislation and
notoriously corrupt courts. And lawyers say that the regulations
accompanying a new constitution approved last December have made it
even harder than in the past for victims who win civil actions to
recover damages from those responsible for their losses.

   ASIA STAKE SOLD IN SOUTH KOREAN BANK
</P>
<P>
   A consortium led by global investment firm Carlyle Group and
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. has become the largest shareholder in South
Korea's KorAm Bank after acquiring a 40 percent stake for 455.9
billion won ($412.6 million), the South Korean bank said. In a
statement to the Korea Stock Exchange, KorAm Bank said it had
signed an investment agreement to sell the stake to the consortium
in the form of Global Depositary Receipts. Earlier, a sole bid by
Carlyle to acquire a stake in KorAm Bank was rejected by the South
Korean government on grounds that the investment firm was not a
banking institution. Curently, Samsung Group and Bank of America
each hold a 16.8 percent stake in KorAm.

   AIR FRANCE PROFIT RISES 20 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   The French carrier Air France said operating profit in the
quarter that ended June 30 rose 20.2 percent to 185 million euros,
or $166 million, on a 20 percent increase in revenue, to 3 billion
euros, fueled by a 33 percent rise in traffic over the North
Atlantic. Air France's president, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said the
increases came despite a sharp rise in fuel costs, and attributed
much of the North Atlantic growth to a recently announced alliance
with Delta. Net income in the quarter, the first in Air France's
fiscal year, rose 85 percent, to 267 million euros, helped in part
by the sale of a stake in the Amadeus reservation system.
</P>
<P>
   ELTEK TO ACQUIRE POWER CONVERSION
</P>
<P>
   Eltek ASA, a Norwegian power supply company, said it would buy
Power Conversion Products of the United States for about $330
million in stock. The deal brings together two suppliers of power
to the Internet and telecommunications industries. After the merger
the new company would derive nearly 40 percent of its revenue from
the United States. Eltek founder Alain Angelil controls 46.8
percent of the company's shares, and will need to endorse the
merger for it to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   TNT POST BUYS CTI LOGISTX
</P>
<P>
   Europe's second largest express package delivery company, TNT
Post Groep NV, said it had bought CTI Logistx from CSX Corp., the
U.S. railroad concern, for $650 million in cash. The deal was
announced in concert with TNT's first half earnings. The company
said its income, including profits on the sale of noncore business,
grew 25.1 percent to 229 million euros. Revenue jumped 19.5 percent
to 4.7 billion euros. The acquisition of CTI is TNT's largest
purchase since it went public in 1998. It brings TNT one step
closer to a transformation from a regional post office to a global
logistics company.

NOW AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL, A FIGHT TO PRESERVE THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds., also filed in ``e'' categry) 
 By   DON TERRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one has conducted more performances at the
Hollywood Bowl, under the stars and with the Santa Monica Mountains
as a backdrop, than John Mauceri. ``The Bowl,'' Mauceri, conductor
of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, says, ``is magic.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been too many nights in the middle of a concert
when Mauceri has had to pick up the telephone at the conductor's
stand on stage and whisper into the mouthpiece to the sound
engineer that he is having trouble hearing the trumpets or the
trombones.
</P>
<P>
   For while the Bowl may be magic, the acoustics, Mauceri says,
are simply terrible in its music shell, one of the most
recognizable structures in the city's sprawling landscape. ``It's
extremely problematic,'' he said, ``when the orchestra can't hear
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the decades,'' Mauceri said of the shell, ``all kinds of
things have been put on it, glued on it and hung from it to improve
the acoustics. Nothing has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old shell is also too small for a 100-piece
orchestra, and so about a third of the musicians are forced to sit
outside it. Further, it is covered in asbestos and lead paint, and
its roof leaks.
</P>
<P>
   So the time has come, say Mauceri and the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Association, the Bowl's manager, for the shell to be
demolished and replaced with a state-of-the-art 21st-century
version costing $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money was approved by voters in 1996, and the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors is to discuss the association's plan on
Sept. 12. If the board approves, the project should be completed in
2002, and a shell 30 percent larger but otherwise looking very much
like the current one will be standing in its place.
</P>
<P>
   But just hold your baton a few beats, says the city's
preservation movement. So much of the city's history has already
been bulldozed under the seemingly endless rivers of freeway and
acres of development that the Los Angeles Conservancy has come out
against tearing down yet another piece of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the shell is the most identifiable icon of the
entire Bowl facility,'' said Ken Bernstein, the conservancy's
director of preservation issues. ``We are not trying to stand in
the way of quality music. We're just trying to raise the right
questions and ensure all the alternatives to demolition are
examined.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the current semicircular shell was erected in 1929, a
parade of musical legends have performed on its stage, from Jascha
Heifetz and Vladimir Horowitz to Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald
to Bob Dylan and the Beatles. There are dance performances, too,
and artificial stars light up the sky over the Bowl when the city
comes together every Fourth of July to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   With all that in its past, ``we believe this is a very, very
serious step to lose the shell that has defined the Bowl for 71
years,'' Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, the conservancy has had its first chance
to study the philharmonic's environmental impact study on the
demolition and its review of alternatives. Bernstein, for one, is
impressed. ``At this point,'' he said, ``it does appear somewhat
clearer it may be difficult to reconcile saving the shell with
other needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bernstein said, the group remains officially opposed to
demolition, at least for now. ``This is a difficult issue,'' he
said. ``It's a wonderful place to listen to music, and we're not
disrespectful of the acoustical issues. But the shell is an icon.''

METAL STRIP THAT DAMAGED CONCORDE LIKELY FROM A CONTINENTAL
AIRLINES PLANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS with new 8th graf re inspection of aircraft in Houston.) 
By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A metal strip that investigators believe may have led to
the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde last July apparently came
from a Continental Airlines DC10 that had taken off from the same
runway only minutes before the Concorde, the French agency
investigating the disaster said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that an identical metal band that is believed to
have gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge chunks of
rubber to pierce the plane's fuel tanks, was reported missing by
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characteristics of the missing piece seem identical to
those of the metal piece which was found on the runway after the
accident on July 25, 2000,'' a statement issued by the French
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from its headquarters, Continental said the piece
could well have come from a Continental plane that was on its way
to Newark, N.J., from Charles de Gaulle airport outside of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative agency's latest statement came on a day when
Air France officials said they believed it was unlikely that the
remaining sleek-needle nosed supersonic jets belonging to Air
France and British Air would fly again before April, at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Air France, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said at a
press conference that a team of 20 experts was working with the
government and the plane's manufacturers to try to come up with
modifications that would insure the safety of the plane. The
modifications would then have to be tested, and only then would Air
France and British Air _ the only two airlines that fly Concordes _
discuss whether to return the aircraft to service.
</P>
<P>
   The French agency described the piece of metal that may have
triggered the crash that killed 113 people as ``a part of a hood on
the plane's reverse thrusters.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators inspected the Continental aircraft on Saturday
in Houston, where Continental is based, officials said, accompanied
by officials from Continental, the National Transportation Safety
Board and the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Continental said the 17-inch by one-inch piece
of metal found on the runway was ``similar'' in shape to a piece
found missing from its DC10. The piece, it said, was ``missing from
the space between the fan reverser and the core door on the right
wing engine.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of such a piece, the statement said, ``does not
affect the safe operation of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, French investigators disclosed that one of three
daily runway inspections aimed at removing debris such as the metal
strip had been skipped on the day of the crash because of a fire
drill. The runway thus had not been thoroughly inspected for about
12 hours before the supersonic jet took off, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that the piece had fallen off the Continental
flight pointed out that the runway inspections would not have
prevented the disaster.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One evening last summer, Dennis Lynch, a young entrepreneur, was
waiting to meet two potential investors at his company headquarters
in Edgewood, N.Y., where he sells used computer and office
equipment through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're small-time investors,'' he remembers telling
his associate, Michael Browne. ``John and David Sculley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Sculley?'' Browne replied. ``He's the former CEO of
Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who is 30, might be excused for not recognizing John
Sculley's name. The last time Sculley was in the news was in 1994 _
when, only a year after resigning as chief executive of Apple
Computer, he then quit after just four months as chief executive of
Spectrum Information Technologies, a Long Island
wireless-technology company where accounting irregularities had
occurred before Sculley arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Sculley, now 61, has maintained uncharacteristically
low visibility. A Wharton-trained executive, who at 38 was running
PepsiCo's domestic soft-drinks unit, and in 1983 jumped to Apple,
he has for the last five years run a small venture capital firm
with his two brothers, Arthur and David. It is his way of
fulfilling a desire to work with his family _ and to help
proselytize people about the virtues of the Internet without
suffering the corporate intrigue that overwhelmed him at both Apple
and Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Now John Sculley focuses on start-ups like Techsmart, the
company founded by Lynch, and serves as mentor and friend as well
as investor. Minutes after starting their meeting, Sculley and his
younger brother were drinking beer with the entrepreneurs and
trading tales about growing up on Long Island. By the end of the
evening, the Sculleys had tentatively committed themselves to
invest $1 million and promised to offer guidance on how to build a
small company into a much bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley may still be licking his wounds, but he said he is far
happier in his new career. And so are his brothers, who are also
veterans of corporate America. Arthur Sculley, 55, ran J.P. Morgan
&AMP; Co.'s $80 billion private bank until 1995, and David Sculley, 54,
was president of the H.J. Heinz Co.'s domestic operations until
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the absolute most wonderful time of our lives,'' said
John Sculley, sitting in his Park Avenue office. ``We're in total
control of our ground rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fun while teaching young entrepreneurs, he said, now
takes priority over earning maximum returns. By using their own
assets, they do not subject themselves to the pressure of
performing for investors. Nonetheless, he said, they expect high
returns over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sculley Brothers LLC has invested in 26 start-ups. Four
are either profitable or breaking even, John said. But their track
record so far, at least as it can be judged from the outside,
leaves something to be desired. Three of the five companies they
backed that have gone public _ like many other Web-based businesses
since the Nasdaq shakeout in April _ now trade at rock-bottom
prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Buy.com, an Internet retailer, closed on Friday at
$2.81, down more than 90 percent from last February's initial
public offering at $30. Another, Talk City, a builder of online
communities, has also plunged, closing on Friday at $1.56 compared
with $12 when shares were first sold to the public in July 1999.
John Sculley said both are doing well but suffering in the market
along with other Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another is NetObjects, which helps businesses build Web sites
and, like other software companies, has been shifting from selling
products to providing online services. Its shares, offered at $12
in April 1999, closed on Friday at $2.97, down by more than 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, John Sculley said: Before the share prices of
NetObjects and Talk City plunged, Sculley Brothers sold some
holdings at a profit. And since they invested early, they acquired
equity in all three companies well below the price set at the
initial public offering. So the brothers said they remain in the
black.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the collegiality, one reason John Sculley said he enjoys
working with his brothers is that they protect him from a tendency
to take people at their word, which he said had hurt him in the
corporate boardrooms. They also keep him, he said, from being so
dazzled by technology that he does not watch the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   At Apple, for example, his record of memorable marketing and
increased sales was partly undone by his focus on Newton, a
hand-held computer that was a forerunner of the Palm Pilot but
which never sold well because its technology was flawed. Critics
said that by spending so much time on Newton _ and on trying to
become an industry luminary _ Sculley did not prepare for a price
war that cut revenue of Apple's core product, the Macintosh
computer. The board fired him in 1993. ``I was ambushed at Apple
and pushed out,'' Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   David Hancock, Apple's former marketing chief, remarked of
Sculley: ``He can be distracted by neat new stuff and can jump at
it. He can get fooled by people. He needs people who can refocus
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those people are his brothers, Sculley said. ``I have been too
trusting in the past, so it's great to have my brothers there to
help me on this.'' Where John and David, the enthusiastic marketing
guys, can be swept away by an idea, for example, Arthur, the
no-nonsense banker, often plays devil's advocate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   They first dreamed about working together in the late 1980s
while walking on a beach in Bermuda, where they were attending the
annual meeting of a perfume factory founded by a grandfather. The
idea of banding together in venture capital took shape after John
Sculley left Spectrum and began searching for a new career. While
visiting companies and attending technology conferences, he decided
that the Internet was creating a revolution and that he wanted to
be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of John's marketing experience, he understood the
power of the Internet as a business tool and a marketing tool,''
said Joshua Ruch, managing partner of Rho Ventures, a New York
venture capital firm that has invested in some of the same
companies as the Sculleys.
</P>
<P>
   John Sculley also appreciated that this revolution, in its early
days, involved small, private companies out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really aren't looking for any publicity,'' he said, after
having first declined to be interviewed. ``We aren't trying to
prove anything to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He began investing in start-ups and in 1995 became nonexecutive
chairman of LivePictures, an Internet imaging company. Several
months after he gave up the chairmanship in 1998, the company went
bankrupt, though it was then sold to the Toronto-based MGI
Software, allowing investors to break even. (He attributes the
company's failure to ``weak management'' too distant for him to
watch closely.)
</P>
<P>
   But other projects were thriving, including Cambridge Display
Technology, a developer of flat-screen video displays; Veon, which
provides interactive video services; and Sirius Thinking, creator
of the PBS children's program ``Between the Lions.'' Cambridge
Display was sold last year to two private venture capital firms,
delivering a ``very high return'' to the Sculleys and other early
investors, John Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Arthur joined John to form Sculley Brothers. Arthur
Sculley, also a Wharton graduate, had spent 25 years at J.P.
Morgan, where he said he contracted ``the entrepreneur's bug''
while setting up offices in Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   John and Arthur pursued projects based on their individual
interests. Arthur co-founded IntraLinks, which distributes
prospectuses for syndicated loans over the Web, and served as
chairman of the Bermuda Stock Exchange as it adopted electronic
trading. That led him to specialize in business-to-business
exchanges, and Sculley Brothers has invested in four _ including
Catex, which trades catastrophe-reinsurance contracts, and
BigMachines.com, where companies can buy and sell industrial
equipment. Another investment, CreditTrade, which serves as an
exchange for credit derivatives, just turned profitable, John said.
</P>
<P>
   David Sculley, 54, joined the family firm in 1996. After 22
years at Heinz in Pittsburgh, four as head of Heinz USA, he said he
became drawn to ``building companies rather than managing
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony O'Reilly, the Heinz chairman, said he was sorry to see
David Sculley leave, adding: ``He's a great motivator of people.
There's a pulse about him, whether he's talking about ketchup or
the Internet.'' And David Sculley is attentive to profitability,
O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   In creating their business, the Sculley brothers made it a
priority to keep things simple. They dress casually and have no
other partners, working with a few assistants in a spacious office.
</P>
<P>
   Their approach to selecting investments is also straightforward:
They meet only with people they know well or have been referred to
by someone they trust. ``We don't solicit,'' Arthur Sculley said.
``We don't want any business plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Several investments have resulted from John Sculley's Apple
connections. One is Presenter.com, an online conference center
founded in 1998 by Eric Chen, a former Apple engineer. Chen, in
turn, referred the Sculleys to the man who founded Gizmoz, a
company that builds Internet broadcast networks. Sculley Brothers
invested in Cambridge Display Technology on the advice of Herman
Hauser, an engineer who worked on the Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The Sculleys declined to say how much money they have to invest,
only that they put an average of $1 million into each venture. But
they offer services beyond that _ serving as mentors for some
entrepreneurs, attracting new investment for others, and often
ending up on the boards of the companies in which they have
invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for board members with thoughtful ideas and
connections, and they have both,'' said Tom Hirschfeld, a general
partner at Patricoff &AMP;  &UR; Co. &LR;  Ventures of New York, who is a
director of IntraLinks and TalkCity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all run big divisions,'' Arthur Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're hands-on.'' John said, ``We've learned lessons from
both our successes and our mistakes that any CEO would have to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Gizmoz, for example: Captivated by the potential of the
technology, John Sculley became nonexecutive chairman and persuaded
the founder, Eyal Gever, 30, to move to New York from Israel.
Today, John speaks with Gever nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring John with me to open doors, but mostly to negotiate,''
Gever said. ``He's guided me on multiple levels.'' John's pitch
helped to persuade America Online to invest in Gizmoz earlier this
year. Sculley also accompanies Gever on television programs, as he
does with other entrepreneurs, using his own celebrity to draw
media attention.
</P>
<P>
   All three brothers have become involved in BigMachines.com, an
industrial-equipment exchange based in Foster City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   David Sculley helped the founders _ Goerdt Abel, a neighbor of
his in Pittsburgh, and his son, Godard _ develop a business plan.
Arthur guided them on how the exchange would work. John establishes
connections with potential partners and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The three have also contributed to PeoplePC, an Internet
membership buyers' club that went public on Aug. 15 at $10 a share.
Even though it has since fallen to $6.50, the Sculleys' 4 percent
stake, which they acquired for $2.1 million, is now worth about $28
million.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Sculley has made introductions that led to group
memberships. David brought in consultants.
</P>
<P>
   And John advised on marketing and operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of complex operational issues that he just
nailed Day 1,'' said Michael J. Price, a former investment banker
at Lazard Freres, who serves on the PeoplePC board. ``He's got some
of the soundest operating judgment I've ever seen.''

BRITISH POWER COMPANY IS SAID TO ACQUIRE NIAGRA MOHAWK 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ National Grid Group PLC, a British energy company, is
expected to announce on Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire
Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc., an upstate New York power company,
for about $3 billion in cash and stock, according to executives
close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The move would catapult National Grid into the role of a major
player in the energy market in the United States, where it has
steadily been building a beachhead in the Northeast by making
acquisitions. The deal will allow National Grid to leverage Niagara
Mohawk's business with its other units _ New England Electric
Systems and Eastern Utilities Association _ creating one of the
largest power companies in the region, and the ninth largest power
company in the country. Niagara Mohawk has 1.6 million electric
customers and serves 540,000 gas customers. It also is a major
employer in upstate New York, employing more than 7,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction comes amid rampant consolidation in the energy
sector, sparked by deregulation of the industry. In early August,
the FLP Group merged with the Entergy Corp., to become the largest
electricity company in the country, serving 6.3 million customers.
That deal was followed by FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU Inc. for
$4.5 billion, just two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   At $3 billion, National Grid is paying about a 25 percent
premium for Niagara Mohawk, which has a market capitalization of
$2.4 billion. National Grid will also be assuming about $5 billion
in debt, according to the executives. National Grid will make
two-thirds of its payment in stock and the rest in cash, the
executives added.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk has become an attractive takeover target because
of its underperforming stock price, which has remained stagnant in
the last 12 months, hovering around $14 a share, despite a 23
percent rise in Standard and Poor's electricity index. Shares of
Niagara Mohawk closed up 7.6 percent to $13.875 on Friday, but
still remain off their 12-month high of $16.19. U.S. markets were
closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In London, shares of National Grid fell 2.3 percent Monday to
560 pence in London after The Wall Street Journal Europe reported
that the two companies were in talks. Both companies declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk has been pushing to increase its share price
through a massive restructuring program that included the sale of
its hydroelectric and coal-fired power station last year for $860
million as well as a separate sale of its gas-fired plant in Albany
to PSEG Power LLC for $47.5 million. The company also announced a
deal in June 1999 to sell its nuclear plants to the AmerGen Energy
Co., a joint venture of Pesco Energy Co. and British Energy, for
about $135 million.
</P>
<P>
   For National Grid, the acquisition marks a major milestone in
its effort to gain a meaningful foothold in the United States,
bringing its U.S. earnings even with earnings generated in Britain.
The company has long sought to increase it presence in the United
States, especially since margins in the energy business in Britain
have recently been squeezed. National Grid had considered acquiring
GPU, executives close to National Grid said, though FirstEnergy
sealed its deal first.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executives, Niagara Mohawk will retain its
headquarters in Syracuse, N.Y., and keep its name. No major layoffs
are expected, the executives said, though National Grid expects to
achieve savings through natural attrition, a practice it employed
successfully when it acquired New England Electric Systems and
Eastern Utilities Association. The companies plan to create a joint
committee to shepherd the integration of the two concerns.

SPORTS COLUMN: HINGIS, OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT, LEADS BY EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By   HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis sprayed her trademark winners around
the Grandstand court on Monday, played her sharp angles, and
quietly moved on to the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open, a sly cat
under a white baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of her Sunday night match with France's Sandrine
Testud was as brief as a sun shower, finishing, 6-2, 6-1, and
sending Hingis into a fast-emptying interview room as the follow-up
act to Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more pressure on them,'' Hingis said of the fascination
with everyone named Williams these days inside the National Tennis
Center. ``They have to do well and make the results. For me, it's
never been the talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely true, as Hingis has had her share of verbal food
fights with the family Williams, in addition to those intemperate,
homophobic-sounding remarks she made regarding Amelie Mauresmo a
couple of winters ago at the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Hingis was only 18 at the time, riding impossibly high
with her fifth _ and last _ Grand Slam singles title. Now, her
sorority crowded with contemporaries who dwarf her 5-foot-7-inch
frame, her 20th birthday only 25 days away, she somehow seems
undeterred by the calamity of less attention. Better yet, she began
this tournament by stating for the record that she would under no
circumstances do anything potentially harmful to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to die when I'm 30,'' she said when asked if she
had considered using creatine and other supplements in an effort to
become stronger, more Williams-ready. ``I'm scared of that stuff.
My life is too nice right now.''
</P>
<P>
   These remarks, augmented by her stated desire to remain fast and
lean, were reported, and pretty much forgotten within one 24-hour
news cycle. They weren't angry, like the ravings of Damir Dokic,
banished father of Jelena. They weren't as provocative as that
knee-jerk gender commentary from the mouth of John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' quotes just needed to be written in stone and presented
like a mantra to all young athletes in our enhancement-crazed
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real positive because what she was saying is that she
needs to focus on her own strength, her speed and cunning, and not
try to become something she's not,'' said Dr. Brian Hainline, the
tournament physician and the co-author of the 1989 book ``Drugs and
the Athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would hope for is that young people could really hear
what she's saying and that message could take off. Because the
bigger question of whether creatine is harmful or helpful, or if
androstenedione made a difference in Mark McGwire hitting home
runs, is why pharmacology has become an integral part of what young
athletes believe is needed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there has been a candidate to succumb to the sad notion
of the body as an experimental tool, it is Hingis, who ruled the
tour before Lindsay Davenport harnessed her power ground strokes.
Before, as Serena Williams said on Monday, ``Venus and I raised the
bar.'' Hingis is too pure a player to ever overlook. The computer
still acknowledges her as No. 1. But the buzz is clearly not around
her anymore. McEnroe and Donald Trump won't be challenging her to a
battle of the sexes anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vain, probably,'' Hingis said the other day on the subject of
McEnroe and his claim that any college male or senior player (read:
himself) could handle either Williams. Jealous, too, like the
neglected jock whose last cry for attention is, inevitably, ``Let's
arm wrestle.''
</P>
<P>
   What was McEnroe's point? There was none, other than to
apparently remind us that the men may be boring, but they're
bigger. Twist the logic and the implication is that men are better,
the more enhanced gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessary to say things like this,'' Hingis
said. ``I mean, I'm playing on the women's tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The men are not her problem, not even when her new boyfriend's
got problems. While Magnus Norman struggled in his five-set
comeback against Max Mirnyi Sunday night, Hingis said she grew
exasperated by the length of her wait to get on the same court
against Testud.
</P>
<P>
   ``At four-all, I had no more feelings,'' she said. ``I was like,
`Come on, get it over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Norman survived, and Hingis and Testud eventually played a set
and a game before the rain sent them inside for the night. Hingis
awoke on Monday at 9, hit a few practice balls, finished off Testud
and began thinking about Monica Seles, next up in the quarters.
</P>
<P>
   She'll have to deal with the Williamses later this week and for
the next several years. Her promise to do it with what comes
naturally is a powerful message, a winner on all courts. &QL;

THE GORE CAMPAIGN: FIVE CITIES, 28 HOURS, ONE MESSAGE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The best things about a marathon are the
little events that keep people amused along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's 28-hour spurt over Labor Day across
five cities provided several distractions, all of which contributed
to the picture that the campaign wanted to present of a
hard-working, energetic candidate on the move.
</P>
<P>
   It also afforded Gore an effortless way to show his human side.
Over mushroom omelets in Tampa, Fla., he reminisced with
firefighters about an uncle who was a firefighter and used to take
young Al to see the fire engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone called him Uncle Punk, except me,'' Gore recalled.
And he talked about the time his furnace exploded and he had to
call the fire department, another everyman adventure that Gore
enjoyed imparting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the events involved food, and Gore seemed to eat at
every stop.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president burst into song for hospital workers around
midnight in Flint, Mich. He was interviewed by Ed Rendell, the
former mayor of Philadelphia who is now a chairman of the
Democratic Party, for a sports program, giving him a chance to
praise the virtues of athletics, especially for girls.
</P>
<P>
   His staff sang its own lyrics to the tune of ``Route 66'' to
mark the 66 days until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   He was praised by a speaker at a parade in Pittsburgh for
kissing his wife ``in front of millions of people'' at the
Democratic National Convention. He responded to the roar of the
crowd of 10,000, ``I like people who appreciate a proper kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the hours grew wee, so did Gore's grip on his accent,
which veered toward the homespun, as in: ``I'll be durned if we're
going to go back to the old ways.''
</P>
<P>
   By hour 28, he had become a little punchy. ``I've got
approximately 75,000 cousins in Kentucky,'' he blurted out here. He
said his wife, Tipper, also had cousins here, and, mocking his
habit of asking audiences how long each person has been married, he
called out, ``How many people are related to Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he derided the big drug companies, calling out,
``I've been at this for 30 straight hours _ you're going to get the
unvarnished truth here, now, you know it!''
</P>
<P>
   The tour began in a downpour in Philadelphia on Sunday
afternoon, with the traditional stop at Pat's King of Steaks for
cheesesteaks.
</P>
<P>
   It ended Monday night here at the Motor Speedway. In between,
Gore, with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, his running mate, at his side for
part of the trip, hit Flint, Mich., Tampa and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Their message was one of alliance with working families _ and
against the tax cut proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whose
name was rarely mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore put it to about 1,000 people who showed up at the Tampa
firehouse before dawn: ``If you give all that surplus away in the
form of a giant tax cut mainly to the wealthy, you're going to have
the top 1 percent get richer and richer, and maybe there's some
benefit to that. We're not against people getting rich; everybody
wants to be, I guess. But look at the public investment. How can we
stand by if the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and the
public investment in schools and hospitals and the environment and
libraries all are falling into disrepair and decay? We need to
start looking out after the middle-class families.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman paid homage in his own way to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the labor movement were a religion _ and in some ways it is
_ Flint, Mich., would be a holy city,'' he proclaimed to a
union-bolstered crowd that greeted them at the Flint airport.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Gore spoke
sorrowfully of the recent death of Joe Abraham, the head of the
local union of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   He was addressing health-care workers and telling them about the
crowd at the airport. ``They said we wouldn't have a crowd close to
midnight,'' he mused, then added: ``What's that song?'' Then he
began singing, ``Close to Midnight. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the tour, Gore found lines that garnered a good
response, most especially a declaration to ``make most college
tuition tax-deductible.'' He derided health maintenance
organizations by saying they were controlled by ``bean counters
behind the computer terminal.'' When he riled up the crowd, he
asked them, ``Are you with me? Are you with me?''
</P>
<P>
   He and Lieberman staged a cozy scene for the cameras Sunday
morning at 4:20 a.m., after they landed in Tampa. They walked down
the stairs of Air Force Two, picked up a newspaper that had been
placed there, then walked back up to the plane, like a couple going
back inside their house.
</P>
<P>
   The togetherness of the two has been striking over the last
several days. They tend to wear similar outfits (khakis and sports
shirts, then jeans and polo shirts), and Lieberman knows his place.
He introduces Gore, they hug heartily, then he moves to the
background and sits still, a reassuring presence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who has criticized the Hollywood culture, spoke with
some authority Monday in praising Gore's wife for leading a push
for warning labels on music. ``Long before it became fashionable,
Tipper led the battle to protect our children from a lot of the
violence and vulgarity in the popular culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore covered nicely for Lieberman on Air Force Two around 2
a.m., when Gore was chirpily telling groggy reporters about his
many all-nighters (including two in a row in 1998 to write his
father's eulogy).
</P>
<P>
   Where was Lieberman?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's reflecting,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   The two made a brief appearance on NBC's ``Today Show,'' where
the subject turned to Lieberman's repeated references to his faith.
He was asked whether the emphasis on religion was the result of a
political calculation that this worked to the ticket's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman replied: ``I spoke what naturally came from my heart
and I think reflects the feeling of the great majority of the
American people. And the man I'm lucky enough to run with shares
those points and said to me, `Joe, be yourself because that's why I
chose you to be my running mate.' And that's what I'm going to
continue to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore agreed. ``I knew he was a man of faith when I picked him,''
he said. ``I believe in what he is saying, we share commitment to
the separation of church and state, but what he is saying is right
for this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right for the American people,'' Gore said, ``and you bet
we're going to keep on saying it.''

BUSH'S FRANK STATEMENT CREATES AN EMBARRASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ George W. Bush Monday urged voters to put
``plain-spoken Americans in the White House,'' intending to
contrast himself with Vice President Al Gore. Instead, his
frankness created an embarrassment, after he uttered a vulgarity
that was accidentally broadcast over loudspeakers to a crowd of
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing onstage to address a Labor Day rally in suburban
Naperville, Ill., the Republican presidential nominee spotted a
veteran political reporter in the crowd and pointed him out to his
running mate, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Adam Clymer, major-league asshole from The New York
Times,'' Bush said, as he smiled and waved to the cheering crowd.
Cheney, also unaware that the microphones were turned on, agreed,
saying, ``Oh yeah, he is, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment, which was captured by dozens of video cameras and
was mostly audible from the audience, touched off a wave of
defensive reactions from the Bush campaign, although aides said it
was justified because Clymer has written several stories Bush
considers unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign delighted in the remark and immediately
chastised Bush. The vice president's spokesman, Chris Lehane, told
reporters: ``Last week, Governor Bush broke his promise not to
engage in negative personal attacks when he attacked Al Gore'' in a
Republican National Committee TV ad questioning the vice
president's credibility. ``And now, this week, facing increased
pressure, he is not only attacking Al Gore; he's also attacking the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane added: ``What it really reflects is the fact that the
dynamics of this campaign have changed, that people are beginning
to focus on the issues, and that George W. Bush recognizes that he
cannot defend the indefensible _ as in his tax cut _ or explain the
unexplainable _ as in why he doesn't have a plan that will help
working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Clymer told the Associated Press, ``I'm disappointed in the
governor's language.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday &UR;  &LR; night, Bush addressed the issue directly. ``I
regret that a private comment I made to the vice presidential
candidate made it into the public airwaves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would apologize, he said: ``I was making a
comment to . . . Cheney. I didn't realize, obviously, the mikes
were going to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing thousands of union laborers at a rally at Point State
Park on Pittsburgh's riverfront, the vice president appeared to
hint at the faux pas by thanking all those who were helping with
his four-state, 27-hour Labor Day campaign ``Workathon.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``I want to thank all of the medics. I want to thank
the law enforcement officers who are working today on Labor Day. I
want to thank the Secret Service and all of those who have made my
trip possible. I want to thank the working press corps, who are
working on Labor Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more damaging for Bush, the incident drew attention away
from what was intended to be a serious Labor Day push to stop
Gore's recent ascent in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor plans to continue that effort Tuesday, as he
unveils a prescription drug plan for Medicare, but there was little
discussion of such weighty topics Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush instead delivered a strong political criticism of Gore
during a 12-minute speech at Naperville North High School.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing a theme that has run throughout the Bush campaign but
which has taken even greater prominence in recent weeks, Bush all
but accused Gore of being a liar. The governor told the crowd,
``It's time to elect some folks who've got good common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to elect people who say what they mean and mean what
they say when they tell the American people something,'' he said.
``It's time to get rid of all those words like `no controlling
legal authority.' We need plain-spoken Americans in the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore camps also exchanged blows Monday over the
status of debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Sunday that he would debate Gore three times, starting
next week, but Gore rejected the proposal because two of the
debates would take place on NBC and CNN, while only one of the
debates would be sanctioned by the Commission on Presidential
Debates and carried by all broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   In what he termed an example of ``Washington double-speak,''
referring to Gore, Bush said: ``My opponent said he would debate me
any place, any time, anywhere. I said fine, why don't we just show
up at NBC with Mr. (Tim) Russert as a moderator? Why don't we just
show up at Larry King and discuss our differences?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then all of a sudden the words about any time, anywhere don't
mean anything,'' Bush continued.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the vice president at the Pittsburgh rally, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson came to Gore's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of debate about the debates. Bush does not
want to debate Al Gore. There's this rising fear factor. You see,
he wants to have privatized debates, a private debate with Larry
King, a private debate with Tim Russert. We want public debates for
the American people,'' Jackson said, drawing a cheer from the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come out of the bushes and let's debate,'' he bellowed.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day, which comes at the end of the summer vacation season
and is the last major holiday before the election, is a traditional
landmark in presidential campaigns. Bush had hoped to use the day
to elaborate on major policy and personality differences between
him and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is considered a swing state, and in an Aug. 30
Mason-Dixon poll, the race was a statistical dead heat. Gore was
nominally ahead, 46 percent to 41 percent, but the survey had a
5-point margin of error. A Chicago Tribune poll taken before the
Democratic convention also showed Gore ahead, 42 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Cheney remarks disparaging the reporter were heard
over the loudspeakers at Naperville High. While not everyone heard
the statements, the Bush campaign did not try to deny them, but
rather explained them with criticism of Clymer's work.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer is a veteran Washington correspondent who appeared in the
original campaign chronicle ``Boys on the Bus'' and is the author
of a recent biography of Senator Edward M. Kennedy. He has written
several articles that displeased the Bush campaign, including one
that examined health care in Texas under Bush's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said the remark was intended to be private.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a series of articles that the governor has felt
have been very unfair,'' said Bush's communications director, Karen
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Illinois rally, Bush flew to Michigan to attend a
peach festival. Gore wrapped up his campaign swing with a speech at
a motor speedway in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Detroit yesterdat, Gore's running mate, Joseph I.
Lieberman, said he'll keep pushing for a place for religion in
public life, telling union workers the ``the labor movement is
built on values that come from faith,'' the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kornblut, traveling with the Bush campaign, reported from
Illinois; Johnson, traveling with Gore, reported from Pittsburgh.

 UNDATED: the century. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A NEW STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   After the debacle with the Advanced Automation System, the FAA
adopted a more modest approach to modernizing air traffic control _
a strategy Garvey, the administrator since 1997, summed up as
``build a little; test a little; deploy a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA replaced its old mainframe computers with newer models
and installed color radar displays. Computer system crashes, which
in the 1990s frequently forced controllers to track jets on slips
of paper, are now rare.
</P>
<P>
   But many problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   The new mainframe computers that form the heart of the air
traffic system are IBM models built in the 1990s that have already
gone out of production. The FAA could not buy IBM's newest machines
because they would not run the 1960s-era programming language used
in the system's software.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also had high hopes for a plan called the Wide Area
Augmentation System, intended to use the constellation of military
satellites that make up the Global Positioning System to enable
planes to fly virtually independent of controllers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be operating by 1998, but it also proved much
more complicated _ and expensive _ than the FAA first thought.
</P>
<P>
   The system was made available on a limited basis last week, but
is not scheduled to be completed until 2002. Few believe it will
make a significant contribution toward reducing delays.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the FAA is working on deploying a series of discrete
systems designed to improve the efficiency of takeoffs and landings
at busy airports and to allow some airplanes to fly more direct
routes. But these improvements will not come close to addressing
the long-term growth in air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can make some changes,'' said Steven Brown, the
FAA's acting associate administrator for air traffic services.
``Those will be marginal _ not unimportant, but marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   REVOLUTIONIZING THE AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   Such talk fuels critics who say that the only way to end the
impending gridlock in the skies is to junk the FAA _ or junk the
economics on which its management of the air traffic system is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Federal air traffic control services are paid for by taxes on
airline tickets, cargo and fuel. Users like commercial airlines do
not pay any more to use the system than private pilots; small
planes get the same priority as jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the resources are not priced properly,''
said Richard Golaszewski, a consultant who has advised the FAA and
several European countries. ``In fact, they are not priced at
all.'' That means that airlines have no incentive to limit their
use of air traffic control services even at the most crowded
airports.
</P>
<P>
   For years, economists have urged the government to switch to a
fee-based system that would force users to pay for the services
they use. Raising prices at peak hours would put pressure on
airlines to reduce congestion. They might also switch service to
underutilized secondary airports, or replace some smaller jets with
less frequent service on bigger planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the unfinished business of deregulation,'' Golaszewski
said. ``We have taken off all of the controls on what airlines can
do, but we haven't done anything to balance demand and capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates go farther and say that the air traffic control
system needs to be separated from the FAA and handed over to a new,
independent entity that would operate like a business.
</P>
<P>
   A plan that the Clinton administration sent to Capitol Hill in
1994 as part of Vice President Al Gore's campaign to reinvent
government never got out of committee, even though the House was
still controlled by Democrats at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Various privatization proposals have been floated in Congress
during the years, but none have made any progress.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA is already beginning to act more like a business.
Congress passed legislation a few years ago creating a 15-member
advisory council to supervise the agency. A bill passed this spring
directed the council to hire a chief operating officer to run the
air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also increased the FAA's budget by $10 billion during
the next three years to $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent public outcry about flight delays, interest in
privatization is on the rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Nav Canada, the only private company in the world to run a
national air traffic control system, has proven the most intriguing
to policy makers in Washington. Before the nonprofit corporation
was set up in 1996, the Canadian air traffic control system
suffered many of the same problems that plague the FAA: Its
equipment was antiquated, and a proposed replacement was behind
schedule and far over budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nav Canada has managed to reduce air traffic delays,
cut costs and revamp its technology. A cost-accounting system
enables the company to charge users by the flight. Managers who
worked under both systems say the new arrangement has enhanced
safety, precisely because regulation and operations have been
assigned to two different organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that if we have one more summer as bad as this
one, or even one worse than this one, finally it will force the
issue,'' said John Meyer, a retired economics professor at Harvard
who is in favor of introducing user fees.  &QL;

ANALYSIS: SYRIA'S MAN LOSES BY A LANDSLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ The landslide defeat of the Syrian-appointed
government by the billionaire builder Rafik Hariri in elections
that concluded on Sunday has changed the political map of Lebanon
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But the most intriguing aspect of the sudden shift has been
speculated about in whispers under the din of celebratory
fireworks, car horns and street dancing that went on until nearly
dawn Monday. It is why Syria's new ruler, Bashar Assad, allowed
this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri's victory came less than three months after the death of
President Hafez Assad of Syria, who had run both countries with an
iron hand for the last 10 years and had meddled in the murky waters
of Lebanon since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, two Lebanese presidents and a prime minister
perished in mysterious explosions. Political opponents, critical
journalists and errant guerrilla leaders were regularly
assassinated, and countless thousands of civilians died, all as a
result of machinations universally attributed here to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The last decade has so entrenched Syria's dominance that
virtually all of the players on the Lebanese political scene _
Hariri not least among them _ have ties to Syria. Damascus, a
foreign envoy noted, ``is in the happy situation of having to deal
with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But the election victory by Hariri and his allies crushed
President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss. The two men
were handpicked by Bashar Assad to run Lebanon two years ago after
his father sent him to Lebanon as an internship for power.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, a 34-year-old eye doctor, was raised to power by
the ruling Baath Party, the generals and the Alawite minority
clique running Syria. Even four weeks ago, the defeat of his
candidates would have seemed unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals are interpreting their mandates rather more widely
than they would have under his father,'' Michael Young, a respected
political analyst here, said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   But is Bashar Assad truly, as Syria's official media said,
determined to foster a new era of freedom? Or is Assad, a
mild-mannered computer enthusiast, just not tough enough for the
job of keeping the fractious Lebanese in line? Has he shifted his
patronage, or has he let the situation slip out of control?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the most interesting question of the next
few months,'' a Western diplomat said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the official tallies were counted up on Monday, Beirut
newspapers estimated that Hariri and his allies had taken 92 of the
128 seats in Parliament, an overwhelming majority that would seem
to make it impossible for Lahoud to deny him the office of prime
minister, which he held from 1992 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, the president issued a statement saying the
new government would be formed, ``in line with the constitution,''
when the new Parliament assembles in mid-October, implying that he
would avoid a crisis by appointing his sworn enemy, Hariri, to be
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they going to work together?'' the Western diplomat
wondered. ``It is very difficult. These are two very strong-willed
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming extent of Hariri's victory was shown by his
elimination of two pillars of the Sunni Muslim establishment in
West Beirut. The city had been gerrymandered into three districts
under Syrian orders to preserve the power of two traditional
leaders and to prevent the emergence of a single dominant leader.
</P>
<P>
   But that that balance was wiped out by Hariri's campaign. One of
those leaders is Hoss, a five-time prime minister, who was beaten
by 11,000 votes by an unknown computer professor, Ghanwa Jalloul,
the first woman ever elected to Parliament from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad did not grow up intending to rule Syria _ or
Lebanon. That role was reserved for his dashing older brother,
Basil, who died in a car crash in 1994. Bashar Assad was plucked
from his medical studies in London, sent through military training,
made a colonel and apprenticed to his father.
</P>
<P>
   He was given the task of running Lebanon in 1998 as part of his
training program. At the time, the country was the turf of the
veteran Syrian vice president, Abdul Halim Khaddam, and of Maj.
Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, of military intelligence, both of whom had been
in charge here for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both were close to _ many said in the pocket of _ Hariri, then
the free-spending prime minister. In recent weeks, he has
recemented his ties by pledging with three Saudi-based construction
agencies to carry out projects in Syria that could total as much as
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working through the older men, both in his father's
inner circle, Assad struck out on his own, anointing Lahoud, the
military commander, as president. That forced a power struggle in
which Hariri departed and the decent, long-suffering Hoss was named
to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bashar brought this guy in,'' said Young, the Lebanese
political analyst. ``He failed. Someone, somewhere is keeping
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the Syrian system are looking to see how Bashar gets
out of this one.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lahoud had accused Hariri of corruption and of running the
country into debt, matters only got worse under the new
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To voters on Sunday, Hariri suddenly seemed the economic savior,
particularly to Sunni Muslims, who had no strong leader and were
the biggest voters in Lebanon's complicated balloting, intricately
divided by religious sect. But the problems that Hariri faces are
enormous, and there is little evidence that his solutions will
work.
</P>
<P>
   As the election struggle became more bitter, most of the major
figures in Lebanon trooped to Damascus to sit with Assad, as they
had so often when summoned by his father. But the signals that came
out of the meetings seemed mixed, and the situation different. The
young Assad did not hold the icy menace of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go back to before '98 when every problem was solved
in Damascus,'' Young said. ``Syria has changed. We have changed.
Israel is gone from the south. I don't think the Lebanese will
willingly return to being so obviously under the Syrian thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said the idea of a change ``has really entered the public
domain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always phrased very carefully,'' he said. ``Let's
recognize a `new relationship' rather than a direct call for a
Syrian pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bashar is in a dilemma. He is certainly in a tight spot. Can
he find a way of operating alternatively in this country? That's at
the heart of this entire episode.''

NIGERIAN LEADER SEEKS PEACEMAKING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Fifteen months after restoring democracy to
Africa's most populous nation for the second time in 20 years,
President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria said Monday that he was
ready to step into a larger role in mediating an end to his
continent's debilitating wars, beginning with Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly after his arrival in New York for a
gathering of world leaders, Obasanjo, whose troops the United
States is now training for peacekeeping duties in Sierra Leone,
said he recently volunteered to go to Congo and talk to President
Laurent Kabila. Kabila has been the primary roadblock to efforts to
end the war, which involves a half dozen African nations, and has
been uncooperative with both the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's offer was turned down by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, he said. ``I wanted to go, and I told the secretary-general,
and I was told that it was not opportune yet for me to go,''
Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to send Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who during a
short period as Nigeria's military ruler opened the way for the
election last year of Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo remains ready, he said. ``I will go,'' he said, adding
that his message is simple. ``Mr. Kabila, your country needs peace.
Nothing should be too much to sacrifice for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As wars have further weakened countries in sub-Saharan Africa
already devastated by economic problems and AIDS, Annan and other
world leaders have tried to involve Africans more actively in
peacemaking. Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former president, has
negotiated a tentative peace agreement in Burundi. But tensions
between South Africa and Congo have prevented him from playing a
greater role there, where Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe all have forces.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, who said he had also been asked for advice by the
military government of the Ivory Coast, acknowledged that Nigerians
were waiting for a ``democracy dividend,'' but that this should not
mean he had to look inward.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, he said, was not grabbing power, ``but if a situation
comes to which we must react positively in the interest of our
sub-region, or in the interest of our continent or even in the
interest of the world, we would be less than what we should be if
we did not react.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Obasanjo, 65, has seemed reluctant to shoulder more
continental responsibilities because he has his own priorities in
Nigeria, now struggling to recover from another period of military
rule that left the country isolated, in debt and facing
Christian-Muslim tensions. He seemed eager to withdraw troops from
an earlier peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone. Shortly after
taking office, he pressed for an agreement signed in Lome, Togo,
last year ending the war. But flaws in that agreement led to a
resurgence of fighting in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that Nigerian troops cannot remain forever in Sierra
Leone, so we must work out some process by which Nigerian troops
could start the process of disengaging,'' he said Monday. ``That
was why we went for the Lome agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we will always have domestic priorities,'' he said.
``But our domestic priorities must never prevent us from being a
good neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a general, he offered a prescription for Sierra
Leone. ``We must be strong militarily, but we must not throw
completely overboard what I call the political option,'' he said.
But he ruled out any future political role for Foday Sankoh, the
rebel leader of the Revolutionary United Front who resumed the war
this year and captured 500 U.N. peacekeepers. ``Foday Sankoh is no
longer an issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also appealing to President Charles Taylor of
Liberia, who has been complicit in Sankoh's rebellion and is
accused of funneling diamonds from Sierra Leone through his country
to raise money for arms. Speaking of ``doing what needs to be done
as quickly as possible'' in Sierra Leone, he said, ``What needs to
be done is disarmament, demobilization of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo said speed was important in Congo also. ``We have to
move quickly to get those troops that should not have been there
out of the place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought that the nations involved, including
Zimbabwe, which is propping up the Kabila government, could not
continue spending money on this war. ``The cost of maintaining
troops outside your own territory must be telling on Zimbabwe,'' he
said. ``We know from experience what it is.''

STILL POPULAR, MO MOWLAM BIDS GOODBYE TO BRITISH POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mo Mowlam survived the bombs, bullets, and brickbats of
Belfast, but apparently she could not survive the sniping of
Whitehall, and so the most popular politician in Britain announced
Monday that she is leaving politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam, who shot to international fame as the first female
secretary of state for Northern Ireland, said she would step down
as Cabinet minister within the next year and would not stand for
reelection to Parliament. She said she was considering a new career
in conflict resolution or international politics.
</P>
<P>
   While Mowlam's announcement led the BBC news, it was hardly
surprising to friends and associates of the colorful,
controversial, salty politician. Mowlam, who turns 51 next week,
had told friends that she was unhappy with her relatively
low-profile job, which Prime Minister Tony Blair forced her to take
last year so he could give his friend and confidant Peter Mandelson
the Northern Ireland portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, her friends said Mowlam was deeply wounded by what
she saw as an ungrateful slight by Blair, who had put her in the
Belfast hot seat after he led the Labor Party to a landslide
victory in May 1997. Publicly, she embraced Mandelson and played
the part of loyal soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her immense popularity with ordinary people _ she
routinely topped polls as Britain's most popular politician _
Mowlam had influential enemies. Pro-British Protestant unionists in
Northern Ireland accused her of being ideologically biased toward
Irish Catholic nationalists. She denied it, but in private she told
friends it was easier to get along with nationalists. In an
interview last year, Mowlam said she found unionists more
uncomfortable dealing with a powerful woman.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, while wanting to promote his friend Mandelson, also
wanted to appease unionists by moving Mowlam, his aides concede.
</P>
<P>
   More significant than unionist opposition was Mowlam's
resistance to Blair's initial effort to reassign her in the summer
of 1999, saying she wanted to see the Northern Ireland peace
process through.
</P>
<P>
   In a parliamentary system, no individual Cabinet minister, or
even a prime minister, is considered indispensable. And in parts of
the Blair administration, her refusal to accept a reassignment was
seen as petulant.
</P>
<P>
   She was also regarded within Whitehall as something of a loose
cannon. As the government's drug czar, she recently admitted to
smoking marijuana in her youth. Last month, she suggested that the
royal family leave Buckingham Palace for privately rented
accommodation, leaving more than a few eyes rolling in Whitehall.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Mowlam accepted her reassignment, which she
privately regarded as a demotion, the sniping continued. Anonymous
advisers to Blair were quoted in all the major British papers as
saying that Mowlam's star had burned out, that she was the right
person at the right time in Belfast, but that that time had passed.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Monday afternoon's Evening Standard, the first
paper to weigh in on Mowlam's announcement, summarized the
arguments against her and showed that, for all her popularity, she
had many critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a classic example of a politician best suited to
opposition and the back benches, a great public character rather
than a natural governor,'' opined the Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that her spontaneity and warmth made a
useful contribution to the peace process. . . . But her
indiscipline and unembarrassed vulgarity, which made the public
warm to her, also limited her usefulness as a minister. Once the
time for human gestures had passed, and the hard grind of
negotiation and administration had to be sustained, Ms. Mowlam was
out of her depth.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of Blair's top aides, all of them men, have
expressed similar sentiments. According to some of Mowlam's
friends, among them Joan Ruddock, a fellow member of Parliament,
that smacks of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the first deputy leader of the Northern Ireland
Assembly and the most senior Catholic nationalist politician in
Northern Ireland, paid a warm tribute to Mowlam's skills as a
conciliator and mediator, suggesting that those who disliked her
were envious.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' said Mallon, ``should underestimate the talent of Mo
Mowlam. She is an original.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mowlam met with Blair privately at 10 Downing St.
Monday for 15 minutes, then issued the formal denials that her
friends say were predictable. In an interview with the BBC, Mowlam
said her decision to leave politics was not influenced by the
sniping from anonymous Downing Street advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing to do with British politics, nothing to do with
Number 10. It's a personal decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the phone Monday night, a close friend of Mowlam didn't
buy her public explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just Mo being Mo,'' the friend said. ``You and I both
know she was unhappy. I just hope she can find something she's
happy with, because she deserves it.''

BIG CROWD, BIGGER HOPES, FOR UN MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The megashow begins Tuesday. More than 150
presidents and prime ministers are arriving, some with dozens of
aides, children, and, of course, nannies. Fidel Castro is flying in
on his Soviet-made jet. The Israelis and the Palestinians will be
riding bulletproof limos to the Waldorf Astoria, knocking on
President Clinton's door.
</P>
<P>
   And on the 38th floor of UN headquarters, the host of the UN
Millennium Assembly awaits them all, hoping his out-of-this-world
plans to change the world begin to take root.
</P>
<P>
   Called together by Secretary General Kofi Annan, the largest
collection of world leaders ever is converging on New York Tuesday
and Wednesday, to take a stab at setting new goals for the
institution for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, when Annan first said he wanted to pull at least
half of the 1.2 billion people out of extreme poverty by the year
2015, give every child at least a primary school education by 2015,
and cut the spread of HIV and AIDS by 25 percent among young people
by 2010, he admitted it ``may seem absurdly ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Some do think that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This assembly is essentially a dog-and-pony show,'' said
Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York. ``The more sweeping a goal is, the less
likely it is going to be achieved in this age.''
</P>
<P>
   But Annan, who will further outline his hopes for the assembly
when he meets with reporters Tuesday, said this year that ``if the
United Nations does not attempt to chart a course for the world's
peoples in the first decades of the new millennium, who will?''
</P>
<P>
   His top aide, John Ruggie, said in an interview last week that
the expectation from this week's summit was that specific steps
would be made in the next year to overhaul the UN's peacekeeping
operations; to provide duty-free access into Western countries for
goods made in the least developed nations; and to clinch a deal on
greenhouse gases contained in the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would win US Senate ratification for the protocol,
Ruggie, a US citizen, said it was bound to happen because ``sooner
or later, people are going to start connecting the melting of the
polar ice cap with the extraordinarily volatile weather conditions
in the US with greenhouse gases. The connection can only be denied
for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruggie said one key to the summit will be to make progress
toward implementing a recent UN report on peacekeeping, which calls
for member states to create several multinational brigade forces so
that effective force can be swiftly deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was heavily criticized in the report for
peacekeeping failures in Bosnia, Rwanda, Angola, and Sierra Leone,
but Ruggie said much of the responsibility rests with member states
not giving the organization a mandate for a stronger force. He also
pointed to successes in peacekeeping operations in East Timor and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations is a meaningful organization to the people
of East Timor. It is a meaningful organization to the people of
Kosovo,'' he said. ``It was not a meaningful organization to the
people of Rwanda _ but for one simple reason: the permanent members
of the Security Council did not give the secretary general a
mandate in Rwanda and 800,000 people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically noted the United States' role in arguing against
deployment of peacekeepers in Rwanda. The person articulating that
position was then-UN ambassador Madeleine K. Albright, now
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The policy debates and the roll of 193 speakers before the
General Assembly this week _ each talk is limited to five minutes _
will give Americans an opportunity to hear the undeveloped world's
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the West's focus on failed UN peacekeeping missions
and the decision to bypass the Security Council in the wars against
Serbia and Iraq, Third World countries see the UN's mission far
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on whose limbs were chopped in off in Sierra Leone or
Liberia, or things going to hell in Bosnia or Afghanistan, but the
bread-and-butter issues for most countries really evolve around
economic and social betterment,'' said Thomas G. Weiss,
presidential professor at City University of New York and author of
``The United Nations and Changing World Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That means leaders will be talking about 1.2 billion people
living on less than $1 a day. Or confronting the water crisis of
the developing world. Or finding new markets for the poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much of the attention this week is likely to be
off-site.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Castro, who announced only last Friday that he would be
attending the assembly, last came in 1995 and will be making his
fourth appearance at the United Nations since he came to power in
1959. Five years ago, he received more than 400 invitations for
meals and receptions; this time the requests also have been pouring
in.
</P>
<P>
   At the Waldorf Astoria, Clinton's one-on-one meetings with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Wednesday will unfold with much of the world watching to
see if they can rebuild the collapsed Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   And then there will be the spectacle of it all, from buses and
telephone kiosks bearing banner ads carrying UN messages, to major
traffic jams, to the trails of aides and families of heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not believe the lists of people we are hearing about
from some of the delegations,'' said a US diplomat in New York,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's not just spouses, it's
children and all these nannies. Hotel rooms are booked.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, said Mead, the Council on Foreign Relations
fellow, is to keep expectations low. ``The fact that you have an
organization that heads of state want to appear at, and that you
have a high-profile meeting like this to raise the UN profile
around the world, is a good thing. But don't think much is going to
happen.''

<P>
   President Clinton's foreign policy aides say he plans a
diplomatic whirlwind in New York over the next three days,
including what one senior official called ``the last real chance''
to jump-start the failed talks between Israel and the Palestinians
and what may be prove to be a tense session with China's president
over Beijing's continued missile exports to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Those meetings are part of a jammed schedule for Clinton, who
arrives in Manhattan on Tuesday for one of his last opportunities
for major foreign policy accomplishments. Wednesday, he is to open
a three-day series of speeches and discussions by more than 150
world leaders at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly intent on not sitting on the sidelines while the
presidential campaign speeds into its last two months, Clinton
plans to announce American support for a plan to establish a
permanent United Nations operation, based in New York, for planning
and preparing peacekeeping operations that could be deployed
quickly. At present, they have to be organized on an ad hoc basis.
But Clinton also plans to use the U.N. meeting to insert himself in
an array of simmering world conflicts _ from the Middle East to
Cyprus to the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said in a
lengthy interview over the weekend that much of Clinton's time will
be spent on one last effort to reconstruct a deal between the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel. Clinton is said to want that foreign policy achievement
more than any other in his short time left in office, and he
watched in frustration and anger as it slipped from his grasp at
Camp David in the early morning hours of July 25.
</P>
<P>
   He put most of the blame on Arafat, who was unwilling to sign on
to any agreement that gave him only partial sovereignty over
contested parts of Jerusalem. Arafat also was apparently unwilling
to go along with Clinton's alternative proposal, to announce a
settlement on all issues except Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later likened the sessions to ``going to the dentist
without having your gums deadened.''
</P>
<P>
   In advance of this week's meetings Clinton dispatched Dennis
Ross, his special Middle East envoy, and CIA Director George Tenet
to try out new formulations. ``There needs to be some flexibility
that would indicate we have some chance of getting real momentum
here,'' Berger said. ``If we are not any further than we were in
Camp David, it will be tough to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Berger have contended that Arafat's
inflexibility was the chief obstacle to an agreement at Camp David.
American officials have made it clear that little has changed since
then.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that currently there are no plans for three-way
meetings between Arafat, Barak and Clinton. Instead, the president
will shuttle between the two at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, starting
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   No other meetings are formally scheduled, but Clinton's aides
have already laid out a plan for at least two more days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the atmosphere of the chaotic week at the United
Nations may work against Clinton's hopes. In the seclusion of Camp
David, the president could shut out distractions and some of the
outside pressures bearing down on the leaders in the heat of their
talks. News blackouts were easy to manage, because the press was
kept miles away. Cell phones do not work at Camp David, leaving
just a few land lines for each delegation.
</P>
<P>
   New York will be the opposite: Arafat will be negotiating with
other Arab leaders just blocks away, and Barak will be talking as
he entertains American Jewish groups and others with a strong
interest in how a deal is constructed. Thousands of reporters will
be milling about; the delegations will have every form of
communication at their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ideal atmosphere,'' one former senior official who
was deeply involved in past negotiations said recently. ``I think
the effort is to get enough progress to justify more meetings or
maybe whisking them back to Camp David at the end of the week.''
Berger said he believes any thought of reconvening at Camp David is
premature; nonetheless, Clinton's schedule for week's end has been
left vague, save for a few New York appearances on behalf of his
wife's candidacy for the New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting on Friday with President Jiang Zemin of China
may be Clinton's last chance to show that he has made a lasting
imprint on American relations with China. He has not seen Jiang in
more than a year, and not since the two countries reached agreement
over China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Although
Clinton contended that the trade accord would yield broader
diplomatic benefits, encouraging China to be more cooperative in
dealing with hot spots around the globe, so far there has been
little evidence of a change in China's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, under increasing political pressure at home because of
the scope of China's market-opening concessions, is not likely to
be in a mood to offer Clinton much. Moreover, while the House
approved the WTO accord in the spring by a surprisingly large
margin, the Senate has yet to act. Passage there seems all but
assured, but the Republican leadership has yet to schedule a vote,
part of an elaborate maneuver for political advantage in the last
days of the congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that even as the administration works to secure
Senate passage of the trade bill, ``we will be pressing the Chinese
on the question of implementation'' of the WTO accord. Those are
code words for American concern that China will drag its feet on
market openings and continue its efforts _ stepped up in recent
months _ to control Internet content in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said earlier this year that such efforts were fruitless
and that eventually, the openness spawned by increased commercial
contacts would undermine the Communist Party's power. He is
unlikely to repeat that prediction, which presumably angered
China's leaders, to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   One focus of the Friday meeting will be to win Jiang's assurance
that China's missile exports to Pakistan, its longtime ally against
India, will cease. ``We have to get this resolved and we are
seeking further commitments on restraint,'' Berger said. But he
quickly added that he did not expect an accord at this meeting. The
two men are expected to see each other again after the presidential
election, at a meeting of Asian leaders. But by then Clinton's
powers will be all the more diminished in China's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Berger also said that the two men will discuss Taiwan at some
length, for the first time since the island's longtime opposition
won the presidential election. China made threatening indications
to Taiwan before the election, in an effort to keep independence
forces far from power, but has been far more moderate since the
Nationalist Party lost. Still, there has been little communication
between Beijing and the new government in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been urging flexibility, restraint and dialogue and we
have had more success on one and two than three,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's U.N. speech on Wednesday will also endorse a report,
issued by a special advisory group to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
that a permanent peacekeeping structure be created in New York.
That would sidestep the awkward process of re-creating a
peacekeeping structure each time U.N. forces are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle we are supportive of what is in the report for a
peacekeeping operation,'' Berger said. ``It parallels what we have
been recommending for several years.''

IBM AND MICROSOFT LEAD GROUP TOWARD WEB STANDARD FOR BUSINESS
TRANSACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seeking to promote the rapid development of
electronic commerce between businesses, IBM, Microsoft and Ariba
plan to announce a proposal on Wednesday to create a huge set of
online registries of products and services to help automate
business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine companies, including American Express, CommerceOne,
Compaq, Merrill Lynch and Sun Microsystems, will initially endorse
the proposal, to be named the Universal Description, Discovery and
Integration project, or UDDI. The backers said they planned to turn
the idea over eventually to one of several Internet standards
bodies to make it a broadly backed initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are intent on making the Web an easier way to handle
business-to-business transactions,'' said Marie Weik, IBM's
director of electronic markets infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative comes at a time when companies have begun to
grapple with the intricacies of electronic commerce, hoping to
achieve the original promise of a new Internet publishing standard
known as Extensible Markup Language, or XML.
</P>
<P>
   Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, led to the current World
Wide Web as a vast electronic publishing medium. Many hope XML will
permit direct computer-to-computer transactions as Web technology
develops.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the UDDI project was a closely held secret among
the three companies. While IBM and Microsoft are dominant players
in Internet commerce, Ariba is a smaller electronic commerce
company, based in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initiative is being portrayed as an effort to
create an ``open'' standard, the UDDI project offers some insight
into the bruising behind-the-scenes competition occurring in the
area of Internet standards as companies seek proprietary advantage
for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Several executives at competing electronic commerce companies
said the UDDI standard initiative parallels but ignores an earlier
effort led by Commercenet, a competing Silicon Valley electronic
commerce initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the eCo Framework Project, that system also focused on
creating public electronic registries and automated electronic
commerce. But the Commercenet effort has lost momentum, and
Microsoft has moved quickly to take over the effort to set
standards for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Making analogies to telephone directory yellow and white pages,
executives said their proposed UDDI standard would permit companies
to publish descriptive information about their organization and
their products in a way that could easily be located by electronic
commerce software programs used in business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the proposed standard would go a step beyond
being a static ``telephone directory'' style reference service. An
additional component of the registry was described as a ``green
pages,'' which would allow companies to publish information about
their business practices.
</P>
<P>
   This is intended to make it possible for electronic commerce
programs based on the XML standard to locate business partners
automatically and buy and sell products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps a better analogy would be to the signaling system used
by the telephone network to automatically set up telephone calls,''
said James Utzschneider, Microsoft's director of Web services for
the company's business applications division.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies said they plan to create a prototype within
a month.

DEMOCRATS' DASH: 4 STATES IN 27 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD ``WORDSMITH II'' _ In an effort to jump-start the general
election campaign, and take a poke at George W. Bush's more
leisurely campaign style, Al Gore and Joseph I. Lieberman jetted
off Sunday on a 27-hour campaign ``Workathon'' to mark Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush chuckled last week when he heard about the trip, but soon
afterward the Republican presidential contender decided to begin
his latest campaign swing one day earlier, on Sunday instead of
Monday, and extend it until Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket coined a name for its journey: ``Al and
Joe's Hard Day's Tour.'' It was that and more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
1:30 p.m. Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Andrews Air Force Base, Md.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's check-in time at Andrews Air Force Base, and the roads
nearby are clear. That's because everyone in Washington is
squeezing in a last visit to the beach, at the Washington Redskins
home opener, or watching the US national soccer team's match
against Guatemala at RFK Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The traveling press corps isn't so lucky. We sit in a sterile
arrival lounge, watching a Secret Service agent rifle through our
bags and rearrange everything that had been arranged so carefully
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we're crammed onto a bus for a short drive across the
tarmac to the press charter, a Pan Am Boeing 727 dubbed the
``Clipper Walt Helmer'' after a judge who helped the Portsmouth,
N.H., company emerge from bankruptcy. The Gore campaign has a
different name for it: ``Wordsmith II.'' As we arrive, a flight
attendant named Trinidad is tying red, white, and blue balloons to
the top of the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably cost $20,000,'' joked one reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute trip to Philadelphia is uneventful and we find
three motor coaches waiting on the ground. Campaign aides give each
traveler a plastic grocery bag filled with a trip kitty: a baseball
cap from the ``Survivor'' TV series (motto: ``Outwit, Outplay,
Outlast''); a T-shirt with the trip plotted across a map of the
United States; a bottle of spring water; and a selection of
toiletries including a single-use toothbrush, a disposable razor,
and a packet of shave cream.
</P>
<P>
   The first event is at a Hyatt Regency hotel under construction
at Penn's Landing, overlooking the Delaware River. Gore and
Lieberman arrive about a half-hour late, after picking up 100
cheesesteak sandwiches for the workers at Pat's ``King of Steaks,''
a cheesesteak landmark on the city's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates try to look the part in their jackets and
open-collar shirts, but Gore slips by wearing polished black cowboy
boots while Lieberman sports a pair of $175 Ecco hiking boots. The
workers, clad in union T-shirts and dusty, scuffed workboots, pay
no heed.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman gives an introduction that shows off his charisma,
alternately joking and speaking seriously. He jokes that he should
have a collective bargaining agreement, because ``this guy's
working me too hard,'' but then he connects with a story about his
father the bread truck driver, who later used the proceeds from a
package store to make his son the first in the family to go to
college.
</P>
<P>
   The US senator from Connecticut also blasts Bush for saying at
the Republican National Convention that the past eight years have
been ``squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a construction boom, he tells the workers, ``You sure as
hell know the last eight years have not been squandered. But this
election is about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gore plays to the audience, saying, ``If you
want a job done right, have it done by union workers.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to veto an across-the-board tax cut like that which
Bush has proposed, and he also takes a jab at the Texas governor's
proposal to let workers invest a portion of their Social Security
taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and I want to take the Social Security and Medicare
programs, take them out of the rest of the budget, put them in an
iron-clad lockbox, put up a sign that says, `Politicians, hands
off,' '' the vice president pledges.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has made a similar promise, Gore adds: ``I'll tell
you what I'll never go along with, and that is the plan to divert
one out of every six dollars from the trust fund and put it into
the stock market, meaning that you'd have to come up with a
trillion dollars from somewhere else to pay for the so-called
privatization of Social Security. I'm against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman leave to take in the end of the Philadelphia
Eagles-Dallas Cowboys game at Doc's Union Pub, a union-owned bar. A
clearly tipsy patron stands up behind Gore at one point and says,
``Where's Al Gore. They told me I could see Al Gore.'' The vice
president stands up and has his picture taken with her.
</P>
<P>
   Gore then heads upstairs for a radio interview with Ed Rendell,
a former Philadelphia mayor who is now chairman of the Democratic
National Committee. They make lots of references to the Eagles'
defeat of the Cowboys, with Rendell hinting at Bush by asking, ``Is
it fair to say from today's game that the Eagles `messed with
Texas'?'' Gore replies: ``I think that's entirely fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the press corps heads to a nearby Sheraton for a
robust dinner and a measley amount of filing time. After only 45
minutes to transmit stories, we are herded through a violent
thunderstorm back to a bus for the ride back to the Pan Am charter.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Trinidad is waiting with fruit salad and another dinner
offering: cheesesteak sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
10 p.m. Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A crescent moon hangs over the haze as Gore and Lieberman step
off the plane to greet several hundred AFSCME workers who have
staged an ``impromptu'' rally after being swept by security and led
to a pen in front of floodlights trained on Air Force II.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Lieberman introduces Gore and makes wise about needing a
collective bargaining agreement. The senator, the first Jew named
to a major party ticket, also jokes about recent criticism that he
invokes religion too much on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the labor movement was a religion, which in some ways it
is, Flint, Mich., would be one of its holy cities,'' he says. The
impromptu audience delivers a spontaneous cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to Hurley Medical Center to speak to the late
shift of doctors and nurses, Gore talks about his plan to provide
prescription drug coverage through the Medicare program. He also
smashes the ``bean counters'' at HMOs who try to ``play God'' by
overruling doctors' orders.
</P>
<P>
   Then the vice president strokes the locals by highlighting their
role in the coming general election. ``Michigan is as close to the
key as you'll find, and Flint is right here in the position to
swing the whole difference, and it makes a difference to you
whether or not you have a president who will fight for you,'' he
says to more cheering.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, Gore and Lieberman make much the same speeches
and exchange much the same hug as they trade off the microphone.
There is one difference: While Gore still wears his cowboy boots,
Lieberman has changed into more sensible brown tie-ups.
</P>
<P>
   With their final deadlines approaching, some reporters listen to
the speech from a ``filing'' center. Although it is barely four
hours since dinner, the staff has arranged for pizza, salad, and
beer. There are plenty of takers.
</P>
<P>
   On their way back to the airport, the Democratic ticket stops by
a General Motors plant to watch an assembly line that makes pickup
trucks. Gore and Lieberman don protective covers on their belts to
keep from scratching the paint on the new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the plane, the staff at the filing center obviously
hasn't passed the word to Trinidad, who is waiting with chicken
wings, a cheese platter, fruit, cookies, and another round of
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Air Force II, Gore appears in the press cabin at 2 a.m.
to find the lights out. ``I can't believe that you are sleeping
back here,'' he says. Asked Lieberman's whereabouts, the vice
president replies: ``He's reflecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 20 minutes, Gore is back in his cabin and the entire
plane is dark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
6 a.m. Monday
</P>
<P>
   Tampa
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The humidity is thick and the sun is just starting to appear
over Tampa as Gore and Lieberman, now sporting jeans and fresh polo
shirts, climb onto the back of a pickup truck to address a crowd of
about 600. Across the street are the first Bush-Cheney supporters
of the trip, but they are blocked from view by firetrucks and a
camera platform.
</P>
<P>
   After Air Force II had arrived at Tampa International Airport at
4 a.m., Gore and Lieberman acted like an old married couple, coming
down the aircraft stairs together, coffee cups in hand, before they
grabbed a copy of the St. Petersburg Times and went back inside.
They emerged minutes later and split up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore paid homage to his mother by visiting Pops and Sons Cafe,
lit up in the Labor Day darkness. The vice president's mother,
Pauline, paid her way through Vanderbilt Law School with 25-cent
tips she earned at an all-night diner.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman paid tribute to his father by heading to Alessi's
Bakery. The senator talks often about how his father drove a bakery
truck in the pre-dawn hours. Less often does he mention that his
father later ran a package store and used the proceeds of the
liquor sales to send his son to college.
</P>
<P>
   When the two reunite at Firehouse No. 9 in West Tampa, Lieberman
tells the collective bargaining joke for the third time. In his
introduction of Gore, he begins to note how honored he is that his
friend selected him to be his running mate, then says: ``Let me be
honest: I'd be pretty happy if anybody asked me to run for vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, delivers his most virulent speech yet. He
also repeats a misconception as he talks about Bush and his running
mate, former defense secretary Dick Cheney. Gore never calls them
by name, instead referring to the Republicans as ``the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``I will not ever sign the other side's plan to give
away the surplus in a giant tax cut, primarily to the wealthy, at
the expense of the middle class.'' Moments later, he returns to the
point about the federal budget, saying: ``If you give all that
surplus away in the form of a giant tax cut, primarily for the
wealthy, you're going to have the top 1 percent get richer and
richer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed no such thing. Of the $4.6 trillion in
surpluses projected for the next decade, he has proposed leaving
half untouched in the Social Security trust fund, saving $1.3
trillion for emergencies or government spending, and using the
remainder, $1.3 trillion, for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continues undeterred, blasting Republican ``trickle-down''
economics and declaring: ``I'll be damned if we're going to go back
to the old ways of just borrow-and-spend and go into debt in order
to give the big tax cut to the wealthy. That is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   After a joint appearance on the ``Today'' show, for which Gore
and Lieberman don their third shirts of the trip, the running mates
part company. The vice president heads to Pittsburgh and
Louisville, Ky., while Lieberman takes off for Detroit; Toledo,
Ohio; and Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   We fly back north on Air Force II.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
11:30 a.m. Monday
</P>
<P>
   En route to Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Air Force II is the video monitor in the
press cabin that charts the airplane's progress and displays
statistics about its altitude, speed, and outside air temperature.
The second best thing is that most everybody aboard is completely
wired.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Boeing 757 touches down, Gore campaign spokesman
Chris Lehane is reading messages from a pager. He chuckles when he
sees a note saying that before a speech in Illinois, Bush used a
vulgarity to badmouth a reporter without realizing he was speaking
into a live microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane immediately piles on. ``He went from having one event a
day to two, so maybe doubling his workload is causing him
trouble,'' the spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
   The plane lands, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson boards to speak with
Gore for about a half-hour before the two march in a parade and
address a Labor Day rally in downtown Pittsburgh. As Jackson
arrives, he makes a special point of shaking the hands of two black
Air Force officers guarding the stairs to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore emerges clad in his fourth shirt of the trip, a red polo
inscribed ``Labor Day Parade.'' At Point State Park, on
Pittsburgh's waterfront, Jackson delivers a red-meat attack on the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   He describes the Democrats as a ``big-tent American team,'' and
says, ``And then there's George W.,'' which elicits boos, ``and Mr.
Cheney,'' eliciting more boos, ``and Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms
and Orrin Hatch,'' listing the names of GOP conservatives. ``It's
time for America's team to win in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   During his turn at the mike, Gore repeats the phrases he has
been saying all night, about the bean counter, about the Social
Security lockbox, about who's for the powerful and who's for the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it all comes down to is whether we are going to be free
to fight for what is right,'' the vice president says. By the time
he finishes, he has sweated through shirt number four.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Pan Am charter, Trinidad has been replaced by a
flight attendant named Annette, who sweetly offers four kinds of
sandwiches: ham and cheese, chicken salad, tuna, and turkey. We
pick turkey. The passenger in the row ahead gets the last one.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken salad it is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
6:25 p.m. Monday
</P>
<P>
   Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The end is in sight, and none too soon for the vice president's
valets. He's on shirt number five, a slate gray polo.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is greeted by more than 1,000 cheering union members at a
rally just after racing ended at the Louisville Motor Speedway. He
feels an affinity with the crowd, and there's good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 75,000 cousins in Kentucky,'' declares Gore, who
hails from neighboring Carthage, Tenn. ``Anybody who's related to
me, raise their hand.'' Every hand in the crowd shoots up as
laughter erupts.
</P>
<P>
   After 2,900 miles, four states, and five cities, Gore makes one
more spin through the stump speech. He also dips into the text of
his convention speech, which launched his surge in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is not a reward for past performance; I am not
asking you to support me on the basis of the economy we have. I'm
asking for your support on the basis of the better, fairer,
stronger economy that we're going to make together over the next
four years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the confetti flies, the music plays one more time _
and the press corps starts to head to bed. Then word comes from the
campaign staff: Gore wants to make one last stop, at a nearby 911
center before bringing his Workathon to a close. The pool piles
onto a bus, and the rest of us finally get to go to sleep.

ERSTAD MIGHT BE BACK IN LEFT FIELD TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Joe Haakenson  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A strained muscle in his ribcage relegated Angels
outfielder Darin Erstad to designated hitter for the 10th
consecutive game Monday. He missed four games before returning as
the DH.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Mike Scioscia hopes Erstad can return to left field
for tonight's game. Erstad's problem has been throwing the ball,
but Monday he worked out with coach Ron Roenicke in left field and
said it improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's broken through,'' Scioscia said. ``You've got to
cover some real estate here.''
</P>
<P>
   Comerica Park's outfield is spacious, particularly between left
and center field. It's 398 feet to left center and 420 feet to
straight-away center.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad went 1 for 3 Monday to extend his hitting streak to 10
games. Even though his batting average fell from .363 to .362, he
took over the lead in the race for the A.L. batting title from the
Blue Jays' Carlos Delgado, who fell to .361.
</P>
<P>
   The lone batting champion in Angels history is Alex Johnson, who
batted .329 in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   FYHRIE OFF DL: Pitcher Mike Fyhrie was activated from the
disabled list Monday after recovering from an inflamed right elbow.
His presence was needed because relievers Al Levine and Shigetoshi
Hasegawa were unavailable, having pitched three innings and two
innings, respectively, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME TO THE SHOW: The Angels will call up pitchers Juan
Alvarez (Triple-A Edmonton) and Ben Weber (Double-A Erie) today. &QL;

DAIMLERCHRYSLER ANGLING FOR MORE CONTROL AT MITSUBISHI MOTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ DaimlerChrysler AG, which has based its
hopes for Asian expansion on a partnership with Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. of Japan, is demanding more control in the wake of a scandal
over defective cars that has engulfed Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement Monday, a spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler
in Stuttgart confirmed that ``we are in talks about the future of
the alliance'' in the context of ``the current challenges facing
Mitsubishi Motor Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Daimler executives said they wanted more control over
Mitsubishi, in which the German automobile manufacturer had been
planning to pay $2 billion for a 34 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   But they refused to say what form that control might take. NHK,
a Japanese television network, reported Monday that Daimler
executives were demanding that their stake be increased at no extra
cost to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would make Daimler the biggest shareholder in Mitsubishi
Motors, bigger even that Mitsubishi's parent company, Mitsubishi
Corp. But other options include increasing the number of Daimler
executives on Mitsubishi's board from three to four and winning the
right to oust and name a replacement for Mitsubishi's president,
Katsuhiko Kawasoe.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Daimler's top executives, Eckhard Cordes and Manfred
Bischoff, met last Friday with Minoru Makihara, the chairman of
Mitsubishi Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens, the Mitsubishi scandal poses
Daimler's chairman, Juergen Schrempp, with major problems on
opposite sides of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the merger and de facto takeover of
Chrysler Corp. two years ago has been followed by steadily
dwindling profit margins and the resignations of many top Chrysler
executives, including its chairman, Robert Eaton, and its
president, Thomas Stallkamp.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, DaimlerChrysler surprised and irritated industry
analysts by abruptly canceling a meeting with them scheduled for
this week. The cancellation stirred speculation that Daimler is
either planning another management shake-up or pondering the
release of more bad financial news.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Mitsubishi was supposed to strengthen DaimlerChrysler's
minuscule presence. But last month, just a few weeks after the two
companies agreed on the final details of their pact, Mitsubishi
announced the recall of nearly 1 million cars and was forced to
admit that it started keeping defects secret two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The defects included faulty fuel tanks, clutches, crankshafts
and brakes. Since 1977, Mitsubishi admitted two weeks ago, managers
had suppressed information about consumer complaints, making
repairs in secret and keeping record of the repairs on separate
books that were concealed from government inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   And the scandal is not over yet. On Sunday, Japanese police
raided Mitsubishi offices for the second time in search of
documents that might provide the basis for charges of a criminal
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the problems with Mitsubishi are much less
threatening to Daimler than the slump at Chrysler, which has caused
Daimler shares to be among the worst performing of Germany's
blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitsubishi could prove much more difficult for Daimler to
turn around and use as a base for expanding its Asian presence.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the problems could give Daimler executives leverage
that they have not been able to acquire so far.
</P>
<P>
   Although acquiring 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors' shares as
originally planned would give Daimler a veto over major board
decisions, it would not give Schrempp or his lieutenants the power
to dictate the details of a tough restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when Renault SA of France acquired a similar stake
in Nissan Motor in 1999, one of its top executives, Carlos Ghosn,
became tantamount to chief executive of the Japanese company and is
now putting Nissan through a wide-ranging overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference between the two cases is that Nissan has
much more dispersed shareholders, making it easier for Renault to
take command.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of DaimlerChrysler, Schrempp has repeatedly shown a
determination to seize control. Though the deal with Chrysler was
touted as a ``merger of equals,'' Schrempp overshadowed Eaton from
the first day and Chrysler is now merely the American subsidiary of
a Stuttgart corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter control has not yet brought Schrempp greater rewards,
however. Though the Mercedes-Benz operations are generally
thriving, the Chrysler business has been hammered by competition in
the United States and the company has only been able to maintain
sales growth by giving customers ever-more generous discounts and
thereby sacrificing profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The steady erosion of Chrysler's clout within DaimlerChrysler
could also hinder the restructuring of Mitsubishi. For more than a
decade, Chrysler has had a broad working relationship with
Mitsubishi that included a jointly owned factory in Normal, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   That experience could give Chrysler executives better insight
into Mitsubishi's problems and people. But given Schrempp's
frustrations with Chrysler, it is doubtful he will trust
Mitsubishi's recovery to its managers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, DaimlerChrysler faces a potentially ticklish legal
issue if it pushes for too much control of Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Breitsprecher, an automobile analyst at Deutsche Bank,
said that if Daimler were perceived to have taken control of
Mitsubishi, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
could force it to consolidate Mitsubishi's results with its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a disaster, because it would mean that Daimler
would have to consolidate all of Mitsubishi's debt,'' Breitsprecher
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Funke, a spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler, said talks with
Mitsubishi have been ``fruitful and cooperative'' and should result
in an agreement in ``the very near future.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At 32, Mona Sutphen, smart, driven and possessed of
that quality so elusive in Washington, an easy personality, was
known as one of the best and the brightest in the West Wing of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   As executive assistant to the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, she was trusted to work on the most sensitive foreign
policy matters. She sat through the tough crises, including whether
to bomb Iraq and how to rescue an American pilot downed in enemy
Yugoslav territory. Had she wanted, Sutphen, who was on loan from
the State Department, could have gone to the heights of the U.S.
Foreign Service: political counselor at an embassy, assistant
secretary of state or an ambassador. Perhaps even the top job one
day.
</P>
<P>
   But those peaks did not look so great to Sutphen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning to the State Department and a future of
writing cables that she felt nobody important read, she took her
passion for foreign affairs to an Internet company. She is a prime
example of what policy experts say is a crippling problem at the
State Department: talented diplomats are leaving for careers that
they believe have more power and prestige in the new global
economy. And college graduates who used to rush to take the Foreign
Service exam no longer bother.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as the State Department, the institution responsible
for American diplomacy around the world, is finding it hard to
adjust to an era in which financial markets pack more punch than a
Washington-Moscow summit meeting. It is losing recruits to
investment banks, dot-com companies and the Treasury and Commerce
Departments, which have magnified their foreign policy roles. Some
are turning to idealistic private organizations that work in risky
environments abroad, a far cry from the days of the Cold War, when
the State Department was the only place to be.
</P>
<P>
   When Sutphen prepared to leave the State Department this spring,
the Foreign Service made her decision easier because, while it took
great pride in her as a woman of African-American heritage, it
offered her nothing that she found challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end there was nothing on the horizon that I really
wanted,'' she said. After the hothouse of the National Security
Council at the White House, and having served in Bosnia and
Thailand, the ``idea of being the third political officer on the
Israeli desk is very difficult.'' Instead, she chose to join the
Manhattan office of Currenex, a Silicon Valley Internet company
that specializes in business-to-business foreign currency trading,
at a salary of more than $100,000 _ more than twice her government
pay _ plus stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of prestige and power at the State Department has not
gone unnoticed around Washington or inside the department itself.
What to do about it has consumed study groups and consultants and
caused internal hand-wringing among the top echelon of State
Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the department was so worried about the problem that
two years ago it commissioned a study from a consulting firm,
McKinsey &AMP; Co. The results , with recommendations to be carried out
this year, were not flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Young diplomats told the consultants that they were frustrated
by slow promotions in the bureaucracy compared with promotions
based on merit in the private sector. They questioned the relevance
of their work. ``The best for what work?'' parried one respondent.
</P>
<P>
   They were dismissive of what they described as a demoralized
management. They complained that the department was unresponsive to
the demands of two-career couples, especially when sending
diplomats abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``The War for Talent'' _ tellingly renamed
``The War Against Talent'' in the department's corridors _ quoted
one diplomat as saying, ``You've joined the supposedly elite
Foreign Service and you have terrible managers _ people who've been
promoted to get them out of other people's hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the department, the U.S. Commission on National
Security/21st Century, set up by the federal government to study
the nation's needs for its national security architecture, has
taken a particular interest in the failings of the State
Department. The commission's executive director, Gen. Charles G.
Boyd, said he had been taken aback by the difficulty the department
had in ``retaining and recruiting quality people.''
</P>
<P>
   At elite graduate schools specializing in international
relations, deans say that the Foreign Service has slipped down the
totem pole as a career choice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, smart graduates who want to join government are heading
for the Departments of the Treasury or Commerce, said Mark L. von
Hagen, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University.
Others gravitate toward nongovernmental organizations and to the
World Bank. ``It reflects the generally diminished role of the
State Department in foreign policy,'' von Hagen said.
</P>
<P>
   The new director-general of the Foreign Service at the State
Department, Marc Grossman, who is in essence the department's chief
personnel officer, acknowledged the problem when he appeared before
the Commission on National Security recently.
</P>
<P>
   The dropout rate for one of the five groups of diplomats who
entered the State Department in 1992 or 1993 was 32 percent, he
said. For another group in that two-year period the dropout rate
was 23 percent, although it was only 12 percent for two other
groups. From 1994 to 1997, the dropout rate has hovered around 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department's personnel department said
they did not have statistics to compare this dropout rate with
previous decades. Nor, they said, had the department done any
analysis to determine whether those who had left in the 1990s were
considered the most talented.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most senior officials at the State Department,
Undersecretary of States Thomas R. Pickering, who has served for
nearly 40 years and has been ambassador to eight countries, said he
did not believe that the dropout rates differed ``so wildly'' from
the past, particularly in the era of the Vietnam War when many
dissenters quit.
</P>
<P>
   But Boyd said that ``anecdotal'' evidence suggested that good
young diplomats had quit in the 1990s and that the dropout rate was
higher than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And for all those who are leaving, there are believed to be many
who are more than qualified but are not considering the Foreign
Service. Last year, said the undersecretary for management, Bonnie
R. Cohen, there was a ``significant'' drop in the number of
candidates who, after passing the written and oral exams of the
Foreign Service and the security checks, accepted an offer to join
the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means young people are looking elsewhere for other
jobs,'' said Cohen, who is in charge of budgetary and personnel
matters for the department.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Money _ in particular the large financial packages from merchant
banks that also offer stimulating work in the global economy _ is
proving an important, though not overriding, reason for officials
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The average starting salary for a new Foreign Service officer is
$32,500, Cohen said. This is less than some customer service agents
make at Verizon's union telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Peter E. Bass, 37 _ who after a meteoric career left the State
Department this summer to join Goldman Sachs as the chief of staff
for the bank's president and chief operating officer, John L.
Thornton _ is one of half a dozen officials who have been enticed
away in the last several years by Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to gain a knowledge of the financial world, the global
economy and capital markets, which are the key for global
prosperity,'' Bass said, explaining his decision to leave. He had
been deputy assistant secretary of state for energy and sanctions,
involved in policy toward Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wall Street salary was also a lure. ``When the
difference in money is arithmetic, it's bearable; when it's
geometric, it becomes harder and harder,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Grossman is appreciated as the new face of
personnel, though, is that he acknowledges that money is not the
only reason for losing good people. He knows, he said, that in
order to attract and keep talent, the department must evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department has to change from being one that went and
observed to one that sees itself in a more active world,'' Grossman
said. ``I can't give more people more money but I can give jobs
that are seen as more active and less passive.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be a hard argument to win. Many of the fields that
Grossman talks about being new to the State Department _
international trafficking in people, the environment, empowering
poor women _ are often handled by other American agencies operating
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, for example,
now operate at a number of American embassies. Rather than being
proud of this expansion, American diplomats view these agencies as
competitors for whom, they say, embassies perform the role of
``concierge.'' At the American Embassy in London, for example,
fewer than 20 percent of the officials belong to the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   There are other hurdles: most notably, the archaic way the State
Department hires people and treats them once they get inside. It
can take up to two years before a candidate, who has taken the
written exam (general knowledge, focusing on international affairs)
and the oral exam (problem solving) and passed the security
clearance, is invited to join the Foreign Service.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who have recently left the State Department argue that
the substance of the work must also change if good people are going
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a culture where you are told to make notes and send
them forward,'' said Spence Spencer, 38, who quit this summer after
12 years and three tours abroad. ``A lot of it is staffing to make
sure your boss looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, who celebrated his departure over several glasses of
wine at a recent lunch, left on a high note. He reached a cherished
goal: equipping 30 court buildings in Kosovo with computers, fax
machines, photocopiers, typewriters, generators and metal
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the department's Human Rights Bureau, Spencer
said there was much more in the field of human rights that he would
like to do at the State Department but felt he would be unable to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such disdain for the community of nongovernment
organizations at the State Department,'' said Spencer, whose
passion is elections, police, justice and the other ``soft'' issues
that crop up in regions of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``At State, you can't talk to these organizations with ease,''
he said. ``So you are left talking to each other.'' Spencer is
joining Public Strategies Inc., a company based in Austin, Texas.
He will specialize in public affairs for European companies
exporting to the United States and plans to do pro bono work for
international nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Another diplomat, Cynthia R. Bunton, 46, who dreamed of joining
the State Department from age 12, speaks four languages and has
served in a number of posts abroad. Now that she is back in
Washington, the department is unable to find a way to use her new
expertise in intellectual property rights, an increasingly vital
issue for American business.
</P>
<P>
   As the consul in Naples, Italy, for political and commercial
affairs, she became an expert in property rights and for the past
year has been on loan to the Recording Industry Association of
America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bunton said she realized the importance of economics in
diplomacy several years ago and decided to concentrate on music
piracy. ``The question is: Do I go backward and become a political
officer again _ which I have been all my life _ or go out into
private industry?'' she said. She still feels loyalty to the State
Department, but she is leaning, she said, toward leaving.
</P>
<P>
   One of those on the U.S. Commission on National Security, Leslie
H. Gelb, said that in order to keep people like Sutphen, Bass,
Spencer and Bunton, the State Department must make fundamental
changes to regain the prestige of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department will be able to attract anyone it wants
when once again the building becomes the center of making foreign
policy and foreign policy strategy,'' said Gelb, who is the
president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good people want to work at places that are at the center of
things.''

   BENSON, Ariz. _ Take a sopping wet underground cavern in a
remote corner of Arizona. Add a man-made entrance with heavy steel
doors to keep out the hot desert air, a misting system to keep the
cavern damp and lights to show off a wonderland of spires,
flowstone, soda straws and other phantasmagorical cave formations.
</P>
<P>
   Then add a human being who, in a one-hour visit, sloughs off
some 60,000 skin fragments, 160 million dust particles, 20,000
clothing-lint particles, 25 quarts of carbon dioxide gas and 170
watts of body heat. Multiply this by 183,000 visitors to the cave
each year.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an ad hoc experiment now under way at Kartchner
Caverns near Benson, Ariz., to learn if it is possible to bring
thousands of people into the fragile environment of a pristine cave
without destroying the cave in the process. Kartchner is the first
major show cave to open in the United States in several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State Parks system, which owns the land, is trying,
with some difficulty, to balance the interests of visitors with
those of preservationists. Arizona has spent more than $28 million
on monitoring systems and on a visitors center, two man-made
entrances, 1,100 feet of concrete tunnels and 1,225 feet of trails
that lead visitors to large showrooms inside the cavern. One of
these, the Throne Room, is now open. A second, the Big Room,
probably will not open for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are signs that the cave is drying out _ compared
with years before the cave opened last November, the average
temperature is up 1 degree and in some spots humidity dropped by
half a percent and evaporation rates quadrupled. And without enough
moisture, Kartchner's formations will stop growing and their colors
will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Travous, director of Arizona State Parks, said that the
changes could be explained by the construction, which is still
under way, and the severe drought in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of leading cave scientists and the two men who
discovered the cavern 26 years ago are worried that park officials
are not heeding signs that the cavern may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kerbo, a leading authority on cave management for the
National Park Service, recently visited Kartchner Caverns. Although
he praised the commitment of the state park officials, he pointed
out problems with lighting, misting, air locks, data collection and
a new proposal to sample cave air and moisture with a system of
plastic tubing called cave suckers. ``It would be better to install
electronic sensors'' to understand changes in cave microclimates,
Kerbo said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tufts, co-discoverer of the cave who now does lunar and
planetary research at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said:
``Our main concern is that they don't seem to be on top of data
collection. It's one thing to have a problem and know it and
another to have a problem and not know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufts and his caving buddy, Gary Tenen, who today owns two Alpha
Graphics stores in Tucson, found the cave in 1974 when they crawled
into a cavity in the Whetstone Mountains and smelled ``eau de bat
guano'' coming from a three-inch hole in a wall of limestone. They
widened the hole, crawled in and discovered an untouched,
two-and-a-half-mile long, richly decorated ``living'' cave, meaning
its formations were still growing.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that large numbers of amateur cavers would destroy the
pristine cavern simply by exploring it, the two kept the cave's
existence a secret. In 1978, they told the Kartchner family, which
owned the land, about the cave, and in 1988 the family sold it to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, we realized that the best way to preserve the
cavern was to develop it as a commercial show cave so that it would
remain under watchful eyes,'' Tenen said. In unsupervised caves,
people cannot seem to stop themselves from breaking off stalactites
that took 10,000 years to grow, writing on walls and strewing
garbage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In opening the nation's newest cave, the developers of Kartchner
have been able to employ state-of-the-art principles of cave
conservation that are being used to maintain and restore older
caves in other parts of the United States and in Australia, France
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Kartchner Caverns is a twisted maze of passageways that open
into two main galleries with 100-foot-high ceilings and 26 smaller
rooms. Apart from spectacular stalactites, stalagmites and columns,
many of the formations sound good enough to eat or put in a living
room at home: fried eggs, bacon, popcorn, turnip shields, soda
straws, draperies, cave cotton, coral pipes, birdnests and miles of
moonmilk, a soft, white claylike substance on cave walls. Some of
the formations are blood red. A viscous mud of unknown depth lies
in many passages, holding water from past floods.
</P>
<P>
   From April to September each year, 1,000 to 2,000 myotis bats
turn one corner of the cave into a bat maternity ward. That corner
will be off limits to visitors then, Travous said. A variety of
microbial life plus 38 invertebrate species munch on bat guano or
each other year round.
</P>
<P>
   Like most limestone caves in the world, Kartchner was formed
when rain water combined with carbon dioxide in the air and carbon
in the soil to form a weak acid solution similar to soda pop. As
this acidic water trickled through limestone, it picked up calcium
in the rock. When it reached air in underground passages carved by
water running underground, each droplet gave up carbon dixode gas
and left calcium carbonate in tiny rings that grew into the yummy
sounding cave formations.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge at Kartchner is that this wet underworld lies in a
desert where the surface evaporation rate is 800 times greater than
inside the cave. If completely opened to surface air, the cave
would dry out in a week, Travous said.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening it to the public, scientists spent two years
taking baseline measurements of air and soil temperatures, relative
humidity, evaporation rates, gases and airflow patterns within the
cave.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extremely fragile environment, said Robert Buecher, a
civil engineer who led the monitoring study and is a leading
authority on cave climates. The original entrance allowed very
little air exchange with the surface, he said. If the humidity were
to drop just 0.7 percent from its average before development, to
98.7 percent, he said, the evaporation rate would double and start
to dry out the cave.
</P>
<P>
   Cave climates are tricky and often counterintuitive, Buecher
said. For example, one winter the cave flooded and the relative
humidity went down instead of up. This was because the flood water
was slightly colder than the cave air and, just as a glass of iced
tea in summer collects moisture, the cold water condensed moisture
out of the cave air.
</P>
<P>
   But people are the biggest threat to cave health, Kerbo said. At
Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, people snap off and carry away
2,000 to 3,000 pieces of cave formation each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who goes into a cave leaves behind a belly button
full of lint, skin cells and dust,'' said Tom Aley, owner and
director of the Ozark Underground Laboratory, a cavern dedicated to
teaching and research in Protem, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   People carry enough dust on the surface of their clothing fibers
to cover the area of two tennis courts, said Neville Michie, a cave
climate expert at Macquarie University in Marsfield, Australia.
Walking through a cave, each person drops one microgram of dust per
second, Michie said. The dust travels to the corners of a cavern
and dulls the formations. Skin cells and lint, which are heavier
than dust, accumulate near trails in nasty-looking grayish black
mats or can even hang from the ceiling in ``lintcicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Flakes of skin are little life rafts for bacteria that float
into the cave and compete with native bacteria, often taking over.
Moreover, most lint contains phosphates from detergents, and
phosphates are essentially fertilizers for algae, which can take
root in the cave formations and cause them to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which can change the
deposition rate of calcium carbonate, slowing the growth of
formations. And, of course, people add heat.
</P>
<P>
   All of these problems were anticipated at Kartchner, Travous
said. The entrances and tunnels were dug at the same level of the
natural opening, which prevents air from leaving the cave in a
chimney effect. The visitor center, parking lot and other
structures were built downhill within a different drainage system.
Two huge walk-in freezer doors at each entrance serve as airlocks
to the entrance tunnel and prevent surface air from coming into the
cave.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the tunnel, visitors pass through a smaller third
door that leads to trails for viewing cave formations. Misters,
like those used on vegetables in a supermarket, are on round the
clock, adding two to three gallons of water per hour to the cave.
</P>
<P>
   The trails have 18-inch-high curbs for catching lint and skin
cells, which tend to fall straight to the ground. Trails are hosed
down every night. Lights are turned on only when tours pass through
an area.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Travous said, only 20 people at a time
are allowed on a tour and are watched by two guides.
</P>
<P>
   As for keeping an eye on the cave's climate, 13 monitoring
stations for temperature, humidity and evaporation rate are located
along the tour route and in deeper recesses of the cave. The ``cave
sucker'' system of tubing is being installed in hope of automating
data collection.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if all these measures were working to protect the cave,
Travous said, ``We sure hope so,'' but added, ``We still don't know
what is acceptable change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cave is one degree warmer and the humidity is lower in
some places,'' Travous said. ``But if we go back and look at
monitoring data from the past, we've seen these higher temperatures
before. Plus the cave will flood again.''
</P>
<P>
   But many scientists familiar with Kartchner Caverns are worried
that some of the steps taken to protect the cave may ultimately
contribute to its drying out. While the freezer doors keep hot air
out of the cave entrance, the tunnels contain so much air that they
may significantly alter air flow inside the cave, Kerbo said.
</P>
<P>
   The misters might change air flow patterns and temperatures,
Kerbo said. Introduced water could concentrate on mudflats and
other surfaces in a way that interferes with natural processes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Buecher said he was worried that data now being collected by
hand were not being compared to baseline. ``If they were, someone
would have sounded the alarm,'' he said. ``The cave is definitely
drying out.''
</P>
<P>
   Travous said that he planned to hire a cave specialist and a
cave scientist to improve monitoring. Scientific advisers will be
invited back at some point, and the idea for cave suckers is being
re-assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under pressure from the Legislature to finish
construction and be fully open to the public,'' he said. ``But we
won't neglect good science in the process.''

 WASHINGTON: remains uncertain. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The various policy differences and political jockeying will be
on display from the start. On Thursday, the House leadership has
scheduled a vote on overriding Clinton's Aug. 31 veto of the bill
to phase out federal inheritance taxes. Next week, there will be a
vote in the House on overriding Clinton's veto last week of the
repeal of the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that ending of the federal estate tax would
be too costly and would mainly benefit wealthy people. The White
House said the federal government would lose revenues of $100
billion in the first 10 years and $750 billion more in the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because 65 Democrats voted in favor of abolishing the estate
tax, congressional Republicans initially expressed optimism that
the House would strike down Clinton's veto and hand the president
an embarrassing defeat. But it appears that some Democrats will
reverse themselves, that some who missed the first vote will side
with the president, and that the veto will be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try overrides on the tax bills; that will be
unsuccessful,'' predicted a top aide to a Republican House leader.
``Then we'll pivot and say to Democrats and Clinton, you can't
spend it either. Our alternative will be to pay down debt and
protect Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   But the aide added that House leaders had yet to reach an
agreement on such a course of action. ``The big dogs have to sign
off on it,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans must also devise a strategy to deal
with the White House on the 13 spending bills that must be enacted
by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 to keep the government
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed 12 of the 13 bills and the Senate has
approved eight. Two, a $288 billion measure for defense and a much
smaller bill for military construction, have been signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto eight of the spending bills,
setting the stage for fights over issues like providing money for
school construction, hiring more teachers to reduce class size and
setting aside more federal lands for wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are seeking to paint the administration as the
recalcitrant party, emphasizing that a mere $30 billion, out of a
budget with more than $600 billion in discretionary spending, is
what separates their bills from what the White House wants to
spend. They even note that they are providing the amounts the
president wants for his school construction and class reduction
programs, though, unlike the administration version, the Republican
bill gives local school districts an option of not spending the new
federal aid for those purposes. But White House officials say the
difference is less about amounts than about how the money is to be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say any problems reaching agreement with the
administration will benefit them and their presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to work this time,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate Republican campaign
committee. ``It's going to help Governor Bush because he will
demonstrate that he's the guy who can reach across party lines and
govern. It will illustrate the Clinton-Gore administration's
inability to govern on a bipartisan basis. Let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I., said that on social policy
the standoff in Congress will help his party. ``The fact of the
matter is the American people support the Democratic caucus issues
_ prescription drugs for seniors, a patients' bill of rights,
education for our future _ and those are the issues that our
Republicans are trying to bill themselves as champions of, but it's
just not working,'' said Kennedy, who is chairman of the House
Democratic campaign committee. ``The American people know it's the
Democrats that are truly on their side.

   DISPARAGING A REPORTER
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance in Naperville, Ill., on Monday, while waiting
to speak, Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, leaned over
to his running mate, Dick Cheney, and used an obscenity to describe
a New York Times correspondent, Adam Clymer, who was there. Bush,
his aides said, thought he was speaking privately. But his words
were picked up by a television microphone. Asked later about the
comment, Bush said, ``Well, I regret that a private comment I made
to the vice-presidential candidate made it to the public
airwaves.'' When asked if he wanted to apologize, Bush repeated
that he was sorry the comment was heard. Bush's director of
communications, Karen P. Hughes, said of Clymer: ``There's been a
series of articles that the governor has felt have been very
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the paper's executive editor, said: ``This is
at least Adam's eighth campaign. He knows what he is doing. His
work is both fair and accurate. The Times has never heard from the
Bush campaign about Adam. If they have a complaint, they should
convey it to us and we will review it as we do all serious
complaints about our coverage.''

   A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, Mark Fabiani, said that
Bush had ``portrayed himself as a person who wants to change the

   DEMOCRATS APPEAL TO WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Completing a grueling round-the-clock trip to three swing
states, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut made a series of Labor
Day appeals on Monday to working-class voters, including an
appearance at an AFL-CIO Labor Day festival in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lieberman made a visit to workers at Alessi's bakery in
Tampa, Fla., telling them of his father's experience working the
night shift at a bakery. On Sunday, Gore and Lieberman visited
workers at a construction site in Philadelphia, a hospital and a
General Motors plant in Flint, Mich.

   POLKA AND KIELBASA
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney danced the polka with a Polish beauty queen, spoke a
little Polish and dished out a few plates of kielbasa and stuffed
cabbage in Chicago on Monday. Cheney, whose campaign style has
sometimes been described as aloof in recent weeks, shed his
motorcade and rode the El to the Taste of Polonia festival. At the
festival, Cheney greeted the crowd in Polish. ``Sto lat,'' he said
_ may you live 100 years. Then he spoke about his role as the
secretary of defense under President Bush. ``We were proud to work
with all of you to help bring down the wall and free the peoples of
Eastern Europe,'' he said, to applause.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just after the rain delay, in between the
exiting day crowd and the incoming night-session fans, when
Hyung-Taik Lee's made-for-television adventure began to unfold in a
studio setting of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   As bright lights flooded Arthur Ashe Stadium Monday night and
cameras traced every move made by Lee, this miracle qualifier,
against the ominous Pete Sampras, only a few extras to this surreal
scene remained in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, an entire nation was watching Lee's fourth-round match
at the U.S. Open. Before sunrise in Seoul, South Korea, people were
assembling in front of their television sets to watch their
unlikely star on the country's first live broadcast of an Open. On
Sunday afternoon in Queens, diners in a Korean-owned sushi
restaurant stopped him for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Under this crush of attention, Lee never gave into stage fright.
He was feeling the good vibes from his good-luck buddies in the
friend's box flashing signs like ``Positive-Lee'' and
``Absolute-Lee'' and ``Unquestionab-Lee.'' And before the clouds
unleashed a downpour on Day 8 of the tournament, he was giving
Sampras fits with daring passing shots that whistled in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But on a freakish play in the first-set tie breaker, the
flashbulb-quick Lee raced toward the net to put away a desperate
half-volley by Sampras at 6-4. But as Lee crushed the ball for a
winner, he touched the net with his foot. Instead of a minibreak of
Sampras, the set was over. One two-hour rain delay later, and Lee's
improbable journey was finished as well. The unflustered Sampras
had decoded the unknown threat and advanced to the quarterfinals,
7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4. Still, Lee, ranked 187th, left with his head
held high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, when I would play a ranked player, I would be more
concerned with his ranking and I would be a little afraid,'' Lee
said through his interpreter. ``I might consider myself a coward.
But after this experience, I feel that I can play anyone on any
given day.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not seem nervous at all. During the second-set rain
delay, Lee was spotted in the players' lounge, laughing with his
coach and friends, and popping french fries for a snack. It was
this kind of nothing-to-lose demeanor that Sampras had to guard
against.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult playing someone you've never seen
play,'' Sampras said. ``He came out playing well. He wasn't
overwhelmed by the situation. He came out and held his own.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been handcuffed by the serve of Sampras, crestfallen
after his blown opportunity in the first-set tie breaker, but his
loss was not due to the distractions whirling around him. The
fourth-seeded Sampras was just too much.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was just one of the household names to advance Monday.
Depositing her ground strokes with characteristic precision,
top-seeded Martina Hingis completed her postponed match left over
from a soggy Sunday night in a simple 6-2, 6-1 victory against
11th-seeded Sandrine Testud.
</P>
<P>
   The Round of 16 did not unfold as well for other seeded players
in the women's draw. After missing six weeks of play following
Wimbledon with a sore shoulder, fourth-seeded Mary Pierce felt the
pain surface again the moment she delivered her first serve against
Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blasting away with her typical catapult force, Pierce
could barely put a firm punch on her serve. She could not go on
like that. Once she lost the first set, 6-4, Pierce, the French
Open champion, retired with tendinitis in her right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I am thinking right now,'' said Huber, who
is a friend of Pierce's. ``I am happy that I am in the
quarterfinals, but I feel sorry for her. I saw her in the locker
room. She didn't look very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's mood was in stark contrast to the smile stretching
across the face of Serena Williams like a banner after she escaped
the unflappable Jelena Dokic, 7-6 (7), 6-0. Last Wednesday, Dokic
was in tears while witnessing a tirade by her father, Damir Dokic,
who was banned for the rest of the tournament. Monday, Dokic was in
position to push aside the defending U.S. Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   But on her second set point in the tie breaker, Dokic was left
with her hands on her hips in dismay when she whipped a backhand
that appeared to clip the line for a winner only to see the
linesman call it out. Instead of set point, the score was 6-6 in
the tie breaker, and Williams closed it out from there. Dokic never
recovered from the questionable call, but exited under sympathetic
applause by a crowd that appreciated her ability to cope under
duress this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be able to deal with situations,'' said Dokic,
who seems older than 17. ``I did that at Wimbledon, did it here.
You've got to block things out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own way, Lee managed to do this, too. For a week, his
story had become the center of attention on the grounds of the
National Tennis Center. With his every victory, more nuggets of his
life were uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to play on such a great court,'' Lee said through
his interpreter. ``I'm an athlete, whereas a lot of my friends back
home, they're students. I think I would tell them that I learned a
lot about confidence here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARENCE CENTER, N.Y. _ Choosing two starkly different Labor Day
celebrations at different edges of the state _ a volunteer
firefighters' parade here in western New York and the West Indian
parade in Brooklyn _ Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped
off into their general election campaigns Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton bopped down Brooklyn's Eastern Parkway while Lazio
hammered her as an interloper trying to ride her name to power.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates for the Senate could not have found two more
disparate neighborhoods to mark what is traditionally viewed as the
first day of the general election campaign. Lazio headed for this
Republican dot of a town 20 miles outside Buffalo, stepping briskly
down narrow streets lined with trees and single-family homes to
waves of applause and shouts of support, as well as more than a few
catcalls directed at Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the state, Clinton marched through one of
the most solidly Democratic parts of New York, the Crown Heights
section of Brooklyn, surrounded by a chaotic, throbbing throng of
Secret Service agents, police officers, campaign aides and party
supporters. She crisscrossed the street reaching for hands amid the
cacophony of shouts of support and calypso music blaring from
floats.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, this was a day of pictures more than words. She
seemed intent on enjoying what has proved to be one of the most
intriguing spectacles in New York, the West Indian American
Carnival Parade, which has become a mandatory stop for any
Democratic candidate running in New York. ``It's great to be
here,'' she shouted above a pounding soca beat, gyrating her
shoulders and waist, though perhaps not as frenetically as the
music called for.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton apparently did not hear the next question, about her
thoughts on the Labor Day campaign kickoff, as she continued
shuffling along down the street before jumping into her van. She
did not hold a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lazio, traveling with a far lighter contingent of
reporters, and finding a smaller crowd at the two events he
attended _ the parade here and the State Fair in Syracuse on Sunday
morning _ held two news conferences in which he drew contrasts with
his opponent on issues like tax cuts and health care, but spoke
mostly about Clinton, asserting that she lacked the grounding to
fill the seat of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, Lazio said here, ``has no record, no commitment
to the state, and has no real rationale for representing us in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on the grounds of the State Fair in Syracuse, Lazio
said: ``People look at my opponent and they can't name one single
thing that Mrs. Clinton has ever done for the people of the state
of New York. And but for her name, I think a lot of New Yorkers
wonder whether she would even  &UR; be  &LR; a candidate in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The core issue, Lazio said, is ``about which person has been
talking a lot of baloney and which person has been getting the job
done.'' Lazio left no doubt that he put himself in the productive
category.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to Lazio's remarks through a spokeswoman,
Cathie Levine. ``Congressman Lazio has been engaging in negative
personal attacks because he can't improve his record and he has no
idea how to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's robust attack on his opponent, coming after a month in
which Clinton has attacked him almost daily with speeches and
television advertisements, emphasized the extent to which this
campaign has turned negative. That is surprising, several analysts
said, only because it happened so early and so intensely, so much
so that aides to both candidates are wondering what might be left
to say at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to both candidates said that with the election so tight
and with so many voters apparently set in their ways, the only way
to move an electorate already saturated with information was with
hard-charging attacks.

NOMO HANDS ANGELS FOURTH STRAIGHT LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Joe Haakenson  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With September comes the onset of fall, as well as the
Angels' traditional fall from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels lost their fifth game in a row, 5-0 to the Detroit
Tigers on Monday night at Comerica Park, getting shut down by
former Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo, who threw eight scoreless
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Former Angel Damion Easley led the Tigers offense with three
hits, three RBI and a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are 0-4 this month, well on their way to another
losing September unless they turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have had a winning record in September only twice
(1991, '99) since 1986, the last time they reached the playoffs.
Including this season, the Angels are 126-196 (.391) in September
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's loss, they fell 6 games behind Cleveland in the
wild-card race but remained six games behind Seattle in the A.L.
West. They are 68-69, the first time they've been below .500 since
May 18 (20-21).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach will not be one of a sense of urgency to the
point of panic,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``Our team was
as focused and intense in April as it is now. That's the approach
you're going to win with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're not doing the things we need to do, and we're
running out of games. But we're working extremely hard on the
things we need to do to get where we want to be. We're still in
this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were swept in the three-game weekend series in
Chicago, the Angels didn't have a problem scoring runs, totalling
26 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   But the offense sputtered Monday against Nomo (6-11), who gave
up five hits, walked two and struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had great control of his off-speed pitches,'' said Angels
center fielder Garret Anderson, who had two hits. ``That's his
game. He's pretty much a two-pitch pitcher. He pitched his game and
that's it. ... It doesn't matter how many times you've seen him,
he's a tough pitcher to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, had their chances.
</P>
<P>
   They had runners on first and second with one out in the first,
but Tim Salmon hit into a double play. Adam Kennedy had a leadoff
double in the third, but Bengie Molina and Darin Erstad struck out,
and Kevin Stocker grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   They had runners on first and second with nobody out in the
sixth, but Mo Vaughn hit into a double play and Salmon struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo retired the side in order in the second, fifth and eighth
innings. Only two Angels baserunners reached third in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomo again made some good pitches in key situations,'' said
Scioscia, who was a coach with the Dodgers when Nomo pitched for
them. ``That's been his trademark. He's shown in the past he'll get
out of jams.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time the Angels have been shut out this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Karl made his second start for the Angels and gave up five
runs (four earned) and nine hits in 5 innings. Not only did he not
get any offensive support, the defense let him down, too.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus' throwing error in the second inning led to an
unearned run. And a botched relay in the sixth inning allowed Brad
Ausmus to score from first on a double by Easley.
</P>
<P>
   Their recent poor play has come at a time when they can least
afford it. But the players continue to say it's no time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands what the situation is,'' Mo Vaughn said.
``We've gotten a couple of bad breaks, and that's why we are where
we are. I don't think anybody's holding anything back, everybody's
playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure everybody knows the urgency of what's going on. You
look around the locker room after a game and there are a lot of
ugly faces. We're frustrated with the last four games. But you
never point fingers, you never get mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have 25 games remaining, meaning the Mariners' magic
number to eliminate the Angels is 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, if we don't win, I don't check to see what anybody
else does,'' Anderson said. ``If we get on a good streak I might
take a peek. Anything can happen on any day. I've been on both
sides of it. You put unnecessary pressure on yourself if you feel
urgency. Just come out and play every day.''

ADVERTISING: MCDONALD'S BETS OLYMPIC-RELATED IMAGE SATURATION WILL
BOOST SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though its brand is quintessentially American, its business,
increasingly, is not. So McDonald's is turning these days to
international promotional opportunities _ like the Summer Olympic
Games, coming soon to a television set near you _ and to nearly
everybody else's on the planet, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that 65 percent of the world's population will be
watching the Olympics, at one time or another,'' said David Green,
senior vice president and marketing officer for McDonald's
International.
</P>
<P>
   To tap that enormous audience, McDonald's, which first began
sponsoring the Olympics on a national level in 1976, signed on in
1997 as a ``TOP Sponsor'' _ TOP stands for The Olympic Partnership
program. That gave the burger chain a global exclusive to
advertising Olympic tie-ins for its product category, as well as
the right to a physical presence at the games. The company ran its
first exclusive advertisements and served its first official
Olympic burgers in Nagano, Japan, at the 1998 Winter Games; this
month's events in Sydney are the first summer games where it will
have the same rights.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's operators in the United States and 97 of the 115
locations outside the country will participate in the campaign .
Certain symbols will be used by all McDonald's everywhere _ the
Olympic rings, for example _ and there will be some joint
activities, like the agreement by restaurants in 19 countries to
send workers to help their Australian counterparts flip burgers at
the Olympic Village. But each country has otherwise been encouraged
to develop a regionally appropriate marketing campaign on its own.
</P>
<P>
   That has resulted in several different approaches. In Germany
and Austria, for example, a promotion called ``5 weeks, 5
Continents, 5 burgers'' begins this week. It features one
differently flavored sandwich each week through the end of
September, with each supposedly representing a different area of
the world. (McAmerica, the first sandwich, has ``two beef patties
with cooked onions, two slices of cheese and barbecue sauce.'')
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, children's Happy Meals will include toy characters like
Ronald McDonald playing Olympic sports. Australians will be given
cards with meal purchases that will be good for free food if
Australia's team wins the event specified on the card. And local
Olympic athletes will be featured on bags and on cups in France,
where the company has had its share of public relations problems of
late (anti-globalization activists vandalized an unfinished
McDonald's there last year).
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Happy Meals will offer ``Olympic-themed
Barbie,'' said Green, and she will be ``trying out for different
events, including one paralympic event,'' where the doll will be in
a wheelchair. There will also be ``taste trials'' of newly flavored
products. This week, McDonald's begins running a new ``Olympic
Smiles'' commercial, which plays off its new theme, ``We love to
see you smile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about bringing the fun of the Olympics right down to
the customer,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about business, of course. McDonald's and other TOP
sponsors like Coca-Cola, IBM, Visa and Xerox, are estimated to have
paid $40 million apiece for their sponsorships of the 1998 Winter
Games and now the Summer Games in Sydney. And that does not include
the cost of the actual advertising to be done throughout the world,
on television, in print and otherwise, which surely will run to
many, many millions of dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most countries we are among the biggest national
advertisers,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? McDonald's apparently seems to think so.
Although IBM, for one, has dropped out of TOP, McDonald's has just
signed on for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics and the 2004 Athens
summer games, at a reported cost of about $55 million. This even
though it hasn't any single new product on which to focus its
worldwide advertising, which is often a justification for such
costly, flashy advertising buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feel-good campaign,'' said Bob Goldin, executive vice
president of Technomic, , a food industry and restaurant research
and consulting company based in Chicago. He puts the total,
worldwide McDonald's sponsorship and advertising expenditures at
``easily more than $100 million'' for the Sydney Olympics, a sum he
called ``expensive and high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of companies vying for share of mind, McDonald's is
banking on a lot of image to provide a sales boost,'' he said.
``And that can be tricky and hard to measure.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it work?
</P>
<P>
   Very possibly, according to Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to pull the heartstrings as well as anyone
else,'' he said.

ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One evening last summer, Dennis Lynch, a young entrepreneur, was
waiting to meet two potential investors at his company headquarters
in Edgewood, N.Y., where he sells used computer and office
equipment through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're small-time investors,'' he remembers telling
his associate, Michael Browne. ``John and David Sculley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Sculley?'' Browne replied. ``He's the former CEO of
Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who is 30, might be excused for not recognizing John
Sculley's name. The last time Sculley was in the news was in 1994 _
when, just four months after resigning as chief executive of Apple
Computer, he then quit after just four months as chief executive of
Spectrum Information Technologies, a Long Island
wireless-technology company where accounting irregularities had
occurred before Sculley arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Sculley, now 61, has maintained uncharacteristically
low visibility. A Wharton-trained executive, who at 38 was running
PepsiCo's domestic soft-drinks unit, and in 1983 jumped to Apple,
he has for the last five years run a small venture capital firm
with his two brothers, Arthur and David. It is his way of
fulfilling a desire to work with his family _ and to help
proselytize people about the virtues of the Internet without
suffering the corporate intrigue that overwhelmed him at both Apple
and Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Now John Sculley focuses on start-ups like Techsmart, the
company founded by Lynch, and serves as mentor and friend as well
as investor. Minutes after starting their meeting, Sculley and his
younger brother were drinking beer with the entrepreneurs and
trading tales about growing up on Long Island. By the end of the
evening, the Sculleys had tentatively committed themselves to
invest $1 million and promised to offer guidance on how to build a
small company into a much bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley may still be licking his wounds, but he said he is far
happier in his new career. And so are his brothers, who are also
veterans of corporate America. Arthur Sculley, 55, ran J.P. Morgan
&AMP; Co.'s $80 billion private bank until 1995, and David Sculley, 54,
was president of the H.J. Heinz Co.'s domestic operations until
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the absolute most wonderful time of our lives,'' said
John Sculley, sitting in his Park Avenue office. ``We're in total
control of our ground rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fun while teaching young entrepreneurs, he said, now
takes priority over earning maximum returns. By using their own
assets, they do not subject themselves to the pressure of
performing for investors. Nonetheless, he said, they expect high
returns over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sculley Brothers LLC has invested in 26 start-ups. Four
are either profitable or breaking even, John said. But their track
record so far, at least as it can be judged from the outside,
leaves something to be desired. Three of the five companies they
backed that have gone public _ like many other Web-based businesses
since the Nasdaq shakeout in April _ now trade at rock-bottom
prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Buy.com, an Internet retailer, closed on Friday at
$2.81, down more than 90 percent from last February's initial
public offering at $30. Another, Talk City, a builder of online
communities, has also plunged, closing on Friday at $1.56 compared
with $12 when shares were first sold to the public in July 1999.
John Sculley said both are doing well but suffering in the market
along with other Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another is NetObjects, which helps businesses build Web sites
and, like other software companies, has been shifting from selling
products to providing online services. Its shares, offered at $12
in April 1999, closed on Friday at $2.97, down by more than 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, John Sculley said: Before the share prices of
NetObjects and Talk City plunged, Sculley Brothers sold some
holdings at a profit. And since they invested early, they acquired
equity in all three companies well below the price set at the
initial public offering. So the brothers said they remain in the
black.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the collegiality, one reason John Sculley said he enjoys
working with his brothers is that they protect him from a tendency
to take people at their word, which he said had hurt him in the
corporate boardrooms. They also keep him, he said, from being so
dazzled by technology that he does not watch the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   At Apple, for example, his record of memorable marketing and
increased sales was partly undone by his focus on Newton, a
hand-held computer that was a forerunner of the Palm Pilot but
which never sold well because its technology was flawed. Critics
said that by spending so much time on Newton _ and on trying to
become an industry luminary _ Sculley did not prepare for a price
war that cut revenue of Apple's core product, the Macintosh
computer. The board fired him in 1993. ``I was ambushed at Apple
and pushed out,'' Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   David Hancock, Apple's former marketing chief, remarked of
Sculley: ``He can be distracted by neat new stuff and can jump at
it. He can get fooled by people. He needs people who can refocus
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those people are his brothers, Sculley said. ``I have been too
trusting in the past, so it's great to have my brothers there to
help me on this.'' Where John and David, the enthusiastic marketing
guys, can be swept away by an idea, for example, Arthur, the
no-nonsense banker, often plays devil's advocate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   They first dreamed about working together in the late 1980s
while walking on a beach in Bermuda, where they were attending the
annual meeting of a perfume factory founded by a grandfather. The
idea of banding together in venture capital took shape after John
Sculley left Spectrum and began searching for a new career. While
visiting companies and attending technology conferences, he decided
that the Internet was creating a revolution and that he wanted to
be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of John's marketing experience, he understood the
power of the Internet as a business tool and a marketing tool,''
said Joshua Ruch, managing partner of Rho Ventures, a New York
venture capital firm that has invested in some of the same
companies as the Sculleys.
</P>
<P>
   John Sculley also appreciated that this revolution, in its early
days, involved small, private companies out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really aren't looking for any publicity,'' he said, after
having first declined to be interviewed. ``We aren't trying to
prove anything to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He began investing in start-ups and in 1995 became nonexecutive
chairman of LivePictures, an Internet imaging company. Several
months after he gave up the chairmanship in 1998, the company went
bankrupt, though it was then sold to the Toronto-based MGI
Software, allowing investors to break even. (He attributes the
company's failure to ``weak management'' too distant for him to
watch closely.)
</P>
<P>
   But other projects were thriving, including Cambridge Display
Technology, a developer of flat-screen video displays; Veon, which
provides interactive video services; and Sirius Thinking, creator
of the PBS children's program ``Between the Lions.'' Cambridge
Display was sold last year to two private venture capital firms,
delivering a ``very high return'' to the Sculleys and other early
investors, John Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Arthur joined John to form Sculley Brothers. Arthur
Sculley, also a Wharton graduate, had spent 25 years at J.P.
Morgan, where he said he contracted ``the entrepreneur's bug''
while setting up offices in Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   John and Arthur pursued projects based on their individual
interests. Arthur co-founded IntraLinks, which distributes
prospectuses for syndicated loans over the Web, and served as
chairman of the Bermuda Stock Exchange as it adopted electronic
trading. That led him to specialize in business-to-business
exchanges, and Sculley Brothers has invested in four _ including
Catex, which trades catastrophe-reinsurance contracts, and
BigMachines.com, where companies can buy and sell industrial
equipment. Another investment, CreditTrade, which serves as an
exchange for credit derivatives, just turned profitable, John said.
</P>
<P>
   David Sculley, 54, joined the family firm in 1996. After 22
years at Heinz in Pittsburgh, four as head of Heinz USA, he said he
became drawn to ``building companies rather than managing
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony O'Reilly, the Heinz chairman, said he was sorry to see
David Sculley leave, adding: ``He's a great motivator of people.
There's a pulse about him, whether he's talking about ketchup or
the Internet.'' And David Sculley is attentive to profitability,
O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   In creating their business, the Sculley brothers made it a
priority to keep things simple. They dress casually and have no
other partners, working with a few assistants in a spacious office.
</P>
<P>
   Their approach to selecting investments is also straightforward:
They meet only with people they know well or have been referred to
by someone they trust. ``We don't solicit,'' Arthur Sculley said.
``We don't want any business plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Several investments have resulted from John Sculley's Apple
connections. One is Presenter.com, an online conference center
founded in 1998 by Eric Chen, a former Apple engineer. Chen, in
turn, referred the Sculleys to the man who founded Gizmoz, a
company that builds Internet broadcast networks. Sculley Brothers
invested in Cambridge Display Technology on the advice of Herman
Hauser, an engineer who worked on the Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The Sculleys declined to say how much money they have to invest,
only that they put an average of $1 million into each venture. But
they offer services beyond that _ serving as mentors for some
entrepreneurs, attracting new investment for others, and often
ending up on the boards of the companies in which they have
invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for board members with thoughtful ideas and
connections, and they have both,'' said Tom Hirschfeld, a general
partner at Patricoff &AMP;  &UR; Co. &LR;  Ventures of New York, who is a
director of IntraLinks and TalkCity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all run big divisions,'' Arthur Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're hands-on.'' John said, ``We've learned lessons from
both our successes and our mistakes that any CEO would have to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Gizmoz, for example: Captivated by the potential of the
technology, John Sculley became nonexecutive chairman and persuaded
the founder, Eyal Gever, 30, to move to New York from Israel.
Today, John speaks with Gever nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring John with me to open doors, but mostly to negotiate,''
Gever said. ``He's guided me on multiple levels.'' John's pitch
helped to persuade America Online to invest in Gizmoz earlier this
year. Sculley also accompanies Gever on television programs, as he
does with other entrepreneurs, using his own celebrity to draw
media attention.
</P>
<P>
   All three brothers have become involved in BigMachines.com, an
industrial-equipment exchange based in Foster City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   David Sculley helped the founders _ Goerdt Abel, a neighbor of
his in Pittsburgh, and his son, Godard _ develop a business plan.
Arthur guided them on how the exchange would work. John establishes
connections with potential partners and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The three have also contributed to PeoplePC, an Internet
membership buyers' club that went public on Aug. 15 at $10 a share.
Even though it has since fallen to $6.50, the Sculleys' 4 percent
stake, which they acquired for $2.1 million, is now worth about $28
million.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Sculley has made introductions that led to group
memberships. David brought in consultants.
</P>
<P>
   And John advised on marketing and operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of complex operational issues that he just
nailed Day 1,'' said Michael J. Price, a former investment banker
at Lazard Freres, who serves on the PeoplePC board. ``He's got some
of the soundest operating judgment I've ever seen.''

METS STILL SEEK SEPTEMBER VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ If the Mets' punchless hitters need an example,
they might want to look to Timoniel Perez. Perez, a 23-year-old
outfielder, is in his first week in the major leagues and may not
know what it means to press.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the new guys are free and easy,'' Tom Robson, the
Mets' hitting coach, said Monday after watching his team flail away
futilely again in a 6-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. ``They don't
know about this. Perez is awesome. He's up there swinging. That's
what we've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez had two doubles and drove in a run at Cinergy Field and is
three for 10 since his call-up. The rest of the Mets managed only
four hits Monday as the journeyman Elmer Dessens mastered them. It
was the Mets' fourth straight defeat, and they are batting .196 in
their last nine games _ six of them losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets hold a four-game lead in the National League wild-card
race, but they trail the Atlanta Braves by one game in the NL East.
The Mets' position is still relatively comfortable, but if their
slump continues, they will quickly be confronted with the notion
that they have entered another September swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine sees no evil and says no evil. A
scuffling offense? Sure, Valentine said, if that's what you call it
when good pitchers make good pitches against you. Valentine chose
to heap praise on Dessens, who has pitched two good games against
the Mets. He allowed four hits and one run in six and two-third
innings Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he makes a relatively perfect pitch every time
he pitches against us,'' Valentine said. ``He'd be a Cy Young
winner if he pitched like that every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Robson saw something different. Taking nothing away from Dessens
_ or Rick Ankiel, Darryl Kile, Wade Miller and the others who have
subdued the Mets lately _ this slump is the Mets' doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's us, it's not the pitcher,'' Robson said. ``We're just not
centering the pitches the way we should, we're fouling them off
when we should've hit them and then chasing bad pitches when we get
two strikes. That's what we're doing, and all that leads to not
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' starters have a 4.18 earned run average, the best in
the majors. When the Mets went 25-9 from late July to late August,
they did so largely by winning close, low-scoring games and
rewarding their starting pitchers with victories.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the pattern has changed, and the Mets are losing
games like that. Al Leiter had a bad feeling when he gave up a
two-run, first-inning home run to Ken Griffey Jr. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being down 2-zip in the first inning makes their pitcher a
little more comfortable,'' he said, ``and if your lineup is already
pressing, they're going to press a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Griffey struck, swatting an outside slider over the
left-field fence for his 37th home run, the Mets had already missed
one big chance. Perez led off the game with a double, but Dessens
retired the next three Mets and Perez never left second.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds went ahead by 3-0 in the third when Dmitri Young drove
a slider into right field with two outs, bringing in Pokey Reese,
who had singled, stolen second and gone to third on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got their fourth run in the sixth inning, when the
rookie Chris Sexton doubled, again off a first-pitch slider with
two outs, again scoring a runner who had stolen second. ``That was
dumb,'' Leiter said, noting that Dessens was on deck. ``I don't
know what I was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had scored in the fifth when a sacrifice fly by Perez
brought home Darryl Hamilton, who had doubled. After that, their
offense continued to slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza drew walks to lead off the
sixth. But Robin Ventura and Todd Zeile flied out and Jay Payton
bounced to Dessens. In all, the Mets were 0 for 14 with runners on
base.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura went 0 for 4, his average dropping below .230 for the
first time since April 24. Zeile is also slumping, his average
under .280 for the first time since May 12.
</P>
<P>
   With little production from their fifth and sixth hitters, the
Mets leave Piazza scant protection. If Ventura and Zeile continue
to slump, that weakness will be exposed in games against the Braves
at the end of this month and, possibly, in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The later you get into the season against certain teams, when
teams get closer to you, they're not going to get beat by Mike,''
said Ventura, who says he feels fine and does not know why he is
struggling. ``They're going to get beat _ if they get beat _ by the
guys behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   To Piazza, who hit his 34th homer in the eighth, the memory of
last September's swoon is ``ancient history.'' But there is no
mistaking it, he said: the Mets' hitters are trying too hard,
pressing. They need to get back to the basics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this club is resilient,'' Piazza said. ``We've worked
hard to get to this point. We have to dig down deep and find a way
to get it done.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In wheelchairs, on crutches and standing
shoelace-deep in the mud, several thousand Latino evangelicals
waited nearly all afternoon on Monday in a South Bronx park for a
former bodybuilder turned faith healer who is widely known as the
Spanish-speaking Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rev. Yiye Avila, a wiry 74-year-old Puerto Rican with
steel gray hair, finally showed up on stage in St. Mary's Park, he
was more than two hours late. But the wait was far from over. He
had hardly begun to speak when the sky darkened and a late summer
shower exploded into a drenching downpour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to pray so that God will bring out the sun, the
moon and the stars,'' said Avila, who retreated from the rain to
pray beneath a canopy as his followers, soaked and muddy, waited
patiently for yet another hour. No one complained or even seemed
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Avila, a fiery preacher who paces the stage feverishly, speaking
of God, the devil and miracles of faith, is a crowd-pleasing force
behind one of the major religious shifts among American Hispanics
in the last quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   His satellite-powered ministry, heard on television and radio
across much of the United States and Latin America, has played a
significant role in converting hundreds of thousands of Roman
Catholic Latinos to evangelical Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equivalent of one out of seven Hispanics has left
Catholicism in a little more than a quarter of a century,'' the
Rev. Andrew M. Greeley wrote two years ago in America, the Catholic
weekly. He estimated that about 600,000 Hispanics are lost to the
church every year, adding that ``if this hemorrhage should continue
for the next 25 years, half of all American Hispanics will not be
Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeley described the loss as ``the worst defection in the
history of the Catholic Church in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A report last year by the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops acknowledged that the migration of Catholic Hispanics to
other denominations was a substantial threat to the future of the
church in the United States. The report said that evangelical
preachers were succeeding by skillfully linking Scripture to
everyday experience and by instructing believers on a strict code
of behavior that gives sense to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When the rain finally stopped on Monday and Avila resumed
speaking, he told the audience of his conversion to evangelical
Christianity when he was a young man in Puerto Rico, where he had
been a minor-league baseball player and a professional bodybuilder.
He won the North America title in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Rheumatoid arthritis was threatening to cripple him until the
night he caught the evangelist Oral Roberts preaching on
television. He then dedicated his life to God and, he said, his
arthritis disappeared. Avila told the crowd in the Bronx on Monday
that sometimes it is good to watch television.
</P>
<P>
   Among the soggy celebrants, there was no shortage of former
Catholics eager to explain the appeal of preachers like Avila.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that when I went to Catholic church it was like they
were reading a book,'' said Sonia Castro, 40, a bank teller in
Brooklyn who travels three hours each way by subway, train and bus
to attend the Christian Charismatic Church in Elizabeth, N.J. ``But
at my church, it is like I feel the Holy Spirit wrapping his arms
around me.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the miracles, or at least the promise of
miracles, that brought dozens of believers in wheelchairs to listen
to Avila, who for nearly four decades has been preaching in major
Latino urban centers across the United States. In the park, those
hoping for miracles sat close to the stage, on Avila's left.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Santiago, 40, a home-care provider who lives in the
Bronx, took Janice Santos, who is 6 and has cerebral palsy, to the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see if he does work miracles,'' said Santiago, who
grew up Catholic. ``Maybe he can work a miracle for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others in the crowd spoke of the clarity that evangelical
beliefs bring to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholics, they drink and they dance,'' said Pablo
Padillo, 68, a retired truck driver from the Bronx who was raised a
Catholic but now describes himself as a Pentecostal. ``When you
accept Jesus, you don't do any of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Avila's appeal, especially for recent immigrants,
is that he makes sense of what for many is a hard and confusing
life in the United States, according to the Rev. Isaac J. Canales,
a pastor and theologian in Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``His is a very simple, hopeful and conservative message,'' said
Canales, who has spent a number of years analyzing Avila's
ministry. ``He preaches the value of hard work, success and
prosperity in a message that is Christ-centered and
miracle-oriented.''

NEW YORK'S WEST INDIAN DAY PARADE ROLLS ON ALCOHOL-FREE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As they have for years on Labor Day, tens of
thousands of New Yorkers, and the politicians who court them,
descended on Brooklyn on Monday for the West Indian American
Carnival Parade.
</P>
<P>
   As in other years, people ate Caribbean food and danced along
the sidewalks to music blaring from all corners. They wore bright
costumes native to Caribbean islands and rode on floats festooned
with bamboo, crepe paper and silver paint.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the first time, they did not drink alcohol at the
parade _ at least not legally _ because of a ban imposed by the
city last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants appreciated the alcohol-free parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be out here without having people throwing beer cans at you
is kind of nice as far as I'm concerned,'' said Errol Hassell, a
mechanic from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   While the parade was generally free of trouble, five people were
arrested, including a women charged with biting a Secret Service
agent protecting Hillary Rodham Clinton, and two men charged with
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   When the city announced the alcohol ban and other new rules for
large parades last month, officials said they were in part a
response to accidents that killed three people at last year's
parade. Two 11-year-old dancers were killed, and another child
hurt, when they were struck by a van, and an 18-year-old man was
killed by a sound truck. Parade organizers protested that alcohol
use was not implicated in any of the accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opposition to his administration's decision, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani marched on Monday, and was was greeted with a
cascade of catcalls and boos as he made his way down Eastern
Parkway. ``What are you doing here? We don't need you here,''
yelled Hugh Gardner, a 37-year-old Flatbush resident, as the mayor
walked by his spot along the parkway. ``You're a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   By parade's end, the authorities said, 21 bottle of alcoholic
beverages and 20 cases of beer had been confiscated, and 35
open-container summonses issued.
</P>
<P>
   The woman accused of biting a Secret Service agent in the arm
was identified by the police as Yolande Bobb, 55, of Brooklyn, who
was charged with second-degree assault. The incident occurred as
Bobb was approaching Clinton and the agent interceded, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Claudis Jacob, 40, of Brooklyn, was charged with abusing a
13-year-old girl and held on sexual abuse charges. Cecil Wayland of
Brooklyn, 40, was also charged with sexual abuse, accused of
abusing a 24-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn's West Indian parade draws an estimated two million
people, about twice that drawn by the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade in Manhattan.

EDITORIAL: TECHNOLOGY'S GENDER GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The barriers that keep minorities from enjoying full access to
the technological revolution have been widely commented on. Less
talked about is another ``digital divide:'' The fact that fewer
women are entering today's booming technology fields.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that women are active users of the new technology
and that female Internet users slightly outnumber male users. But
the paucity of women creating that technology is cause for concern.
The most recent National Science Foundation statistics show that
between 1984 and 1997, the proportion of women receiving bachelor's
degrees in computer science dropped from 37 percent to 27 percent.
Currently, women make up only 20 percent of the information
technology work force.
</P>
<P>
   Because the industry serves the broader needs of society, the
technology workplace ought to reflect the interests of both men and
women. The technology industry badly needs more workers. Women
represent a major untapped source of talent that could solve the
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Why are there few women in these fields? One reason is that
girls receive little encouragement to explore computers early in
their schooling. Most computer games are male-oriented, and there
are few female role models in technical industries. Women who
perform well in high school math and science are often put off by
male-dominated lecture halls in college. Women who do end up
joining the technology work force have complained about a lack of
opportunity for advancement and an absence of support and
mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in grade school curriculums could help redress the
imbalance by, for example, using computer programs as tools and
teaching aids in all disciplines, from history to music to biology.
Mentoring programs at all levels of education, from middle school
to college, can also provide women with needed support. The
National Science Foundation is dedicating $2 million in grant money
to find ways of increasing women's participation in technological
fields. Without this and other steps, women will continue to be
discouraged from entering the world of high technology.

EDITORIAL: JOURNALISTS UNDER SIEGE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The editors of two opposition newspapers in Congo are facing the
death penalty. Emile-Aime Kakekese Vinalu's crime was writing two
articles that analyzed a tiff between high-level officials,
complained of disunity in the opposition and said that those who
speak their minds get arrested for crimes against state security.
The government of Laurent Kabila then proved him right. Then
Jean-Pierre Ekanga Mukuna was arrested, apparently for refusing to
give authorities Vinalu's home address. Both men are charged with
high treason.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered editors in Congo have plenty of company. A
Serbian journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, is now serving a seven-year
sentence for espionage and disseminating false information after he
reported on the Yugoslav army's war crimes in Kosovo. As
parliamentary elections approach in Azerbaijan, authorities have
arrested the editor of an opposition newspaper on trumped-up
charges that he participated in a hijacking attempt. In Paraguay a
reporter was run over by a car driven by the security chief of the
nation's former comptroller, who is accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The world is seeing an epidemic of government attempts to
silence independent journalists, less through murders than through
legal harassment and physical threats. Paradoxically, the new
repression is in some ways a sign of progress. Azerbaijan was not
persecuting independent journalists 10 years ago, because it had
none. Most nations now attacking journalists are quasi-democracies
and so must put up with at least some independent media. But their
leaders use libel suits and threats to stop reporters from
investigating corruption, and often jail journalists and shut media
down for tax offenses or other pretexts during political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, respect for a free press comes with democratic
development and economic growth, in part because only a robust
private sector can provide enough advertising to give the media
independence. But a free press is also an integral part of both
kinds of progress and needs more help from the outside today.
Several international groups provide lawyers for accused
journalists, and independent media in places like Yugoslavia get a
big percentage of their budgets from Western governments and
nongovernmental groups. But these donors tend to concentrate on
high-profile nations.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy is to try to discourage attacks by exposing
them. Turkey, whose bid to join the European Union depends on its
civil rights record, has responded to visits from the Committee to
Protect Journalists by releasing some jailed writers and reporters.
But exposure only works when governments take press freedom
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia recently arrested a British TV crew investigating
reports of diamond smuggling by President Charles Taylor. When
African leaders, including Nelson Mandela, complained, Taylor
released the four men.

USC TURNS DOWN CHANCE TO GET EX-VOLS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Scott Wolf  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were few high school players USC thought
more of last season than running back Marcus Houston, who spurned
the Trojans to attend this week's opponent, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Houston's presence as a stark reminder of the runner
they almost had, USC recently turned down a second chance at
getting one of the most highly touted prep tailbacks from two years
ago. Onterrio Smith, who was dismissed from Tennessee by coach Phil
Fulmer after one season, contacted USC and asked for a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans hotly recruited the Sacramento native two years ago,
when he decided to attend Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted him to spend a year at a junior college to get his
academics and personal life back in order,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``He clearly wasn't interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has since enrolled at Oregon, where he will sit out this
season before he becomes eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made headlines off the field last January because he was
charged with misdemeanor battery after being accused of striking
the mother of his 3-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Helping hands: USC wide receiver Steve Stevenson, defensive
tackle Bernard Riley, defensive tackle Malcolm Wooldridge and
safety Kyle Matthews of Westlake High came to the aid of an injured
USC student last week.
</P>
<P>
   A female student fell out of her second-story apartment window
and became stuck on top of security bars covering a first-floor
window.
</P>
<P>
   The four players held the student up to relieve pressure until
the fire department could arrive and cut the bars from the window.
The tips of the bars were removed from the student's legs when she
got to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was try to get her to calm down and relax,''
Stevenson said. ``We were holding her for about 10 minutes. At
first, we heard a big scream and we thought someone was messing
around. Then we saw her hanging down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she came back (Sunday) and is all right,'' Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado connections: USC quarterback Carson Palmer welcomes
this week's game for a special reason: He will be playing against
one of his closest friends, former Santa Margarita High teammate
John Minardi, who is a wide receiver for the Buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked trash back and forth about who's going to win,''
Palmer said. ``I told him he's lucky he doesn't play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Minardi briefly played safety for Colorado before returning to
wide receiver. The pair discussed attending Colorado together
before Palmer chose USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it, but it's tough because we had different
interests,'' Palmer said. ``But we talk all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Grootegoed ailing: Hackett said he is concerned over the health
of freshman strong safety Matt Grootegoed, who has missed the past
two practices and is questionable for this week's game after
showing flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's rundown,'' Hackett said. ``He's not feeling
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Jamaal Williams, who broke his leg in August, had
the cast removed and could begin practicing within two weeks. He
will still redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Trevor Roberts (sprained foot) will start
running Wednesday, but is expected to miss the game.
