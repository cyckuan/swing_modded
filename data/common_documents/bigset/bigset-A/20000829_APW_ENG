<HEADLINE> Cardinals 5, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Will Clark's RBI triple sparked a four-run eighth
inning and the St. Louis Cardinals rallied past the Florida Marlins
5-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike James (1-2) pitched a scoreless seventh for his first major
league victory since 1997 with Anaheim. He combined with Rick
Ankiel, Jason Christiansen and Dave Veres on a five-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Veres pitched the ninth for his 23rd save in 28 chances for the
NL Central leaders, who improved to 4-1 on their seven-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's A.J. Burnett hit his first big league homer and
notched a career-high 10 strikeouts. He departed with a 2-1 lead
after giving up a leadoff double in the eighth to J.D. Drew, and
the Cardinals then broke through against Armando Almanza (4-2).
</P>
<P>
   Clark tripled Drew home to tie the game, and Craig Paquette's
RBI single put St. Louis ahead. Edgar Renteria doubled in another
run, and Mike Matheny followed with an RBI single against Braden
Looper.
</P>
<P>
   Matheny also drove in a run in the fifth with his first triple
in 212 NL games. Clark went 3-for-5 and is batting .386 since being
traded to the Cardinals on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett's homer came on a 3-2 pitch leading off the third inning
and traveled an estimated 385 feet. He allowed seven hits and two
runs in a duel with another hard-throwing youngster, Ankiel.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' rookie gave up only three hits and two runs in
six innings while striking out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Florida scored in the second when Preston Wilson led off with a
single and came home on Derrek Lee's double.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals stranded four runners in scoring position against
Burnett. They had runners at second and third with nobody out in
the seventh, but Matheny grounded into a forceout, pinch-hitter
Shawon Dunston struck out and Placido Polanco flied out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burnett's homer was the second by a Florida pitcher this
year and the 15th in franchise history. Vladimir Nunez homered
against San Diego on May 2. ... Matheny became the Cardinals'
1,000th strikeout victim in the third. They lead the major leagues.
... Marlins outfielder Mark Kotsay began the week in a 2-for-19
slump. ... The Cardinals' Ray Lankford began the week batting .278
against right-handers and .149 against lefties. ... The Marlins are
9-4 when tied going into the ninth inning.

<HEADLINE> Diabetics Urged: Drop Blood Pressure  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The National Kidney Foundation is urging more
aggressive treatment of diabetics with high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Blood pressure in such patients should be no higher than 130
over 80, the foundation said. The current standard is under 130
over 85.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the more than 11 million Americans with both diabetes
and high blood presssure will need to take at least two drugs to
reach the lower target rate, according to the foundation. The
foundation also recommended that treatment start with an ACE
inhibitor, a common type of medication.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, published in September's American Journal of
Kidney Diseases, are based on recent research suggesting that
diabetics who have high blood pressure with a diastolic reading --
the bottom number -- of around 80 have fewer cardiovascular
complications and less kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics are more vulnerable to heart attacks and
life-threatening kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure in a diabetic ''is like adding gasoline to
the fire,'' said Dr. George Bakris, who led a National Kidney
Foundation committee that created the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's report was funded in part by Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corp., a maker of blood pressure medications,
including ACE inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recommendation, the American Diabetes Association
stands by the higher threshold and believes it is not only safe but
more achievable, said Dr. Richard Kahn, ADA chief scientific and
medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines do not apply to the general population, for
whom the recommended blood pressure remains less than 140 over 90.

<HEADLINE> College Football Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   College football's preseason is over, and thank goodness nobody
got hurt. At least not too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest casualty after five weekend ''classic'' games
appears to be Lee Corso's rental car, which was struck by lightning
Sunday night during violent thunderstorms that forced postponement
of the BCA Classic -- Georgia Tech at No. 11 Virginia Tech .
</P>
<P>
   ESPN aired video of a red car being hit by a bolt of lightning
in the parking lot at the north end of Lane Stadium. Corso, ESPN
GameDay's analyst, was not certain the car was his until he left
the stadium and tried to drive back to his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started up, and he drove it a little bit before it just
died and he realized it was his car that got hit,'' Chris Fowler,
GameDay's host, said Monday. ''Lee got out, hitched a ride with
some fans, and the car-rental people brought him a new car.''
</P>
<P>
   The lightning strike came right after the GameDay crew went off
the air, with Corso having just predicted a Georgia Tech upset of
the Hokies and quarterback Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   In the games that did get played, there were a few mishaps:
</P>
<P>
   -- David Allen, Kansas State's return specialist, injured his
left ankle on a punt return in the Wildcats' 27-7 win over Iowa in
the Eddie Robinson Classic. K-State coach Bill Snyder said Monday
that his halfback will miss Saturday's game against Louisiana Tech,
and probably the next game, against Ball State on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to be out for an undetermined period of time,''
Snyder said. ''We don't know exactly how long that is going to be
but it is going to be more than a ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Bret Engemann, BYU's starting quarterback in the Cougars' 29-3
loss to No. 2 Florida State in Saturday's Pigskin Classic, sprained
a left knee ligament and is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   -- LaVell Edwards, in his 29th and final season at BYU, was fine
after being floored by Seminoles quarterback Chris Weinke, who was
pushed out of bounds and into the 69-year-old coach. Weinke was
throwing a 19-yard TD pass at the time.
</P>
<P>
   -- Florida State kicker Matt Munyon had his confidence shaken
after missing his first extra point and field goal attempts of 34
and 27 yards. Coach Bobby Bowden hopes freshman Brett Cimorelli can
do better once he shakes off a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   -- Penn State absorbed its worst season-opening loss in 17 years
after revitalized USC beat Joe Paterno's team 29-5 in Sunday's
Kickoff Classic. The loss knocked Penn State out of the Top 25 for
the first time since the final poll of the '92 season.
</P>
<P>
   -- Big East Conference teams have now played host to the last two
games postponed by weather -- UCLA at Miami in 1998 and Georgia
Tech-Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA-Miami was wiped out by the threat of Hurricane George on
Sept. 26, 1998. The game was played on Dec. 5, with the Hurricanes
winning and knocking UCLA out of the national title picture.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Virginia Tech, ESPN and the Black Coaches Association
proposed a Dec. 1 makeup date, but Georgia Tech hasn't decided on a
course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Comebacks, debuts and encores were also on the weekend agenda:
</P>
<P>
   -- Texas Tech's Ricky Williams had 15 carries for 78 yards and
caught the first TD pass of his career in a 24-3 win over New
Mexico in Saturday's Hispanic College Fund Football Classic --
making coach Mike Leach's debut a successful one. Williams, the
nation's fourth-leading rusher in '98, missed last season with a
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   -- USC quarterback Carson Palmer wasn't super -- 10 of 20 for 87
yards -- but he did nothing wrong in his first game since missing
most of last season with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ''He handled the football team the way I wanted him to,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ''That was more important than how much
passing he did.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Engemann, the brother-in-law of CNN's Larry King, did not fare
well in his debut before he was hurt, hitting 12 of 28 passes for
139 yards and two interceptions. He was sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   -- Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey played his first game
since being charged with assaulting an off-duty police officer in
May. The senior was 7 of 24 for 106 yards and was replaced by Matt
Senneca in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a tough outing for him for a lot of reasons,''
Paterno said. ''He had a tough preseason. Now that he has this out
of his craw, he can come home and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the game that wasn't played, Hokie fans will have to wait
until Saturday for Vick to begin his run at the Heisman Trophy
after a sensational freshman season in which he led his team into
the national title game. And Yellow Jacket fans will have to wait a
week for the debut of quarterback George Godsey, who steps in for
'99 Heisman runner-up Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech is home to Akron and Georgia Tech is home to
Central Florida.

<HEADLINE> Garcia Beats Woods at Bighorn  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT, Ca. (AP) -- Sergio Garcia finally found the secret
to beating Tiger Woods -- play him at night.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia outplayed Woods under the lights Monday night, upsetting
the world's best player 1-up as golf returned to prime time in the
''Battle at Bighorn.''
</P>
<P>
   The win in the made-for-television event won't show up on any
official lists, but it was worth $1.1 million and a ton of pride
for Garcia, who has struggled this year while Woods dominated the
sport, winning three majors.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia made a 35-footer for birdie on the 16th hole to go ahead
for good, and the tiring Woods could not answer on the final two
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods put it within 4 feet on the final hole for a possible
birdie to tie, but Garcia sunk his 10-footer for a birdie of his
own before Woods even had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least I gave Sergio a run for his money,'' Woods said. ''He
had to make some putts to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods flew across country earlier in the day and was fighting a
cold or the flu after a streak of eight days that saw him win the
PGA Championship and the NEC Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so cold. I'm freezing,'' Woods said to caddie Steve
Williams as he waited to putt on the 17th hole on a warm night in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Woods finished off the field in near darkness to win
the NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio, he and Garcia needed portable
lights mounted on cranes to finish the final five holes at the
Bighorn Gold Club.
</P>
<P>
   And the darker it got, the better Garcia played.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia made eight birdies, five on the back nine, against a pair
of bogeys for what would have been a 66. Woods didn't make a bogey,
but managed only five birdies, including the conceded putt on the
final hole, for a 67.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little nervous on the first hole,'' Garcia said.
''After that, I started calming down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia grew increasingly animated as he played nearly flawless
down the stretch, while Woods appeared tired and trying to keep his
focus in a surreal setting in the desert foothills.
</P>
<P>
   The evening started well for Woods, who got out in front quickly
as spectators began scrambling for position on an overcast but hot
and humid late afternoon in the Santa Rosa foothills. Garcia missed
the first green and made bogey after chipping past the pin, while
Woods made a routine par.
</P>
<P>
   But, with Woods making only one birdie on the front side, Garcia
got back to even after a birdie on the eighth hole. They remained
that way after a front nine in which neither played particularly
well, both shooting 1-under 35s.
</P>
<P>
   Woods flew to California after doing a corporate clinic in Ohio
on Monday morning. Both he and Garcia went out before the televised
match to play a few holes on the Canyons course at Bighorn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another million,'' one fan yelled at Woods as he walked down
the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was clearly the attraction for an estimated 7,000 fans,
who shouted out at him and ran from hole to hole to get prime
viewing spots.
</P>
<P>
   The players were driven in golf carts between many of the holes,
and on several occasions Woods looked a bit nervous as his cart was
forced to thread between throngs of fans to get to the next tee.
</P>
<P>
   Between the third and fourth holes, Garcia hopped off his cart
and tried to find his way through a swarm of fans to a restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in the porta potty to the left,'' one security guard
barked to another on his radio.
</P>
<P>
   As Garcia stood over a putt on the fourth hole, a cell phone
rang. Both he and Woods also backed off shots after beginning their
backswings when cameras went off next to the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year's inaugural event, which saw Woods beat No. 2
David Duval 2 and 1, Garcia was picked for the match despite not
winning all year and holding the No. 15 ranking in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia got the nod because of the animated way he often plays,
such as in the 1999 PGA Championship when he ran across the fairway
and leaped in the air as he chased a shot on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia showed little emotion early, and he and Woods didn't
share much conversation, despite wearing microphones for the
television broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won the NEC Invitational only the evening earlier, hitting
an 8-iron to 2 feet in near darkness on the final hole to win by 11
shots. It was his eighth win in 16 PGA Tour events this year, five
of them coming by at least four strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has also won four of the last five majors, beginning with
the 1999 PGA in which he held Garcia off by a shot at Medinah
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, meanwhile, has struggled all year, winning only $554,313
compared to $7.7 million for Woods.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Releases QB Foley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Veteran quarterback Glenn Foley was
released Monday by the Seattle Seahawks in a cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, the team's backup quarterback last season, started one
game in 1999 when Jon Kitna was injured. He lost his backup job to
second-year player Brock Huard, who performed better during the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000-plus Foley was to receive this season played into
the decision, said coach and general manager Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ''The salary cap factors into it,'' Holmgren said. ''Having a
veteran as your third (quarterback), there's a certain comfort
level there, but we're about training young people right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lytle, one of four players signed by the Seahawks on
Monday, will be the No. 3 quarterback this season. He spent last
season with Carolina, but was released by the Panthers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle cut Todd Peterson, the second-leading field goal kicker
in team history, on Sunday in another salary-related move.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to kickers or punters that are good players, and
Todd's a good player, there's usually more than one reason you do
that,'' Holmgren said. ''It was a combination of playing outside
and the cap situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks will play at University of Washington's Husky
Stadium this season after the implosion of the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who stopped by the team's practice facility Monday,
said he has been contacted by two other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not for me to second-guess,'' Peterson said. ''It's for
me to move on and get ready to roll. I'm going to talk to teams,
figure out what's the best opportunity, then I'm going to go kick
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris Heppner, a rookie free agent from Montana, will be the
Seahawks' kicker this season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In addition to Lytle, the Seahawks signed three other
players from the waiver wire: defensive end Rahmaan Streeter, guard
Eric King and fullback Scot Osborne. They also waived offensive
lineman Jeff Dellenbach.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Fending off international criticism of their
election, lawmakers from Haiti's Lavalas Family party took office Monday and
cemented former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's control over Parliament.
Incumbents from opposition parties boycotted the session to protest the disputed
election, which was held in three stages in May, June and July. Senators chose
Sen. Yvon Neptune, spokesman of Aristide's Lavalas Family party, to be president
of the upper house. Lower house members chose Sainvoyis Pascal, 71, their eldest

<HEADLINE> Arena Players Ratify Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Arena Football League and its players have a
six-year labor agreement that includes a salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The league's Players Organizing Committee, the exclusive
collective bargaining representative of all AFL players, said
Monday the players voted to ratify the recently negotiated six-year
collective bargaining agreement by a vote of 6-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, AFL owners voted to ratify the agreement.
Previously, negotiations between owners and the players' union
lasted about five months. The players' voting process, which was
conducted by secret ballot, began during the last week of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement provides for generous salary increases,
accelerated free agency, and an unprecedented level of benefits to
our players,'' said Ronald J. Kurpiers, AFL deputy commissioner and
general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   AFL players have been working under an interim collective
bargaining agreement negotiated in March 2000. At the March
negotiating session, 34 AFL player representatives negotiated the
terms and conditions of employment for the 2000 season after the
league threatened to cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the new agreement:
</P>
<P>
   -- AFL owners agreed to pay approximately $1 million in
retroactive pay increases to all AFL players who played in the 2000
season and who are eligible. The retroactive pay will affect those
players who made less last season than the new minimum salaries
outlined in the six-year agreement.
</P>
<P>
   -- Any player with four or more years of AFL experience will
immediately become an unrestricted free agent, free to sign with
any AFL team once the new signing period opens this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   -- The AFL will operate under a salary cap, with an allowance for
player salary increases of up to 52 percent per year over the life
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   -- League owners will fund a players pension and retirement fund
through revenue sharing from the league's licensed merchandise
program. Revenues from the program will be split 50-50 between the
league and the union. Owners have agreed to pay $1 million into the
pension fund over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   -- AFL players will receive guaranteed increases in their minimum
base salaries. The new agreement requires first-year players a
minimum of $900 per game and a $200 win bonus; second-year players
are guaranteed a minimum of $1,250 per game and a $300 win bonus;
and players with three or more years of AFL experience are
guaranteed a minimum of $1,450 per game and a $400 win bonus. Any
player with three or more years of AFL experience may voluntarily
waive the minimum salary to fit within the team's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   -- A four-man practice squad will be instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Murtha, who heads the AFLPOC, said, ''This agreement meets
the goals which the players set last year when they began their
efforts to form a union and bargain with ownership. The hard work
and sacrifice of our player committee has benefited all the players
of Arena Football.''

<HEADLINE> Woods Runs Out of Magic  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's what makes Tiger Woods worth watching, even in a
made-for-TV event against a guy he beats most nights in his sleep:
</P>
<P>
   Woods has become the best show not just in sports, but all of
TV. You take your eyes off him, even for a minute, and you risk
missing something no one's ever done before.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting fatigue and the flu, Woods ran out of magic Monday
night in the ''Battle of Bighorn,'' losing to Sergio Garcia 1-up.
The 20-year-old Spaniard birdied four of the last five holes,
including two long birdie putts ripped out of the pages of Woods'
playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least,'' said Woods, ''I gave him a run for his money.''
</P>
<P>
   More important was what Woods gave golf for the last week or so.
</P>
<P>
   This past Saturday, he was walking up the 18th fairway with Phil
Mickelson and lapping the field again. It wasn't a major. Bob May,
who chased Woods to the wire in the last of the season's big four
tournaments, has taken his slingshot to another PGA Tour event
halfway across the country.
</P>
<P>
   So only golf junkies were supposed to be watching the final
minutes of the telecast from the NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio.
And Mickelson had just given them a jolt by wielding his 8-iron
like a scythe to cut the ball out of the rough and land it just
short of the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   Then Woods took his turn.
</P>
<P>
   What followed had the CBS announcers in the fairway and the
tower stepping on each other's lines. The result sounded like
something straight out of Carl the deranged greenskeeper's
''Cinderella Boy'' monologue from ''Caddyshack.'' Only this was on
live TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tiger's in really, really nasty rough ... he's got 184 yards
to the pin ... pitching wedge (!) ... to 8 feet (!!!) .''
</P>
<P>
   After one of the most remarkable shots ever, Woods missed the
birdie putt. And still shot 67.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sunday comes, he plays a few holes, wolfs down a
cheeseburger during a rain delay, rifles his last shot through
near-darkness to two feet, and shoots another 67. He wins, he
breaks another scoring record and makes another acceptance speech.
The only difference between this Sunday and last is he doesn't get
to sleep in his own bed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Woods wakes up in Akron, appears at a clinic for
one of his sponsors, then hops on his private jet. What awaits him
at the end of a journey to Palm Desert, Calif., is yet another of
those well-paying exhibitions golf pros use to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Woods being Woods, this one has a title, ''Battle of Bighorn,''
and it will pay him considerably more -- $1.1 million -- than most
exhibitions. And instead of playing in a foursome with the usual
corporate chieftains, Woods has to play mano a mano with Sergio
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to be said about ''Battle of Bighorn'' is, it
sounded like a good idea at the time. When ABC cleared space in
prime time and cut the deal last spring, Woods was just coming off
a streak of six straight wins and Garcia was still his most
attractive rival. Of course, back then the young Spaniard still had
game and Woods still had rivals.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the only suspense left is what kind of ratings
''Bighorn'' draws. But what else are you going to watch?
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' on CBS? ''Mysterious Ways'' on NBC? ''Nitro'' on
TNT? Padres at Cubs?
</P>
<P>
   Watching Woods instead gives you the best they have to offer,
anyway. What he gives up in drama, he more than gives back in
honest showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Ali was like that, but TV was just getting started then. Michael
Jordan was like that, too. There were dozens of nights in February
when his team was resting comfortably atop the standings and Jordan
was far enough ahead in the scoring race to take a night off. But
he never did.
</P>
<P>
   He understood that to make the biggest shots at the biggest
moments, he had to make them at the smaller ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is like that. Only he's delivering those moments in such a
compressed time frame that anybody who blinks risks missing
something. It's why the networks stopped taking chances, why Time
magazine put him on the cover the week of the Republican
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Only four years ago, Woods was playing in the final group of
another golf tournament that also ended Sunday. That was the U.S.
Amateur. He's raised his game several levels since, but the
competition looks the same. The problem is that the guys with
enough talent to challenge Woods don't have the heart, and vice
versa. No one is willing to outwork him.
</P>
<P>
   En route to a 61 on Friday that sent shivers down the spine of
everybody who has to play him, Woods walked off the 15th tee and
into a clearing. He found a gap in the tree line and stood there
transfixed, staring off in the distance at a TV tower with a cloth
hanging off it like the tail of a kite. He was intent on gauging a
breeze almost no one else felt. Only then did he step back on the
tee and hit his drive.
</P>
<P>
   That's what his competition is up against. A friend who should
have copyrighted the idea said the ''Battle at Bighorn'' would have
been more interesting if Woods played against a different pro at
each hole. Someday soon. Or if Garcia proves as good at
impersonating his fellow pros as Peter Jacobsen, maybe sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem stayed tuned
because he has plenty at stake. Finchem is about to open
negotiations on a new TV contract. At the moment, he likes his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he does this six or eight times a year for the next five
years, at some point do people get bored?'' Finchem said. ''Maybe.
That's not the case right now.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Arkansas Campus Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A longtime professor and a graduate
student who had been taking classes for 10 years were shot to death
Monday at the University of Arkansas in an apparent murder-suicide
on the first day of the fall semester, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Associate professor John Locke, 67, died in his English
department office on the second floor of Kimpel Hall, a classroom
and office building near the heart of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard one gunshot followed by a ... man's voice saying, 'No,
I didn't do anything,''' said Bethany Edstrom, a graduate student
who was in a nearby office. ''Then I heard a second shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of a 911 call reporting the shooting shows the
caller said Locke had uttering the same phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Officers responding to the calls said they spoke briefly with a
man behind the locked office door, University Police Capt. Brad
Bruns said. Less than five minutes later, another shot rang out.
Officers found the two men dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   Bruns identified the other victim as James Easton Kelly, 36, of
Marianna, a graduate student in the comparative literature program
in which Locke taught.
</P>
<P>
   Police hadn't determined the motive for the shootings or who
pulled the trigger, Bruns said. He said the gun found at the scene
belonged to Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had been taking courses in a doctoral program for 10 years
and had a pattern of enrolling in comparative literature courses
and then dropping them, Bruns said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, a committee of six professors voted to dismiss him
from the degree program but to allow Kelly to continue to take
classes as a non-degree student. Locke was on the committee but
abstained from the vote, Bruns said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Monday that he was saddened to learn of
the killings at the school where both he and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton taught law in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's shooting strikes a particularly sad chord for Hillary
and me, who both had the privilege of teaching at this wonderful
institution,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Bennett, who had worked across the hall from Locke for 20
years, described him as a ''very mild-tempered man'' who had
reputation for helping his graduate students through the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing could astonish me more,'' he said. ''I'm without
words, without any kind of guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Woods, dean of the arts and science department, said he
had known Locke for 30 years and that he expected Locke to retire
in January. He also said there had never been any complaints about
Locke, who had been a liaison to students for years.
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty were evacuated from the building after the
shooting, and several classes there and in an adjacent building
were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to deal with a situation that seems horrific and
trying to control everything we can and bring this to resolution as
quickly as possible,'' university spokesman Roger Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimpel Hall houses faculty in a number of departments --
communication, drama, English, foreign languages and journalism,
Williams said. Journalism department chairwoman Patsy Watkins many
of the 50- to 60-student classrooms on the floor would have been
filled at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor John White said there a forum would be held Tuesday
for students to discuss the shooting. The 15,000-student campus is
in the northwest part of the state.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Add Wrestler to Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge on Monday ordered the U.S.
Olympic Committee to name wrestler Matt Lindland to the U.S. team
for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest reversal in a lengthy dispute that has
bounced between arbitrators and the courts since Lindland lost the
167&AMP;frac12;-pound Greco-Roman wrestling Olympic trials to Keith Sieracki
in June.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge B. Zagel ruled Monday that an arbitration
ruling that had led to a rematch -- in which Lindland beat Sieracki
-- should settle the matter. The arbitration ruling had been upheld
by an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Zagel said a second arbitration hearing Thursday that was
decided in Sieracki's favor had not been confirmed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judges trump arbitrators when they have jurisdiction,'' said
Zagel, who stayed his order until 3 p.m. Tuesday to give the USOC
time to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   USOC attorney Irving B. Levinson said he would consult with the
committee. Meanwhile, Sieracki is trying to get an order from a
federal court in Colorado to uphold the arbitration that went his
way.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling goes back to the Olympic trials in June, when
Sieracki beat Lindland 2-1 on a referee's decision after overtime.
Lindland protested the match, saying Sieracki tripped him, in
violation of wrestling rules.
</P>
<P>
   After Lindland's protests were denied twice by USA Wrestling, he
appealed to an arbitrator, who ruled there should be a rematch.
Lindland beat Sieracki 8-0 Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki then filed his own appeal. But hours later, the 7th
Circuit decided that Lindland, not Sieracki, should get the Olympic
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys were girding for the possibility of more court action
in the tangled case.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki, a military police sergeant, was rated as the top
wrestler for 2000-01 by Team USA and USA Wrestling. But Lindland, a
University of Nebraska coach who is working out with the U.S. team,
contends he should have been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The official deadline to submit rosters for next month's Olympic
games was Friday, but the USOC took the weekend to make a decision.
USOC attorney Levinson argued that, because of the deadline, the
question was now out of USOC's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland's attorney, Kevin B. Duff, said there was still plenty
of time to make a change.

<HEADLINE> Developer Makes Plea in Tax Charge  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Real estate developer Abe Hirschfeld pleaded no
contest to a state tax evasion charge on Monday and paid a $1
million fine with money he had set aside for bail in another case
on which he is serving a 1 to 3 year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call from the jail in the New York Criminal Courts
building, the 81-year-old Hirschfeld crowed that the judge had
''dismissed the case'' and accused an assistant district attorney
of being ''a crooked lawyer'' who gave the court wrong figures.
</P>
<P>
   But Hirschfeld's lawyer, James Palumbo, said Criminal Court
Judge Bruce Allen had accepted an ''Alford plea,'' the New York
version of no contest, to end the tax case. Hirschfeld's health was
a factor in the decision, he said. Hirschfeld suffers from a
chronic renal ailment, gout and skin cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld was awaiting a second trial on the tax charge, his
first trial last year having ended in a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution claimed that Hirschfeld had evaded $5.5 million
in state taxes. Hirschfeld insisted he had paid all his taxes and
never received a bill for the contested amounts. Palumbo said the
state still may seek to recover the money in civil proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld was sentenced Aug. 1 to 1-to-3 years for
second-degree criminal solicitation, a charge stemming from his
attempt in 1997 to arrange the murder of Stanley Stahl, his real
estate partner of 40 years, over a business dispute, for $150,000.
Stahl died in 1999 of a stroke that his wife claimed was brought on
by stress over the death threat.
</P>
<P>
   Following his conviction on the solicitation charge, Hirschfeld
posted $1 million as bail but a court refused to grant his release,
a decision upheld on appeal last week. In Monday's ruling, Allen
allowed that money to be transferred to pay the fine on the tax
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the court that I can afford it, the money means nothing
but my reputation means everything,'' Hirschfeld said in his phone
call.
</P>
<P>
   A flamboyant, eccentric figure who made millions in parking lots
and health clubs, Hirschfeld has run for several political offices
and once owned the New York Post for about a week.

<HEADLINE> Quake Jolts Eastern Indonesia Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A strong earthquake with a magnitude
of 6.4 shook the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon on Tuesday,
causing residents to flee their homes in panic, seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or serious damage,
the Indonesian Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the tremor occurred five minutes after midnight with the
epicenter beneath the Banda Sea about 40 miles southwest of Ambon.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, a 5.6 magnitude quake struck beneath the
Seram Sea about 55 miles northwest of Ambon.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, which sits on major fault lines, is prone to frequent
seismic upheavals. A magnitude 6 earthquake can cause severe damage
if centered near an urban area.
</P>
<P>
   Ambon is in the Maluku islands, also known as the Moluccas,
where thousands of people have been killed in Muslim-Christian
fighting during the past 20 months.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Mubarak To Talk Peace  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Seeking to avoid a blowup if Israel and the
Palestinians fail to meet a mid-September deadline for a
settlement, President Clinton flew to Cairo on Tuesday to enlist
the help of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, long considered a
reliable intermediary between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the time is short,'' Clinton said before beginning his
session with Mubarak. ''I think that all the parties understand
that without the leadership and support of Egypt they will not be
able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Mubarak met in a lavishly appointed room at the
Cairo airport.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said he is optimistic that Israel and the Palestinians
can reach an agreement by next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to do our best to find a resolution to the
problem in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians,''
Mubarak said. ''We are making some consultations where we could
help the two parties to reach a framework which is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Mubarak at the end of a four-day African tour.
He hoped the Egyptian leader could help break a deadlock over the
future of Jerusalem, the key obstacle to an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Mubarak has been critical to this process for 20
years now, certainly all the time that I've been here. So we are
going to work together to see if we can find a way to help the
parties get over this next big hump,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly at least, the Egyptians have indicated they would not
try to force concessions from Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader
whose demand for sovereignty over East Jerusalem helped cause the
collapse of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp
David in July.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mubarak has apparently tried to persuade Arafat to
shelve his threat to declare Palestinian statehood unilaterally if
negotiations with Israel failed to provide that dividend by Sept.
13, the deadline set by the two sides. Arafat met with Egyptian
officials Saturday in Alexandria, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to Cairo came at the end of an African tour
during which he encouraged democratic advances in Nigeria and
negotiations to end seven years of civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's inconceivable we could have a peace between the Israelis
and Palestinians without the support of President Mubarak,''
Clinton said Saturday as he began a two-day visit far down the
continent in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you should read too much into it,'' Clinton said
at the time of the Mubarak session, ''other than that we are
working with a sense of urgency given the timetable the parties
have set for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said he doesn't expect
''decisive action'' from the Mubarak meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I hope will be furthered by this is the process by which
we can work with the Egyptians to try to get the parties closer
together,'' he told reporters aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presided over the failed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
at Camp David, in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, and has since
pledged to do whatever he can to help the two sides along.
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided to visit Mubarak in Egypt because Mubarak was
not planning to attend next month's United Nations Millennium
summit in New York, where Clinton is expected to make a broad push
to renew Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 13 deadline falls about a week after the U.N. summit.
</P>
<P>
   The talks to end a half-century of hostility broke down over the
fate of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as holy.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush,
speaking via satellite to the annual convention of B'nai B'rith
International in Washington, renewed his promise to support moving
the U.S. Embassy from outside Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, ''the city
Israel has chosen as its capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised America's ''special relationship'' with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''My support for Israel is not conditioned upon the outcome of
the peace process,'' Bush said. ''America's special relationship
with Israel precedes the peace process. Israel's adversaries should
know that in my administration the special relationship will
continue even if they cannot bring themselves to make peace with
the Jewish state.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Set for Drug Fight  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENAS COLORADAS, Colombia (AP) -- Their fuselages flashing in the
sun, two airplanes lazily circled over fields of coca, ready to
dump a load of herbicides onto the robust, green bushes used to
make cocaine. Rebels waited below.
</P>
<P>
   Crouching behind fences, tree stumps and the coca itself,
fighters from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
opened up on the two Vietnam-era planes with M-16 and Galil assault
rifles, the crackle of automatic weapons fire splitting the
afternoon silence.
</P>
<P>
   During the action Friday, witnessed by an Associated Press team
accompanying the rebels through the coca fields near the southern
village of Penas Coloradas, neither of the U.S.-made OV-10
airplanes was shot down. But the camouflage-clad leftist guerrillas
considered it a victory: The unprotected aircraft veered off
without releasing their cargo.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to Colombia on Wednesday and a $1.3
billion U.S. aid package aim to drive the rebels from the drug
fields. Under the plan, 60 U.S. combat helicopters will escort
fumigation planes and ferry U.S.-trained anti-narcotics troops into
drug-producing plantations that cover vast areas of southern
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   FARC rebels, as well as a rival right-wing paramilitary group,
protect the crops of coca and poppy, from which heroin is made. The
rebels have vowed to fight the anti-drug offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the so-called Push into Southern Colombia,
expected to get into full swing next year, will derail fledgling
peace talks and draw the United States directly into Colombia's
36-year-old guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist their only interest is in fighting drugs
but express growing concern about the 15,000-strong FARC, which has
used proceeds from the drug trade to better arm itself and to
dominate a large part of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   FARC commander Alfonso Cano called the planned offensive a
veiled counterinsurgency plan and a symbol of President Andres
Pastrana's subservience to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States needs an excuse to continue to play the role
of the world's policeman, and now that excuse is (fighting) drug
trafficking,'' said the bearded rebel leader in an interview in San
Vicente del Caguan, a town a four-hour riverboat ride north of
Penas Coloradas.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, many Colombians support the anti-drug push. But in
Colombia's coca-growing regions, hundreds of thousands of poor coca
farmers, itinerant harvesters and small-time merchants do not.
</P>
<P>
   In Penas Coloradas, a grimy settlement on the brown and windy
Caguan River, 280 miles from the capital Bogota, coca is the
economy's driving force and the FARC the only law and order. The
rebels take their cut of the cocaine production process while
serving as a de facto government. Liquor sales are forbidden
between Monday and Friday. Theft and drunkenness are punished.
Prostitutes at the town's Great Saigon bar must take AIDS tests.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fumigation planes made their abortive spraying
attempt, the local rebel commander -- known as Herley -- said the
coming offensive will provide the FARC with an ample recruiting
base among farmhands who could lose their livelihoods as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many enemies are created when you take away the food from
someone's children'' the rebel, a 22-year FARC veteran with long,
soiled fingernails and a bloodshot glare, asked as he strode
through the coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the fumigation planes flew overhead, he rested the
barrel of his rifle on a tree stump, aimed at the aircraft, and
carefully squeezed off a few rounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the farmers in Penas Coloradas, as in much of the rest of
impoverished, rural Colombia, there are few viable alternatives to
making a living than growing coca. They are skeptical of government
pledges that the anti-drug offensive will be accompanied by loans
and other assistance to help them grow legal crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government doesn't even know we exist,'' fumed Miguel
Hernandez, whose four-acre coca plot was fumigated two times last
week, wilting banana trees mixed in with the coca.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a tenth of the U.S. aid plan would provide funds for
alternative development projects.
</P>
<P>
   While the cocaine trade nets huge profits for those further up
the international drug chain, the small-time farmers who grow coca
near Penas Coloradas make very little.
</P>
<P>
   Jose, a farmer who turned to coca four years ago after working
for years as a migrant coffee picker, said he earns only about $375
a month in profits off his 12&AMP;frac12; acres of coca. He didn't give his
last name for fear of having problems with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a wooden shack at a bend in the Caguan River, he
intently watched local men commissioned by drug cartels test the
purity of his football-sized bag of ''coca base'' -- a
semi-processed form of cocaine. One of the men then handed Jose a
wad of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not honorable work,'' Jose said sheepishly. ''But here in
Colombia we have to eat however we can.''

<HEADLINE> Judge To Release Wen Ho Lee on Bail  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- To Wen Ho Lee, the question is crucial:
When will the nuclear scientist jailed on charges of mishandling
U.S. secrets be released on bail?
</P>
<P>
   It may not be immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys were expected at a hearing
Tuesday to iron out any differences they may have over U.S.
District Judge James Parker's proposed conditions of release for
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors appeal the final order, Parker could allow a
delay while the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decides whether
to hear an appeal. Even if all goes smoothly and there are no
appeals and no delays, Lee probably would not be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One condition proposed by Parker, for example, would require the
FBI to search Lee's home in the Los Alamos suburb of White Rock.
That could not be done until after the release order was finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Another condition: Computers, cell phones and all other
electronic means of communication -- except a single federally
monitored telephone -- would have to be removed from Lee's home and
an electronic monitoring system would have to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys Mark Holscher and John Cline declined comment
Monday when asked when Lee might get to go home. The FBI and
Justice Department also had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, has been jailed since his arrest Dec. 10 on 59 counts
alleging he transferred restricted data to unsecured computers and
tape at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He was twice previously
refused bail, including once by Parker last December. But last
Thursday, Parker said the case for holding Lee in jail pending his
November trial is no longer as compelling and agreed to release him
on $1 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI counterintelligence agent, Robert Messemer, acknowledged
some errors in his December testimony on which Parker had relied in
refusing bail. And the defense produced some respected scientists
who disputed the secrecy value of the material Lee is accused of
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Under Parker's proposal, Lee would have to remain at home under
electronic monitoring unless accompanied by his attorneys to court
or the lab to help with his defense. Federal authorities also could
inspect his mail and monitor the movements of Sylvia Lee, his wife.

<HEADLINE> Black Authors Getting Imprints  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Have publishers finally learned to love black
authors?
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Time Warner, HarperCollins and Kensington
Publishing are among those who started or acquired imprints
specifically to release books by blacks. The most recent one is
Strivers Row, a division of Random House that begins publishing
next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have long complained the industry ignored them, that it
didn't believe they actually read books. Now, with the industry
apparently paying attention, many say demand for black writers has
never been stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in a buying frenzy,'' said Anita Diggs, a senior editor at
Ballantine Books and director of One World, a multicultural imprint
with a strong focus on black writers. ''It's very exciting right
now to be African-American and to be working in publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very competitive these days,'' said Melody Guy, who heads
Strivers Row. ''A couple of times recently I've been looking over a
manuscript only to find out that another publisher was already
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agree the turning point came in the early 1990s with the
publication of Terry McMillan's ''Waiting to Exhale.'' Her novel
about the lives of four upper-class black women sold millions of
copies. It proved not only that there was a large black readership
but that a market existed for subjects besides ''protest
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the market has broadened. Literary
authors such as Nobel laureate Toni Morrison still sell millions of
copies, but there's also room for mystery (Walter Mosley), romance
(E. Lynn Harris, Eric Jerome Dickey) and self-help authors (Iyanla
Vanzant).
</P>
<P>
   The imprints themselves reveal the number of potential markets.
Strivers Row emphasizes paperback first editions of commercial
fiction. Hyperion's Jump at the Sun specializes in children's
books. Time Warner's imprint will focus on religious books for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''After Terry McMillan's success, blacks were buying books just
because of the novelty. Taste wasn't really involved. Now, a decade
later, readers are more discerning,'' said Manie Barron, publisher
of Amistad Press, an imprint of HarperCollins that publishes
fiction and nonfiction by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many authors initially published themselves, selling thousands
of copies. Tawana ''TJ'' Butler, whose novel ''Sorority Sisters''
came out earlier this year from Villard, used to travel around the
country on her own, relying on black-owned stores to help promote
her. Early copies of Harris' popular ''Invisible Life'' were sold
from the back of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first started publishing myself, I was advised against
it because I was told the industry frowned upon it. But within the
African-American community I saw lots of sales,'' said Harris, a
Doubleday author with 2 million books in print.
</P>
<P>
   Writers once passed over by publishers now have deals. Author
Solomon Jones saved the rejection slips, all 50 of them. They had
much to praise about ''Pipe Dream,'' his novel about four drug
addicts and a murder they didn't commit. But they told Jones there
was no market for his book.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of statement blacks say they've been hearing since
the earliest days of publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just about ready to put out the book myself,'' said
Jones, a writer with the Philadelphia Weekly, an alternative paper.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, however, ''Pipe Dream'' will be published by
Strivers Row. It will receive a first printing of 25,000, a high
number for a first novel, and it will be promoted throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   '''Pipe Dream' was the book that got us talking about starting
Strivers Row,'' Guy said. ''It was hard to see the book as a
hardcover. It's a story where crack addicts are the heroes and it's
not difficult to see why so many publishers were shying away from
it. But we felt that it could work well in paperback and reach
readers we don't always get to.''

<HEADLINE> Arab Fighters Said Sent to Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIZARAK, Afghanistan (AP) -- Suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden
sent 400 Arab fighters to the Russian breakaway republic of
Chechnya with explosives and weapons to help the war against
Russian forces, a military instructor in his organization says.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence sources confirm fighters went to Chechnya
from Afghanistan, but cannot say whether they were Arab or Afghan.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press reporters have seen Afghan and Arab fighters in
Chechen bands, but none has confirmed a link to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure comes at a time when Central Asian governments
are sounding increasingly worried about Islamic militancy in their
countries, and are blaming the Taliban, the Islamic rulers of
Afghanistan where bin Laden's Al-Qaida organization is based.
</P>
<P>
   The military instructor in Al-Qaida, who goes by the nom de
guerre of Abu Daoud, also reports that bin Laden is under pressure
from the Taliban to curtail his activities, and that bin Laden has
indicated he would rather quit Afghanistan than give up his war
against the West.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accuses bin Laden of masterminding the bombing
of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998. U.N. sanctions were
imposed on Afghanistan in November.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Daoud, a Yemeni national whose real name is not known, spoke
in an interview this month in a remote village in Nangarhar
province, northeastern Afghanistan. The meeting was arranged by a
Taliban commander.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Daoud said hundreds of Arab and Afghan fighters went to
Chechnya about 18 months ago, and many returned. The latest 400
went there some three months ago, according to Abu Daoud's account.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin claimed this spring to have evidence that bin Laden
and the Taliban had a deal to aid Chechen units. Vladimir Putin,
then Russia's prime minister, said last September that bin Laden
had been in Chechnya several times. Moscow also tried to link bin
Laden to apartment bombings that killed 300 people. The bombings
were part of the reason Russian troops re-entered Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians gave no evidence, and the statements were seen as
aimed to win Western support for a military campaign against
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to Abu Daoud, bin Laden's welcome in
Afghanistan seems to be wearing thin. He said a new order was
issued at the beginning of July by the Taliban's supreme leader,
Mullah Mohammed Omar, flatly banning bin Laden's operations.
</P>
<P>
   He said Omar told bin Laden ''in very tough words that there
could be no activity. He should be like a simple refugee and all
his communications were shut down. Then bin Laden said, 'I want to
leave Afghanistan for another country, but you must agree to not
tell where I am going.'''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Washington has urged the Taliban -- directly in
talks with Taliban officials and through Pakistan -- to crack down
on bin Laden and prevent him from committing terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden keeps his whereabouts secret, and there was no
indication to which country he might try to move.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban deputy interior minister, Mohammed Khaqzar, said in
an interview that Bin Laden's communications were cut off more than
two years ago, and he denied any new curbs have been imposed.
</P>
<P>
   But Abu Daoud said that until the latest ban, bin Laden had been
operating as usual, running a worldwide financial network.
</P>
<P>
   He said bin Laden had money transferred two months previously to
Jordan to finance the defense of 28 Arabs being tried on suspicion
of planning terror attacks during the millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a telephone call and the money was transferred to
Jordan,'' Abu Daoud said. The transaction was handled by a bin
Laden lieutenant code-named Abu Zubayda, who is presently in
Afghanistan, Abu Daoud said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian military prosecutor in Amman, Jordan, Col. Mahmoud
Obeidat, said in an interview that Abu Zubayda is a Palestinian
from the Gaza Strip whose real name is Zein Abediein Mohammed
Hassan. He is one of 12 men being tried in absentia in the
terrorism case.
</P>
<P>
   The sending of fighters to Chechnya is further proof that bin
Laden was active at least until recently, Abu Daoud said.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Urges $1 Minimum Wage Hike  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Signs of compromise have emerged for a bill to
raise the minimum wage by $1 over two years, now that House Speaker
Dennis Hastert proposed to move the legislation without two key tax
cut proposals that drew objections from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senior White House officials and Democratic congressional
leaders said Monday that Hastert's offer could represent a
breakthrough in long-stalled negotiations on size and speed of a
minimum wage increase and the composition of an accompanying
package of tax breaks for business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will study Speaker Hastert's offer and hope to work with
the GOP, which now seems possible for the first time, to produce a
bill that is in the best interest of working Americans,'' said
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., said in a letter to Clinton that Republicans
still wanted a $76 billion package of business tax breaks paired
with the wage measure. But they would remove proposals to abolish
the estate tax and to change pension laws, including increased
contribution limits for 401(k) plans. Both are subjects of separate
bills moving on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long sought in these prosperous economic times to
increase the $5.15-an-hour federal minimum wage, but Republicans
say tax breaks are needed to cushion the higher costs that would
fall on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very clear that a vast majority of congressional
Democrats and Republicans would like to see a balanced approach
achieved before we adjourn,'' Hastert said in the letter to
Clinton. ''I believe that we can work together to pass this
legislation when we return in September with strong bipartisan
majorities in the House and Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Clinton administration estimates, about 10 million
workers earning between $5.15 and $6.14 an hour would be directly
helped by a $1 minimum wage increase. For a full-time worker now
earning minimum wage, it would amount to a $2,000 annual raise.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's chief economic adviser, said the
White House would ''take a fresh look'' at the tax package now that
''the most objectionable poison pills'' were removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this movement reflects a Republican willingness to work
with us to remove remaining barriers, then perhaps we can come to a
bill the president could sign,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are divided on the merits of increasing the minimum
wage, but with House control at stake in the fall elections some
want to head off potential Democratic attack ads claiming they
favor tax cuts that skew to the wealthy, such as abolishing estate
taxes, but have done nothing to give raises to the lowest-paid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hastert's proposal, the minimum wage would rise to $6.15
an hour over two years: 50 cents on Jan. 1 and 50 cents on Jan. 1,
2002. The proposal would provide business tax breaks worth $76
billion over 10 years, down from $122.7 billion in an earlier House
version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tax package includes:
</P>
<P>
   --Immediate 100 percent health insurance premium deductibility
for the self-employed, sooner than under current law. Individuals
could deduct from their taxes 100 percent of health expenses
without itemizing, if they are not covered by an employer or
government plan or by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   --Repealing excise taxes on producers and marketers of distilled
spirits, wine and beer.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lieberman, Bush Embrace Religion  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Again pushing the boundaries between the
spiritual and secular, Democratic vice presidential candidate
Joseph Lieberman said Monday that ''religion is a source of unity
and strength in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most religious country in the world and sometimes,
we try to stifle that fact or hide it,'' Lieberman told 150
religious leaders at an interfaith breakfast. ''But the profound
and ultimately, most important reality is that we are not only
citizens of this blessed country, we are citizens of the same
awesome God.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
praised members of a Jewish group for performing ''miracles of
renewal'' with faith-based community programs, which he supports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our nation is chosen by God and commissioned by history to be
a model to the world of justice and inclusion and diversity without
division. Jews and Christians and Muslims speak as one in their
commitment to a kind, just tolerant society,'' Bush told B'nai
B'rith, a Jewish service organization.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have embraced religion as a means of reaching
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, warmly received by the spiritual leaders, said he was
moved that the gathering crossed religious lines ''because it makes
real for me what I have believed with profound faith throughout my
life, that religion is a source of unity and strength in America.''
</P>
<P>
   He met with pastors, priests and rabbis at the South Shore
Cultural Center, a former country club that banned blacks and Jews.
In greeting the group, Lieberman quoted a line from a Hebrew song,
Hine Ma Tov, that calls for ''brothers and sisters to dwell
together in harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier in Detroit, he told members of a black church that
he hopes his candidacy as an Orthodox Jew will reinstate ''a place
for faith in America's public life.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the billing aides give to issues like health insurance,
Medicare and prescription drug coverage, Lieberman manages to bring
the discussion back to God. Bush also talks about his faith.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Newsweek poll showed 66 percent of the public was ''not
at all concerned'' that Lieberman's religion might interfere with
his ability to perform as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's emphasis on religion troubles the
Anti-Defamation League, which issued a statement Monday calling on
him to refrain from ''overt expressions'' of religious values and
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Candidates should feel comfortable explaining their religious
convictions to voters,'' said Howard P. Berkowitz, ADL national
chairman, and Abraham H. Foxman, the national director. ''At the
same time, however, we believe there is a point at which an
emphasis on religion in a political campaign becomes inappropriate
and even unsettling in a religiously diverse society such as
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Lieberman said he had not yet seen the
statement from the ADL and therefore, could not immediately comment
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, who accompanied Lieberman around
the city Monday, acknowledged the power of prayer in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know there's a separation of church and state in America,
but at the same time, elected officials realize that they're all
citizens right here, as well as religious leaders. Their
congregations are citizens as well, and that's why you have to
build this relationship up,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised B'nai B'rith in a conference call from Austin,
Texas, saying, ''Your works have touched millions of hearts and are
a testament to the power of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to rally the armies of compassion that exist in every
community across America,'' Bush said. ''A truly welcoming culture
must recognize that every person is created in the image and
likeness of God. We must appreciate the dignity ... in all
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigns as a different kind of Republican, a
''compassionate conservative'' who welcomes help from faith-based
groups on everything from education to fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lieberman told Democratic activists he's
''not asking anybody to vote for me because of my religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, on Election Day that will be an irrelevant factor
as I think it is today for most Americans. And Al Gore and I offer
ourselves to America as the team that's best for America on the
merits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the airport for a flight to California, Lieberman,
joined by Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill., stopped at a train station
to shake hands. A pregnant woman who shook hands with Lieberman
pointed to her belly and said, ''You have two votes right here.''

<HEADLINE> Libyan Welcome for Freed Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- A plane carrying six former hostages
traveled to Libya on Monday for an extraordinary welcome by Moammar
Gadhafi. The Libyan strongman earned unprecedented international
thanks for persuading Filipino rebels to release the group.
</P>
<P>
   The plane left Cebu, Philippines on Monday and landed in the
United Arab Emirates for refueling in the afternoon. After an
overnight rest, it traveled on toward Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the hostages were released, a radio station in the
southern Philippines quoted a spokesman for the Abu Sayyaf rebels
as saying the group had abducted an American.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Abu Sabaya, told the Radio Mindanao Network
Tuesday that the man's name was Jeffrey Craig Schilling and that he
was kidnapped Monday near a shopping mall in southern Zamboanga
city and taken to Jolo. The rebels claimed he was a CIA agent and
threatened to execute him if the United States does not accept
demands that will be announced in three days, Sabaya said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Manila said it was looking into the report
of the kidnapping but could not confirm it. Police and military
officials also had no information.
</P>
<P>
   Libya, often accused of backing guerrillas, plotting terror
attacks and meddling in affairs far from home, says it acted out of
humanitarian concern. But the move also won Gadhafi international
publicity at a time when his country is working to end years of
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany, whose citizens were among those freed, found
themselves officially thanking Libya. Negotiators say Gadhafi paid
$1 million per captive, but Libya insisted it gained the releases
by promising development projects in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the six hostages, South African Callie Strydom, was freed
earlier Monday. The five others, including Strydom's wife, Monique,
were released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Strydoms embraced tightly and kissed as they were reunited
on the tarmac of Cebu's airport, where the luxurious Libyan
Ilyushin plane -- formerly used by Russian President Boris Yeltsin --
waited.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy,'' Monique said after seeing her husband. ''But
I'm very sad for all the other men who weren't released.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hostages had been held four months after being
captured at the Malaysian diving resort of Sipadan. Six foreigners
and 12 Filipinos remain in the hands of the Muslim rebels, known as
Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
   Tharwat Moarbes, whose Lebanese-French daughter Marie was among
those released, thanked Gadhafi for his help and expressed hope the
other hostages would also be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very happy that Gadhafi has brought back my daughter. God
willing he will bring the remaining'' hostages, she told reporters
after arriving in Libya from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Gadhafi International Association for Charitable
Organizations, a group run by Gadhafi's son Seif el-Islam that led
negotiations, promised to continue efforts for the release of the
remaining hostages ''as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya has long-standing ties with Muslim rebels in the mostly
Catholic Philippines and has helped negotiate in previous
kidnappings. It has helped build schools and mosques in the
impoverished south, but has also been accused of training rebels
from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the larger Muslim rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
   The freed hostages' trip to Libya is officially voluntary. But
it is widely believed that their governments agreed to the visit in
exchange for Libya's help in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A huge festival is believed to be under preparation for them
here, and officials from Germany, France and South Africa were
among the expected guests. But Libyan officials were refusing
comment Monday on their welcome plans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gadhafi handed over two Libyan government officials
who were suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people. The United Nations
responded by suspending international economic sanctions. Since
then, Gadhafi has been welcoming foreign politicians and
businesspeople to Libya and appearing at regional summits at which
he portrays himself as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   Those released by the rebels also include Frenchwomen Sonia
Wendling and Maryse Burgot and German Werner Wallert.
</P>
<P>
   Burgot was among three French journalists who came to the rebel
camp to interview the hostages last month. The two other French
journalists remained held along with 12 Filipino Christian
evangelists who had come to pray for the captives.
</P>
<P>
   The five other released captives were among 21 people kidnapped
from the Malaysian resort April 23.

<HEADLINE> Husband sues hospital for wrongful death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Genesee Hospital has been sued for $1
million after an emergency room physician diagnosed a woman's
damaged aorta as muscular-skeletal pain.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court jury in Rochester gave the award to Steven
Stewart, who sued the hospital for the wrongful death of his
30-year-old wife, Donna Stewart, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Stewart, of Walworth, Wayne County, was at a restaurant
with friends when she began having severe back pain, high blood
pressure and restlessness.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where a physician
suspected muscular-skeletal pain, ordered tests that showed
negative results, and discharged her after a sedative relieved some
of her pain.
</P>
<P>
   She died 10 minutes after her discharge when her aorta ruptured.
An autopsy revealed that her pain had been caused when her aorta, a
major artery that carries blood from the heart, began splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors awarded $1,063,000 for her loss of income, household
services, parental guidance to the couple's two sons, and pain and
suffering, said the family's lawyer, David L. Murphy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Huddling With Egypt Leader  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Seeking to avoid a blowup if Israel and the
Palestinians fail to meet a mid-September deadline for a
settlement, President Clinton briefly visited Egypt Tuesday to
enlist the help of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, long
considered a reliable intermediary between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the time is short,'' Clinton said before beginning his
early morning session with Mubarak. ''I think that all the parties
understand that without the leadership and support of Egypt they
will not be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Mubarak met for just over an hour in a lavishly
appointed room at the Cairo airport. They made no remarks after
their meeting ended and Mubarak escorted Clinton to his plane.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said before the meeting that he is optimistic that
Israel and the Palestinians can reach an agreement by next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to do our best to find a resolution to the
problem in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians,''
Mubarak said. ''We are making some consultations where we could
help the two parties to reach a framework which is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped in Cairo for less than three hours at the end of
a four-day African tour. He hoped the Egyptian leader could help
break a deadlock over the future of Jerusalem, the key obstacle to
an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Mubarak has been critical to this process for 20
years now, certainly all the time that I've been here. So we are
going to work together to see if we can find a way to help the
parties get over this next big hump,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly at least, the Egyptians have indicated they would not
try to force concessions from Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader
whose demand for sovereignty over East Jerusalem helped cause the
collapse of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp
David in July.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mubarak has apparently tried to persuade Arafat to
shelve his threat to declare Palestinian statehood unilaterally if
negotiations with Israel failed to provide that dividend by Sept.
13, the deadline set by the two sides. Arafat met with Egyptian
officials Saturday in Alexandria, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to Cairo came at the end of an African tour
during which he encouraged democratic advances in Nigeria and
negotiations to end seven years of civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's inconceivable we could have a peace between the Israelis
and Palestinians without the support of President Mubarak,''
Clinton said Saturday as he began a two-day visit far down the
continent in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you should read too much into it,'' Clinton said
at the time of the Mubarak session, ''other than that we are
working with a sense of urgency given the timetable the parties
have set for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said he doesn't expect
''decisive action'' from the Mubarak meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I hope will be furthered by this is the process by which
we can work with the Egyptians to try to get the parties closer
together,'' he told reporters aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presided over the failed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
at Camp David, in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, and has since
pledged to do whatever he can to help the two sides along.
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided to visit Mubarak in Egypt because Mubarak was
not planning to attend next month's United Nations Millennium
summit in New York, where Clinton is expected to make a broad push
to renew Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 13 deadline falls about a week after the U.N. summit.
</P>
<P>
   The talks to end a half-century of hostility broke down over the
fate of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as holy.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush,
speaking via satellite to the annual convention of B'nai B'rith
International in Washington, renewed his promise to support moving
the U.S. Embassy from outside Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, ''the city
Israel has chosen as its capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised America's ''special relationship'' with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''My support for Israel is not conditioned upon the outcome of
the peace process,'' Bush said. ''America's special relationship
with Israel precedes the peace process. Israel's adversaries should
know that in my administration the special relationship will
continue even if they cannot bring themselves to make peace with
the Jewish state.''

<HEADLINE> Logistics Chiefs Often Go Unnoticed  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNEMUCCA, Nev. (AP) -- It's a Friday afternoon, and Mike Whalen
expects he'll be packing up and heading for Montana by morning. Or
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no clue. It may change on us,'' Whalen said. ''Right
now the heavy action is in Montana but in a few days it could be
California.''
</P>
<P>
   He does know that when he goes, wherever he goes, his worries
will be less about flames and smoke than about water and ice.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen is one of the logistics chiefs who organize the vast
firefighting effort. The details he must tend to go almost beyond
comprehension -- everything from supplies, equipment, transportation
and fuel to sleeping arrangements, showers, kitchen units and
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to make sure the outhouses are downwind from the
kitchen and make sure the guy who services the outhouses doesn't
come to pump them out at dinner time,'' he said. ''There's just a
lot of odds and ends to keep the crews functional.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, by the time a logistics officer gets involved,
the fire has escaped the initial attack and gone beyond the local
crew's ability to deal with it. Manpower is running short and
supplies shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first time they realize they are in over their
head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It means telephone calls in the middle of the night and a
quickly packed bag to jump a flight to who knows where. The latest
comes from interagency fire officials in Boise who were organizing
a new area command team in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''Logistics seems to be the thing killing everybody. Right now
supplies nationwide are being drawn down at an incredible rate,''
said Whalen, a fire ecologist for the Bureau of Land Management in
Winnemucca whose biggest assignment to date has been the 1988 fires
at Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's worse than 1988,'' he said. ''Right now, we are begging
and borrowing and stealing to get whatever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   First-aid kits, radios and other communication equipment are
among the things they are running out of fast. When the
government-issue equipment is gone, the horse trading begins.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen remembers when Marines were sent in from Camp Pendleton
in Southern California to help with the fires at Yellowstone 12
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't have any cold-weather gear and it would get down
to 20 degrees at night,'' he said. ''It got to the point I was
trading hand tools and radio kits for sleeping bags and ground
pads.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, local caterers have to be called on sometimes to meet
the food demands of a large fire team.
</P>
<P>
   ''A local caterer who is used to doing weddings and receptions
can get overwhelmed when they try to feed 300 people out in the
desert 60 miles off the pavement,'' Whalen said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of a logistics chief's job involves the little things not
apparent on the front lines, like deciding who gets to eat first
and scheduling transportation of crews and equipment, water
supplies and hand tools.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't carry the tools with the crews. Metal and bodies
don't mix when you have a wreck,'' Whalen said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fires attract crews in excess of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time you get to 2,000 or 2,500 people you are managing
several camps and two or three kitchen units and a number of
medical units,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get a city of 2,000 people, you sure enough are going
to get upset stomachs, flu and some bad toothaches besides the
normal fire-line injuries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back in 1985 when we were in Custer County, Idaho, we had a
saying that we were the biggest city in the county -- and all of our
people were employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Command chiefs are only supposed to work 12- to 14-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want you to get rest so you are reasonably cognizant,''
he said. ''But this year, there have been a lot of 16-, 17-,
18-hour shifts, especially at the initial stages of a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a double command team is sent in to work two shifts,
around the clock. But in many cases, it's not possible to fight
fires in the dark, especially in ''steep country, when it's burning
in timber and you can't see the snakes coming as it burns
through.''
</P>
<P>
   A Northern California native who grew up near Red Bluff and
Susanville, Whalen got his start as a seasonal firefighter for the
California Division of Forestry in 1967. He's been in the business
ever since, having moved to the BLM in Winnemucca in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Married for 26 years, he has four children -- three of whom are
in the business. One is a dispatcher in Salt Lake City, one mans an
engine with the Forest Service in the Humboldt-Toiyabe National
Forest in Markleeville, Calif., and another works in ground and
supply support.
</P>
<P>
   He first became interested in logistics when he was fighting a
fire in California and complained to his boss about a shortage of
supplies getting to the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   His boss said he had a solution -- volunteering Whalen for
logistics training.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of a thankless job in a lot of ways because when
things go right nobody notices but when things go wrong, you know
right where the breakdown occurred,'' Whalen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of the fire operation, you can blame the weather, the
fuels, the topography, the fire behavior-type stuff. But logistics,
you know right where the problem is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ''there's some good satisfaction when you
feel you've pulled another one off.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's known for making huge purchases of supplies and
ordering them on a minute's notice, Whalen said his wife does most
of the shopping at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a Costco card but I hardly ever use it. I hate to go
to Costco and stand in line to save $6.''

<HEADLINE> Weatherman Uses High-Tech Approach  </HEADLINE>
By VANIA GRANDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   O'NEIL BASIN, Nev. (AP) -- When Mike Smith rouses himself from
bed at 5 a.m. each day, he begins one of the least recognized and
most important jobs in the modern fire camp: telling crews how much
danger they are likely to face, in time for them to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran meteorologist, Smith monitors weather patterns and
alerts firefighters of sudden wind shifts or random thunderstorms
that could whip up flames and throw their lives into peril.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are the only weather person on the fire so it's not like
there's anyone else to lay the blame on if the forecast goes bad,''
said Smith, a senior meteorologist for the National Weather
Service. ''They don't go to the weather office ... they come to me,
because I'm responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is one of 36 meteorologists in the United States qualified
to work at wildfires. Twenty-five of them are now on the front
lines at blazes raging across the West.
</P>
<P>
   The typical fire meteorologist is a computer whiz who can set up
a satellite dish, download weather models and then spend the night
in a dusty tent in the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Smith puts in 14- to 16-hour days, stays away from home for
weeks at a time but still calls his job sedentary compared to that
of the firefighters who trek out to the flames to dig for hours in
sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''You take the position knowing this will be part of your job,''
Smith said from his makeshift office in an abandoned ranch house 25
miles southeast of Jackpot, Nev., where fires blackened more than
31,000 acres of sagebrush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think most people know what they are getting into,
though,'' said Smith, a 38-year-old from Sacramento, Calif., who
has spent 10 years chasing fires. ''They don't realize they can be
called up at any time during the summer and that they will be
sleeping in a tent. It's not like back at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's day starts at 5 a.m. Within minutes, he has turned on
his laptop, set on an old chest in what was the abandoned ranch's
master bedroom and linked to a satellite dish outside.
</P>
<P>
   He checks the latest forecast and heads to a 6 a.m. briefing,
where he tells planning chiefs what's in store.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that they are making decisions based on my forecasts
and that feels good,'' Smith said. ''That's why incident
meteorologists like their jobs, because we know when we are here
what we do is important.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that at home too, but you are more removed,'' he said.
''You don't really see the results.''
</P>
<P>
   At 33 minutes past every hour, Smith receives a three-megabyte
packet of compressed data from weather service headquarters in Salt
Lake City, which feeds into his computer in 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A special program unzips the files and arranges them so they can
be interpreted. The data include infrared satellite pictures of
water vapor, high and low pressure systems, temperatures, wind
speed and direction.
</P>
<P>
   The most potentially dangerous element at a wildfire is wind,
Smith said. And if an image of a brewing thunderstorm pops up, he
starts worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get 30 to 40 mph downdrafts with a thunderstorm and they
could blow the fire in an unexpected way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Smith would run over to communications and get a
message out to the 450 men and women battling the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the firefighters work with their heads down, and they
are not paying attention to what is around them,'' Smith said. ''It
would be my job to alert them.''
</P>
<P>
   Making sure the message reaches them quickly is the main reason
Smith is on the scene rather than in an office in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the incident commander saw something was going on it might
take him an hour to get hold of the nearest weather station,
whereas he can just walk up to me and say, 'Hey, what's going
on?''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Being here also allows Smith to see the fire firsthand and
determine how the terrain, such as canyons that channel winds, are
affecting local weather.
</P>
<P>
   Besides satellite images, Smith uses a handheld radio to call a
remote weather station set up about five miles from camp. He'll
hear a computerized voice read the local temperature, wind speed
and humidity. Or he can drive out to the solar-powered station,
plug in his laptop and retrieve several days' worth of data.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the old days, weather data came in only twice a day via
shortwave radio and it rolled out on a huge printer rather than
downloading into a computer. If you missed it, that was it for
another 12 hours, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the new equipment has helped forecasters fine-tune
their predictions, the high-tech stuff doesn't always work in the
bush.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remembers when a mountain blocked the satellite or someone
leaned on the dish, throwing it out of whack. Other times,
headquarters accidentally cut off his data or the computer crashed.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, the weatherman relies on older equipment such as
the theodolite -- a 1940s gadget, no longer in production, that uses
a helium balloon and trigonometry to determine wind speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''You learn to be creative,'' Smith said. ''You can't just click
a button and have the data come up on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the method, the fire meteorologist's goal is to get the
forecast right.
</P>
<P>
   While other wild-lands firefighters may be thrilled by the sound
of rain beating on their tent at night, Smith's joy is qualified:
''Only if I forecast it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nader's Veep: Running To Help Poor  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK HOWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE EARTH INDIAN RESERVATION, Minn. (AP) -- While sweeping the
floors in her remote log home, Winona LaDuke stops, jabs her finger
in the air and proclaims: ''I'll definitely do a housecleaning when
I get to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ralph Nader's vice presidential running mate breaks into
laughter at her declaration. Sound bites just aren't her style.
</P>
<P>
   An author, activist and farmer, LaDuke lives in a lakeside home
on a dead-end gravel road in a part of northwest Minnesota where
the prairie gives way to the north woods.
</P>
<P>
   The Ojibwe woman also ran with Nader in 1996. The two Harvard
graduates spent mere thousands and received 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they will be on the ballot in at least 45 states.
They're aiming to spend millions and are talking about winning.
</P>
<P>
   To those who say victory is impossible, LaDuke points to the win
by another unlikely politician from her home state: former
professional wrestler, now Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The Nader-LaDuke campaign has been drawing support of up to 6
percent in some national polls. In California, Nader's support was
as high as 8 percent earlier this month, before dropping to 4
percent in the most recent Field Poll.
</P>
<P>
   David Gillespie, professor at Presbyterian College in Clinton,
S.C., and an expert on third-party politics, says LaDuke
complements the background of Nader, the famous consumer advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needed a person who represented a more multicultural
perspective,'' Gillespie says.
</P>
<P>
   LaDuke, 41, says she is campaigning to help the poor and protect
the environment. She wants to see a constitutional amendment, based
on Indian tradition, that would require all governmental decisions
to be examined with regard to their impact on people seven
generations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to campaign at least part of every week. But when
she's on reservations, she will be making a soft sell.
</P>
<P>
   American Indians vote at rates lower than their roughly 2
percent share of the general population. Some view voting as a sign
of acceptance of federal authority over sovereign tribes. It's a
view her own husband, a leader of a Michigan tribe, shares.
</P>
<P>
   LaDuke's life and career are rooted in American Indian concerns
and she's blunt about the problems facing her community. ''Every
social and economic statistic you don't want to have, we have,''
she laments.
</P>
<P>
   But she also hopes her effort will not be seen only as a
''racially based ethnic campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Los Angeles to a Jewish mother and an American
Indian father. Her grandmother was an early union organizer.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Ashland, Ore., where she placed second in the
state as a high school debater. At 18, she made a presentation
before the United Nations on U.S. energy policy and Indian lands.
After working on causes on other reservations, she came to White
Earth, home to her own family's tribe, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   She took a job as principal at a tribal high school and quickly
became involved in a lawsuit to recover lands taken from the tribe
by the federal government and the logging industry. White Earth is
larger than Rhode Island, but the tribe owns less than 10 percent
of the reservation land.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the suit, LaDuke founded the nonprofit White Earth
Land Recovery Project, which has so far repurchased 1,300 acres of
the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   LaDuke says she is ''not inclined'' toward electoral politics
and hasn't run for any elected offices other than the vice
presidency. Still, she has shown a willingness to play the game.
When Dan Quayle had trouble spelling potato in 1992, LaDuke made
speeches in which she spelled it for him -- in Ojibwe.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Thayer, a political supporter and a member of the same
religious lodge, says LaDuke is skilled at communicating American
Indian themes and concerns to nonnative audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''She blossoms in the public eye,'' says Thayer. ''She's got
that bicultural skill, which is rare in Indian country.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indians have held few national elective posts, but
there is precedent for LaDuke's ambitions. Charles Curtis, a vice
president under Herbert Hoover, was Kaw Indian.
</P>
<P>
   LaDuke describes herself as a ''mother-of-three,
parent-of-many'' and questions how ''men of privilege'' can be
expected to rule judiciously. She argues ''there is no real quality
of life in America until there is quality of life in the poorest
regions of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Can she and Nader win? Gillespie says no, but adds that the
ticket is positioned to tap into a large body of voters looking for
an alternative to the two main parties. Says Gillespie: ''The Nader
ticket, far more than the Reform Party, is certainly the game in
town to watch this year.''
</P>
<P>
   LaDuke says she and Nader will win ''if the largest faction of
this election -- those who don't usually vote -- vote for us.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Challenging Bush in Florida  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Al Gore looks at Florida and sees lots
of senior citizens, Jewish people and rural voters whose families
have voted Democratic for generations.
</P>
<P>
   And he sees a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential rival George W. Bush sees an
opportunity, too. The state has voted Republican recently,
including electing his brother, Jeb, as governor.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those family ties -- and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's
popularity -- Texas Gov. Bush isn't taking Florida for granted,
partly because Gore isn't writing off the nation's fourth-largest
state and its 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore met with elderly Floridians Monday, less than 10 blocks
from the governor's home, the latest indication that Gore thinks
spending time trying to win votes here isn't a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the state, where one out of every four people is at
least 60 years old, to talk about something seniors say is of vital
importance -- the cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed having Medicare pay the cost of prescription
medicines for many seniors, and wants to spend $253 billion over 10
years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed providing the same benefit, but won't issue
details until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also was in Tallahassee when he secured his party's
nomination in March. And at the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles, Florida was chosen as the state to give Gore the
needed number of votes to put him over the top for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit Monday was his second to the state in a week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, wife Tipper is scheduled to tour a Tampa health care
center and meet with patients and administrators before appearing
in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not writing any state off,'' Gore said after meeting the
seniors Monday. ''There are probably a few that are Republican,
I'll have to admit, but Florida is not in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florida is a state where I am going to fight hard with
everything I've got, right up to the night of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has taken notice of that. The Texas governor
was in Florida last week, raising money in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush promised that his brother will be back, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be a tough fight, it'll be intense,'' he added Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush returns, his surrogate will be here later in the
week. Running mate Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne will meet with
students, parents and educators in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm
Beach on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate only
once in the last 20 years, going for President Clinton in 1996.
Bush's father carried the state in 1992 and 1988, and Ronald Reagan
won the state twice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interesting thing is, because Republicans have done well
here at the top of the ticket, people forget this is still a
Democratic state in registration,'' said Randy Enwright, a
political consultant and adviser to the Bush campaign in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But barely. Registered Democrats only outnumber Republicans 3.6
million to 3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is always a swing state and you've got to look at it that
way and pay attention to it,'' said Enwright.
</P>
<P>
   That means paying attention to seniors, who vote heavily, as
Gore did Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And south Florida has a heavy Jewish population, 85 percent of
whom voted for Clinton in 1996. State Democratic Chairman Bob Poe
said Gore's Jewish running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, can
energize that Jewish base to enhance turnout. Gore brought
Lieberman with him last week to south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rural north Florida is the most conservative part of the state.
But while many voters there are lifelong Democrats, many actually
vote for Republicans more often than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they helped Jeb Bush give Republicans control of the
governor's office and both legislative chambers for the first time
in about a century.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeb Bush has been popular; Gore said he knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I know that he's not on the ballot,'' Gore said. ''The
governor of Florida is not running for president this year. I don't
think people are confused about that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who writes Florida off in one column or the other is
making a mistake,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Record-Tying Dry Spell Hits Texas  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CURRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- With not even a hint of rain to settle the dust
Monday, North Texas broke a record, going 59 days without moisture
-- longer than the dry spell during the Dust Bowl days of the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Lawns in Dallas-Fort Worth and beyond are burned, farmers and
ranchers have lost an estimated $595 million and reservoirs are
shrinking fast, even though rainfall for the year is close to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The dry spell began July 1. And the forecast doesn't hold a hint
of a sprinkle -- let alone a good gully washer -- in the week to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just keep pouring water on the yard, and it keeps turning
brown,'' said Molly Gneiting, who lives in the Fort Worth suburb of
North Richland Hills. ''Every morning I water the flowers. If I
miss just once, you can tell it by the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just dry; it's hot. Monday was the year's 36th day
of 100-degree temperatures in Dallas-Fort Worth. The record is 69
days, set in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like the middle of winter. Everything's brown,'' said
Rayford Pullen, agricultural extension agent for Montague County, a
largely agricultural area along the Red River.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Throckmorton, hundreds of volunteers spent their
vacations digging ditches for a pipeline to bring water from
another town because their own reservoir had fallen too low to
supply drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Hyde and her husband, Ted, bought their home at Lake
Arrowhead near Wichita Falls so their children and grandchildren
would have a place to swim and fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the cranes don't go out to fish anymore,'' she said.
''Every morning when we get up and look out, there is less and less
water.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we need is a good steady rain,'' said Polly Drozd, whose
family owns a marina on Lake Lewisville near Dallas, where the
water level has dropped 15 feet. ''Not just a day or two of rain,
but a real steady rain for a week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   But none is expected. ''Even the long-range forecast doesn't
look good,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist Mark Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Even cloud-seeding in hopes of bringing rain to the Texas
Panhandle was on hold -- there weren't any clouds to seed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 9th of August was the last time we've seen anything,''
said Shea Lea Clower, meteorologist for the ''precipitation
enhancement'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dust Bowl years were much worse.
</P>
<P>
   That previous record of 58 days without rain, set in 1934 and
tied in 1950, was only broken by one-one-hundredth of an inch of
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was terrible. It was a horrible time,'' said Bill Green, a
curator at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon. ''Dirt
drifted up and covered barbed-wire fences. Conditions were much
worse than they are today because we have learned a lot about soil
conservation in 70 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the dry spell, North Texas has received 21.19 inches
of rain since Jan. 1, only about an inch below normal, mostly
because of a wet June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's kind of an overstatement to compare it with the
Dust Bowl,'' Green said. ''We have periodic droughts. Everybody
worries, everybody prays. It rains, and everybody gets over it.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Plans Offer Campaign Drama  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns of Democrat Al Gore
and Republican George W. Bush are slinging ads and arithmetic at
each other in a battle over prescription drugs for the elderly. But
so far there's only one plan -- Gore's -- in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   With $5 million in commercials and a visit Monday to Floridians
struggling with their drug bills, Gore is jumping on the lack of
specificity in Bush's promise to support prescription drug coverage
for senior citizens -- a promise the Republican now says he will
flesh out next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan to attach a drug benefit to Medicare comes with
plenty of detail, including a $253 billion cost estimate, enough
for Republicans to tag it as another example of ''Hillary-care'' in
a swipe at the ambitious health care reforms explored under the
supervision of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A ''nationalized, catch-all, government-run, once-size-fits-all
plan,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer, who made the allusion to
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Republican ads attacking his Medicare drug
benefit, Gore said Bush should be ''presenting specifics so the
American people can make a judgment for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls give Gore a 2-to-1 advantage when voters are asked who
would do a better job dealing with health care and prescription
drug prices. And the elderly are more apt than younger people to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, policy director of AARP, which represents older
people, said drug costs are the leading concern of at least half of
the 12 million seniors his group represents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore has the advantage of having a plan,'' he said. ''You can
criticize the plan; it's not all that generous, frankly, and it's
also something that they've not gotten Congress to support yet. But
it's a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said Bush's alternative, emphasizing consumer choice,
would resemble that introduced in May by Sens. John Breaux, D-La.,
and Bill Frist, R-Tenn.: a sliding scale of government subsidies
for retirees choosing to purchase drug coverage from private
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor ... will make clear exactly which of those levels
he supports and how he'll do it,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself called the Breaux-Frist plan ''a blueprint for
success'' Monday while adding: ''I think we can make it even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would ensure that no one enrolled in it pays more
than $4,000 a year for drugs. The coverage foreseen in the
Breaux-Frist plan would pay half of drug costs after a $250
deductible, with an out-of-pocket cap of $6,000 a year for
enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would have the government pay all drug costs for the
poorest senior citizens. Most others would pay premiums starting at
$25 a month and rising to more than $40 a month over 10 years, and
they would also pay half the cost of the drugs out of pocket, up to
an annual cap.
</P>
<P>
   His plan is closely modeled on one offered this spring by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign resorted to a device already tried by Gore --
call it the per diem principle -- that involves belittling an
opponent's program by boiling it down to how much it would be worth
to someone per day. In that regard, Gore's plan would be worth 13
cents a day to the average senior citizen, who pays $673 a year for
drugs, the Bush campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the campaign at first said 5 cents a day but
miscalculated when dividing a number by two.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides use a higher figure for a senior citizen's average
drug costs, $1,100, which they say is more up to date than the 1996
estimate used by the Congressional Budget Office and cited by Bush.

<HEADLINE> Doctor's license lifted for 6 months  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An obstetrician's medical license was
temporarily suspended after he allegedly tried to sterilize a
22-year-old woman without her consent.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred after the woman had a baby delivered by
Caesarean section at ViaHealth of Wayne Hospital in Newark, on July
22, 1999, according to documents from the state Board of
Professional Medical Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   After he delivered the baby, Dr. Leonard J. Burman applied
surgical clamps to the woman's fallopian tubes and left them in
place three minutes, long enough to stop blood flow and cause
malfunction, the state said. The woman had not consented to being
sterilized, the board said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month suspension was effective Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Burman and his lawyer have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no evidence the tubes were clamped,'' Dan O'Brien,
Burman's lawyer said. ''He has had an unblemished record and has
provided excellent care to women of all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Professional Medical Conduct said it was not
revoking Burman's license because it believed the incident was ''a
momentary loss of control and lapse in good judgment'' in someone
who had been a good physician 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   He ''is a very skilled surgeon who had always taken excellent
care of his patients,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the alleged incident occurred, a social worker had told
Burman that the patient's three other children had been removed
from her custody and that the baby would be taken away when it was
born, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the planned C-section, Burman reportedly told the
social worker: ''Wouldn't it be a shame if the knife slipped?''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement to hospital administrators 11 days after
the C-section, Burman admitted saying the patient should be
sterilized because all her children were in foster care ''due to
sexual abuse,'' the state said. It was unclear who was involved in
the alleged abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Before the C-section, Burman had discussed a tubal ligation with
the patient but she refused, the state board said.

<HEADLINE> Western Residents Fear Lung Damage  </HEADLINE>
By BOB ANEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Katie Gray-Murphy spent the last weekend of
her summer vacation shuttered in her house, the windows closed
against a gray shroud of wildfire smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was no fires or smoke going on, I could go out and do
whatever I wanted,'' said the 15-year-old, who has lived with
asthma most of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Northern Rockies are cloaked in a stinky, dingy
cloud of wood smoke from wildfires that have burned millions of
acres this summer. In Helena, the shroud is often so dense Katie
must check the local air quality hot line before going for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read, watch TV or do chores,'' she said. ''It gets really
boring, just doing the same thing over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the smoke is more than boring -- it's a matter of
life and death. Each new day is a danger to those with existing
respiratory or cardiac problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people on the ragged edge of dying anyway, and this
kind of air could be the triggering cause,'' said John Coefield, a
meteorologist with the state Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have spawned a massive plume of smoke that extends the
500-mile breadth of Montana, east into the Dakotas and beyond. In
Des Moines, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources warned people
with respiratory problems to stay indoors Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer it lasts, the more people are going to be
affected,'' said Shannon Therriault, air quality specialist for the
Missoula City-County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   For Montana, the Big Sky is almost permanently gray over nearly
all the state's 145,000 square miles. A blend of wind and
temperatures can change the haze into air pungent with the smell of
burning wood and laced with ash that leaves a dusting on cars
parked overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities and towns in the Bitterroot Valley have had air
considered so hazardous that everyone is urged to avoid any
strenuous activities outdoors. The elderly, children and those with
breathing or heart problems are told to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said pharmacies are reporting runs on inhalers,
used by asthmatics and others with respiratory problems. Some
stores are selling two or three times what they normally do this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   The data backs up the fear: While a typical summer day would
measure a pollution level of 30 micrograms or less per cubic meter
of air, Missoula has reached 500 micrograms during the worst
smokestorms.
</P>
<P>
   Darby, a small town near the heart of the Bitterroot's worst
fires, has measured pollution at 750 micrograms -- 25 times more
polluted than normal for August.
</P>
<P>
   Lungs compensate for smoke by constricting, reducing air flow
and causing blood pressure to rise -- putting an added strain on the
heart, said Dr. Michael Spence, the state's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're subjected to a lot of smoke for long periods of
time, you can have headaches, nausea, dizziness,'' said Judy
Griffin, public health nursing director in Ravalli County, one of
the hardest hit areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin fears that although public health officials have not
seen a large number of patients in trouble due to the smoke, the
long-term damage won't be known for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down the road, I wouldn't be surprised to see people -- even
with healthy lungs -- to have problem with coughing and mucous,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Loehnen, a pulmonary disease specialist in Missoula,
said people should use common sense in deciding when to go
outdoors. ''Be prudent,'' he said. ''Even if you're healthy, you
shouldn't be exercising in air like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Loehnen expects no long-term adverse effects on residents'
health due to the smoke because lungs have the ability to recover
once clean air is breathed again -- but that may not be possible
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   With some fires expected to burn until the winter snows arrive,
smoke could be around for a long time to come, said Dan Powers,
environmental health director for the Butte-Silver Bow County
Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until Mother Nature comes around and provides us with some
relief,'' he said, ''we're going to be stuck in this pattern for
several more weeks, if not into October.''

<HEADLINE> OIC's Ray Defends Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Granting that the nation is tired of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, independent counsel Robert W. Ray wrote in
an op-ed piece Tuesday that his decision to impanel a new grand
jury to consider criminal charges against President Clinton was not
partisan and was done to speed the case to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, writing in The Washington Post, said forming the grand jury
''now rather than later'' was done to prevent the matter from
hanging over the head of the next president. Waiting, he said,
''would have prevented me from resolving this case promptly after
the president leaves office, something I promised I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the new grand jury was first reported by The Associated
Press two weeks ago on the day of Vice President Al Gore's
presidential nomination acceptance speech, prompting Democrats to
complain that Ray's motives were political in this election season.
The grand jury was impaneled July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ray had said at the time that the disclosure actually was a
setback to his investigation. In the op-ed piece, he noted that his
office had been condemned for the leak when in fact it was later
revealed that a Democratically appointed judge was the source of
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many who so quickly rushed to judgment realized their error
and have now reconsidered their evaluation of this office, for
which I am grateful,'' Ray wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he would be faithful to his oath to carry out the job
of deciding whether Clinton committed perjury or other crimes
responsibly and fairly, and without partisan concerns. He said no
decision about whether to ask the grand jury to return an
indictment had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am bound by the oath I took to consider whether criminal
charges should be brought against the president once he leaves
office, weary though the country may be of the subject. ...
Resolution of these matters must not be left to hang over the next
president's term, to his or the nation's detriment,'' Ray wrote.
''Continuing the criminal process by impaneling a grand jury cannot
credibly be dismissed as a partisan endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the public eventually will accept that the decision to
come will be made in the right way and for the right reasons,'' Ray
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Report on Value of National Forests  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National forests are far more valuable for
their recreation, wildlife and water quality than for timber,
minerals and cattle grazing, according to a report released Tuesday
by the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The forests are worth an estimated $234 billion and generate 2.9
million jobs from recreation, fish and wildlife, water quality and
wild areas, according to an economic consulting firm that prepared
the report for the Sierra Club, which opposes commercial logging in
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the nation's 192 million acres of federal forests
generate $23 billion and 407,000 jobs from timber, mining, grazing
and other uses, said the firm, ECONorthwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leaving trees standing in most cases can contribute far more
to local state and national economies than logging,'' said Ernie
Niemi, a co-author of the report and an economist at the Eugene,
Ore., firm.
</P>
<P>
   A timber industry official challenged the report, saying the
Forest Service can allow logging in forests and still produce
benefits from recreation, water quality and fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make sure we're balancing all the values of all the
goods and services these forests provide,'' said Chris West of the
Northwest Forestry Association in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The ECONorthwest study relies on a 1995 Forest Service analysis
to conclude that recreation in forests would contribute $108
billion to the national economy and 2.6 million jobs by 2000. The
same analysis concluded that fish and wildlife in forests would
provide $14 billion and 330,000 jobs by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service analysis also predicted timber would generate
$4 billion for the economy and 76,000 jobs by 2000, and that
minerals, grazing and other activities would generate $19 billion
and 331,000 jobs, the ECONorthwest report said.
</P>
<P>
   ECONorthwest used a Forest Service study from this year to
estimate that water in national forests is worth $4 billion. The
firm used the findings of a limited study by some Forest Service
economists from 1997 to estimate that unroaded, wild areas have a
value equal to recreation on forest lands, or $108 billion.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Kills Mideast Man  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An 84-year-old man died this week of
complications from the West Nile virus -- the same virus that hit
the New York City area this summer -- health officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite newspaper headlines and long reports on the radio,
officials tried to calm fears. Experts noted that the virus is
common in this region, and most Israelis have developed immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, five people have been diagnosed with West Nile
virus this year, all 63 years old or older, officials say. The
virus killed seven people and sickened more than 60 in the New York
City area last year.
</P>
<P>
   Severe infections of West Nile virus can result in encephalitis,
an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the
brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   While downplaying the severity in Israel, officials are taking
steps to stop the spread. The Health Ministry said it is working
with local authorities to increase spraying against mosquitoes,
which carry the disease to humans after biting infected birds.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Ministry workers destroyed a flock of 3,000 infected
geese at a farm in the center of the country Monday, said the
director of the ministry's veterinary services, Dr. Oded Nir. He
said farm-grown flocks are immunized, but it is much more difficult
to deal with free birds. Israel is on a main bird migration route.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fatality, ''there is no cause for concern,'' Heath
Ministry spokesman Yoram Malka told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Eitan Rubinstein, director of the infectious disease
department at Sheba Hospital outside Tel Aviv, where the man died,
said West Nile disease usually causes mild flu-like symptoms and
clears up by itself in a few days, leaving lifelong immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry said two residents of Tel Aviv were
diagnosed with serious complications from the virus last year.
Rubinstein said that ''more than one died, for certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Older immigrants to Israel are more vulnerable. The elderly and
infirm are at risk of developing complications, like encephalitis
and meningitis, said Dr. Alex Levental, director of public health
services at the Health Ministry.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are mostly lower in early trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average is down 28 points in today's early
going. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 7-5 lead
over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is down one point and the Standard &AMP;

</P>
<P>
   The market has a couple of modest negatives hanging over it in
the news department. AT&AMP;T warned that third quarter earnings will
be lower than expected because of a faster consolidation of Excite
At Home results. On the technology side, Intel has stopped
shipments of its fastest chip because of a flaw.
</P>
<P>
   The market will get a double-dose of economic news in the coming
minutes. That will be consumer confidence from the Conference
Board, and new home sales for July.

<HEADLINE> CBS Plans O.J. Simpson Miniseries  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Six years ago this summer, O.J. Simpson was a
defendant in the most-watched murder case in American history.
Viewers sat glued to their TV sets as the saga unfolded in what
would be dubbed the Trial of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a TV miniseries is reproducing the experience and exposing
audiences to what they didn't see during the yearlong trial:
behind-the-scenes battles and strategy sessions by the defense
''dream team'' which won Simpson's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   It will air on CBS in November unless O.J. Simpson is able to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson sent his lawyers to court this month seeking a
preliminary injunction to halt production on ''American Tragedy.''
So far, his 11th-hour legal bid has been futile. A judge refused to
issue an injunction, saying he'd look at the script and revisit the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, production will be completed by the time Simpson's
suit gets back to court on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   What is this movie and why does Simpson want to shut it down?
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the soundstage in North Hollywood is an adventure in
deja vu. Actors bear an eerie resemblance to Marcia Clark, Robert
Shapiro and Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, among others. The
courtroom where the case was tried has been duplicated in every
detail including floral arrangements that often decorated the
judge's bench.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding hand behind the production is Lawrence Schiller, who
wrote the book ''American Tragedy'' with James Willwerth based on
information from his ''mole'' on the defense team, lawyer Robert
Kardashian.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller is directing from a script written by Pulitzer
Prize-winner Norman Mailer, and he has assembled a top notch cast
headed by Ving Rhames as Johnnie Cochran Jr., Christopher Plummer
as F. Lee Bailey and Ron Silver as Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller, who collaborated with Simpson on a jailhouse book, ''I
Want to Tell You,'' recently directed another miniseries from his
book ''Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' a recounting of the Jon
Benet Ramsey murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson
Defense,'' published in 1996, was controversial from the start:
Lawyers felt it invaded Simpson's attorney-client privilege of
confidentiality. Eight members of the defense filed affidavits last
week saying they had been misled into giving interviews to
Schiller. But the author's lawyers pointed out that no one took
legal action until the miniseries was nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller says neither Simpson nor anyone else was promised prior
approval on the book or script. Cochran and Shapiro have met with
the actors portraying them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This story isn't about O.J. Simpson. It's about the lawyers,''
Schiller said in an interview. ''The public doesn't know what took
place behind closed doors, how the defense dealt with the evidence,
how they pushed the envelope in the court system. To me, that is
more interesting than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a Simpson ''body double'' sits at the counsel table
during filming of court sessions, his is not a speaking role. A
Simpson voice is occasionally heard on an intercom talking to his
lawyers during their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Segments of actual trial footage will be seen in the miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   The actors have spent many hours immersing themselves in trial
history, reading books and watching hours of trial videotape. Most
of them were avid fans of the televised trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I watched the trial. It was the hottest show in
town,'' said Plummer. ''One is not particularly proud of having
watched it. It was sort of the fascination of watching a snake.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actor, who recently played Mike Wallace in the movie,
''the Insider,'' said the chance to play the legendary F. Lee
Bailey was irresistible, and he found the miniseries much more than
''a ghastly replay of the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about the defense team and the quite amazing ego
challenges involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of playing Bailey included a physical
transformation for Plummer, whose body was padded and his face
altered by a rubber mask.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a wonderful character,'' said Plummer. ''He represents
the high-flown old school of lawyering, the old man, the
curmudgeon. I'm sure he loves his drink and I do too, so I
sympathize.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Silver, who bears a striking resemblance to Shapiro, added
thick eyebrows and shaved a bald spot on the back of his head.
Silver has met with Shapiro more than once but said the lawyer
claims never to have read Schiller's book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've read Bob's book and I've talked to other people about
him,'' said Silver, who concluded that Shapiro laid the groundwork
for a brilliant defense but was forced to the sidelines by others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the trial started, he became quite marginalized,'' said
Silver. ''Everyone had their agendas. But his obligation to his
client kept him there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the movie hews to the book, it will not take a position on
whether Simpson was truly innocent of the murders of his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson was
acquitted in criminal court and later found liable in civil court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what the truth is,'' both Plummer and Silver said
separately. But one cast member said he became convinced that truth
was never the aim.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing about the search for the truth is laughable,'' said
Bruno Kirby, who plays attorney Barry Scheck. ''In a courtroom,
it's about winning. Both sides are there to win ... I hope this
(movie) makes people look at the system and see that it needs
work.''

   AN ACTOR'S TALE: ''Becoming Dick,'' E! Entertainment

Williams, Robert Wagner and Elizabeth Berkley. Bob Saget, who

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Smiling Fish'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a movie which, for all its locker-room language, is an
ode to sweetness, decency, kinship and the idealization of romance.
</P>
<P>
   The oddly yet logically titled ''Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire''
is a smallish film with a heart the size of ''Wy-boring,'' the
screenwriters' appellation for Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The movie centers on two orphaned, twentysomething brothers
(played by siblings Derick and Steven Martini, who co-wrote the
script), Los Angeles housemates who share advice and commiseration
over their messy love lives.
</P>
<P>
   Each bears a nickname handed down in infancy by their
half-Italian, half-American Indian grandmother. Blond, carefree
Tony Remi (Steven Martini) was born grinning, so he was dubbed
''Smiling Fish.'' Dark-haired, brooding Chris Remi (Derick Martini)
was born with a migraine, earning him the epithet ''Goat on Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris' lady troubles involve longtime sweetheart Alison (Amy
Hathaway), who weeps during sex then bites his head off for asking
what's up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wanton, wandering Tony takes a toaster in the head,
hurled by a girlfriend who discovers him in bed with two other
women. His philandering ends when he meets endearing mail carrier
Kathy (Christa Miller) and her adorable, outspoken young daughter
(Nicole Ray).
</P>
<P>
   While Tony is taken with the idea of instant family, Chris meets
two pivotal new people: Clive (jazz singer Bill Henderson) is a
dying curmudgeon who imparts to Chris his theory of ''magnetic
perfection,'' the harmony that resonates when soul mates find each
other.
</P>
<P>
   And with Clive's notion fresh in his head, Chris takes up with
the sweet, exotic Anna (Rosemarie Addeo), a gorgeous Italian
visiting Los Angeles to care for animals on movie sets.
</P>
<P>
   While it's clear there's magnetic perfection in the air for the
brothers, both must face roadblocks and make decisions about where
they're headed, and with whom.
</P>
<P>
   Though their parents died years earlier, the brothers have never
cut the ties to each other. They have built a comfortable nest, and
the time has come to decide if either should flee it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it sounds gay, but my older brother's always been my
best friend,'' says Smiling Fish.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the film is rather naturalistic, laced with
affectionate expletives and a lot of fairly unmemorable dialogue.
What's memorable in ''Smiling Fish,'' as in life, is the feeling
behind the words. There's a sense of deep caring and understanding
behind what transpires among the brothers, their new women and the
rascally Clive.
</P>
<P>
   The low-light, low-tech style of this indie film directed by the
Martinis' pal Kevin Jordan lends a sense of grainy intimacy and
immediacy. ''Smiling Fish'' is pure charm, with nothing more than
the melodrama of ordinary lives hitting ordinary crossroads to
propel it.
</P>
<P>
   There are winsome performances all around, ''just-folks'' acting
that appeals in the way the gratifying gab of a close friend
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The characters' familiarity, their honorable natures and their
different takes on hopefulness make this little ensemble of good
people worth checking out.
</P>
<P>
   The movie picked up the Discovery Award given to new talent at
last year's Toronto Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire,'' released by Stratosphere
Entertainment, runs 92 minutes. It is rated R for language, sexual
content and brief drug use.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Whipped'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, guys, if Amanda Peet is your dream girl, be afraid. Be very
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Peet, co-star of the WB television series ''Jack &AMP; Jill'' and
Bruce Willis' hired-gun protege in ''The Whole Nine Yards,''
delivers a viciously gleeful twist on male-female relations in the
gutsy sex comedy ''Whipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by first-timer Peter Cohen, ''Whipped'' is
a caustic, raunchy, often hilarious examination of how men use
women, and how easy it is for a determined female to do the same to
a passel of self-centered males.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Swingers'' style, three New York City pals share tales of
romantic conquests and advice on scamming women into sex. There's
Wall Street cad Brad (Peet's real-life boyfriend Brian Van Holt),
pretentious Bohemian Zeke (Zorie Barber) and sensitive geek
Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams), who tends to end up alone with his
collection of hand-lotion helpers instead of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Joining them is married guy Eric (Judah Domke), who takes
voyeuristic pleasure listening to his single friends' weekly bull
sessions. When he was single, Eric was part of the scamming team as
the guy who would ''jump on the grenade'' -- take the less
attractive woman so his friends could score with the prettier ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''And then I married the grenade,'' Eric says. ''I pulled her
pin.''
</P>
<P>
   One week, each of the threesome has a surprise to tell. It seems
each has met someone truly special: Zeke, a woman with artsy film
tastes that match his own; Brad, a woman fascinated by his
financial acumen; and Jonathan, a woman who shares his passion for
solo sex.
</P>
<P>
   But they soon learn that each has fallen for Mia (Peet), who
handily deals with audience incredulity over the coincidence by
expressing her own disbelief that three best friends could wind up
with the same woman in a city the size of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's ribald, razor-sharp script ultimately unravels a more
wicked, willful explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brad, Zeke and Jonathan opt to continue dating Mia,
who professes to like all three and makes each one feel that he's
got the inside track to outlast the others.
</P>
<P>
   Even hapless Eric, lamenting the bad blood that tears apart the
weekly male-bonding gatherings he cherishes, gets caught up in the
love-hate fest that Mia evokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's got you all whipped,'' Eric taunts.
</P>
<P>
   And Mia eventually delivers a comeuppance that whips these
womanizers like they've never managed to whip the opposite sex
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a crisp, pseudo-interview style a la ''Sex and the
City,'' which it resembles in spirit, while copping a much more
carnal, risque approach toward the sport of relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The men deliver fine performances, each representing a
satirically stereotyped breed of male swinger. Van Holt is
especially strong as the quintessential sleazeball suit, and Domke
pitches in some of the film's best comic moments as the hubby who
experiments with kitchen appliances to freshen up his connubial
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Peet whips up the real icing here, though. Something of a poster
woman for female empowerment, Peet is marvelous as a sexual heroine
with edge, attitude and gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Romantics might ask, what's the good of a movie whose message
might be that women can be objectifying pigs just like men? Answer:
This movie is not for romantics. Go rent ''Runaway Bride'' again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whipped'' is for people whose notion of a good date movie
might be a modern romantic comedy based on ''Medea.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: Coarse as it is, the language of ''Whipped'' was even more
wickedly vulgar, initially earning the movie an NC-17 rating. The
filmmakers toned it down for an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whipped,'' a Destination Films release, runs 82 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Aging Buddies Meet in 'The Crew'  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- On the front porch at a hotel for
senior citizens, four over-the-hill gangsters wear sour expressions
as they sit and watch the trendy traffic of South Beach pass by.
</P>
<P>
   The mobsters consider it a crime that they've grown old.
</P>
<P>
   ''You said the good times were going to last forever,'' Joey
''Bats'' Pistella grumbles to Bobby Bartellemeo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we'd be dead by now,'' Bartellemeo replies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Crew,'' which opens in theaters nationwide Friday, is a
comedy about the aging wise guys rediscovering their zest for life.
If the plot sounds familiar, it's because another new buddy flick,
Clint Eastwood's ''Space Cowboys,'' is about four aging test pilots
rediscovering their zest for life.
</P>
<P>
   Do we have a Hollywood trend here?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a trend if it makes money,'' says Burt Reynolds, who
plays Joey ''Bats'' Pistella. ''If we were all dressed as flamingos
and it made money, we'd have 14 flamingo movies coming out next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things come in bunches. I don't think it's a trend. It's
just a question of what the flavor of the month is.''
</P>
<P>
   But as baby boomers age, the potential market expands for movies
-- and books, songs and TV shows -- about the challenges of growing
old. The serious subject is also a fertile topic for dark comedy,
as ''The Crew'' proves.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Reynolds, the movie stars Richard Dreyfuss as
Bartellemeo, Dan Hedaya as Mike ''the Brick'' Donatelli, and
Seymour Cassel as Tony ''Mouth'' Donato. (The geriatric foursome in
''Space Cowboys'' consists of Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald
Sutherland and James Garner.)
</P>
<P>
   Bats has a heart condition, Bobby bad hearing and Mouth an
enlarged prostate, while the Brick has turned so soft that he
exchanges Christmas cards with other retired gangsters. None of the
four washed-up wise guys can bear to shoot even a corpse anymore.
Don Corleone they ain't.
</P>
<P>
   But when threatened with eviction from their hotel, they pull
off a caper that makes them feel young again, then sends them
unwittingly into a gang war with a Colombian drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The script is by Barry Fanaro, who wrote the TV series ''The
Golden Girls.'' ''The Crew'' touches on such issues as regret,
reconciliation and forgiveness, but never stays serious for long.
The pace is quick, the dialogue snappy, the characters sharply
drawn, and the result is a sort of Golden GoodFellas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the funniest scripts that I've ever read,''
Dreyfuss says.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Dinner, ''The Crew'' was shot on location,
with the superficial sheen of South Beach's beautiful people mined
for plenty of laughs. The film's stars -- Cassel, 65, Reynolds, 64,
Hedaya 60, and Dreyfuss, 52 -- couldn't help but feel old as they
sat on the hotel porch watching fashion models parade past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Occasionally some of them would look up and say, 'My mother
loves you!' Or even, 'My grandmother loves you!' But nobody was
throwing room keys at us,'' Reynolds complains before breaking into
his familiar cackle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking at each other, shaking our heads and saying,
'Isn't the view pretty, but we have nothing to do with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reynolds admits that while it's difficult for mobsters
and test pilots to grow old, actors actually have it pretty good.
They can keep working if they're willing to act their age.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard on actresses, but it's only tough for actors
who haven't had the courage to play old,'' Reynolds says. ''It's
all laid out there for you -- all those wonderful character parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedaya agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opportunities are there,'' he says. ''Look at Burt. He's
coming back like a dynamo. Unbelievable. He really pours himself
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in
the 1997 movie ''Boogie Nights,'' is doing some of his best work at
an age when most people are ready to retire. But while he has
embraced roles of older characters, the former Florida State
football player still does his own stunts.
</P>
<P>
   In ''The Crew,'' Reynolds is physically thrown out of a
fast-food restaurant. A camera at ground level captures him in a
freeze frame just before he hits the ground face first.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence had to be shot 10 times, Reynolds says.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear those dreaded words: 'Um, I had a little focus
problem,''' he says. ''It hurts a little more each time. What they
don't crunch the first time, they get the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should know better, but I thought it would make it a better
movie. I said, 'Just freeze-frame for a second, will you, so they
know it's me.'''
</P>
<P>
   In another memorable scene, as the four wise guys take advantage
of the early-bird special in a diner packed with senior citizens,
Reynolds' character rises from his seat and shouts, ''We would have
been better off dead!''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ''The Crew'' makes us believe otherwise, which could
be the start of a trend.

By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, four oldtime astronauts blast off from Cape Canaveral in
''Space Cowboys.'' Now four retired mobsters return to their old
tricks in ''The Crew.'' What's next -- Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston
and Jack Lemmon in ''The Three Grandfather Musketeers''?
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Watching old pros can be a pleasurable experience, and
even if they aren't as spry as in their heydays, their timing
remains impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Crew'' -- Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Seymour Cassel,
Dan Hedaya -- are really not as doddering as they are required to
play in this action comedy. They are first seen on the porch of the
Raj Mahal retirement hotel in South Beach, Miami, watching the
bikinis stroll by and reminiscing about the heists they enjoyed
when they were working for the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Their boring lives are disrupted when the hotel management moves
to evict them so the place can be upgraded to attract a better
clientele. Reynolds, known as Bats because of his weapon of choice
for quelling his enemies, devises a plan. Since Hedaya (The Brick)
works as a makeup artist in a mortuary, they would hijack a stiff
and make it appear that the man was a victim of a gang rubout in
front of the hotel. Hence the value of the joint would plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, they picked the wrong corpse. He happened to have
been the father of a Miami drug lord (Miguel Sandoval in a funny
portrayal), who dispatches his henchmen to track down the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Cassel is called Mouth because he rarely talks. But when he beds
a busty stripper, Jennifer Tilly, he tells her everything,
including details of the corpse caper. She threatens to squeal to
the drug lord unless the foursome perform a service: killing her
stepmother (Lainie Kazan).
</P>
<P>
   As if that isn't enough plot, police detective Carrie-Ann Moss
is working the case with a pushy old flame, Jeremy Piven. And it
just happens that Dreyfuss has been looking for a daughter he
hasn't seen in 30 years. Guess who interrogates him.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Dinner and writer Barry Fanaro both were
schooled in TV sitcoms, notably ''The Wonder Years.'' That
background is evident in ''The Crew.'' The action is speedy, the
wisecracks and sight gags flow with profusion. Some of the gags
just lie there, as though waiting for a laugh track. But the movie
speeds on at a breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   The four stars work wonderfully together in what is more farce
than comedy. Dreyfuss, the one note of sanity, carries the heaviest
load, and performs handily. A special nod to Lainie Kazan. When she
comes on the scene, the movie sparkles.
</P>
<P>
   For nostalgia buffs, the soundtrack is a winner. Two dozen old
platters, including ''Bim Bam,'' ''I Don't Need No Doctor'' and
''Too Hot to Stop,'' bring back the old sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Buena Vista release of a Touchstone Picture was produced by
Barry Sonnenfeld and Barry Josephson (they even put their portraits
in the opening credits, a first). Rated PG-13, for language,
vulgarity, adult material and violence. Running time: 88 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 54; Nasdaq Falls 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A slump in bank and pharmaceutical stocks pulled
the rest of the market lower Tuesday as investors tried to sort out
conflicting signals on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   At midmorning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 54.02 at 11,198.82.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 12.55 at 4,058.04. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8.03 at 1,506.06.
</P>
<P>
   A new report showed Americans were less confident than expected
about the health of the economy in August, but remain optimistic
overall about its future prospects. The Conference Board said its
Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.1, down from a revised
143 in July and below its the 144.7 record level reached in May.
</P>
<P>
   But a government report showed that new housing sales soared a
surprising 14.7 percent in July, the biggest jump in seven years,
indicating that consumers are optimistic enough to keep spending.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors took profits Tuesday after a moderate rally
Monday. This caused several Dow stocks to drop, including
Citigroup, down $1.63 to $57.25 and American Express, down 93 cents
at $58.94.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, particularly those in financial services, have rallied
in the past month as it became clear the Federal Reserve is done --
for now -- raising interest rates to cool down the economy and
prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq on Monday gained about 28 points, to pull the
technology-dominated index into positive territory for the year for
the first time since spring. The Dow, which gained about 60 point
Monday, is now down about 2 percent from where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pfizer and Johnson &AMP; Johnson fell after studies showed
their blood pressure and blood clotting drugs did not work as well
as expected. Pfizer fell 31 cents to $42.56 while J&AMP;J fell 69 cents
to $94.06.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! showed some bounce, gaining $1.25 to $123
after big losses the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 96.58 million shares,
up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.52 to 528.00.

<HEADLINE> Ray Defends Clinton Grand Jury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Granting that the nation is tired of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, independent counsel Robert W. Ray said his
decision to impanel a new grand jury to consider criminal charges
against President Clinton was not partisan and was done to speed
the case to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, writing in Tuesday's Washington Post, said forming the
grand jury ''now rather than later'' was done to prevent the matter
from hanging over the head of the next president. Waiting, he said,
''would have prevented me from resolving this case promptly after
the president leaves office, something I promised I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the new grand jury was first reported by The Associated
Press two weeks ago on the day of Vice President Al Gore's
presidential nomination acceptance speech, prompting Democrats to
complain that Ray's motives were political in this election season.
The grand jury was impaneled July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ray had said at the time that the disclosure actually was a
setback to his investigation. In the op-ed piece, he noted that his
office had been condemned for the leak when in fact it was later
disclosed that a judge appointed by President Carter, a Democrat,
was the source of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many who so quickly rushed to judgment realized their error
and have now reconsidered their evaluation of this office, for
which I am grateful,'' Ray wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times interview published Tuesday, Ray also
defended the planned release of his Whitewater report a few weeks
before New Yorkers elect their next senator: first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton or Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he would issue the findings on the Arkansas real estate
transactions the moment they are ready and added it would be wrong
to delay disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even withholding them could have political repercussions and
that could be viewed as being manipulative,'' he said, adding that
there would be adequate time for anyone to respond to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ray wrote in the Post article that he would be faithful to his
oath to carry out the job of deciding responsibly, fairly and
without partisanship whether Clinton committed perjury or other
crimes. He said no decision about whether to ask the grand jury to
return an indictment had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am bound by the oath I took to consider whether criminal
charges should be brought against the president once he leaves
office, weary though the country may be of the subject. ...
Resolution of these matters must not be left to hang over the next
president's term, to his or the nation's detriment,'' Ray wrote.
''Continuing the criminal process by impaneling a grand jury cannot
credibly be dismissed as a partisan endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the public eventually will accept that the decision to
come will be made in the right way and for the right reasons,'' Ray
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest Disney Dalmatians  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CAVANAUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Animal rights activists are demanding
that Walt Disney Studios add a disclaimer to the upcoming film
''102 Dalmatians'' warning potential owners about the dogs'
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Dalmatian rescue groups are predicting a glut of unwanted dogs
based on the large numbers of Dalmatians that landed in shelters
and were destroyed following the release of ''101 Dalmatians'' in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''People literally went from the movie theater to the pet stores
and the breeders'' to buy the dogs, and later abandoned them, said
Ann Herrington, president of Media Partners for Pets, a nonprofit
animal rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Dalmatians are often high strung and don't always make the best
pets for children. More than a quarter are born hearing-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Activists demonstrated outside Disney's studios on Monday and
tried to deliver a letter to Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner
demanding the disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   They also want 1 percent of the proceeds from the film's ticket
and merchandise sales donated to Dalmatian rescue groups and
no-kill shelters.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney spokeswoman, Andrea Marozas, declined to comment on the
activists' letter or Monday's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The studio issued a statement during the weekend announcing a
partnership with the Dalmatian Club of America, a breeders'
organization, to promote pet adoption and awareness in conjunction
with November's release of the film.

<HEADLINE> Russians To Cut Submarine Open  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wants to begin efforts to recover the
bodies of 118 men who died aboard the sunken nuclear submarine
Kursk in September by cutting holes in the vessel's hull, Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov, chairman of the commission investigating the Aug. 12
disaster when the submarine sank after shattering explosions,
rejected reports that the Kursk was testing a new type of torpedo
that used a liquid fuel system that some officers considered
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that the Kursk collided with a large
object such as a foreign submarine, or with a World War II mine,
but they have also considered the possibility that a torpedo inside
the submarine misfired.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no new torpedoes on the submarine,'' Klebanov said
after a commission meeting in St. Petersburg. He said the torpedoes
aboard had been used for 20 years, although he added they had been
fitted with a new model of battery.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said the commission, after considering several methods
of recovering the bodies, would recommend to President Vladimir
Putin that the work be done by cutting holes in the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, that work could begin in late September and would
by done by diver teams of two Russians and one Norwegian, Klebanov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Spassky, head of the Rubin submarine design bureau, which
designed the Kursk, told the NTV television channel that the method
would ''enable the divers to freely get into every compartment of
the submarine and evacuate the bodies to accompanying vessels.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov also said the commission would give Putin a proposal on
Wednesday for lifting the huge submarine to the surface, but he
provided no details other than to say the project would take about
a year and cost about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Just removing the bodies would cost $5-7 million, Klebanov said.
Even the smaller amount is a severe expense for the cash-strapped
government, but Putin is under strong public pressure to recover
the remains for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's government was sharply criticized for its handling of
the disaster and its delay in accepting offers of help in the
rescue effort from Norway and Britain. Family members have said
some of the crew could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said medical experts should be able to identify the
victims even if they were burned in the blast and have deteriorated
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is always a number on each crewman's clothing to
identify him,'' said navy Capt. Dmitry Litovkin, a military
commentator for the armed forces' newspaper Red Star.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to say whether the bodies are whole, but medical
experts will be able to recognize them,'' Litovkin said.
</P>
<P>
   However, other experts contend that the force of the blast would
have mutilated the bodies, and any remains would be carried away by
sea currents or eaten by fish and plankton.
</P>
<P>
   The Stolt Offshore oil services company, a Norwegian company
that sent divers to the Kursk, is negotiating with the Russians to
raise the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have also considered cutting the submarine into
segments or raising it with pontoons, but that could set off any
weapons still on the submarine or damage its two nuclear reactors.
Russian and Western officials have said they have detected no
radiation leaks so far.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels May Kill Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By BOY TECSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels in the Philippines
threatened Tuesday to kill an American man they have kidnapped
unless the United States accepts their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Craig Edwards Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., was seized
Monday by a faction of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, which this week
released six other Western hostages in return for a reported $6
million ransom but was still holding 18 other captives.
</P>
<P>
   But the faction holding Schilling insisted the prospect of more
ransom was not behind the latest kidnapping. In past abductions,
the faction has demanded the release of Muslim militants jailed in
the United States for the World Trade Center bombing and other
planned attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview, rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya said the rebels
would ''not hesitate to execute this American guy if the Philippine
government and the U.S. will not listen to our demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya said the specific demands would be announced in three
days. ''We demand for our principles, we demand for our religion,
we demand for our ideology,'' he told the Radio Mindanao Network.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been trying very hard to get an American because the
Americans may think we are afraid of them,'' he said when asked if
they had abducted Schilling to prevent a military operation against
Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government hostage negotiator Robert Aventajado confirmed
Schilling had been kidnapped, saying an envoy had seen him in an
Abu Sayyaf camp on southern Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, arrived in the Philippines in March and has been
living in a house with his Filipino girlfriend in southern
Zamboanga city, according to immigration records.
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya said Schilling had contacted Abu Sayyaf rebels in
Zamboanga and identified himself as a Muslim convert who was
interested in visiting the camp of the rebels, who are fighting for
an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels suspected he was a CIA agent when they discovered he
knew little about Islam and decided to abduct him to Jolo, Sabaya
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's girlfriend, Ivi V. Osani, also a Muslim, gave a
different account of the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   She said the rebel spokesman Sabaya is related to her mother and
had been urging the couple for some time to visit the rebels' camp
on Jolo. Schilling, who was planning to return to the United States
in early September, finally agreed, and they went by boat on
Sunday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing, Osani said Schilling had told her to return alone to
Zamboanga, and she had not discovered until her arrival on Tuesday
that he had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Six U.S. Embassy officials flew to Zamboanga Tuesday to
investigate the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf kidnapped 21 tourists and workers from Malaysia's
Sipadan diving resort on April 23. Most of those hostages -- from
France, Germany, Finland, South Africa, Malaysia and the
Philippines -- have been released, but four remain. The rebels later
seized three French journalists and 12 Filipino Christian
evangelists who came to their hide-out.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, they released six Western hostages after Libya
reportedly paid $6 million in ransom, though Tripoli insisted the
money would go to development projects in the impoverished south,
not directly to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Many Filipinos, drained from the drawn-out hostage crisis, were
worried that the large ransom payment would inspire new
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, the smaller of two main Muslim rebel groups
fighting in the south, is made up of several factions often working
independently.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the faction that snatched Schilling seized more than
50 Filipinos, including many children, from two schools and held
them on the island of Basilan. It executed two men from the group
after the United States refused its demands to release Ramzi
Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in
New York, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to
blow up New York City landmarks.

<HEADLINE> Feds Confirm Hike in Flight Delays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Late arriving data from the Transportation
Department confirm what most Americans already knew: June was a
miserable month for flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics said air
carriers posted a 66.3 percent on-time arrival record in June, down
from both the 74.3 percent mark recorded in May and the 70.9
percent recorded in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The data confirm passengers complaints and an earlier Federal
Aviation Administration report.
</P>
<P>
   The flight delay report is normally part of the department's
monthly air travel consumer report, issued a few weeks ago. But the
delay statistics were not available from a new computer then and
were made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, United Airlines had June's poorest on-time
performance in June. That airline, the nation's largest, had an
ongoing dispute with pilots at the time which has since been
settled.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the FAA has reported that there were fewer
delays caused by weather and air traffic control in July, and
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater has convened a meeting of
airline executives to work together to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   The best on-time performance in June, Tuesday's report said,
came from Northwest at 75.0 percent. That was followed by Delta,
73.7 percent; Continental, 73.1 percent; Southwest, 71.1 percent
and TWA, 66.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the nation's 10 largest airlines were American,
65.5 percent; Alaska, 65.5 percent; US Airways, 63.3 percent;
America West, 60.5 percent and United, 48.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Body Found in Russian TV Fire  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The giant Moscow TV tower that was engulfed in a
26-hour fire is stable enough to be restored, officials said
Tuesday as the search for bodies ended with the death toll in the
blaze listed as three.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the State Committee on Construction, Anvar
Shamuzafarov, said Tuesday that about 25 percent of the 149 steel
cables that bind together the sections of the 1,771-foot Ostankino
Tower had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said
experts have inspected the structure for two days and concluded
that it is stable.
</P>
<P>
   Flames spread through the tower on Sunday and Monday, raising
concerns that some of the tower would fall or that it would have to
be torn down. Losing the tower, one of Moscow's most striking
sights, would have been a blow to the city's image.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was the latest catastrophe in a month that some media
have started calling ''Black August.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent Russian history has never known such a tragic month,''
the Moscow News weekly said. It recalled the 12 victims of a
bombing in an underground passage in the capital, the 118-member
crew that perished when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the
Barents Sea and the three killed in the TV tower.
</P>
<P>
   The third victim was identified Tuesday as Alexander Shepitsyn,
a plumber in the tower, a spokeswoman with the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear whether Shepitsyn had died in an
elevator that got stuck about halfway up the tower after the fire
broke out and then plunged to the ground. Two bodies from the
elevator were identified Monday -- a high-ranking fire official and
an elevator operator.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue efforts ended on Tuesday afternoon, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started in the tower's thin spire about 1,470 feet
above ground because of a short circuit, officials say. It spread
downward, cutting broadcasts to the capital and burning the
observation deck and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ITAR-Tass said much of the tower's inside was scorched and
damaged from smoke but that some equipment could be saved. Most of
the damage had been done to cables running up the tower's central
shaft, it reported.
</P>
<P>
   The tower's upper spire was tilting slightly because of the
fire, surveyors said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire cut most television service in Moscow and its
surroundings, although channels were still able to transmit
nationally in spite of the fire. President Vladimir Putin on Monday
ordered that broadcasts of the major channels in Moscow be resumed
within a week, but it was unclear whether that could be
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have proposed plans ranging from broadcasting from the
top of the main building at Moscow State University to attaching
transmitters to dirigibles.
</P>
<P>
   Independent NTV, one of Russia's main channels, resumed
broadcasting its news programs in Moscow within hours of the fire
by using the signal of a UHF channel owned by the same company that
holds NTV.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in Ostankino highlighted the decay of Russia's
infrastructure, which has been neglected because of dire funding
shortages for years. The tower, which was constructed in 1967 and
came to symbolize the Soviet Union's technological might, is the
world's second-tallest free standing structure, behind the CN tower
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't simply a tower. ... It was the symbol of an epoch
that now, it seems, has passed for good,'' the Vremya MN daily
commented.

<HEADLINE> Tearful Exchange in German Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A former treasurer of Helmut Kohl's party burst
into tears at a hearing Tuesday after a once-powerful Kohl protege
accused her of lying about a money handover under investigation in
the scandal entangling the ex-chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Brigitte Baumeister's testimony was a dramatic peak after months
of digging by a parliamentary investigating committee, but it only
deepened the mystery about allegations that Kohl's former Christian
Democratic government traded favors for donations.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of conflicting testimony by Baumeister and Wolfgang
Schaeuble, Kohl's successor as party leader who quit after being
implicated in the affair, also ensured fresh nationwide headlines
on the financing scandal the party has been battling all year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was an alleged $45,000 donation by German-Canadian arms
industry lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber in 1994, when Kohl was
chancellor and party leader. Schaeuble, then the Christian Democrat
leader in parliament, and Baumeister each say they received an
envelope with the money and gave it to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Tears welled in Baumeister's eyes after nearly four hours of
confrontation at the witness table with Schaeuble, who accused her
Tuesday of launching a smear campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice breaking as she turned to Schaeuble, Baumeister said
the testimony had been an emotional strain. ''To talk of an
intrigue was the worst thing I could ever have experienced,'' she
added, dabbing her eyes with a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   She denied forging a plot against Schaeuble and hinted that she
had been pressured to change her account. ''I've been through a
valley of hell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble remained distant, even when Baumeister addressed him
by his first name, saying she would have ''gone through thick and
thin'' for him in earlier years and was now disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is getting more and more abstruse,'' Schaeuble snapped at
one point.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers had called the latest hearings to examine whether
Schreiber's donation was part of efforts to get Kohl's government
to lobby for a defense project in Canada by a subsidiary of a
German company, Thyssen.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of parliament's inquiry is a 1991 delivery of
Thyssen-Henschel tanks to Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf War.
German prosecutors charged Schreiber in March with bribery, tax
evasion and other counts related to money that allegedly flowed to
set up the deal. Schreiber is fighting extradition from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Baumeister testified Tuesday that Juergen Massmann, a former
Thyssen executive also charged in the Schreiber case, was present
at Schreiber's home when she received the envelope she believed to
contain a donation. But she said she only exchanged greetings with
Massmann and was sure the money wasn't from him.
</P>
<P>
   Massmann went before the committee Tuesday but refused to
testify, citing the pending judicial investigation. He even refused
to say whether he knew Baumeister, fanning suspicions of a cover-up
among committee members from the governing Social Democrats and
Greens.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both witnesses did not tell the full truth,'' said Friedhelm
Julius Beucher of the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble said he received the money from Schreiber and turned
it over to Baumeister to record as a donation. Baumeister says she
was handed the envelope by Schreiber after dinner at his Bavarian
home and later gave it to Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl set off the scandal last November by admitting he received
some $900,000 in off-the-books donations for the Christian
Democrats. He has refused to identify the donors, prompting
allegations that the money was in return for favors -- something
Kohl hotly denies.

<HEADLINE> Arista Joins With Jam, Lewis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Arista Records has made a three-year deal with
Grammy-award winning producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to
distribute, promote and market the duo's Flyte Tyme Records.
</P>
<P>
   Jam and Lewis, who are responsible for most of Janet Jackson's
chart-topping recordings as well as hits from artists including
Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey, will produce music for Arista
artists, Arista President Antonio ''L.A.'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, artists will be signed to Flyte Tyme and marketed
by Arista.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm building is a music machine. I'm bringing in as many
great producers as I can. We can find great songs for great artists
-- that's the key to success,'' Reid said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was recently installed as Arista's president, replacing
company founder Clive Davis. Davis left after Arista's corporate
parent, BMG Entertainment, enforced its mandatory retirement
policy. The 67-year-old Davis last week announced the creation of a
new record label, J Records, with BMG.
</P>
<P>
   Arista is home to such superstars as Whitney Houston and Carlos
Santana.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Profit-taking left stock prices narrowly mixed
Tuesday, with bank and pharmaceutical stocks among the decliners.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 12.95 at 11,239.89.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was up 17.02 at 4,087.61. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.02 at 1,513.07.
</P>

   ''We are seeing a bit of profit taking,'' said Alan Ackerman,

</P>
<P>
   But a government report showed new housing sales soared a
surprising 14.7 percent in July, the biggest jump in seven years,
indicating that consumers are upbeat enough to keep spending.
</P>
<P>
   Profit-taking brought financial services stocks lower, including
Citigroup, down 93.75 cents to $57.938 and American Express, down
81.25 cents at $59.063.

<P>
   Stocks, particularly those in financial services, have rallied
in the past month as it became clear the Federal Reserve is done --

   The Nasdaq on Monday gained about 28 points, to pull the

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Guerrillas Now Military  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AILEU, East Timor (AP) -- They fought a desperate jungle war
against Indonesia's occupation for a quarter of a century. Now, one
year after East Timor broke free, they have no place to go and
nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Aileu, 12 miles southwest of East Timor's
capital Dili, about 800 guerrillas of the rebel group Falintil
lounge around a dusty parade ground and smoke cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen in faded uniforms, automatic rifles slung over
their backs, tinker with a dilapidated army truck. Others tend
vegetable patches or do other chores. A few chat with U.N.
officials assigned to keep an eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   It's very different from their days of daring cat-and-mouse
combat against the vastly superior Indonesian army. Outnumbered and
outgunned, Falintil used its knowledge of the land and the
near-universal support of the population to survive repeated
Indonesian offensives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we are bored and feel useless,'' said Koli Ati, a
guerrilla commander.
</P>
<P>
   But this could change soon.
</P>
<P>
   As East Timor prepares for statehood during the next 18 months,
Falintil -- a Portuguese acronym for the Armed Forces of the
National Liberation of East Timor -- is to be transformed from a
ragtag rebel group into the nucleus of a new and professional
defense force, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Once U.N. peacekeepers begin pulling out, the new army will
assume responsibility for the fledgling nation's security.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Falintil fighters will be feted as heroes when
East Timor's 600,000 people mark the first anniversary of a
U.N.-sponsored referendum that ended 24 years of Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   That independence vote sparked an orgy of violence by militias
backed by the Indonesian military, ending only with the entry of
international peacekeepers. With elements of the Indonesian army
still unreconciled to the loss of the territory, Falintil may see
renewed combat soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, some Falintil fighters are to be recruited by
the U.N. force as scouts along East Timor's troubled border with
Indonesian-controlled West Timor, the scene of a spate of recent
clashes between the peacekeepers and anti-independence militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Australian peacekeepers exchanged gunfire with two
militiamen near the border. No one was injured in the clash and the
militiamen escaped, peacekeeping spokesman Col. Brynar Nymo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Falintil knows the terrain better than anyone else, certainly
better than our troops,'' said East Timor's U.N. administrator
Sergio Vieira de Mello.
</P>
<P>
   ''Falintil will be the backbone. They will be the core of the
new East Timor defense force,'' he said. ''They will have a key
role, a crucial role to play in defending this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some independence leaders want the guerrillas to do more.
Independence leader Jose ''Xanana'' Gusmao has reportedly suggested
that his men conduct raids into Indonesian West Timor to root out
militia base camps there -- an option De Mello rules out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not be using the same tactics as thugs and
criminals,'' he said. ''Violating international borders is contrary
to international law.''
</P>
<P>
   During and after the August 1999 referendum, Falintil kept its
promise to the United Nations to remain in its camps. But it has
since refused several U.N. requests to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   After the former colonial ruler Portugal left East Timor,
Indonesia invaded in 1975, prompting the Falintil guerrilla war.
The guerrillas used their superior military training to run rings
around Indonesia's U.S.-trained special forces, called Kopassus,
that tried to hunt them down. Human rights groups claim as many as
200,000 people, mostly civilians, died in the first years after the
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officers believe rogue elements of Kopassus are still
active in West Timor, training and arming militia gangs that are
now crossing the border to destabilize East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, peacekeepers deployed reinforcements to the central
highlands in an attempt to corner a gang of militiamen thought to
be hiding out in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Falintil's current commander, Taur Matan Ruak, said all this
proves a strong East Timorese force is necessary to deter
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need only look around us and see on our doorstep what is
happening,'' he said. ''Our border is being threatened, and some
militiamen have come back and they are causing deep concerns.''

<HEADLINE> Catholics: Yes To WWII Compensation  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN GRAHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Catholic church said Tuesday it would
pay $4.6 million in compensation for using Nazi-provided forced
labor during World War II but snubbed a national compensation fund,
saying the church had no part in ''collective guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on the Catholic church has grown since German firms and
the government established a $4.6 billion fund earlier this year
and called on all organizations who might have used slave or forced
labor, including the churches, to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   While Protestant church leaders agreed last month to pay $4.6
million into the national fund, the Catholic church decided not to
join that initiative and will instead channel payments to surviving
victims via a charity, said Karl Lehmann, chairman of the German
Catholic Bishops Conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Catholic church rejected the idea of ''collective
guilt'' for any abuses of forced laborers because it had treated
its workers well, while the Nazis deliberately had worked slave
laborers to death.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those forced to work for Catholic institutions during
the war were agricultural laborers not covered by the
government-industry fund, which is aimed at helping forced laborers
detained in concentration camps or employed in industry and
government, the church argues.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't mean we won't help shoulder the people's burden
of responsibility,'' Lehmann said at a news conference in the
western town of Mainz after 27 bishops met Monday to decide their
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the government-backed fund and victims
criticized the bishops for paying too little, too late and accused
them of arrogance in deciding to shun the national initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an altogether small-hearted reaction to rid themselves of
a painful subject,'' said Wolfgang Gibowski, the spokesman for the
government-industry fund, complaining that the Catholic church had
never approached the fund to discuss whether agricultural laborers
would have been covered.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Lambsdorff, the government's chief Nazi labor envoy, argued
that it wasn't true that agricultural laborers wouldn't be entitled
to payments under the national scheme. He said the fund would take
into account payments by the Catholic church so that all victims
would be treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has been struggling to collect the firms' $2.3
billion share of the fund, with their pledges stuck for weeks at
just over $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Witti, a Munich-based lawyer representing victims, said
it had taken the church ''a laughably long time'' to decide to
compensate survivors and accused it of ignoring popular support for
the government-backed fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic church said half of its pledge will be direct
payments via a charity organization to those forced to work in
institutions such as monasteries and convents. The other half will
go to educational projects run by the church.
</P>
<P>
   While the Catholic church has yet to release details of how many
forced laborers it employed, newspaper reports have suggested only
a few hundred are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a Berlin historian confirmed that an archive
containing the names and personal details of about 3,000 slave
laborers, most from western Europe, was discovered in the bunker of
a former electronics company in the capital. The data could help
survivors claim compensation, Reiner Janick said.

<HEADLINE> New Data From Weather Satellite  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is getting ready to launch a
new $267 million weather satellite it hopes will improve
understanding of what triggers storms, enhance flood forecasts and
even offer faster search and rescue response.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA-L is scheduled for launch Sept. 20 from Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California. It will replace a six-year-old satellite
that is drifting out of orbit as it ages.
</P>
<P>
   John Jones, deputy director of the National Weather Service,
said instruments aboard NOAA-L and its sister satellites will
provide a more detailed vertical profile of the temperature and
moisture in the atmosphere than is currently available.
</P>
<P>
   This information can help researchers understand what triggers
the rising air, called convection, that leads to clouds and storms,
he said. They will be able to measure the upward motion, the inward
movement of cool or warm air and more or less moisture.
</P>
<P>
   This can lead to a better understanding of thunderstorms, he
said, ''thunderstorms that can possibly become tornadoes.''
</P>
<P>
   While that is long-term learning, a more immediate gain is also
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments will be able to differentiate between clouds and
snow cover, a current problem for satellites looking down at white
expanses. This new detail will allow hydrologists to better measure
the ground snow pack and forecast spring flooding, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   And with other satellites in similar orbits, NOAA-L will provide
worldwide data used in the complex computer programs that help make
forecasts by calculating how the weather will change.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what's happening far away can help in long-range
forecasting, since weather tends to travel around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ajay Mehta of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration added that the new satellite will also be part of
the satellite search and rescue system operated by the United
States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses weather satellites to receive signals from
emergency beacons carried by ships, aircraft and individuals on the
ground. These are related to ground stations which send rescue
teams in the event help is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Another satellite in orbit reduces the time before a receiver
may be overhead of someone needing help, he explained, and this can
reduce rescue time.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Davis of NOAA's satellite office noted that satellites like
NOAA-L also help weather forecasters in other nations because their
data is broadcast in a way that anyone with a receiver can use.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many third world countries who could not afford satellite data
in any other way can get it ... and it's free and open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flying about 520 miles above the Earth's surface, the satellite
will be on an orbit slightly tilted from south-to north. Taking
about 100 minutes to complete an orbit, it would cross the equator
at 2 p.m. local time on each pass, looking at the whole planet
twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   A second NOAA satellite moving north-to-south uses a similar
pattern, giving forecasters a look at the planet four times daily.
</P>
<P>
   The new satellite was built by Lockheed Martin and carries
instruments designed and built by NASA and NOAA as well as ones
provided by meteorological offices in the United Kingdom, Canada
and France.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite will be launched using a Titan II rocket, a former
intercontinental ballistic missile that once sat in a silo in
Arkansas in the event of war. Once in orbit, it will be renamed
NOAA-16.

<HEADLINE> No Solidarity in Polish Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By KEN OLSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Solidarity celebrates the 20th anniversary
this week of the trade union that blossomed under communist
oppression into a bold mass movement that broke the back of Polish
communism. But these days, it is having a hard time living up to
its fabled name.
</P>
<P>
   Riven by personality clashes and loose-cannon lawmakers who snub
the party line, the Solidarity of 2000 sometimes seems set to
self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   Far from a unified voice of popular dissent, Solidarity has
evolved into a fractious political coalition of nearly two dozen
conservative or right-wing parties, societies, trade unions and
religious associations.
</P>
<P>
   Even legendary Solidarity trade union founder Lech Walesa says
the movement has lost its way.
</P>
<P>
   ''After reaching 'Bus Stop Freedom,' we should have rolled up
the Solidarity banners,'' said Walesa, who broke with the movement
over leadership issues and formed his own party, the Christian
Democracy of Poland, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ideal role for Solidarity now would be to go back to its
trade union positions and to ensure democracy -- sometimes help
parties, but never fill in for them,'' Walesa said.
</P>
<P>
   Since a revamped Solidarity bloc took over the government after
winning 35 percent of the vote in 1997, its approval ratings in
surveys of voting-age Poles have plummeted to around 15 percent.
Given the chance to vote today, they almost certainly would hand
the government back to the opposition bloc of ex-communists.
</P>
<P>
   A noisy minority of right-wing Solidarity deputies have held the
government hostage with crusades to try to limit shopping on
Sundays, settle old scores with ex-communists and limit foreign
investment in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Their antics have so disrupted the government's economic reform
program that the pro-market Freedom Union, Solidarity's junior
coalition partner for the past 30 months, bolted the government
because Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek couldn't keep them in line.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Solidarity bloc has been ruling without even a
nominal majority in the parliament since June.
</P>
<P>
   Even festivities for Solidarity's 20th birthday, which run
through Thursday, have opened old wounds, with some former
activists criticizing organizers for refusing to invite President
Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist. Organizers say he was left
off the guest list because he supported Solidarity's suppression
under martial law.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when it should be savoring its victory over
communism, Solidarity is instead struggling to retain its
relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now it's a federation'' instead of a disciplined party,
said Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, director of the Institute of Public
Affairs, a Warsaw think tank. ''And right now it threatens to
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its incessant internal squabbling, the government has
pushed through some impressive fiscal reforms, nurtured solid
economic growth, brought Poland under NATO's military umbrella and
set it on course for European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
   But the harsh realities of the free market, tight budgets and
painful restructuring of ailing industries have helped push
unemployment to nearly 14 percent, leaving many Poles anxious and
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ''People now treat Solidarity like a regular political party,
and it's now accountable for the economy, for social policy, for
whether people feel more secure or not,'' said Pawel Grzelak of the
Demoskop polling agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kolarska-Bobinska noted that all main political groups agree on
the basic goal of a market economy fit to join the EU. But she said
it is folly for Solidarity to cling to what many Poles view as an
outdated obsession with anti-communism and Roman Catholic Church
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Though plenty of anti-communist sentiment lingers, it is ''less
useful today for organizing the political scene,'' she said. And
while more than 90 percent of Poles are Catholic, church-backed
anti-abortion laws and efforts to end Sunday shopping have proved
widely unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity has hit the political skids before. It's feuding
factions went separate ways for the 1993 elections -- and got
clobbered by better organized ex-communists.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1997 ballot, Marian Krzaklewski, Walesa's successor as
head of the union, cobbled together a quirky array of conservative
and far-right groups on a Solidarity Electoral Action ticket. It
worked, but critics say he let in too many rogues who have caused
headaches ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Now Solidarity must try to ride it out as a minority government.
Parliamentary elections are not due until fall of 2001, but could
come sooner if the government fails to get key budget bills
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski, meanwhile, faces a potential humiliation in his
long-shot run for the presidency this fall against Aleksander
Kwasniewski, the ex-communist incumbent who is Poland's most
popular politician.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Solidarity will always have a core of support
likely to ensure it a bloc of seats in the parliament, but its
influence is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a future, but they will have to construct it on
something other than history or nostalgia,'' Kolarska-Bobinska
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Profit-taking left stock prices narrowly mixed
Tuesday, with bank and pharmaceutical stocks among the decliners
and securities firms among the big gainers.
</P>
<P>
   in late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 20.35 at 11,232.39.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was up 5.41 at 4,076.00. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.78 at 1,509.31.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing a bit of profit taking,'' said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''There's also a lack of
volume, a lack of news, a lack of conviction and a lack of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Many traders were on vacation ahead of the long Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Investors got mixed signals on the U.S. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A new report showed Americans were less confident than expected
about the health of the economy in August, but remain optimistic
overall about its future prospects. The Conference Board said its
Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.1, down from a revised
143 in July and below its the 144.7 record level reached in May.
</P>
<P>
   But a government report showed new housing sales soared a
surprising 14.7 percent in July, the biggest jump in seven years,
indicating that consumers are upbeat enough to keep spending.
</P>
<P>
   Profit-taking brought financial services stocks lower, including
Citigroup, down 93.75 cents at $57.938 and American Express, down
81.25 cents at $59.063.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, particularly those in financial services, have rallied
in the past month as it became clear the Federal Reserve is done --
for now -- raising interest rates to cool down the economy and
prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages were rising, fueled by speculation that Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. is in talks to be acquired by the brokerage
unit of Credit Suisse Group. DLJ was up $14.38 to $80.19. Other
brokerages gaining included Bear Sterns, up $3.68 at $63.50 and
Lehman Brothers, up $5 at $143.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq on Monday gained about 28 points, to pull the
technology-dominated index into positive territory for the year for
the first time since spring. The Dow, which gained about 60 points
Monday, is now down about 2 percent from where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! continued to falter, losing $1.25 to
$120.81.

<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the

<P>
   Clinton arrives in Colombia on Wednesday with a high-powered
delegation of U.S. lawmakers, Cabinet members, diplomats and
military brass to speed implementation of a $1.3 billion U.S.
anti-narcotics aid package.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Pastrana lauded the
visit -- the first by a U.S. president since George Bush came in
1990 -- as evidence that ''we are not alone in the fight against
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Clinton's arrival, workers were hurriedly repaving
streets in this walled Spanish-colonial city on the Caribbean and
painting over anti-U.S. graffiti, such as one that read: ''Clinton
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Army troops erected roadblocks on the outskirts and frisked
motorists, part of a massive security operation involving 5,000
Colombian soldiers and police and some 350 U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said he expects the U.S. assistance to continue no
matter who is elected to the White House in November because the
aid plan has both Democratic and Republican support.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana urged the United States also to drop trade barriers
to Colombian products, which would generate employment here and
give Colombians an alternative to narcotics production.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most important subjects we must discuss
with Bill Clinton,'' Pastrana, appearing relaxed and casually
dressed in a blue Lacoste sport shirt and tan chinos, told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit is a political boost for Pastrana, whose
popularity has plummeted here amid disappointing peace talks, a
major recession and ongoing rebel and right-wing paramilitary
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The American aid, most of it in military hardware and training,
is aimed at combatting the armed groups who protect plantations
producing 90 percent of the world's cocaine and a rising share of
its heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the U.S. aid -- in which 60 combat helicopters will be
sent to Colombia and Green Berets are training Colombian
anti-narcotics soldiers -- say Washington is becoming directly
involved in this South American nation's 36-year guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Head-to-head clashes between U.S.-backed troops and the rebels
seem inevitable since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, makes huge profits by protecting and taxing drug crops,
and has vowed to fight efforts by the troops to seize drug
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops are barred from fighting in the war. U.S. officials
scoff at notions the United States is becoming involved in a
Vietnam-like quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said the military aid was welcome but that for a
longer-term solution, Colombian products, especially textiles,
require tariff-free access to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the farms which produce cocaine and heroin from coca and
poppy plants are owned by subsistence farmers. Itinerant harvesters
who used to pick coffee or cotton were driven out of work when
prices dropped and now pick drug crops, Pastrana noted.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be 618,000 acres of cotton in Colombia, but now
there are only 37,000 acres, forcing cotton-pickers to become
itinerant coca harvesters, Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Colombia gains access to U.S. markets -- either through a
bilateral agreement, inclusion in the North American Free Trade
Agreement which currently encompasses the United States, Canada and
Mexico, or expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative -- Colombia's
20 percent unemployment can be dramatically cut, Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can produce cotton, textiles, clothes,'' he said. ''We have
a production chain and can export with very good results. In this
way, commerce can be fundamental in combatting drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, meanwhile, said he was disappointed with the
relatively small contributions pledged from mostly European donors
at a July conference in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is seeking $2.3 billion from Europe and Japan but only
won pledges of some $600 million. While most of the military aid
comes from the United States, the other donors were to have
provided money for alternative crop development and other
nonmilitary assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't get the funds we wanted,'' Pastrana said, adding
that another fund-raising attempt would be made within months.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Clinton for his one-day visit are 11 members of
Congress including House Speaker Dennis Hastert, as well as
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno,
White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey and Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the
Miami-based chief of U.S. military operations in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Calm Colombians  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a videotaped address to the Colombian
people Tuesday, President Clinton sought to calm fears that a $1.3
billion U.S. aid package will escalate fighting in a 36-year-old
guerrilla war in their nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please do not misunderstand our purpose. We have no military
objective,'' Clinton said. ''We do not believe your conflict has a
military solution.'' The White House released a transcript of his
message to Colombians a day before Clinton visits the South
American country Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the cocaine and most of the heroin that now
makes its way to the United States comes from Colombia, where
traffickers seek protection from Marxist guerrillas and right wing
paramilitaries that are undermining a fragile government led by
President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the U.S. aid package pays for helicopters, military
training and eradication of drug crops to support the Colombian
government's work to gain control of drug-producing regions. In his
address, which will be televised, Clinton called the American aid
as ''both pro-peace and anti-drug.'' He also highlighted money in
the package earmarked to support human rights, improvements in the
Colombian judicial system and economic development, including money
to help farmers start growing legal crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The farmers who grow coca and poppy must have a way to make an
honest living if they are to rejoin the national economy,'' Clinton
said. ''Our assistance will help offer farmers credit and identify
new products and new markets.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the impression of U.S. meddling, Clinton said: ''We are
supporting the Colombian plan. You are leading; we are providing
assistance as a friend and a neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   To Oscar Arias, former president of Costa Rica and winner of the
1987 Nobel Peace Prize, the U.S. assistance is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haven't the last 20 years shown us that as long as there is a
market for drugs in the United States, somebody will find a way to
get them there?'' Arias wrote in a letter to The New York Times
published Tuesday. ''Cutting down on the demand side in the United
States would do much more to curtail drug production than a bloody
military campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted in his address that the supply of drugs is only
one part of the problem. ''We must continue our efforts to cut
demand, and we will help Colombia fight the problems aggravated by
our demand,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Rewrites Book on Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The finale of ''Survivor'' drew 51 million
viewers last week, ranking as the most-watched summertime
television show since at least 1987, according to Nielsen Media
Research.
</P>
<P>
   It also led CBS to an easy victory in the week's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hatch won $1 million by outlasting his competitors on
Pulau Tiga, but CBS won much more. It scored a rare victory among
teen-age viewers last week and had nearly as many 18-49-year-old
viewers as NBC and Fox combined.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether a summer series before 1987 had a higher
viewership; that's the year Nielsen began electronically measuring
its audience, and records before then are considered less reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' was second only to the Super Bowl as the
most-watched television show of the year. The one-hour ''Survivor''
reunion special with Bryant Gumbel as moderator attracted more than
38 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For the week in prime time, CBS had an average of 13.6 million
viewers (8.8 rating, 15 share). ABC had 9.7 million viewers (6.7,
12), NBC had 7.6 million (5.5, 10), Fox had 5.9 million (4.0, 7),
UPN had 3.5 million (2.2, 4), the WB had 2.3 million (1.6, 3) and
Pax TV had 1.4 million (1.1, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
9.4 million viewers (7.0 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.6 million viewers (6.5, 14) and the ''CBS Evening
News had 7.8 million (5.9, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Aug. 21-27, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 28.6; ''Survivor: The Reunion,'' CBS, 22.5;
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 15.1; ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 14.9; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 13.6; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.7;
''20/20 Downtown,'' ABC, 9.0; ''Dateline NBC'' (Tuesday), NBC, 9.0;
''The Practice,'' ABC, 9.0; ''Law and Order,'' NBC, 8.3.

<HEADLINE> Germany Has Budget Surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany will post a surprise budget surplus this
year, its first since 1989, the government forecast Tuesday, citing
both a record windfall from the sale of licenses to operate
high-speed mobile phone networks and the healthy recovery of
Europe's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   For the current year, the budget will show a surplus of 1.5
percent of gross domestic product, instead of a previously
projected deficit of 1 percent, the finance ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were pushed into the black in part by the bidding of six
cellphone operators, which agreed earlier this month to pay the
government almost 100 billion marks ($46 billion) for the licenses
after a three-week auction.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrat-led government is banking on tight public
spending and a buoyant economy to help it balance the budget by
2006, though the finance ministry said it still expects to slip
back into deficit in 2001 when the one-time boost from the phone
auction falls away.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for a healthy economy improved Tuesday, after the
finance ministry said the economy grew 3.3 percent in the first six
months compared to the year-earlier period, the fastest first-half
pace since German reunification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, growth should now reach 3 percent, Finance
Minister Hans Eichel said after a meeting with his French
counterpart Laurent Fabius in the German town of Eltville. The
government had forecast growth of 2.75 percent as recently as May.

<HEADLINE> SAT scores stable, racial and gender gaps persist  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - High school students' performance on the
SAT remained strong this year in Connecticut, but a persistent gap
in scores across racial and gender lines is causing concern.
</P>
<P>
   The state's average score of 1017 was down two points from last
year and the prior year, when students recorded the highest scores
in a decade, the state Department of Education announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the scores are close to recent state highs, they are two
points short of the national average, 1019.
</P>
<P>
   The Scholastic Assessment Test is a key indicator for college
admission. The maximum score is 1,600 - 800 in each of the math and
verbal sections.
</P>
<P>
   The average math score of 509, unchanged from last year,
continued a 28-year high, officials said. The average verbal score
of 508 was down two points from last year, when a 10-year high was
set.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut had the nation's highest participation rate. More
than 80 percent of the state's students took the standardized test.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what all states strive for - high numbers of students
taking the test and aspiring to higher education combined with
overall strong performance,'' said state Education Commissioner
Theodore S. Sergi.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains a gap between the scores of black and Hispanic
students compared to white and Asian students. That gap reflects
the economic conditions and disparities in the state, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we look closely at the performance of students grouped by
family income, parents' education, race and gender, we continue to
see significant need for improvement,'' Sergi said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergi said more students should take the practice SAT. Suburban
students are preparing for and taking the PSAT at a much higher
rate than urban students, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergi also said local school boards need to address the
achievement gap, perhaps by focusing on students below the poverty
level and setting expectations at an early age that they will
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gap persists and it needs direct attention,'' Sergi said.
''It has to be done with a focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Black students had an average score of 837, up 11 points from
last year and the highest scores since they were first recorded in
1976. But that average is more than 200 points below the average
scores of whites (1052) and Asians (1073).
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic students had an average score of 876, down eight points
from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap also continues, with math scores for girls 32
points below boys. Verbal scores were only one point apart.
</P>
<P>
   Educators are more perplexed by the gender gap in math, said Tom
Murphy, education department spokesman. Part of the reason may be
expectations, Murphy said, noting that girls traditionally were not
directed to math and science.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier grades, girls outperform boys in writing,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Will Restrict U.N. Access  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN THORNHILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia lashed out at the United
Nations on Tuesday, saying it will scale back contacts with the
world body because of criticism over its treatment of Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia will no longer
allow U.N. committees to visit, nor will it meet requests for
information unless there is a ''compelling reason'' to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would restrict visits by U.N. human
rights inspectors and urged an overhaul of the U.N.'s committee
system. Australia has been a member of the United Nations since it
was formed in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the U.N. Human Rights Committee found that
mandatory sentencing laws in two Australian jurisdictions
discriminated against Aborigines. It criticized the government for
failing to overrule them.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's original inhabitants, Aborigines are now a minority
of 386,000 mostly impoverished people in a population of 19
million. After 212 years of white settlement, Aborigines are the
least employed, least educated, least healthy and most-jailed
segment of Australian society.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. committees also criticized the government's policy of
holding illegal immigrants in detention camps while their refugee
applications are determined, and for allowing uranium mining in a
World Heritage-listed park.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Attorney-general Daryl Williams accused the U.N.
committees of concentrating on relatively minor issues in
democratic countries like Australia while ignoring more serious
abuses in others.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are comparing it (Australia's record) with arbitrary
arrests and executions and having your arms chopped off, the
problems in Australia pale into insignificance,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Jose Diaz, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights, said his organization ''shares the desire of the
Australian government for reforms intended to enhance the
effectiveness of the treaty body system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Utmost care should be taken to continue to work toward
achieving universality of the accepted human rights standards,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's opposition Labor party criticized the government's
move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will give comfort to the Saddam Husseins of the world, to
the Burmese military regime, to all those despots around the place
who hate the idea of international scrutiny,'' said Laurie
Ferguson, Labor's foreign affairs spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organization Amnesty International was also
critical. It accused Australia of wanting to be accountable only to
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an irresponsible overreaction to recent poor report
cards,'' said Kate Gilmore, Amnesty's Australian director.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Sang Lan says she cheer for China's gymnastics team  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) - Though confined to a wheelchair, China's former
champion gymnast Sang Lan still sets competitive sparks flying when
it comes to her former team's chances at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the team has been doing great and gold should be well
within reach,'' the 19-year-old Sang said Tuesday, flashing a shy
but confident smile.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a virtuoso of the vaulting horse, Sang could have been
among those marching behind China's red flag at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes died after she broke her neck while making a
practice vault at the 1998 Goodwill Games at Nassau Coliseum in
Uniondale, N.Y. After surgery to stabilize her neck and 10 months
of rehabilitation in New York, Sang returned home and maintained a
steady regimen of study and physical therapy. She corresponds with
friends around the world by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese women's team placed third at the world championships
last October in Tianjin, China, and is among the top contenders for
a team medal at Sydney. China also hopes for individual medals on
the beam and bars.
</P>
<P>
   Sang warned, however, that competition from the United States
and Russia is likely to be fierce. Romania, the world champions,
also are favored for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Sang plans to watch the competition on television, but said she
does not expect to feel sorry that she will not be taking part.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't be sad. They're all my friends and I hope they will
win,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sang has no feeling below her chest, and initially had little
function in her arms. Though her medical condition has not changed
since her return to China, Sang said she has learned to do more
with the functions left intact. She deftly grasped a reporter's
name card between her fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Sang said she hopes to attend university in another year, though
is undecided on what subject to study.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she was among young handicapped Chinese meeting
reporters prior to touring the United States in a cultural
showcase. Sang will be reciting a poem she wrote in English during
the 10-show tour and said she is looking forward to seeing the
friends and physicians she met following her accident.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Drug Flow Little Changed  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decade ago in the same coastal city of
Cartagena, Colombia, that President Clinton visits Wednesday,
another American president hailed the creation of an ''anti-drug
cartel'' backed by $2.2 billion in U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   The summit with then-President Bush and three Latin American
presidents marked a milestone in international drug cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade later, overall cocaine production in the Andean
region remains about the same, Colombia has become a leading
producer of heroin, and the price of cocaine on U.S. streets has
fallen with declining demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drugs have gotten cheaper and more plentiful, and the trade
has become more fragmented,'' said Raphael Perl, a narcotics expert
at the Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's brief visit to Cartagena follows the approval of the
latest U.S. anti-drug plan, a $1.3 billion package that Clinton
will discuss with Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they now have a unique opportunity
to crush the Colombian drug trade. But opponents are skeptical it
will keep drugs off U.S. streets, especially while America remains
the leading consumer of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Even some supporters of the aid package agree it won't be enough
by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a problem in the United States that we're not going to
solve in Colombia or Peru or Ecuador or elsewhere,'' said Thomas
McNamara, U.S. ambassador to Colombia at the time of Bush's visit.
''We're going to solve it here in the United States or we're not
going to solve it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Feb. 15, 1990, visit to Cartagena was as memorable for
security concerns as for its purpose. It was the heyday of drug
lord Pablo Escobar, who waged a war of terror in Colombia. Some
feared Bush would be a target.
</P>
<P>
   The trip passed without incident and Bush signed an agreement
with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to fight the flow
of drugs and to exchange information and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was successful in that it created an atmosphere of
cooperation on the drug front for the first time,'' said Bernard
Aronson, who accompanied Bush as assistant secretary of state for
Inter-American Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting helped strengthen regional economic ties. And
subsequent years produced victories: drug cartels were destroyed,
Escobar was killed and the cultivation of coca, the raw material
for cocaine, dropped sharply in Peru and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia still poses problems. It remains the world's main
producer of cocaine and its coca cultivation has soared, from
92,700 acres in 1991 to 303,000 acres in 1999, the State Department
says. Moreover, Colombian traffickers are now major suppliers of
heroin to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Years of political instability have let the drug trade flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994-98 presidency of Ernesto Samper was marked by political
chaos following revelations his campaign received $6 million from
the Cali drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   And Pastrana's presidency has been beset by an economic crisis
and an intensification of a 36-year-old guerrilla war within
Colombia. Traffickers have been buying protection from both the
left-wing guerrillas and the right-wing paramilitaries vying with
them for territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration-pushed aid package is intended to
fight the narcotics and the instability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug,'' Clinton said
in a video address Tuesday to the Colombian people.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money will provide helicopters and other equipment
for two Colombian army anti-narcotics battalions, while about a
quarter of it is for social programs, such as helping displaced
Colombians and strengthening the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The army battalions can clear guerrillas from coca fields so the
crops can be sprayed with herbicides. Land, air and river patrols
can prevent precursor chemicals -- essential to turning coca into
cocaine -- from entering the region and cocaine from leaving. And
U.S. officials believe they can work with neighboring countries to
prevent the drug trade from relocating.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also hope that attacking the drug trade will cut
funding for guerrillas, giving them more incentive to negotiate
peace.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents fear it will only drive the United States into
Colombia's civil war. They also object to helping an army with a
poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than reducing coca cultivation and calming Colombia,
this is going to unleash Armageddon,'' said Bruce Bagley, a
University of Miami professor of international studies.
</P>
<P>
   He said coca cultivation will be pushed into other regions,
prompting clear-cutting of Amazon rain forest. More people will be
pushed out of their homes, some likely to join the guerrillas or
paramilitaries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rensselaer Lee, a consultant on international drug issues, said
traffickers have responded to pressures before by improving yield
and potency of coca crops, and they can do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Traffickers are adaptable,'' he said. ''They are very smart
people.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Discourage Russia Travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States may discourage U.S. business
travel to Russia if Moscow does not allow an American jailed on
espionage charges to return home, State Department spokesman Philip
Reeker indicated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright would continue to raise the case of Edmund Pope with
President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials as they have in
the past until it is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The treatment of Mr. Pope raises since his arrest by the
Russian government raises serious concerns about the safety and
security of American travelers in Russia and our ability to protect
the health and welfare of all American citizens,'' Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the State Department would issue an advisory warning
against travel to Russia, Reeker said, ''Obviously we have to
examine the implications of Russian action as this case is
prolonged.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was up to individuals to make their own decisions
about the countries to which they travel.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said Pope's wife, Cheryl saw him Tuesday for an hour and
a half accompanied by two U.S. consular officials. But he said Rep.
John Peterson, R-Pa., who accompanied Mrs. Pope to Moscow, was
denied permission to join the visit at Moscow's Lefortovo prison.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Federal Security Service arrested Pope April 3 for
allegedly buying plans for a high-tech submarine torpedo. Pope's
lawyer said he never intended to buy the secret plans.
</P>
<P>
   He faces 20 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has called for Pope's release, saying
Russian authorities have failed to provide evidence to support the
accusation. They have also requested specialized medical care.
Pope, 54, has a thyroid disease and previously was treated for bone
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a municipal judge rejected Pope's request for release
on bail for medical treatment despite a lawyer's argument that he
suffers headaches and dizziness in his jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer, worked for Penn
State's Applied Research Laboratory after retiring from the Navy
and later founded CERF Technologies International, a company
specialized in studying foreign maritime equipment. He frequently
traveled to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Paramedics aid police commissioner's baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik thanked
paramedics Tuesday for responding quickly to a 911 call his wife
made last week when their infant daughter was choking.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred last Friday evening, when Kerik was on his
way home from a dinner with First Deputy Commissioner Joseph Dunne
and Chief of Department Joseph Esposito.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife contacted me, and was very distraught and upset,''
Kerik said. ''My daughter had been choking.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics from the Fire Department responded and tended to his
5&AMP;frac12;-month-old daughter, Celine, and his wife, Halah, he said. The
baby was taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital as a precaution,
but was released.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a phenomenal job,'' Kerik added.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old commissioner said his daughter is teething and
had some saliva and mucus in her throat, and couldn't catch her
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very scary circumstance, to see your daughter choking,
so my wife called 911,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik got to his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx when
the paramedics - Mark Donnelly and Michael Dealmeida - were still
there, but asked them to come to Police Headquarters for a formal
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   The 911 call was received at 10:35 p.m. A firetruck from Engine
52 responded in minutes, followed by the paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik has a 15-year-old son, Joseph, from a previous marriage.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Demands Release of American  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States demanded Tuesday that Muslim
rebels in the southern Philippines immediately release an American
they kidnapped and threatened to kill.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said he had no
information on the condition of Jeffrey Schilling, of Oakland,
Calif. He would not say whether Schilling works for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf rebels holding Schilling and 17 others captive on
Jolo island suspect that Schilling works for the CIA, rebel
spokesman Abu Sabaya said in a Philippine radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, Schilling's mother, Carol, denied her son is a CIA
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Choking back tears, she said, ''I don't know what's going to
happen next. I'm just hoping everybody will pray for him. I'd like
him home safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schilling said her son went to visit the Philippines in
March partly because of a longtime interest in the region and to
see the sister of some friends in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, she said, he fell in love with the sister and
ended up staying in the Philippines, extending his tourist visa
twice. Mrs. Schilling said she tried to persuade him to return
home, but ''he was too much in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently she said her son had changed his mind and was preparing
to return this weekend to look for work and plan a future for
himself and his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Reeker said the United States
''strongly condemns this latest kidnapping, and we call for the
immediate, safe and unconditional release of this hostage and other
hostages still held captive as well on the island of Jolo.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials confirmed rebels kidnapped an American man
and threatened to kill him unless the United States accepts their
demands. The rebels said they would reveal their demands in three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said several U.S. Embassy officials flew to Zamboanga, on
the main southern island Mindinao, to discuss the kidnapping with
local officials. He said diplomats also contacted officials in
Manila, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States would accept Libyan help to secure
Schilling's release, Reeker said, ''We support efforts by
negotiators, whomever they may be, to find a quick resolution'' so
long as ransom is not paid. U.S. policy bars payments to buy
hostage freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Six hostages held by the same rebel group were released over the
weekend after Libya reportedly paid $6 million in ransom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's premature to make any specific statements on any
requests or offers or issues specifically involving the case,
because we're trying to determine all the facts,'' Reeker said.

<HEADLINE> NYPA to buy up to 11 gas turbine generator sets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Citing the need to ensure adequate power
supply for next summer, the New York Power Authority trustees
Tuesday authorized the purchase of up to 11 gas turbine generator
sets.
</P>
<P>
   NYPA officials said it will cost as much as $220 million to buy
up to 520 megawatts of electric generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   While plans to build new power plants in the state are being
discussed, officials said the earliest that any such project could
be completed would be in the summer of 2002. NYPA said the new
generators would help meet any potential shortfalls, or
''generation gap,'' by being in place by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Power Authority Chairman Clarence Rappleyea said it was
necessary to purchase the generating units immediately because of
global competition for the equipment. If NYPA doesn't act now,
Rappleyea said the units would ''most likely be unavailable when
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rappleyea said NYPA is looking for the best sites for the
generators, he said.

<HEADLINE> Accused carjacker of trooper's cruiser pleads innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) - A Union County man has pleaded innocent
to carjacking a State Police cruiser and another vehicle on the New
Jersey Turnpike during a snowstorm in January.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Montgomery, 30, of Hillside, entered his plea before
state Superior Court Judge John A. Sweeney on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in the Burlington County Jail in lieu of
$100,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery is accused of carjacking the cruiser of State Police
Sgt. Timothy Vanak on Jan. 25 in Chesterfield. Vanak had stopped to
help Montgomery, who he thought was a motorist stranded in the
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery sat in the back of the trooper's unmarked car while
Vanak called for a second trooper. When the second trooper arrived,
Vanak got out of the car, leaving Montgomery alone inside. Police
said Montgomery got behind the wheel and took off.
</P>
<P>
   Vanak scrambled into the back seat to try to stop him, but
Montgomery shoved a gun in the trooper's face, police said. The
trooper later jumped out of the moving car.
</P>
<P>
   The cruiser slid off the turnpike in Washington Township, Mercer
County, about 30 minutes later. Montgomery then carjacked a minivan
from two good Samaritans who had stopped to help him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery is charged with aggravated assault of a police
officer, two counts of carjacking, receiving stolen property,
weapons offenses and contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   State Police spokesman John Hagerty said the contempt of court
charge was filed because at the time of the carjacking, Montgomery
was wanted by the state Superior Court in Essex County for failing
to appear at a pretrial conference.

<HEADLINE> Final census estimate of the 90s shows less-white Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end of the 1990s brings a Connecticut that is less white and
more ethnically diverse than 10 years ago, the last census
estimates for the decade show.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates also suggest Connecticut has not gained back all
the people it lost during the economic recession of the mid-90s,
although the population is on the rise again.
</P>
<P>
   These estimates will be eclipsed by 2000 census figures that are
scheduled to be released in December.
</P>
<P>
   The projections released Wednesday offer some snapshots on the
estimated 3,282,031 people who call the Nutmeg State home:
</P>
<P>
   - Fairfield County has edged out Hartford County over the past
10 years as the most populous region of the state.
</P>
<P>
   - Windham and Tolland counties remain the least-settled.
</P>
<P>
   - Hispanics are poised to overtake black, non-Hispanic residents
as the biggest minority group in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   - The Asian population is estimated to have increased 60 percent
over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   - Litchfield County is home to the fewest nonwhite residents;
Fairfield has the most.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of minority groups said they are eager to see the real
numbers from the census that was taken this spring and summer.
Community groups and the census actively encouraged minority
participation in the survey, which was criticized for undercounting
minorities in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was more organized than previous efforts, but we don't know
how effective it's been,'' said Fernando Betancourt, executive
director of the state Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
   James Slaughter, the head of the state African-American Affairs
Commission, also said there was heightened awareness of the census
this time around, but it remained to be seen what the actual
numbers would show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly want to see if the Census Department - by having
these second and third checkbacks this time to homes - whether
that's going to help cut down on some of the undercount and how
deal with issue of homelessness this time around,'' Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter and Betancourt predicted Hispanics would surpass
non-Hispanic blacks in Connecticut soon, possibly affecting the
realignment of political districts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1999 census estimates, this change may already
be at hand because the Hispanic population is growing at a faster
rate than the non-Hispanic black population. Hispanics can be of
any race, and some people consider themselves to belong to more
than one census group.
</P>
<P>
   By looking at people who identified themselves as Hispanic or
not, the census projected that there were only about 3,700 more
non-Hispanic blacks than Hispanic blacks, whites, Asians or Indians
in the state in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth since 1990 was estimated to have increased
about 8 percent for non-Hispanic blacks and about 30 percent for
Hispanic blacks, whites, Asians and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has so many implications - for local funding, federal
funding, about where there's a concentration of Latinos and the
redistricting,'' Betancourt said. ''The new configuration affects
how many Latinos will maybe be in higher office.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the largest group by far remains non-Hispanic whites,
with an estimated population of 2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The white population, however, is the only subgroup to have lost
members over the past 10 years. The 1990 census recorded 2.7
million whites in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing racial group in the state were non-Hispanic
Asians. The census estimated there were 80,405 Asians in the state
in 1999, up from 49,776 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The non-Hispanic American Indian population was projected to
have increased 150 members, to 6,119.

<HEADLINE> Drug Reduces Heart Failure Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands (AP) -- A new heart drug has proven
effective in treating people with severe heart failure, reducing
deaths by 35 percent, research shows.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, carvedilol, belongs to a relatively new class of
medications called beta blockers, which lighten the heart's
workload. It had already proven effective in prolonging the lives
of people with mild to moderate stages of the disease, but doctors
had been reluctant to give it to severe heart failure patients.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the findings, presented Tuesday at a conference of
the European Society of Cardiology, should allay long-standing
concerns that beta blockers could make heart failure worse because
they depress the heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until recently, most of the trials that had been conducted
with beta blockers were in patients who had mild to moderate
disease. There was a lot of fear that these drugs would not work in
patients with advanced disease,'' said the study's leader, Dr.
Milton Packer, professor of medicine and director of the Heart
Failure Center at Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John McMurray, a cardiology professor at Glasgow University
in Scotland who was not connected with the research, said the
findings provide ''absolute, definite'' proof that beta blockers
are not only safe for people with severe heart failure but that
they can prolong their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a heart attack, heart failure is a progressive condition
in which the heart muscle becomes weakened after it is injured by
something like a heart attack or high blood pressure. The heart
gradually loses its ability to pump blood around the body, and in
the last stage of the disease patients need a machine to help them
do the heart's work.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, about 1.7 percent of adults have heart failure.
Beyond the age of 65, between 6 percent and 10 percent are living
with it. About 5 million Americans have it, and 250,000 of them die
from it every year.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis is similar to that of severe cancer, with about
three-quarters of patients dying within five years of diagnosis.
Once heart failure has become severe -- in about 10 to 15 percent of
cases -- only about half of patients survive for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The research presented Tuesday involved 2,289 people with severe
heart failure who did not need to be in the intensive care unit or
on heart machines at home. In addition to the medications they were
already on, half were given the beta blocker and half were given a
sugar pill.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the study had been going for 2&AMP;frac12; years, 35 percent
fewer patients had died in the group getting the beta blocker than
in the comparison group.
</P>
<P>
   While some drugs work better in specific ethnic groups or
regions, the benefit of carvedilol was consistent across the six
continents in the study and the lives of men and women, young and
old, were prolonged equally. The group on the fake pill reported
more side effects than those taking carvedilol, marketed by
SmithKline Beecham as Coreg.
</P>
<P>
   The research was abandoned more than a year early, in March,
after the ethics committee overseeing it determined the drug had
such a striking effect that it would be inappropriate to withhold
the treatment from those in the study who weren't getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have been proven to work in earlier stages of
heart failure, beta blockers are vastly underused, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''We estimate that about 75 percent to 80 percent of patients
with heart failure should be getting a beta blocker but only about
5 percent to 15 percent are getting one,'' Packer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Swedberg, chairman of the cardiology department at the
University of Gothenberg in Sweden, said that although beta
blockers are underused, they are still new. Ever since they were
proven last year to be the best treatment for mild to moderate
heart failure, many doctors have quickly started to prescribe them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sooner or later most patients with heart failure develop
severe heart failure,'' said Swedberg, who also headed the ethics
committee overseeing the study. ''Physicians are hesitant to take
up beta blockers, but when it's tolerated well, even in severe
heart failure, that should put their fears to rest.''

<HEADLINE> Religious leaders take diplomats' seats for peace conference at U.N. </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Crimson robes outnumbered gray suits and
nuns in saris sat next to swamis in turbans Tuesday at the United
Nations, where monks, a cardinal and even a business mogul
addressed more than 1,000 religious leaders at the Millennium World
Peace Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The summit's second day featured speeches from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and billionaire media czar Ted Turner,
and religion and politics looked set to cross paths during a
planned statement from the Dalai Lama. The head of Tibet's
delegation was to read the message later Tuesday on behalf of the
Nobel Peace laureate, who was not invited to the U.N. portion of
the conference for fear of offending China.
</P>
<P>
   Following a Monday evening of prayers by clan mothers and church
fathers, chief rabbis and high priests, Annan addressed the morning
session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Religious practices and beliefs are among the phenomena that
define us as human,'' he said. But ''religion has often been yoked
to nationalism, stoking the flames of violent conflict. ...
Religious leaders have not always spoken out when their voices
could have helped combat hatred and persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, whose U.N. Foundation, Better World Fund, helped pay for
the conference, struck a more informal note.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was born in a Christian family,'' said Turner, who once said
publicly that Christianity was ''for losers.''
</P>
<P>
   He dreamed of becoming ''a man of the cloth,'' he said, but was
bothered that his religious group taught that only Christians were
going to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought heaven was going to be a mighty empty place,'' he
said. ''Now I believe there may be one God who manifests himself in
different ways to different people. ... And I can't believe God
wants us to blow ourselves to kingdom come. He wants us to love
each other and live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadhvi Shilapiji, a Jain nun, said she found Turner's speech
''fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the feeling of the common man not burdened by any
religious or political affiliation,'' Shilapiji said. ''It came
from his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers Tuesday included Cardinal Francis Arinze,
president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interreligious
Dialogue; and Abdullah al-Obaid, secretary-general of the World
Muslim League.
</P>
<P>
   Participants say they hope the summit, which runs through
Thursday, will result in a declaration on peace, poverty and the
environment, as well as the formation of a council of religious
leaders to advise the United Nations on preventing and settling
disputes. Sessions were scheduled on the role of religion in
conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   And longtime rivals were looking to meet behind the scenes:
Eritrean Bishop Zekarias Yohannes planned to talk with leaders from
Ethiopia, the country with whom Eritrea fought a bitter border war,
and Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes to hold
discussions with Muslim sheiks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This afternoon, this General Assembly hall has become a
sanctuary,'' Bawa Jain, the summit general secretary, told an
audience Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But religious and political concerns collided earlier this month
when participants learned that conference organizers did not invite
the Dalai Lama to the first two days of the event for fear of
offending China, a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security
Council. China accuses the Tibetan Buddhist leader of ''creating
turmoil'' in Tibet, which he fled in 1959 after an abortive
uprising against China's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, the head of the eight-member Tibetan
Buddhist delegation, Drikung Chestsang Rinpoche, planned to read a
statement by the Dalai Lama. The Office of Tibet, the U.S.
representative of the Dalai Lama, said it would be the first time
Tibetans representing the Buddhist leader have spoken in the
General Assembly Hall since the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very sad, and I feel happy,'' said another Dalai Lama
disciple, the Rev. Tsona Gontse Rinpoche. ''This is a historic
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers invited the Dalai Lama only to the last two days of
the conference - being held at a New York hotel. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations did not sponsor the event or issue
invitations. An interfaith coalition organized the program and
picked the participants. The only delegations chosen by their
government were China's and Vietnam's.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other leaders on the program were the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Cambodian Buddhist leader Samdech Preah Maha Ghosananda
and the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric. Leaders who declined
to come include Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, who sent a
videotaped message, and Jerusalem Mufti Ikrema Sabri, who has
refused to meet with Rabbi Lau.

<HEADLINE> French Interior Minister Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The quarter-century of Corsican separatist violence
that has stymied successive French governments led to the
resignation Tuesday of France's respected interior minister,
creating cracks in the left's governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Chevenement, 61, who served three years as interior
minister, said his departure was the ''logical consequence'' of his
open disagreement with the Socialist-led government on a peace plan
for Corsica.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a three-decade friendship with Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, Chevenement said he could not defend the peace plan
before parliament in December. Daniel Vaillant, 51, Socialist
minister for parliamentary relations and a member of Jospin's inner
circle, was named to replace Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's peace plan would give the local Corsican assembly
limited legislative power. Chevenement fears that would fracture
France and encourage armed nationalists seeking more autonomy to
blackmail Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow, you could imagine a Basque parliament, a Breton
parliament. ... It's an attack on the definition of France,''
Chevenement said in an interview on evening television news.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time that Chevenement has resigned from a
ministerial post -- in character with the man who once said, ''A
minister shuts his mouth or resigns.'' His departure was a
cumbersome political development for Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement's Movement of Citizens was a critical element of
Jospin's so-called ''plural left'' that also includes Socialists,
Communists and Greens in the coalition government. Jospin has held
the coalition together since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents said Chevenement's departure was a sign the
left was weakening.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation ''is a failure for Lionel Jospin,'' said Michele
Alliot-Marie, the head of President Jaques Chirac's conservative
Rally for the Republic party. ''In his own camp, we see his closest
people ... denounce the ambiguities and risks of the accord ...
just as we have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Georges Sarre, a member of Chevenement's faction had a different
take. He said the minister's departure ''does not put into question
the participation of the Movement of Citizens in the plural left.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jospin appeared weakened. It was the second Cabinet
shuffle in five months, and Labor Minister Martine Aubry is
expected to go this fall to run for mayor of Lille.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with violence in Corsica has been a burning issue
for the nine months since Jospin opened negotiations that led to a
peace plan. The plan, widely approved by Corsican lawmakers in
July, would give Corsica limited rights to pass its own laws
starting in 2004 if peace is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Corsican nationalist Jean-Guy Talamoni, who helped negotiate the
plan, said that with Chevenement's departure ''an obstacle has been
lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement resigned from two other ministerial posts because of
policy disagreements. In 1983 he quit as industry minister, and in
1991 he resigned as defense minister, disapproving of France's role
in the multinational force in the Gulf War against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Studies Target Cause of Narcolepsy  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A chemical that transmits signals in the brain
-- discovered just two years ago -- may hold clues to the cause of
the rare but dangerous disease narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy is marked by recurring episodes of daytime sleep in
the victim, lasting from a few seconds to an hour. The disease can
be merely inconvenient to some victims, but disabling and dangerous
to others who may fall asleep while driving or operating machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulant drugs help some victims but can cause side effects.
The cause of the disease has eluded researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that a specific brain chemical is involved in
narcolepsy could point the way for researchers to seek new
treatments for the disease. There are about 125,000 narcolepsy
patients in the United States. The disease usually strikes in the
mid-teens to about age 25 and visits both sexes equally.
</P>
<P>
   The two new studies are complimentary, ''we both find that these
cells are disappearing,'' said Dr. Emmanuel Mignot of Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Mignot reports in the September issue of Nature
Medicine that they found a lack of the chemical hypocretin in the
brains of narcolepsy victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocretins, which they noted were discovered just two years
ago, are a type of neurotransmitter produced by the hypothamlus
region of the brain. Prior studies have shown these signal
transmitters to stimulate appetite and arousal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The finding that hypocretins are absent in most cases (of
narcolepsy) ... strongly supports a central role for hypocretin
deficiency in the human disorder,'' they reported.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers added that their findings ''suggest a loss of
neurons that may be irreversible once the disease is fully
established.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study in the journal Neuron, researchers at the
University of California, Los Angeles, reported finding that
narcolepsy patients had a dramatic, degenerative loss of a type of
brain cell called Hcrt. Hcrt cells, or neurons, contain hypocretin
and are located in the hypothalamus.
</P>
<P>
   Those researchers, led by Dr. Jerome M. Siegel, found that the
number of Hcrt neurons in narcoleptics was 85 percent to 95 percent
less than the number found in non-narcoleptic brains. But they
found no loss of other cells normally found intermixed with Hcrt
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it is clear that the degenerative loss of Hcrt cells is
directly linked to narcolepsy, the cause of this cell loss remains
to be determined,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams suggested the possibility of autoimmune disease, and
Siegel's group noted that the presence of gliosis, or scarring,
indicates a degenerative process.
</P>
<P>
   Mignot's group also noted that autoimmune processes, when the
body attacks itself, have been suspected for years.
</P>
<P>
   But those researchers found no recent inflammation that would
indicate such a process, though it could have occurred much
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''More surprisingly,'' they said, ''we also did not detect
significant residual gliosis and-or cellular loss in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Mignot's team also looked for genetic changes that could have
led to the loss of hypocretin, but found a mutation in only one
narcolepsy patient, an unusual case occurring in a young child.

<HEADLINE> Seven-alarm fire destroys four Wildwood stores but spares chapel  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) - An early morning fire destroyed four
Boardwalk stores Tuesday and caused an estimated $1 million in
damages. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-alarm fire, reported about 1:30 a.m., burned for more
than 12 hours, gutting an unoccupied two-story building at Baker
Avenue and the Boardwalk that housed two clothing stores, a T-shirt
shop and a dollar store.
</P>
<P>
   But it spared the Boardwalk Chapel, a storefront chapel located
immediately next door, where about 20 teen-agers from a youth group
were staying.
</P>
<P>
   The youths were awakened by a pizza shop owner who smelled smoke
coming from the adjacent building and knocked on the chapel doors.
They escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flames were about 20 feet up in the air, and there was
water coming from everywhere,'' said Kathy Poneleit, 37, of
Washington, D.C., who was awakened in her hotel by the smell of
smoke and walked to the fire. ''It was an amazing sight to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving firefighters attempted to extinguish the blaze on the
ground floor of the building, where much of the merchandise had
been stored, according to Fire Chief Connie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the fire was fueled by plastic toys, stuffed animals and
other combustibles, and firefighters were driven back, he said.
After three attempts, they gave up and instead began attempting to
contain the fire, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At 3 a.m., we started praying for God's intervention,'' said
Elder Jon Stevenson, director of the Presbyterian chapel. ''God
uses many ways to carry out his purpose. This morning, it was the
firemen he chose to use.''
</P>
<P>
   The chapel sustained some smoke damage, and its white vinyl
siding was singed but was otherwise unscathed. Also untouched was
the construction site of a $70 million convention center being
built on the beach, about 50 yards from the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing smoke enveloped the steel girders of the convention
center construction, but work continued unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 firefighters from four communities - Wildwood, North
Wildwood, Wildwood Crest and West Wildwood - battled the fire.
There was no reason to believe it was set, but the county fire
marshal and county prosecutor will investigate anyway, as a matter
of course, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just really stubborn,'' said Wildwood firefighter Aldo
Sacco. ''It wouldn't go out.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., several firefighters remained at the scene, shooting
water from water cannons at hot spots in the building. The fire was
brought under control at 5 a.m. but wasn't extinguished entirely as
of late Tuesday afternoon, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   A 140-foot section of the Boardwalk itself sustained damage from
falling roof sections and the use of heavy firefighting equipment,
but it was minor, according to Alan Christenson, a public works
supervisor who inspected it.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the store where the fire apparently began said he
left work at 8:30 p.m. Monday, but that a manager worked until 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, whom he did not name, saw nothing amiss when he
left, according to Made in USA owner Neil Hamui.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the smoldering ruins of the store, standing in a
street flooded with water from the firefighting efforts, Hamui
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been here for five years, and then one day it all goes
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern half of the Boardwalk was reopened about 11 a.m. but
fire equipment and burned-out sections of building remained on the
other half.
</P>
<P>
   The fire occurred three days before the start of the Labor Day
weekend, the last fling of summer for vacationers and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely bad timing,'' said Johnson. ''But the
Boardwalk will be open.''

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Distribution Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday barred
distribution of marijuana to people in California whose doctors
recommend it for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The court, voting 7-1 to grant an emergency Clinton
administration request, postponed the effect of federal court
rulings that would have allowed a California club to distribute the
illegal drug for medicinal use.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers had sought emergency help from Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, who referred the request to the full court.
</P>
<P>
   Only Justice John Paul Stevens dissented. He said the government
''has failed to demonstrate that the denial of necessary medicine
to seriously ill and dying patients will advance the public
interest or that the failure to enjoin the distribution of such
medicine will impair the orderly enforcement of federal criminal
statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer disqualified himself from the case.
His brother, Charles, a federal trial judge in San Francisco,
previously had barred distribution of marijuana only to have his
decision reversed by a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The highest court's action, which came in a brief order, was the
latest development in a conflict between federal narcotics laws and
a 1996 California voters' initiative known as Proposition 215.
</P>
<P>
   The state initiative allows seriously ill patients to grow and
use marijuana for pain relief, with a doctor's recommendation,
without state penalties. But federal law says marijuana has no
medical purposes and cannot be administered safely under medical
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives similar to California's have been passed in Alaska,
Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In the California case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that ''medical necessity'' is a ''legally cognizable
defense'' to a charge of distributing drugs in violation of a
federal law, the Controlled Substances Act.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that ruling, Judge Charles Breyer said the Oakland
Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative could provide marijuana to people
facing imminent harm from serious medical conditions and for whom
legal alternatives to marijuana do not work or cause intolerable
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers called the 9th Circuit court's
''unprecedented ruling'' a dangerous one because it created
''incentives for drug manufacturers and distributors to invoke the
asserted needs of others as a justification for their drug
trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's emergency request said allowing such
distribution of marijuana would ''promote disrespect and disregard
for an act of Congress that is central to combating illicit drug
trafficking and use by giving a judicial stamp of approval to the
open and notorious distribution of (illegal) substances to
potentially thousands of users without any of the strict controls
required'' by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In response, lawyers for the marijuana club argued that the
government's emergency request be rejected. ''The government has
provided no evidence that states ... that have passed medical
cannabis laws have any difficulty prosecuting violations of their
drug statutes,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is U.S. v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, A-145.

<HEADLINE> Peru Denies Berenson Intervention  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The head of President Alberto Fujimori's
Cabinet denied Tuesday that the government intervened to overturn
Lori Berenson's life sentence and grant a civilian trial to the New
York native, convicted more than four years ago of terrorism by a
secret military court.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians have charged the surprise decision by the
military court on Monday was another example of government
manipulation in Peru's legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presumption is that this came from government intervention
in the judiciary,'' Prime Minister Federico Salas told foreign
correspondents. ''In the case of Lori Berenson, nothing more was
done than confirm the actions of those within the country that have
powers over judicial affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The central government doesn't meddle in the military or
civilian courts,'' he said, adding that both he and Fujimori
remained opposed to the decision. Fujimori had still not commented
publicly on the military court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Council of Military Justice offered no explanation
Monday for why it voided Berenson's conviction and passed her case
to a civilian court.
</P>
<P>
   The former Massachusetts Institute of Technology student was
found guilty of treason in January 1996 for allegedly helping the
leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's
Congress. Peruvian authorities say they foiled the alleged plan.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Clinton administration has urged Peru to grant
Berenson a new trial, arguing that the secret nature of her trial
didn't meet due process standards. Berenson and her supporters have
maintained that she was not allowed to present evidence at her
trial or to question prosecution witnesses before being sentenced
by a hooded judge.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has steadfastly sworn the 30-year-old would serve out
her life sentence in a Peruvian prison.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated that position in April during his re-election
campaign. He portrayed his presidential opponent, Alejandro Toledo,
as weak on terrorism for suggesting that Berenson's case might be
reviewed after a reform of Peru's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a brutal campaign saying Toledo wants to liberate
the terrorists, that Toledo is a terrorist,'' Toledo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the Berenson decision was a dangerous move for a
weak court system that is vulnerable to government intervention and
private interests. He warned that without proper judicial reforms
in place, the move could pave the legal groundwork for the release
of other convicted leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson has denied that she helped mastermind the alleged plot
and insists she was never a member of the rebel group, commonly
known by its Spanish acronym, MRTA. But sympathy is not evident
from Peruvians, who were caught in the cross fire of rebel violence
during the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Burned into their memories is the image of Berenson's 1996
public pre-sentence declaration in which she angrily screamed
support for Peru's poor and shouted, ''There are no criminal
terrorists in the MRTA. It is a revolutionary movement.'' The
statement was considered by most here to be an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also alleged the announcement of the new trial was ''a
smoke screen'' to divert Washington's attention from an arms
trafficking scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's military has been implicated in the purchase of
Russian-assault rifles from Jordan that were later diverted to
leftist Colombian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori claimed credit last week for busting the arms
trafficking ring, which he said included a low-ranking retired
Peruvian army officer. He and Peru's defense minister have denied
the armed forces had any direct role in the arms dealing.
</P>
<P>
   International pressure has mounted on Fujimori to improve Peru's
damaged democracy since he claimed victory in a May presidential
runoff, amid irregularities and allegations of fraud.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Gov. Vetoes Abortion Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A law that would have made abortions for rape
victims a crime was vetoed on Tuesday by the Guanajuato state
governor after a nationwide furor.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ramon Martin Huerta's veto was a setback for social
conservatives emboldened by their party's presidential victory last
month behind Vicente Fox and for Roman Catholic leaders who mounted
an unusually open campaign for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Guanajuato state legislature, dominated by members of Fox's
National Action Party, voted on Aug. 3 to tighten laws against
abortion by removing a clause that allowed it in cases of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said the law promoted life and said rape victims who
had an abortion were not likely to be sent to prison. Abortion
rights groups said it added to the horror of rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   Huerta vetoed the measure after commissioning a public opinion
poll that showed most state residents opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   National Action legislator Miguel Cortes told the Guanajuato
newspaper Correo that the survey was based on ''lies and
falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is, with few exceptions, illegal in Mexico, and a move
to make the laws in one state even tighter turned the issue into an
unwelcome challenge for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office Dec. 1 as the first president in 71 years
not from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, said during the
campaign that he opposed abortion but did not favor changing the
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The measure caused a furor among women's rights groups across
Mexico, who were already protesting a case in which a 13-year-old
girl was pressured to have her rapist's child in Baja California
state -- also governed by National Action.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's leftist Mayor responded by pushing through a law
here that allowed abortions in cases of danger to a woman's life or
of birth defects. Bishop Luis Reynoso Cervantes, the legal adviser
to the Mexican bishops' council, responded by calling the city's
mayor ''a murderer and a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that doctors who perform abortions would be
excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   The open political activity by church leaders was dramatic in a
country that has sharply restricted the church's rights since the
mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guanajuato is not an isolated case,'' said Eduardo del
Castillo, spokesman for the Reproductive Rights Information Group
in Mexico City. ''It only revealed that there are ultra-rightist
groups that are attempting the absolute criminalization of
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said experts estimate there are 850,000 clandestine abortions
yearly in Mexico, and that as many as 1,500 women a year die of
bungled abortions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Woman Seeks Husband's Release  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The wife of a U.S. businessman jailed by Russian
authorities on espionage charges campaigned for his release Tuesday
in Moscow, saying he has done nothing wrong and was wasting away in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pope said her husband, Edmund, appeared exhausted and
clung to her for a long time when she visited him Tuesday in
Lefortovo prison for the second time since his April 3 arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband looked weak and fragile and tired, and he didn't
look good at all,'' she said. ''He's concerned about his health.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Pope has a rare form of bone cancer, which was in
remission when he left for Russia in March, his family says.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Federal Security Service arrested Pope for allegedly
buying plans for a high-tech submarine torpedo. He faces 20 years
in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pope and the Popes' representative in Congress, John
Peterson of Pennsylvania, said at a press conference that Russian
officials should transfer Pope to a hospital where he can be
examined by American doctors using up-to-date diagnostic equipment,
or at least allow a U.S. doctor to examine him in jail.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the security service has refused and a Moscow court has
upheld the refusal.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, 54, has reported headaches and dizziness that could mean
his cancer has returned, Peterson said. ''If Ed Pope does not get
quality medical care, he may die,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson and Cheryl Pope say the charges are groundless because
the information he was seeking was not secret. ''There's no basis
for the charges, no basis for any of it,'' she said. ''He was
invited and he was working with open technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope, a retired naval intelligence officer, runs CERF
Technologies International, a consulting firm in State College,
Pa., that developed commercial contacts with Russian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pope said her husband was sharing a cell with five other
inmates at Lefortovo. She said they sat on a couch and talked in
the presence of two Russian investigators and their interpreter.
Two U.S. diplomats also were present, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said Pope was seeking to acquire information on an
underwater propulsion system that was at least 10 years old and had
already been sold abroad through someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed Pope is not a spy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The security service said in a statement last week that Pope was
using ''forms and methods of work that are completely in keeping
with the practice of military intelligence common in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said efforts by the U.S. government to lobby for Pope's
freedom were being hampered because Russian authorities have not
revealed specifics of charges so they can be rebutted.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTNOR, N.J. (AP) - Two giant turtles washed up dead on New
Jersey beaches Tuesday, but authorities said the incidents were
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Both were 4-foot-long loggerhead turtles weighing more than 300
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The first was spotted on the beach here at Pittsburgh Avenue
early Tuesday morning, according to Sheila Dean, co-director of the
Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what killed the turtle, which was already
decomposed when it was beached. For more than nine hours, the
turtle lay on the beach, with sunbathers and Boardwalk passers-by
gathering around it to gawk.
</P>
<P>
   The second turned up on a beach in Avalon. It had apparently
been hit by a boat. Propeller marks were visible on its shell, Dean
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such strandings are not unusual, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have them all the time. It's just something we get in the
late summer and early fall every year,'' said Dean.

<HEADLINE> Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader makes Buffalo stop  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Green Party candidate Ralph Nader has been
called a spoiler in this year's presidential race, taking votes
away from Democrat Al Gore and giving Republican George W. Bush an
extra nudge in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The way he sees it, ''You can't spoil a system that's spoiled to
the core.'' Besides, Nader said during a campaign stop Tuesday,
''the outcome could be that Gore is taking votes away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first campaign stop in upstate New York's largest city by
any presidential candidate, Nader characterized the Democratic and
Republican parties as ''look-alike parties'' whose candidates are
indistinguishable on the major issues of the day: ''the really big
issues of democracy and the concentration of power and the denial
of labor and consumer rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ''On the issue of your tax dollars going to subsidize stadiums
and ball parks instead of rebuilding schools and public
transportation, the Republicans and Democrats are the same,'' Nader
added, touching a nerve here, where leaders have been tapped to
help out professional sports teams and the school buildings are the
oldest in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Green Party platform is the deepest, the broadest, the
fairest, the most farseeing, the most constructive political
platform in America today,'' he told about 200 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Painting Gore as having ''surrendered to corporate polluters''
and Bush as ''the corporate welfare king,'' Nader said the
expectation level in the country is far lower than it should be
because big business has put the kibosh on things like adequate
paid maternity leave and vacations and universal health care -
things western European countries have had for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's our excuse? Big business controls this country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed a universal health care system with public funding,
private delivery and controls against profiteering and malpractice,
similar to Canada's single-payer system.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged price restraints for drugs that are developed with
taxpayer dollars and then farmed out to pharmaceutical companies to
sell at huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of giving away a monopoly on these taxpayer-funded
drugs to just one company, multiple licenses should be issued to
any company that wants to sell them,'' he said. ''That would create
competition and bring down prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader saved his harshest words for the Democratic Party itself,
which he said has been too quick to blame the Republican-controlled
Congress for its shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ''How low must our expectations get, in terms of Washington
politics, before we blame adequately the Democratic Party for
allowing the right wing of the opposing Republican Party to gain
control of the Congress?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't rely on the Democratic Party to save our
Legislature, our Congress, from the likes of Newt Gingrich and
Trent Lott, Tom Delay and Dick Armey - among the most craven, the
most evil members of the Congress in recent years - what good are
they?'' he said. ''What good are the Democrats?''
</P>
<P>
   A day after a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of likely voters showed
the consumer advocate at 3 percent, Nader was critical of a
decision by the Commission on Presidential Debates to exclude
candidates who draw less than 15 percent in national polls. Without
national debate exposure the poll results won't easily change,
Nader said, pointing to Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was at 8 percent in the polls of Minnesota until he got on
the debates,'' Nader said, ''and he got on 10 debates and he went
on to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The least Nader is hoping for is 5 percent of the vote, the
threshold at which parties qualify for federal funding.

<HEADLINE> Whitman wants health care, campaign finance on fall legislative agenda </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman wants to rewrite the
state's campaign finance laws, increase funding for health care
programs, help patients with HMO problems and fight home
improvement scam artists.
</P>
<P>
   And she says it can all be done this fall - if the Legislature
cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in her two terms, Whitman detailed her plans
for an upcoming legislative session during a meeting with reporters
invited to her office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to lay out what we need to get done now,''
Whitman said, adding that she's doing this now before the looming
governor's race draws attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are things I think we can get done this fall,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman wants advocacy groups that campaign for or against
candidates to identify their donors. She wants the matching state
funds for out-of-state contributors to the governor's race
eliminated. Taxpayers donate two dollars for every one dollar
raised over a set threshold by candidates who raise enough private
funds to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   And Whitman wants these approved changes before election day
Nov. 7. That would force her potential successors to campaign by
her rules.
</P>
<P>
   Topping her list of reforms is the new disclosure laws.
</P>
<P>
   Groups often attack candidates but rarely make public who
finances their advertising campaign, Whitman said. Organizers
choose names that belie their agenda, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it really helps the public to know how much
credibility to give it if they know who's behind it,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have the right to raise money, but citizens deserve
to know where it comes from, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is good for the public to know who is contributing here,
but we have these loopholes,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey residents should expect to hear from national groups
promoting their specific agendas and candidates in the next
campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the electorate to have as much information as they can
have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Specific legislation is not completed, Whitman said, but her
legal advisers say the proposals will withstand court challenges.
Many campaign finance reforms are said to infringe on
constitutional rights of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to hamper free speech,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's only proposals that had specific price tags attached
were her health care initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The governor would increase the number of people receiving
health care by raising the cutoff for the Family Care program.
</P>
<P>
   People who leave welfare for work programs earn more than the
federal poverty level of $8,000 - the current maximum for the
health insurance. Whitman said that should be increased to cover
people earning the minimum wage, about 130 percent of the federal
level.
</P>
<P>
   That would cost the state $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something I think we need to do,'' Whitman said.
''We're so focused on welfare to work and making it work. One of
the most important things we can do is remove barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators will also be asked to approve increases in Medicaid
payments to doctors and in the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the
Aged and Disabled program. PAAD benefits provide state-subsidized
prescriptions for those over 65 and disabled people over 18 can
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still not providing everything we could for our
seniors,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The current budget includes $25 million for increases beginning
in January. The program would need $50 million for a full year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also suggested a state panel to aid patients
through the ''cumbersome process'' of challenging HMO insurance
decisions. Disappointed patients should be able to sue the
insurance company, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another consumer protection proposal would target home
improvement contractors. If it becomes law, all contractors would
be registered with the state. Whitman would increase criminal
penalties for consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many of these people are fly by night,'' Whitman said.
''You have no way to get back at them because you don't know who
they are.''

<HEADLINE> SAfrica Leaders Get Into Racism Spat  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- It was supposed to be a
gathering of reconciliation, with South African civic leaders,
politicians and professors working to overcome the racial wounds
that continue to fester here six years after the fall of the racist
apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   But the national conference on racism beginning Wednesday
threatens to be overshadowed by a nasty racial spat between
President Thabo Mbeki and the white leader of the opposition
Democratic Party, Tony Leon.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing media battle using Shakespeare allusions and
idioms from the American West, Mbeki has called Leon a racist
seeking to divide the country, while Leon has accused Mbeki of
using race as a weapon to bludgeon his critics.
</P>
<P>
   The argument came as a government minister criticized white
women for being apathetic to civic life in South Africa and the
country's Human Rights Commission issued a report calling the media
a racist institution dominated by minority whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be stupid and ignorant not to recognize that race and
racism is very real in South Africa, even now,'' said Sean Jacobs,
a political analyst with the Institute for Democracy in South
Africa. Racism is almost part of the national fabric, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Mbeki and Leon began with a little reported
speech Leon made last month, criticizing Mbeki's controversial
stance on fighting the AIDS pandemic in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has ''a near-obsession with finding 'African solutions' to
every problem -- even if this means flouting scientific facts about
AIDS in favor of snake-oil cures and quackery,'' Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki responded during a high-profile lecture Aug. 11, in which
he referred to Leon only as ''the white politician,'' and compared
him to Prospero in Shakespeare's ''The Tempest,'' who enslaves the
inhabitants of a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   ''The white politician makes bold to speak openly of his disdain
and contempt for African solutions to the challenges that face the
people of our continent,'' he said. ''According to him ... these
solutions, because they are African, could not but consist of
pagan, savage, superstitious and unscientific responses typical of
the African people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon later said he was simply using innocent idioms from the
American Old West to refer to Virodene, an AIDS drug developed by
South Africa that was found to contain an industrial solvent, and
Mbeki's AIDS advisory panel, which includes controversial
scientists who have questioned the link between HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's response was ''sheer opportunism and vote seeking,''
Leon said Tuesday. The president was simply using race to distract
his voters from more serious issues in advance of local government
elections in November, Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki and Leon, however, were not actually talking to each
other, but to their very divided constituencies: Mbeki to the
mainly black African National Congress electorate and Leon to his
overwhelmingly white voters, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Leon has asked that the exchange be discussed at the racism
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Pityana, the head of the South African Human Rights
Commission, which is running the conference, has said the argument
is unlikely to affect the four days of speeches and workshops,
covering everything from the history of racism to reconciliation
and nation building.
</P>
<P>
   Pityana released a report last week criticizing the nation's
media as racist and suggesting that journalists receive sensitivity
training and news organizations create a code of conduct to punish
racist conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The report and the Leon-Mbeki disagreement came as many white
South Africans were already angry with Safety and Security Minister
Steve Tshwete for criticizing white women for not taking part in
celebrations on National Women's Day, which commemorates a 1956
women's demonstration against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attending the important rallies, white women were
busy shopping, Tshwete said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still tensions in this society which play themselves
out along the lines of race, and that's not surprising,'' said Tom
Lodge, professor of political science at the University of the
Witwatersrand. ''It's a good thing that they are talked about more
openly than they were four or five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The racism conference, however, may be less effective in
stopping that racism than a strong set of laws against
discrimination, Lodge said.

<HEADLINE> Number of students taking SAT in state increases  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The number of public school students who
sharpened their No. 2 pencils and took the SAT test increased this
year, putting New Jersey in a tie for first in that category.
</P>
<P>
   But the test scores themselves grew only slightly, with both
math and verbal results below national averages, according to
figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey students scored an average of 513 on the math portion
of the test and 498 on the verbal section.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, students averaged 514 in math, a 30-year high,
according to the College Board, which administers the tests. The
verbal score was 505 for the fifth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she was impressed by the test scores,
and by the fact that averages are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are continuing to close the gap in our average scores
compared with national averages, which is truly impressive, given
that we are also increasing the number and percentage of students
who take the test,'' Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials touted the fact that New Jersey's
average scores have increased since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Math scores increased 15 points over the 498 average posted a
decade ago. Verbal results went from 495 to this year's 498.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like most other states, our main focus in New Jersey is to
increase student performance against our own carefully developed
academic standards,'' state Education Commissioner David Hespe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, I am pleased to see that this year's SAT results
continue a trend of improvement while providing opportunities for
more students to demonstrate that they are ready to continue their
education after high school,'' Hespe said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the College Board, 84 percent of the nation's
colleges use SAT scores as a factor in admitting students.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, 81 percent of public high school graduates took
the test, one point higher than last year according to the state's
Education Department. That ties New Jersey with Connecticut for
first in the country, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe said that is an encouraging sign since school officials
know more students would mean lower state averages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet, each year, they demonstrate their commitment to broad
student participation over selective encouragement of a smaller
group of high achievers,'' Hespe said.

   He had secured a place in Africa's heart and history by visiting
twice, and this time he could visit Africa's most populous nation,
Nigeria, which moved from pariah to partner during his time in
office.
</P>
<P>
   But once he left for Tanzania and joined a roomful of African
leaders, Clinton's sojourn took a strange turn.
</P>
<P>
   And by time he left Tuesday, he was empty-handed, without the
full cease-fire for Burundi that would have been a fitting climax
for his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended his four-day trip with a brief visit to Cairo,
seeking Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's help in pursuing a peace
deal between Israel and the Palestinians, another situation
balanced on the edge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admit, I am an outsider. I admit I have not been here with
you,'' Clinton said in Arusha, where Nelson Mandela has sought to
negotiate an end to ethnic strife in Burundi that has killed
200,000 people in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''If you let this moment slip away, it will dig
the well of bitterness deeper and pile the mountain of grievances
higher. Someday, when somebody else has to come here and sit at a
table like this, they will have an even harder job than you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burundi peace collapse stood in contrast Clinton's welcome
got in Nigeria. President Olusegun Obasanjo gave him three names,
one from each of Nigeria's tribes. As Clinton left, Obasanjo held
Clinton's hand and walked him to his limousine, even though Clinton
had been vague in responding to Obasanjo's plea for help in easing
Nigeria's debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   He was held in high esteem among workaday Nigerians. After
shaking Clinton's hand in the hardscrabble village of Ushafa,
Evelyn Anieze, 28, said she was impressed that Clinton made a point
to mingle among the poorest, like her.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the slick, muddy roads and chickens scurrying about, she
said, ''We love that he would come here to see this Nigeria, for
this -- this! -- is Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos Shekogaza, 38, a businessman and political organizer in
Ushafa, saw the potential for significant U.S. investment now that
Clinton has visited. To him, significant investment meant a small
factory or a new school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have lights here now. We have water,'' Shekogaza said.
''Whatever will come, we will accept. A beggar has no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, Clinton's envoy for democracy in Africa, worried
about that mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some would look at him, because of the gifts of charisma and
spiritual attraction, and see him as a kind of Santa Claus,''
Jackson said. ''He is not a Santa Claus. He is a strategic partner.
With him as a strategic partner, you maintain your dignity and
honor, both of which are non-negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 30-mile drive through pastoral lands into Arusha, tens of
thousands of Tanzanians cheered and waved American and Tanzanian
flags. Those without flags pulled leafy twigs from the trees and
waved them.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Clinton found himself among a hodge podge of African
leaders: Daniel arap Moi of Kenya. Jerry Rawlings of Ghana. Even
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was represented by his son. Clinton
settled comfortably among them, listening, chin in hand, as Mandela
-- the former political prisoner who became South Africa's first
black president in 1994 and led the country away from apartheid --
chastised Burundi's Hutus and Tutsis for failing to put the lives
of their people ahead of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want any part of the world, especially Africa, where
children, women, the disabled, and the aged are slaughtered every
day,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the factions to heed Mandela. ''He's the world's
greatest example of letting things go,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, half of Burundi's Tutsi politicians reluctantly
signed a power-sharing agreement, but more negotiations will be
needed to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, African leaders say Clinton's presence indicated a change
in the way Africa's issues are viewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has supported our efforts at finding ... African solutions
to African problems,'' Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said.
''An African proverb says, 'Only the owner can free his home from
mice.'''

<HEADLINE> Xerox, once a symbol of corporate success, struggles to compete  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Xerox, of all things, is going trendy.
</P>
<P>
   The company has just launched the most expensive advertising
campaign in its history using Blue Dog, the popular dog with bright
yellow eyes who has a cultlike following.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Blue Dog - the subject of popular paintings by New
Orleans artist George Rodrigue - is no accident for a company
suffering from an image as a stodgy, Old Economy company that can't
keep up.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than $200 million, Xerox is hoping the ads
will help customers realize it makes the latest, high-tech inkjet
printers for the small and home office market, for as little as
$149.
</P>
<P>
   In television commercials that began airing last week, brightly
colored paintings of various small businesses are featured in an
art gallery, with the Blue Dog prominent in each, while an
announcer extolls the virtues of a $149 Xerox printer. ''They're
just a smarter breed of inkjet printer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The company's outdated image is just one of a myriad of problems
at Xerox, a company that was once considered a symbol of corporate
success.
</P>
<P>
   Its copiers were so popular in the 1960s and '70s that the name
''Xerox'' became synonymous with copying, just as the ''Kleenex''
brand became synonymous with tissues.
</P>
<P>
   But Xerox has struggled for more than a year now with slumping
profits, a botched sales force reorganization and a stock price
that has plummeted to one-third of its value a year ago. The stock
closed Monday at $17.12&AMP;frac12;, compared with a high of $50.12&AMP;frac12; a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company announced it would slash 5,200 jobs and
close manufacturing plants to reduce its cost structure so it could
stay competitive with companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Canon and
Ricoh.
</P>
<P>
   The last year was not supposed to be a nightmare for Xerox. In
April 1999, the company made Rick Thoman its chief executive.
Thoman was a former IBM executive credited with helping to engineer
that company's turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman, who had joined Xerox in 1997, had already been
instrumental in the company's push to sell its digital products in
low-end retail outlets such as Staples and Office Max.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Xerox was already struggling to reduce costs as it
shifted from old-style copiers that operate with lenses and lights
to multipurpose digital models that can be upgraded to print, scan
and fax documents when connected to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also in the midst of cutting 9,000 jobs, or just
under 10 percent of its worldwide work force.
</P>
<P>
   But under Thoman's reign, a massive reorganization of the
company's sales force was clumsily executed and slowed productivity
and sales. The idea was to reorganizing the sales force by
industry, rather than the traditional geographic organization used
by Xerox for years.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman was fired in May, just 13 months after he took the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allaire, who Thoman had replaced as CEO, agreed to come
back on a temporary basis. The company elevated Anne Mulcahy to
President and Chief Operating Officer and made it clear she was
being groomed for the CEO job.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Xerox had to report embarrassing problems at its
Mexican operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company was initially vague about the problems, it
later disclosed that that several senior managers had collaborated
to circumvent Xerox accounting policies. They allegedly created
false product orders to inflate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a $78 million charge against second-quarter
earnings to cover bad debt and unrecorded liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission is now investigating.
Xerox, meanwhile, fired several top Mexican executives, including
the general manager and finance director.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican charge, coupled with a revenue decline for certain
products, helped push second-quarter earnings down 68 percent, to
$145 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with $448 million, or
62 cents per share in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In July, during a conference call with analysts, Xerox
executives were surprisingly candid about the extent of the
company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Allaire warned analysts to lower their expectations for the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And Mulcahy said things had gotten so bad that, ''Xerox people
have lost confidence in management.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a feeling the company has lost its sense of
direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, she said, employees had grow increasingly frustrated with
the company's slow reaction to its competition, which had clearly
heated up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our issues kept us focused internally instead of on the market
and the competition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mulcahy said the reorganization of the sales force is now
complete and the turnover rate for salespeople had dropped
recently. She said the company hoped to keep its strongest
producers through pumped-up salaries and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Both Allaire and Mulcahy declined requests for interviews for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the company's internal problems are really just
symptoms of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cause of their problems really has to do with the fact
that they're caught between a rock and a hard place,'' said Shebly
Seyrafi, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ''Their core market is
the copier market and that copier market is in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is down in part because many workers prefer to use
printers linked to their computers rather than copying machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the digital copier market, Xerox has been Number One for two
years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the company had 37 percent of the market, followed by
Sharp, at 18 percent, and Canon, at 11 percent, according to
figures provided by IDC, formerly known as International Data
Corp., a market research and consulting company based in
Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But in the total copier market - analog and digital - Canon led
in 1999, with 31 percent, followed by Xerox, 29 percent, and Sharp,
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the small and home office market that Xerox really lags
behind its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the inkjet market of multi-function machines -those that can
copy, fax and print all from a computer - Hewlett-Packard is
crushing Xerox and other competitors. H-P had 52 percent of the
market in 1999, compared to only 8 percent for Xerox. Canon came in
second with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has tried to make inroads in the small and home office
market. In March, the company announced a $2 billion alliance with
Sharp and Fuji Xerox to develop and manufacture inkjet products for
small and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has also formed a partnership with Dell Computers under
which that company will sell Xerox laser printers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Blue Dog advertising campaign is aimed at showing
customers that this one-time maker of old-style copiers now also
makes products for small and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Always faithful to its owner,'' reads a print ad showing Blue
Dog watching over a Xerox inkjet printer.
</P>
<P>
   But will the new campaign work?
</P>
<P>
   ''The market sees them as this purveyor of antiquated or older
technology and the market has moved on. Copying was big in the
'60s; printing has been big for 10 years,'' said Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have praised the company's decision last year to
purchase the color printing division of Tektronix Inc. in a move
that makes Xerox second only to Hewlett-Packard in the office color
printing market.
</P>
<P>
   But they say it may be a while before Xerox can pull out of its
recent slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may be coming out of it, but if they do they are going to
be coming out of their problems in the 2001 time frame, not anytime
this year,'' said Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kmetz, a director at IDC, said Xerox will be able to turn
things around, but not in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're too much of a major player and a dominant provider of
products to just crumble and die,'' Kmetz said. ''I would expect to
see Xerox rally.''

<HEADLINE> SI prosecutor recovering from second kidney transplant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Staten Island District Attorney William Murphy
was recovering Tuesday at a Manhattan hospital after his second
kidney transplant in six months - both with organs donated by
members of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Mount Sinai Medical Center believed Monday's
transplant surgery was successful, said Murphy's spokesman, Marlene
Markoe-Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the five-term district attorney received a kidney
donated by his bodyguard, Detective Daniel Ingellis. In February,
Murphy's chief of investigations, Mario Mattei, had donated a
kidney to his diabetic boss.
</P>
<P>
   That organ was rejected, necessitating the second operation.
Doctors at the hospital were closely monitoring Murphy's condition,
according to Markoe-Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Ingellis, a 26-year police veteran, was expected to fully
recover and continue a normal life with his single kidney. The
married father of two daughters was likely to miss a month of work.
</P>
<P>
   Mattei, a member of Murphy's staff for 17 years, was back on the
job within weeks of his donation.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 56, discovered last year that he needed a new kidney
after the diabetes began causing kidney failure. The prosecutor had
spent months on a transplant list, a procedure that on average
takes three years.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's wife, Cathy, his two daughters and a brother were
tested to see if they could be donors, but none matched. Recent
breakthroughs in anti-rejection drugs have widened the pool of
donors beyond family members.
</P>
<P>
   To be compatible, the recipient and donor's blood type must
match, along with other factors that show whether the recipient's
antibodies will reject the donor's cells.

<HEADLINE> Judge throws out Princeton's smoking ban  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A Mercer County judge struck down
Princeton's strict anti-smoking regulations Tuesday, ruling that
its regional health commission did not have authority to enact the
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Regional Health Commission passed the ban in June.
It would have been the strictest anti-smoking ordinance in the
state, prohibiting lighting up in bars, restaurants and workplaces.
It restricted smoking to homes, cigar shops or outdoors. Violators
faced fines from $100 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based National Smokers Alliance and three Princeton
bars and restaurants filed a lawsuit challenging the ban June 8.
Superior Court Judge Linda R. Feinberg blocked enforcement of the
ban after a July hearing, and gave attorneys the opportunity to
submit supplemental arguments before making her final decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the 64-page ruling, Feinberg agreed with the alliance's
arguments that the health commission did not have the authority to
enact the ban for fire-safety purposes. The judge also held that
the ordinance is pre-empted by state law.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, Feinberg said, the state Legislature intended to
comprehensively regulate indoor smoking and to do so exclusively.
She ruled that Princeton's ban conflicts with it.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Lewin, the attorney representing bar owners and the
smoker's alliance, said they were grateful for the decision, which
he called ''painstakingly thorough'' in rejecting the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''In each and every instance (the judge) found the smoking ban
violated state law,'' Lewin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ban was an attempt by the commission to avoid going
through the Legislature to change state law. National Smokers
Alliance Executive Director Eric Schippers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly in this case (the ban) was unlawful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Cayci, the health commission's attorney, argued that each
side had its interpretation of the law, and that municipalities are
entitled to legislate.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know if the commission will appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going try to get a meeting together with (members) next
month,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another attorney representing the health commission and a
coalition of 45 anti-smoking groups said the decision will force
the state Legislature to act on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed the court didn't see it our way,'' said
Robert J. Conroy, special council to New Jersey Breathes. ''This
decision will serve as a beacon, if you will, for the legislature.
I think it's very likely that people want to be able to have dinner
without the presence of a known carcinogen.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy said lawmakers will either have to enact a statewide ban
or free municipalities to adopt their own legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said his group will continue to fight efforts by
the National Smokers Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think any group in Virginia has the right to tell
people in New Jersey what to do,'' Conroy said.

<HEADLINE> Daily News driver delivers baby in Holland Tunnel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Delivering newspapers every morning seems pretty
routine - or so Daily News driver Robert Halberstadt thought.
</P>
<P>
   On his way through the Holland Tunnel to deliver Tuesday's Daily
News, Halberstadt, a trained emergency medical technician, made a
special delivery - a 7-pound, 12-ounce baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was definitely not part of the routine,'' Halberstadt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstadt had just picked up the morning papers at the Daily
News printers in Jersey City, N.J. around 4:30 a.m. when he got
stuck in heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that each time the car in front of him stopped, the
driver got out and went to the passenger side to look in the
window.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you get a sense that something is wrong, so I asked
him and he told me his wife was having a baby,'' Halberstadt
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   After calling 911 on his cellular phone, Halberstadt got out of
his van and went over to the man's car, where he saw that the
mother's water had broke, and the baby's head had crowned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next thing I know, I'm holding the baby in the middle of the
tunnel, under 50 feet of water,'' Halberstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   After bringing the couple, who asked not to be identified, to an
ambulance at the New York side of the tunnel, Halberstadt continued
on his way to Sheepshead Bay and Brighton Beach to deliver the
morning papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Holland Tunnel baby was the second born in the past two days
in New York's bridge and tunnel network. Another baby was born
Monday morning inside a taxi at a toll plaza on the Triborough
Bridge.

<HEADLINE> Politician Gunned Down in Spain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- A politician was gunned down Tuesday
in the street of a northern town in the latest in a series of
slayings blamed on the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Indiano, 29, was shot 10 times in the chest and abdomen
outside his candy store in Zumarraga, a Basque town, about 250
miles north of Madrid, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiano, who authorities said refused police protection normally
offered politicians in the Basque region, died in the town's
hospital an hour after the attack. His wife, pregnant with their
first child, was admitted to a hospital later in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Although not a member of the governing Popular Party, Indiano
became a councilor in Zumarraga for the party six months ago. The
conservative party fiercely opposes Basque separatism and other
moves to change Spain's political makeup.
</P>
<P>
   No one took responsibility for the shooting, but Interior
Ministry officials immediately blamed ETA, which began its campaign
for independence of the three-province northern region in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The killing brought to 12 the number of slayings -- five this
month -- attributed to ETA since it ended a 14-month truce last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The group, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has been blamed for killing nearly 800 people. It normally claims
responsibility for its attacks several weeks after carrying them
out.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the latest ETA campaign seeks to push the
government to the negotiating table. A single round of talks during
last year's truce ended in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was condemned by political parties, labor unions and
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are faced once again with the confirmation that the
terrorist group ETA has no other aim but to impose its will on
others and exterminate all those who don't think like they do,''
said deputy Prime Minister Marian Rajoy.
</P>
<P>
   Indiano's body was to be brought to Madrid, where his parents
live, for burial Wednesday, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people gathered Tuesday evening in Bilbao, San
Sebastian and Vitoria, the capitals of the three Basque provinces,
to observe a few minutes of silence. The quiet was broken by
periodic shouts against ETA.
</P>
<P>
   In Zumarraga itself, at a special town meeting called to condemn
the killing, one of three councilors who belong to the pro-ETA
party Euskal Herritarrok tried to read a communique but was drowned
out by shouts of ''murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   While security force members have long been ETA's main target,
in recent years the organization has begun killing more
politicians, particularly those of Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar's Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, who was on a visit to Poland on Tuesday, survived a
car-bomb attempt on his life in 1995 when he was in the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Governor returns, says bike injuries will heal quickly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Whitman is an experienced bicyclist
who spent much of her vacation last week in northern California on
two wheels. She also took to the trapeze for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which activity resulted in a fall requiring medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was our last day and I was the one who insisted we ride,''
Whitman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She took a stretch of road ''standing up on the pedals'' and
proceeded to fall head over handle bars on Saturday, the final day
of her vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The governor appeared several times at the Statehouse on
Tuesday, her upper lip cut and her right middle finger bandaged.
The cut required six stitches. A bone in the finger is chipped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Biking can be dangerous,'' Whitman joked while detailing her
injuries with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of which will heal rapidly,'' she quickly added.
</P>
<P>
   But the adventurous governor had high marks for her trapeze act
even though she could not twist herself around on the flying swing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me tell you, you use muscles you have never used in your
life,'' the 54-year-old governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and members of her family performed the circus stunt at
a private school.

<HEADLINE> State reaches 8.1 million, up 5 percent through the 1990s, with Somerset leading the way </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's population reached 8.14
million last year, up 5 percent over the past decade during a
period when the national population increased about 9 percent to
about 273 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state's population increased by 48,000 from 1998 to 1999, an
increase of about 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These estimates are based on the hard data collected in the 1990
census and revised annually according to surveys and samples, this
for the ninth and last time. By December, the first new numbers are
due from the actual counting in the 2000 census now under way.
</P>
<P>
   The most vigorous growth of the past decade was in Somerset and
Hunterdon counties, where the increasing development of rural areas
brought in 63,000 people. Somerset added 46,700 people, up 19.4
percent, nearly four times the statewide rate. Hunterdon added
16,000 people, up 15.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similar growth rates in the decade were measured in Sussex,
Monmouth and Ocean counties. Ocean had the largest numerical growth
in the state, adding 63,000 people over nine years, a rise of 14.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This was offset statewide by the decline of 30,000 people in
Essex County, down 3.9 percent from 1990 to 1999. The other major
urban counties lost people as well but in far fewer numbers - 287
in Camden County, down 0.1 percent, and 171 in Hudson County, a
change so small it did not register as a percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Exceeding them both was tiny Salem County, which lost 848 people
since 1990, a decline of 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These decade patterns were roughly true for the population
change measured from 1998 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The one-year change saw population up 2.1 percent in Somerset,
1.8 percent in Hunterdon and 1.5 percent in Ocean. Warren had a
larger growth rate, 1.6 percent, showing that rural area was now
starting to grow at a faster rate compared with earlier in the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   On the downward side, Camden County lost 1,175 people from 1998
to 1999, a marked acceleration in population loss. In Essex, by
comparison, the population loss that had been averaging 3,000 a
year slowed to 967 from 1998 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although popular perception is that the aged population is
growing dramatically in comparison with the rest, this did not
appear to hold in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   There were 1.03 million seniors age 65 and older in 1990,
representing 13.3 percent of the total population. By 1999 there
were 1.11 million seniors, an increase of 78,000, or 7.6 percent.
But the proportion that those seniors represent of the total
population was still close, about 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 18-to-65 year-old wage earners increased only 2.5
percent in the same period, but the group of future wage earners,
ages 5 to 17, increased 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of seniors living to age 85 and older was up sharply,
from 94,000 in 1990 to 133,000 in 1999. But as a proportion of the
population that group's increase was less dramatic, from 1.2
percent in 1990 to 1.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end, there were 550,000 children under age 5 in
1990, about 7.1 percent of the state's total. This dropped by 1999,
but only slightly, to 543,000, about 6.7 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> MP3.com executive completes second day on the witness stand  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The chief executive of MP3.com concluded two
days of testimony in a copyright trial Tuesday by insisting that
his company did not believe it was violating copyrights when it
loaded thousands of CDs into its music system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt we didn't require authorization from the record
companies,'' Michael Robertson said at a trial being heard without
a jury by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff already ruled that the San Diego-based Internet music
company violated the copyrights of the nation's major record
companies by offering music online without permission.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the judge is hearing testimony to determine whether
MP3.com willfully violated the copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   If he finds that the company did, MP3.com could be forced in a
worst-case scenario to pay the Universal Music Group several
hundred million dollars in damages. Without willful intent, damages
could be set as low as $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The other four large record companies - Warner Music Group, BMG,
EMI and Sony Music Entertainment - settled with MP3.com prior to
the trial for undisclosed amounts of money and for arrangements for
additional compensation from MP3.com customers.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff said he will decide the matter of willful intent based on
whether he finds MP3.com knew it was infringing on copyrights, and
if it acted recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he considered his operation a friend of the
record companies, setting up a system that would require customers
to prove they had purchased CDs before they could create an online
catalogue of their personal music collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're simply letting people listen to music that they already
have,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Defense Accuses CIA  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Testimony from a former CIA
double agent was delayed Tuesday in the Lockerbie bombing trial
after defense lawyers alleged that the spy agency may be concealing
evidence on the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Judges ordered Scotland's chief prosecutor to ''use his best
endeavors'' with the CIA to obtain the missing information before
they call the spy -- their star witness -- to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came despite warnings it could impede the trial of
two Libyans charged with planting the bomb Dec. 21, 1988, that
killed 270 people on Pan Am Flight 103 and on the ground in
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The practical effect of granting the request would be a delay
of perhaps a considerable period of time,'' Scotland's chief
prosecutor, Lord Advocate Colin Boyd, told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd suggested the witness, identified as Abdul Majid Giaka, who
was initially scheduled to testify on Aug. 22, may not appear until
next week. Less important witnesses could be heard in the meantime,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has stumbled through procedural glitches since it
began May 3 before a special Scottish court sitting in the
Netherlands. Proceedings are expected to last several more months.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
allegedly worked with Giaka as Libyan intelligence agents on the
Mediterranean island of Malta.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the bomb that destroyed the New York-bound
airliner was sent from Malta in an unaccompanied suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence that Giaka provided is contained in 25 cables from
CIA handlers who started debriefing him in August 1988, four months
ahead of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Copies were presented as evidence with passages -- as long as an
entire page -- blacked out which the CIA maintained could jeopardize
U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   Although the CIA restored some deletions last week, defense
lawyers Tuesday demanded access to the full texts, arguing that
potentially significant evidence remained concealed.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted references in the cables to dispatches that the
CIA had not handed over.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is plain that what we have is not the full complement of
cables,'' said Al-Megrahi's attorney, Bill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The judges asked the prosecutor to track down the missing
documents, but they agreed with the prosecution that asking the CIA
to release more of the censored documents would be a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   The judges rejected a defense motion to ask U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno to appoint a federal judge to look into the
security threat posed by the disclosure in full of Giaka's
dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts of the newly declassified passages painted a picture of
an opportunist looking to profit from his dealings with the U.S.
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka, eager to defect from Libya, got the CIA to pay for a
''sham surgery'' on his arm to avoid Libyan military service.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, diminished his usefulness as a mole, a
disappointed debriefer wrote, beginning to suspect that Giaka ''has
never been a true member'' of the Libyan intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka also tried to obtain a $30,000 grant in addition to his
$1,000 monthly CIA salary to help him start a car rental business
in Malta.
</P>
<P>
   Debriefers suspected Giaka was taking advantage of his cover job
at Malta's Luqa Airport to engage in ''low-level smuggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Giaka defected to the United States in July 1991, according to
defense lawyers. He is currently in the federal witness protection
program, living under an assumed identity.

<HEADLINE> Uneasy Calm Prevails in Iranian City  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHORRAMABAD, Iran (AP) -- Riot police dispersed a crowd of youths
Tuesday as an uneasy calm settled over this western Iranian city
following days of violence over a meeting of reformist students.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 people marched earlier in the day in the funeral
procession of a policeman who was killed in riots on Sunday.
Ardeshir Karami was somehow shot during fighting between supporters
of students from Iran's largest student group, who had come to
Khorramabad for their annual conference, and hard-line vigilantes.
Exactly how he was shot remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the funeral, some 400 youths gathered in a
residential neighborhood of the city before scores of riot police
arrived and club-wielding vigilantes sealed off the street. The
purpose of the gathering wasn't clear, but about the anti-riot
police broke it up without incident.
</P>
<P>
   While calm generally prevailed here, anger still flared in spots
of the city, the capital of Lorestan province, whose population of
1 million is seething under poverty and unemployment. The
provincial governor, Noorallah Abedi, suffered a skull fracture
when he was hit with a rock during the policeman's funeral, state
television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Abedi was apparently hit by a hard-liner angry that the Office
for Fostering Unity -- the student group -- was granted permission to
hold its annual conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The vigilantes, like the police, are controlled by hard-liners
in the Iranian establishment. Trouble between the hard-liners and
the reformist students began almost immediately after the
conference began on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, vigilantes occupied the airport to prevent two
leading reformists, Abdol-Karim Soroush and Mohsen Kadivar, from
leaving the airfield after they arrived from Tehran to address the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both Mr. Soroush and Kadivar were savagely beaten by members
of the pressure groups,'' Akbar Atri, a main student leader, told
reporters in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of sporadic clashes and attacks on the students
by vigilantes, things came to a head Sunday when supporters of the
students clashed in the street with the vigilantes and the police
officer was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Conference organizers said about 100 participants were injured
in the attacks Sunday by vigilantes, 40 of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   After organizers agreed to end their weeklong conference two
days early to restore calm to the city, their buses were stopped by
vigilantes and security officers in plain clothes who savagely beat
them, Atri said. A bus full of female students was emptied and the
women kicked and beaten, the student group said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Khorramabad conference, held in support of
democratic reforms initiated by President Mohammad Khatami after
his 1997 election, said they had identified Intelligence Ministry
agents and Revolutionary Guards in plainclothes among the
attackers. They accused security forces loyal to the hard-liners of
abetting the vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami seeks to strengthen the rule of law and weaken the
absolute power of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners have closed down 25 publications -- all but one
pro-democracy -- since April. Journalists, intellectuals and writers
who dare to speak out against the absolute power of the clergy are
jailed daily.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown allowed student groups to emerge as powerful
messengers for Khatami in the absence of newspapers. Universities
reopen in about three weeks after the summer recess.

<HEADLINE> Senate president says patients should sue HMOs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Patients should have the ability to sue
their HMO insurance providers for claims of medical malpractice, a
ranking Republican lawmaker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, said the
''right to sue'' is a key point in a package of health care bills
he plans to make public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week DiFrancesco announced a $400 million property tax
relief proposal. DiFrancesco has said he is considering a run for
governor when Gov. Christie Whitman leaves office at the end of her
second term.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill sends a strong message and that is the health care
consumer will have a powerful tool to fight back against their HMO
and insurance companies,'' DiFrancesco said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision is to require binding arbitration in disputes
with patients, DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This measure will give patients the right to sue their carrier
and ultimately make health insurance companies more accountable,''
DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also announced similar proposals Tuesday and said she
would introduce her bills when the Legislature returns from its
recess.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco plans to announce his full health care plan at a
news conference in Newark on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Scientist Ban at Labs To End  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists from ''sensitive'' countries such
as China, Russia and Iran are expected soon to resume normal ties
with the Energy Department's three nuclear weapons research labs,
ending a 10-month ban on virtually all such contact.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about safeguarding nuclear secrets, Congress last
November barred scientists from 25 ''sensitive'' countries from
visiting the labs, having contact with lab scientists or access to
any computer systems at the facilities, even unclassified ones.
</P>
<P>
   While a small number of waivers to this policy have been
allowed, the moratorium has severely disrupted normal contact -- and
research unrelated to nuclear weapons -- between the U.S. lab
scientists and their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The law said the moratorium could be lifted only after directors
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence
Agency determined that the foreign visitors program had safeguards
to prevent the loss of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh and CIA Director George Tenet on
Tuesday informed key members of Congress they had concluded that
the system meets those security needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am satisfied that the department has in place a system that,
if properly followed and funded, will provide an acceptable
safeguard for the national security interests reposed in the
national labs,'' wrote Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Tenant wrote that he also was ''satisfied'' with the security
measures as long as the Energy Department closely monitors the labs
with periodic inspections of the visitors program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the labs may again resume their contacts with
scientists from the ''sensitive'' countries 45 days after the FBI
and CIA chiefs' certification.
</P>
<P>
   The three national research labs subject to the foreign
visitors' ban were Los Alamos and Sandia, both in New Mexico, and
Lawrence Livermore in California.
</P>
<P>
   An Energy Department spokesperson, Natalie Weimer, confirmed the
letters had been delivered Tuesday and said ''we fully anticipate
the moratorium will be lifted in 45 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the letters were provided by Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., who said the interaction of lab scientists with their
counterparts in other countries was essential if the labs are to
keep their top-notch scientists and attract others.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a major step toward getting the laboratories back to a
more normal circumstance where scientists and engineers at the labs
can be confident they can interact with their counterparts in other
countries,'' said Bingaman.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos lab has been the focus of security and alleged
espionage controversies for two years involving its top-secret
nuclear weapons division.
</P>
<P>
   First, one of its nuclear scientists, Wen Ho Lee, was fired and
later arrested because of allegations that he mishandled nuclear
secrets, including illegally copying computer tapes containing
nuclear weapons codes. Lee, who is awaiting trial, has denied he
ever provided secrets to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Then earlier this year, two computer hard drives, also
containing nuclear weapons secrets, disappeared from a Los Alamos
vault, the reappeared weeks later behind a copying machine not from
where they went missing. The FBI is continuing its investigation of
that security breach.
</P>
<P>
   The security problems -- and some lawmakers' concerns that
nuclear secrets from Los Alamos may have ended up in China --
prompted renewed scrutiny of the labs' foreign visitors program,
although there has been no evidence linking any foreign scientists
with any security breach or espionage.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Disbarment Is Too Harsh  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday he
should not be disbarred over his testimony in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case, telling a state judge that losing his law
license is too harsh a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-page response to a complaint filed by the Arkansas
Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct, the president said
that he would not receive such a stiff sanction if his case was
handled like similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the basis of the relevant facts, the governing law and the
applicable decisions of the Arkansas courts ..., a sanction of
disbarment would be excessively harsh, impermissibly punitive and
unprecedented in the circumstances of this case,'' Clinton's
lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski County Circuit Judge Leon Johnson said he expected to
receive Clinton's filing Tuesday but otherwise would not discuss
the case, including when it might be scheduled for a hearing or
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The state conduct committee says the president lied about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky when
asked about it, under oath, in January 1998. Jones' lawyers asked
the president about Lewinsky while a federal judge presided over
his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed against Clinton June 30, the conduct
committee's prosecutor accused the president of lying to spare
himself embarrassment. In the response filed Tuesday, Clinton's
lawyers acknowledged that the president was attempting to save
face.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ''took actions motivated in part by a desire to protect
himself and others from embarrassment,'' the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Bernarde Miller, the prosecutor, would not comment on
Clinton's filing. She had asked that the matter be cleared up
before the end of the year when Johnson leaves office, but would
not say if Tuesday's filing would help her meet that timetable.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton in
contempt last year and fined him more than $90,000, saying he
intentionally gave misleading testimony about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also acknowledged that the president didn't
fight the contempt citation, but said he did not do so because the
needs of the country came first.
</P>
<P>
   Jones filed suit in May 1994, alleging Clinton made a crude
sexual advance toward her three years earlier in a Little Rock
hotel room. Jones had hoped to use evidence of the Lewinsky affair
as part of an attempt to show a pattern of predatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, however, said the Lewinsky material was not essential to
Jones' case, and later dismissed Jones' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers said Tuesday that the testimony at the center
of the disbarment lawsuit was so minor that stripping the president
of his law license would be too severe of a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation of
Atlanta, which had asked for Clinton's disbarment, said after
Tuesday's filing that the proposed sanctions were not too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, they are precisely what the American Bar Association
recommends based on this behavior,'' Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honesty and candor are absolute prerequisites in our bar,''
Glavin said. ''The Supreme Court has made it clear what's required
for membership in the Arkansas bar. Mr. Clinton doesn't meet those
standards.''

<HEADLINE> Publishers starting imprints for black authors  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Have publishers finally learned to love black
authors?
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Time Warner, HarperCollins and Kensington
Publishing are among those who started or acquired imprints
specifically to release books by blacks. The most recent one is
Strivers Row, a division of Random House that begins publishing
next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have long complained the industry ignored them, that it
didn't believe they actually read books. Now, with the industry
apparently paying attention, many say demand for black writers has
never been stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in a buying frenzy,'' said Anita Diggs, a senior editor at
Ballantine Books and director of One World, a multicultural imprint
with a strong focus on black writers. ''It's very exciting right
now to be African-American and to be working in publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very competitive these days,'' said Melody Guy, who heads
Strivers Row. ''A couple of times recently I've been looking over a
manuscript only to find out that another publisher was already
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agree the turning point came in the early 1990s with the
publication of Terry McMillan's ''Waiting to Exhale.'' Her novel
about the lives of four upper-class black women sold millions of
copies. It proved not only that there was a large black readership
but that a market existed for subjects besides ''protest
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the market has broadened. Literary
authors such as Nobel laureate Toni Morrison still sell millions of
copies, but there's also room for mystery (Walter Mosley), romance
(E. Lynn Harris, Eric Jerome Dickey) and self-help authors (Iyanla
Vanzant).
</P>
<P>
   The imprints themselves reveal the number of potential markets.
Strivers Row emphasizes paperback first editions of commercial
fiction. Hyperion's Jump at the Sun specializes in children's
books. Time Warner's imprint will focus on religious books for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''After Terry McMillan's success, blacks were buying books just
because of the novelty. Taste wasn't really involved. Now, a decade
later, readers are more discerning,'' said Manie Barron, publisher
of Amistad Press, an imprint of HarperCollins that publishes
fiction and nonfiction by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many authors initially published themselves, selling thousands
of copies. Tawana ''TJ'' Butler, whose novel ''Sorority Sisters''
came out earlier this year from Villard, used to travel around the
country on her own, relying on black-owned stores to help promote
her. Early copies of Harris' popular ''Invisible Life'' were sold
from the back of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first started publishing myself, I was advised against
it because I was told the industry frowned upon it. But within the
African-American community I saw lots of sales,'' said Harris, a
Doubleday author with 2 million books in print.
</P>
<P>
   Writers once passed over by publishers now have deals. Author
Solomon Jones saved the rejection slips, all 50 of them. They had
much to praise about ''Pipe Dream,'' his novel about four drug
addicts and a murder they didn't commit. But they told Jones there
was no market for his book.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of statement blacks say they've been hearing since
the earliest days of publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just about ready to put out the book myself,'' said
Jones, a writer with the Philadelphia Weekly, an alternative paper.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, however, ''Pipe Dream'' will be published by
Strivers Row. It will receive a first printing of 25,000, a high
number for a first novel, and it will be promoted throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   '''Pipe Dream' was the book that got us talking about starting
Strivers Row,'' Guy said. ''It was hard to see the book as a
hardcover. It's a story where crack addicts are the heroes and it's
not difficult to see why so many publishers were shying away from
it. But we felt that it could work well in paperback and reach
readers we don't always get to.''

<HEADLINE> S.America Summit To Focus on Economy  </HEADLINE>
By ADALID CABRERA LEMUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Leaders at a South American summit will
discuss ways to boost trade and their economies, but the regional
impact of a U.S.-backed drug war in Colombia will likely be a key
theme.
</P>
<P>
   As 12 heads of state prepared for the two-day summit that begins
Thursday, a foreign ministry official said Tuesday Brazil was
opposed to foreign countries sending troops into Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The summit will start just hours after President Clinton visits
Colombia where he will tour the Caribbean city of Cartagena and
again pledge U.S. support to President Andres Pastrana's anti-drug
plan, known as Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plan Colombia deserves the full backing of all of the
continent's nations,'' Ivan Cannabrava, a top official at Brazil's
Foreign Ministry said at a news conference. ''But this backing does
not mean support for armed intervention in Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has approved $1.3 billion anti-narcotics aid
package. Most of the aid will be in military hardware and training
and it is aimed at combatting armed groups who protect plantations
producing 90 percent of the world's cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the U.S. aid -- in which 60 combat helicopters will be
sent to Colombia and Green Berets are training Colombian
anti-narcotics soldiers -- say Washington is becoming directly
involved in this South American nation's 36-year guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops, however, are barred from fighting in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Cannabrava said the summit will also deal with ways of
integrating the continent's economies by building a network of
highways and telecommunications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, education and technology are also on the agenda, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ''In convening and hosting the summit, Brazil is definitely
taking an important step toward asserting its leadership in the
region,'' said University of Brasilia political scientist David
Fleischer. ''And it's doing so by spearheading the creation of a
South American-wide trade bloc, which is the main idea behind the
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil alone represents half of South America's population of
337 million and half of its gross domestic product of $1.3
trillion.

<HEADLINE> State proposes toughening ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State officials are trying to close what
they see as a loophole in New Jersey's truck ban.
</P>
<P>
   The law currently limits large trucks traveling through the
state to interstate highways. It allows trucks that start or end
their trips in New Jersey to use local roads.
</P>
<P>
   But a fatal truck accident in Lambertville last May has prompted
state officials to clarify the law and toughen the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the driver was hauling garbage from Massachusetts to
Pennsylvania when he lost control of his tractor-trailer on Route
179. The truck hit three vehicles and climbed an embankment before
plowing through the front wall of a video store.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four-year-old store clerk Joan Eschen died. Four others
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the state's ban of large trucks on local roads
didn't apply because the driver left from New Jersey before picking
up the garbage in Massachusetts and returning through the state on
the way to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed changes, the state would consider each part
of the trip separately.
</P>
<P>
   So if a truck is dispatched from New Jersey to pick up a load in
New York and deliver it to Delaware, the driver could no longer use
local roads while traveling through the state.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Department of Transportation Spokesman John
Dourgarian said that was the intent of the original restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a driver's going from one terminal out of state to another
terminal out of state, the driver should be restricted,'' he said.
''We felt the need to clarify it.''
</P>
<P>
   The transportation department has planned two workshops in
October to receive public comment on the proposal. Dourgarian said
the amendments could go into effect by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   American Trucking Associations already has filed a lawsuit
opposing the original ban. A spokesman maintains the ban is
unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's unsafe, unfair and unconstitutional,'' spokesman
Mike Russell said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia President To Welcome Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana said
Tuesday he will urge President Clinton during his visit to drop
trade barriers to create alternative jobs for the thousands of
Colombians who work in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrives in Colombia on Wednesday with a high-powered
delegation of U.S. lawmakers, Cabinet members, diplomats and
military brass to speed implementation of a $1.3 billion U.S.
anti-narcotics aid package.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Pastrana lauded the
visit -- the first by a U.S. president since George Bush came in
1990 -- as evidence that ''we are not alone in the fight against
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Clinton's arrival, workers were hurriedly repaving
streets in this walled Spanish-colonial city on the Caribbean and
painting over anti-U.S. graffiti, such as one that read: ''Clinton
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Army troops erected roadblocks on the outskirts and frisked
motorists, part of a massive security operation involving 5,000
Colombian soldiers and police and some 350 U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist rebels have promised not to disrupt the visit, but some
minor violence and protests have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found anti-Clinton pamphlets signed by the
rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, outside
three banks damaged by small explosions Tuesday in the western city
of Cali. Nobody was injured in the blasts in the city 470 miles
from Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
   In Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, riot police with
water cannons clashed with ski-masked university students who
burned a bus, chanted anti-Clinton slogans and waved Colombian
flags. Troops and rebels also skirmished with no reported
casualties outside Guayabetal, an Andean mountain town 33 miles
southeast of the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said he expects the U.S. assistance to continue no
matter who is elected to the White House in November because the
aid plan has both Democratic and Republican support.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana urged the United States also to drop trade barriers
to Colombian products, which would generate employment here and
give Colombians an alternative to narcotics production.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most important subjects we must discuss
with Bill Clinton,'' Pastrana, appearing relaxed and casually
dressed in a blue sport shirt and tan chinos, told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit is a political boost for Pastrana, whose
popularity has plummeted here amid disappointing peace talks, a
major recession and ongoing rebel and right-wing paramilitary
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The American aid, most of it in military hardware and training,
is aimed at combatting the armed groups who protect plantations
producing 90 percent of the world's cocaine and a rising share of
its heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the U.S. aid -- in which 60 combat helicopters will be
sent to Colombia and Green Berets are training Colombian
anti-narcotics soldiers -- say Washington is becoming directly
involved in this South American nation's 36-year guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Head-to-head clashes between U.S.-backed troops and the rebels
seem inevitable since the FARC makes huge profits by protecting and
taxing drug crops, and has vowed to fight efforts by the troops to
seize drug plantations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops are barred from fighting in the war. U.S. officials
scoff at notions the United States is becoming involved in a
Vietnam-like quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said the military aid was welcome but that for a
longer-term solution, Colombian products, especially textiles,
require tariff-free access to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the farms which produce cocaine and heroin from coca and
poppy plants are owned by subsistence farmers. Itinerant harvesters
who used to pick coffee or cotton were driven out of work when
prices dropped and now pick drug crops, Pastrana noted.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be 618,000 acres of cotton in Colombia, but now
there are only 37,000 acres, forcing cotton-pickers to become
itinerant coca harvesters, Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Colombia gains access to U.S. markets -- either through a
bilateral agreement, inclusion in the North American Free Trade
Agreement which currently encompasses the United States, Canada and
Mexico, or expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative -- Colombia's
20 percent unemployment can be dramatically cut, Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can produce cotton, textiles, clothes,'' he said. ''We have
a production chain and can export with very good results. In this
way, commerce can be fundamental in combatting drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, meanwhile, said he was disappointed with the
relatively small contributions pledged from mostly European donors
at a July conference in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is seeking $2.3 billion from Europe and Japan but only
won pledges of some $600 million. While most of the military aid
comes from the United States, the other donors were to have
provided money for alternative crop development and other
nonmilitary assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't get the funds we wanted,'' Pastrana said, adding
that another fund-raising attempt would be made within months.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Clinton for his one-day visit are 11 members of
Congress including House Speaker Dennis Hastert, as well as
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno,
White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey and Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the
Miami-based chief of U.S. military operations in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Murder suspect dies in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Department of Corrections is waiting
for results of an autopsy performed on an inmate who died in a
Trenton facility Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mazzola was found dead in his cell at the Central
Reception and Processing Facility on Monday night. Medical
personnel found him when they arrived to administer medication for
a pre-existing condition, said corrections spokesman Chris Carden.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old from Shamong was charged with the 1999 shooting
death of his father. He was moved from the Burlington County Jail,
where he had been jailed in lieu of $200,000 bail, to Trenton on
Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola was to be transferred to another state prison to serve
time on an unrelated drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington County First Assistant Prosecutor Raymond Milavsky
said Mazzola had been sentenced to three years in state prison on
drug charges stemming from a 1998 arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very unfortunate episode,'' Milavsky told the
Courier-Post of Cherry Hill. ''I was told he died in his sleep, but
I don't know if (Mazzola's) diabetes was a contributing factor. We
have to wait for the autopsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzola's public defender, Edward Lavelle, said there was no
indication of suicide or foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Another Burlington County inmate recently died in custody. The
man died from an apparent suicide Aug. 17 in the county jail.

<HEADLINE> No Majority in New Mexico Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's new Congress was installed Tuesday,
and no party held a majority, a feature of the country's newly
complicated political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vicente Fox's election July 2 marked a turning
point in Mexican history with the defeat of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico for the past 71
years. Fox takes office Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo will deliver his last annual
State of The Nation speech on Friday before a joint session of the
new Congress that was elected with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress is made up of two bodies, the 500-member Chamber of
Deputies, or lower house, and the 128-seat Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party holds 211 seats in the new
Chamber, far short of the overwhelming majorities it held until
1997, when it first lost its outright majority in mid-term
elections. Fox's National Action Party has 207 seats and the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party has 51.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party, which is allied with Fox, holds 16 seats and
Democratic Revolution's Labor Party ally has seven. The rest of the
seats are held by three tiny organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Garcia Cervantes, 46, of Fox's party, was elected
speaker of the Chamber for a one-year term. He will deliver the
response to Zedillo's speech Friday and preside over Fox's swearing
in.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the Institutional Revolutionary Party has 60
seats -- short of a simple half-plus-one majority needed to approve
legislation on its own. National Action has 46 seats and Democratic
Revolution 16. The Green Party has five seats, and the Labor Party
1.
</P>
<P>
   Senators elected Enrique Jackson of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party as its president.
</P>
<P>
   Senators and the president serve for six years. Congressmen
serve for three.

<HEADLINE> Traffic light camera bill aimed at reducing red-light violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) - Two Buffalo-area men are on a crusade to
stop red-light runners by putting cameras in traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph W. Kolkmeyer and Anthony G. Moeser, a town of Amherst
engineer, have already collected 1,000 signatures and persuaded a
state lawmaker to introduce legislation giving municipalities the
option of installing the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill sponsored by Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Buffalo
Democrat, cameras would photograph the rear license plate of the
offender's vehicle. Violators would receive a ticket in the mail.
Lockheed Martin, a manufacturer of the cameras, has offered to pay
upfront costs in return for a percentage of collected fines.
</P>
<P>
   Several concerns, such as funding, privacy, and who gets the
ticket if the owner wasn't driving the vehicle have stalled
efforts, but Hoyt hopes to gain approval for a pilot program by
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Several police officers applaud the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The camera) is there 24 hours a day. We can't be,''
Cheektowaga Lt. Mark E. Nacke said.

<HEADLINE> Carter: No Deal With Nike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Vince Carter denied an Internet report
Tuesday that he has reached agreement with Nike on a 6-year, $30
million endorsement contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no deal. Everybody thinks they know everything that's
going on with me. I'm tired of it, really,'' Carter said at the
U.S. Olympic basketball team training camp. ''I just got out of a
Puma suit, so how can I have a deal ready?
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's jumping the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors forward broke his contract with Puma last
season, and an arbitrator recently ruled that Carter owes the
company $13.5 million, plus $1 million in attorneys fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site HoopsTV.com reported that Carter's deal with Nike
was agreed to, but an attorney for Puma also disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't anything pending,'' the lawyer, Norman Oberstein,
said. ''We're just trying to work things out, and hopefully we
will.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 38; Nasdaq Gains 12  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Profit-taking left stock prices narrowly mixed
Tuesday, with bank and pharmaceutical stocks declining and
securities firms gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 37.74 at 11,215.10.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was up 11.58 at 4,082.17. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.25 at 1,509.84.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing a bit of profit taking,'' said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''There's also a lack of
volume, a lack of news, a lack of conviction and a lack of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Many traders were on vacation ahead of the long Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Investors got mixed signals on the U.S. economy Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A new report showed Americans were slightly less confident about
the health of the economy in August. The Conference Board said its
Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.1, down from a revised
143 in July and below its the 144.7 record level reached in May.
</P>
<P>
   But a government report showed new housing sales soared a
surprising 14.7 percent in July, the biggest jump in seven years,
indicating that consumers are upbeat enough to keep spending.
</P>
<P>
   Profit-taking brought financial services stocks lower, including
Citigroup, down 75 cents at $58.13 and American Express, down $1.50
at $58.44.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, particularly those in financial services, have rallied
in the past month as it became clear the Federal Reserve is done --
for now -- raising interest rates to cool down the economy and
prevent inflation. Wary traders sought to preserve their gains from
that sector.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks rose, fed by speculation that Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette is in talks to be acquired by the brokerage unit of
Credit Suisse Group. DLJ was up $16.44 at $82.25 Other brokerages
that closed higher included Bear Sterns, up $3.31 at $63.13 and
Lehman Brothers, up $3.34 at $140.59.
</P>
<P>
   Most drug stocks faltered, partly because the industry is under
attack by Vice President Al Gore as part of his campaign for a
prescription drug benefit to be added to Medicare. Both Pfizer,
down 53 cents at $42.34 and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, down $1.75 at $93,
slipped Tuesday after study results showed two of their key drugs
did not perform as well as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq on Monday gained about 28 points, to pull the
technology-dominated index into positive territory for the year for
the first time since spring. The Dow, which gained about 60 points
Monday, is now down only about 2 percent from where it started the
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! continued to falter, losing $1.06 to $121.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 984.78
million shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.15 at 529.63.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.23 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 0.61 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.34 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rikers inmate re-arrested in tangled murder conspiracy plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Rikers Island inmate, awaiting trial on
charges of kidnapping a woman, has been charged with attempting to
hire an undercover police officer to murder her.
</P>
<P>
   Dany Castillo, 25, was charged Tuesday with conspiracy to commit
murder for asking the undercover detective over a phone from Rikers
to kill the woman he kidnapped in October 1999, Bronx District
Attorney Robert Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo allegedly offered the officer a half-kilogram of
cocaine in payment for the hit.
</P>
<P>
   He has been awaiting trial with four other defendants for
allegedly kidnapping the woman last year as she left a beauty
salon, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo and his cohorts allegedly forced the woman into a van
at gunpoint and held her at a Bronx apartment until police freed
her three days later.
</P>
<P>
   While they held her, Castillo and the others allegedly called
the victim's husband, demanding 100 kilograms of cocaine in return
for her release.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the new conspiracy charges, Castillo is charged with
criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, a
Class A-1 felony, which carries a maximum sentence of life in
prison, and criminal solicitation.

<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Gather At U.N.  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Dalai Lama's official words were heard
at the United Nations for the first time in nearly four decades
Tuesday when his representative read a statement from the spiritual
leader to the Millennium World Peace Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has long been an unwelcome presence at the U.N.
because China rejects his call for an autonomous Tibet. So Drikung
Chetsang Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist leader, conveyed the message
on his behalf to more than 1,000 religious leaders gathered for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dalai Lama said that he joined the group ''in
spirit,'' the Nobel Peace laureate was not invited to the U.N.
portion of the conference for fear of offending China -- a
veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world's religions can contribute to world peace, if there
is peace and growing harmony between different faiths,'' he said.
''It is also my belief that whereas the 20th century has been a
century of war and untold suffering, the 21st century should be one
of peace and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no peace as long as there is grinding poverty,
social injustice, inequality, oppression, environmental
degradation, and as long as the weak and small continue to be
trodden by the mighty and powerful. The world's spiritual and
religious leaders need to address these real and pressing issues,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   China accuses the Dalai Lama of creating turmoil in Tibet, which
he fled in 1959 after an abortive uprising against China's
occupation.

   Organizers invited the Dalai Lama only to the last two days of
the conference -- being held at a New York hotel. He declined,
sending an eight-member delegation of Buddhist leaders to represent
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Tibet, the U.S. representative of the Dalai Lama,
said it would be the first time Tibetans representing the Buddhist
leader have spoken in the U.N.'s General Assembly hall since the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very sad, and I feel happy,'' said a Dalai Lama
disciple, the Rev. Tsona Gontse Rinpoche. ''This is a historic
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations did not sponsor the event or issue
invitations. An interfaith coalition organized the program and
picked the participants. The only delegations chosen by their
government were China's and Vietnam's, summit organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Williams, winner of the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize for
founding a mixed Protestant-Catholic peace movement in Northern
Ireland, said, ''The Dalai Lama is conspicuous by his absence.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bishop Reverend Fu Tieshen, leader of the
Chinese delegation, addressed the conference. He did not mention
the Dalai Lama by name, but said ''some people want to trample on
the sovereignty of other countries under the pretext of protecting
religious human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the second day of the four-day event, crimson robes
outnumbered gray suits in the General Assembly Hall, where monks, a
cardinal and even a business mogul addressed the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Following a Monday evening of prayers by clan mothers and church
fathers, chief rabbis and high priests, Kofi Annan addressed the
morning session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Religious practices and beliefs are among the phenomena that
define us as human,'' he said. But ''religion has often been yoked
to nationalism, stoking the flames of violent conflict. ...
Religious leaders have not always spoken out when their voices
could have helped combat hatred and persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Media mogul Ted Turner, whose U.N. Foundation, Better World
Fund, helped pay for the conference, struck a more informal note.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was born in a Christian family,'' said Turner, who once said
publicly that Christianity was ''for losers.''
</P>
<P>
   He dreamed of becoming ''a man of the cloth,'' he said, but was
bothered that his religious group taught that only Christians were
going to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought heaven was going to be a mighty empty place,'' he
said. ''Now I believe there may be one God who manifests himself in
different ways to different people. ... And I can't believe God
wants us to blow ourselves to kingdom come. He wants us to love
each other and live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadhvi Shilapiji, a Jain nun, said she found Turner's speech
''fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the feeling of the common man not burdened by any
religious or political affiliation,'' Shilapiji said. ''It came
from his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers Tuesday included Cardinal Francis Arinze,
president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interreligious
Dialogue; and Abdullah al-Obaid, secretary-general of the World
Muslim League.
</P>
<P>
   Participants say they hope the summit will result in a
declaration on peace, poverty and the environment, as well as the
formation of a council of religious leaders to advise the United
Nations on preventing and settling disputes. Sessions were
scheduled on the role of religion in conflict resolution.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Buddhists read a message from the Dalai Lama at U.N.  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Dalai Lama's official words were heard
at the United Nations for the first time in nearly four decades
Tuesday when his representative read a statement from the spiritual
leader to the Millennium World Peace Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has long been an unwelcome presence at the U.N.
because China rejects his call for an autonomous Tibet. So Drikung
Chetsang Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist leader, conveyed the message
on his behalf to more than 1,000 religious leaders gathered for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dalai Lama said that he joined the group ''in
spirit,'' the Nobel Peace laureate was not invited to the U.N.
portion of the conference for fear of offending China - a
veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world's religions can contribute to world peace, if there
is peace and growing harmony between different faiths,'' he said.
''It is also my belief that whereas the 20th century has been a
century of war and untold suffering, the 21st century should be one
of peace and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no peace as long as there is grinding poverty,
social injustice, inequality, oppression, environmental
degradation, and as long as the weak and small continue to be
trodden by the mighty and powerful. The world's spiritual and
religious leaders need to address these real and pressing issues,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   China accuses the Dalai Lama of creating turmoil in Tibet, which
he fled in 1959 after an abortive uprising against China's
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers invited the Dalai Lama only to the last two days of
the conference - being held at a New York hotel. He declined,
sending an eight-member delegation of Buddhist leaders to represent

<HEADLINE> Nader Seeks Union's Endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTEN HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
sought the endorsement of an electrical workers' union Tuesday and
said the Democratic Party -- labor's traditional partner in politics
-- promises too much and delivers too little.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of
America's annual convention, Nader offered himself as a strong
alternative to Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to protect labor rights, fight for a higher minimum
wage and push for universal health care. And he claimed that
President Clinton and Vice President Gore have failed to push hard
for a ban on hiring permanent replacements for striking workers
despite voicing support for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats have the support of most unions without getting
anything back,'' said Nader, who basked in the cheers and repeated
standing ovations. ''All they get is the phrase, 'You'd better
support us because the Republicans are terrible.'''
</P>
<P>
   The union's 200 delegates were to debate Wednesday whether to
endorse Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Peter Gilmore said the union usually declines to
endorse presidential candidates, and has endorsed only four in its
history -- Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, George McGovern and
Michael Dukakis. A Nader endorsement would be its first departure
from backing Democrats, Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said the main roadblock to a significant Green Party
challenge is ''the feeling in America that we can't win. It takes
pioneers like this union, I hope, to say, 'I'll vote my dreams, not
my fears,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Peniska, a delegate from Alpoint, S.D., said he would
support endorsing Nader, describing him as a viable candidate who
could make an impact in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could do a good job for labor people,'' Peniska said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, meanwhile, a federal judge refused to order
that Nader be put on the state's general election ballot after
failing to file the required number of petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers had argued that the state's June filing deadline
amounted to an unconstitutional restriction on the ability of
third-party candidates to collect those signatures in time.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks 'Choose Life' Licenses  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily
blocked Louisiana from issuing anti-abortion ''Choose Life''
license plates, saying lawmakers should not have approved auto tags
that express only one side of a volatile policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech provisions of the Constitution require license plate
designs to be neutral, said U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state has chosen license plates as a forum for speech.
Once it makes this choice, it cannot discriminate against another
viewpoint,'' Duval wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is temporary, pending trial. State lawyers were
reviewing it to see if they would appeal or proceed to trial, said
Denise Bottcher, an attorney general's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a victory for the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, which filed a lawsuit on behalf of a pair of New
Orleans residents, the National Council of Jewish Women and Rabbi
Robert Loewy.
</P>
<P>
   The plates -- which state ''Choose Life'' and depict a baby,
wrapped in a blanket, carried in the beak of the state bird, a
brown pelican -- would cost motorists $25 in addition to other
registration fees.
</P>
<P>
   A committee that includes members of anti-abortion groups would
recommend how the state should spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed that the women and children of this state
who would have been helped by the money from these plates will see
a delay in getting that money,'' said Kathleen Benfield, a member
of The American Family Association, a Mississippi-based
conservative Christian group that backed the plates.
</P>
<P>
   The only other state with a ''Choose Life'' plate is Florida,
which began selling its version this month despite a pending legal
challenge similar to the Louisiana lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Peru prime minister denies government involvement in Berenson decision </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) - President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday that a
military court was obligated to revoke an American woman's life
prison sentence and grant a civilian trial because of evidence
suggesting she was not a leader of a leftist rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was ''based on new elements'' that indicate Lori
Berenson was not ''a head of a terrorist group but probably a
militant or sympathizer,'' said Fujimori, who had long maintained
that the New York native played a leadership role among the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori declined to elaborate further on the type of new
evidence. But his suggestion points to what could be a critical
element in a new trial in a civilian court because rebel leadership
was a key aspect of her conviction for aggravated terrorism, also
called treason in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that the case has been passed to the civilian court
does not mean she is going to go free,'' Fujimori told reporters.
''The penal code is clear. Terrorism is also punished in the
civilian court. The minimum is 20 years and there are also life
sentences.'' In Peru, sympathy for terrorism is a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The former Massachusetts Institute of Technology student was
found guilty of treason in January 1996 for allegedly helping the
leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's
Congress. Peruvian authorities say they foiled the alleged plan.
</P>
<P>
   Her imprisonment, often in conditions described as harsh by her
supporters, has been a sore point in U.S.-Peruvian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante said Berenson,
30, had been transferred early Tuesday from the Socabaya prison in
Peru's southern Andes to an unspecified penitentiary in the
capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson has denied that she helped mastermind the alleged plot
and insists she was never a member of the rebel group, commonly
known by its Spanish acronym, MRTA. But sympathy is not evident
from Peruvians, who were caught in the cross fire of rebel violence
during the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Burned into their memories is the image of Berenson's public
pre-sentence declaration in 1996 in which she angrily screamed
support for Peru's poor and shouted, ''There are no criminal
terrorists in the MRTA. It is a revolutionary movement.'' The
statement was considered by most here to be an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, a legal adviser for
Berenson's family in New York, said a new trial is unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will resist a trial. She's been held now for four years and
nine months and it has been admitted that she was held in error,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Tom Nooter, another family legal adviser, said the new
evidence does not stem from a re-examination of facts surrounding
Berenson's first trial. Instead, he said, the military court tapped
into subsequent investigations of the MRTA rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arrest of Lori did not end the investigation of the MRTA
at that time,'' Nooter said. ''I believe that further investigation
involving the structure of the MRTA led them to believe that she
was not ever a leader, which was what was required for the military
conviction to stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Clinton administration has urged Peru to grant
Berenson a new trial, arguing that the secret nature of her trial
didn't meet due process standards. Berenson and her supporters have
maintained that she was not allowed to present evidence at her
trial or to question prosecution witnesses before being sentenced
by a hooded judge.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Fujimori had steadfastly sworn Berenson would
serve out her life sentence in a Peruvian prison.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians charged that the surprise decision by the
military court was another example of government manipulation in
Peru's legal system, and accused Fujimori's government of caving in
to international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Federico Salas denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presumption is that this came from government intervention
in the judiciary,'' Salas told foreign correspondents. ''In the
case of Lori Berenson, nothing more was done than confirm the
actions of those within the country that have powers over judicial
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The central government doesn't meddle in the military or
civilian courts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International pressure has mounted on Fujimori to improve Peru's
damaged democracy since he claimed victory in a May presidential
runoff, amid irregularities and allegations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pushing for reforms to Peru's legal system, the
Organization of American States has also insisted that Fujimori
comply with the rulings of the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights.

<HEADLINE> Former Hostages Visit Libya  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- Six former hostages just released after
months in captivity in the Philippines sat patiently in Libya's
capital on Tuesday, listening to speech after speech heaping praise
on the man who helped buy their freedom: Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   The exhausted French, German and South African ex-hostages, some
wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Libyan leader's face, arrived
in Tripoli earlier Tuesday. They were greeted at the ruins of the
house where Gadhafi's adopted daughter was killed in a 1986 U.S.
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't forget the name that delivered you from the humiliation
of captivity. That name is Moammar Gadhafi,'' a Libyan official
told the six in a speech he read on behalf of Seif el-Islam,
Gadhafi's son and head of the Gadhafi International Association for
Charitable Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The site was decorated with anti-American and anti-British
posters and a huge sculpture of a fist crushing a U.S. jet. After
the 75-minute ''welcome ceremony'' was over, the Libyan announcer
invited the former hostages for a tour of the site destroyed ''by
the leader of international terrorism: America.''
</P>
<P>
   The former hostages, some of whom had been held hostage since
April by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines, were released
Sunday and Monday. The Libyan government took the lead in
negotiations to win their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heading home to relatives and friends, or to medical
examinations or psychological counseling after their ordeal, they
embarked on more than a 20-hour flight from the Philippines that
included an overnight layover on mattresses at an airport in the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans appeared determined to squeeze the last drop of
publicity out of their role in the hostage release as their North
African nation tries to end years of isolation as a pariah state.
They have often been accused of sponsoring terrorism and meddling
in the affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The freed hostages' trip to Libya is officially voluntary. But
it is widely believed that their governments agreed to the visit in
exchange for Libya's help in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Wallert, the son of released German hostage Werner Wallert,
said he didn't mind the Libya visit in light of the fact that Libya
helped spring his father from captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the hostages were freed, the stopover in Tripoli is
for me totally all right,'' he said in an interview with SAT1
television.
</P>
<P>
   Two former hostages -- Werner Wallert and South African Callie
Strydom -- attended the ceremony wearing white T-shirts with a
picture of the Libyan leader on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the one hand we are released and happy to be released. ...
On the other hand we are still concerned about those who are still
in captivity,'' Wallert, the German, said in a short address.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel amazing. Very happy, very happy,'' Strydom told
reporters afterward. ''We went through unbelievable things, from
military attacks to running around in the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, who came to power in a 1969 coup, often receives
foreign visitors at the ruined house in Tripoli, taking the
opportunity to criticize the United States for its Middle East
policies and for the 1986 bombing that killed at least three dozen
people. But he did not attend Tuesday's ceremony as had been widely
expected. His whereabouts were not known.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi earned unprecedented international thanks for persuading
the Abu Sayyaf rebels to release the six. He is working on winning
the freedom of 18 others -- six foreigners and 12 Filipinos -- still
held by the separatist Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators in the Philippines say Gadhafi paid $1 million per
captive, but Libya denies that, insisting it gained the releases by
promising development projects in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Libyan government did not pay a single dirham or a cent,''
Seif el-Islam Gadhafi, 28, told a news conference on Tuesday. He
also pledged that his organization would work for the release of
the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the release, the Philippine government announced
that an American, Jeffrey Craig Edwards Schilling, was kidnapped by
the rebels. There had been fears that paying ransoms would
encourage guerrillas to take more hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Libyan negotiator Rajab Azzarouq said Libya would work for
Schilling's release.
</P>
<P>
   France accuses Libyan agents in the 1989 bombing of a French
passenger jet that killed 170 people. On Tuesday, though, the
French minister for cooperation, Charles Josselin, was in Libya to
receive the French citizens among the former hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''This positive action by Libya in the release of the hostages
can clearly only improve relations between our two countries,'' he
told France Inter radio.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya's new image of a caring and humane nation appeared to
cut no ice with some of the relatives of the 270 victims of the
1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Two Libyans suspected
of masterminding the attack are currently on trial in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe Gadhafi has an iota of feeling for the six
hostages -- they're just a means to an end,'' said Bert Ammerman of
River Vale, N.J., whose brother Thomas was killed in the Pan Am
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli analyst criticized Gadhafi, saying that the money
will now go to finance other rebel actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is on the one hand freeing hostages, but he is also feeding
the coffers of organization hostile to governmentt of the
Phillippines,'' said Joseph Alpher, who was part of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak team at the Camp David peace talks in July.
''So any good will he accrues will be offset by Libyan funds likely
to be used to take other hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya has long-standing ties with Muslim rebels in the mostly
Catholic Philippines and has helped negotiate in previous
kidnappings. It has helped build schools and mosques in the
impoverished south, but has also been accused of training rebels
from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the larger Muslim rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Strydom and Wallert, the freed hostages included
Frenchwomen Marie Moarbes -- who is of Lebanese descent -- Sonia
Wendling and Maryse Burgot; and Strydom's wife, Monique. They all
returned home later on Tuesday except for Callie and Monique
Strydom, who were due to fly to South Africa early on Wednesday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Angels Protest of BoSox Game Denied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league baseball denied a protest filed by
the Anaheim Angels over their Aug. 21 loss to the Boston Red Sox.
No reason was given.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office said in a release that Paul Beeston,
baseball's chief operating officer, held a hearing on Tuesday about
the protest, which resulted from Anaheim's 7-6, 11-inning loss at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ''I
mean, history shows that a lot of them aren't upheld. But we felt
we had probably grounds to lodge a protest. We weren't going to
lodge a protest just on a whim. We felt we were on solid ground,
but the league didn't see it as we did, and that's their
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels trailed 2-1 when Bengie Molina hit a popup to short
center field with the bases loaded in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Jose Offerman picked up the ball in short center
field and threw it to third. Although the throw beat Tim Salmon to
the bag, third baseman Lou Merloni was not standing on the base, so
Salmon should have been safe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that third base umpire Jerry Meals had gone into
the outfield to make a call on whether the popup was caught. After
a short delay, second base umpire Derryl Cousins called Salmon out.
</P>
<P>
   Although teams cannot file a protest over an umpire's judgment,
the Angels said their case was over whether the right umpire made
the call. They also complained Cousins didn't ask for help when he
was unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins admitted the next day that he was out of position, but
maintained that it was his call to make.

<HEADLINE> Oscar-Winning Composer Nitzsche Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jack Nitzsche, an Oscar-winning songwriter,
record producer, arranger and studio musician who played keyboard
on some of the Rolling Stones' hits and collaborated with many
other major pop figures of the '60s, has died at 63.
</P>
<P>
   Nitzsche, who died of a heart attack Friday, won the best
original song Academy Award for 1982 for co-writing ''Up Where We
Belong'' for the movie ''An Officer and a Gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   He was described in the Penguin Encyclopedia of Pop Music as
''one of the most versatile of the backroom boys'' during the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rolling Stones, Nitzsche contributed keyboard parts to
such classics as ''Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the
Shadows?'' ''Play With Fire'' and ''Paint It Black.'' He also wrote
the choral arrangements for ''You Can't Always Get What You Want.''
</P>
<P>
   As an arranger, Nitzsche worked with master record producer Phil
Spector in 1962 on the Crystals' ''He's a Rebel.'' Their
association lasted through Ike and Tina Turner's acclaimed ''River
Deep, Mountain High'' in 1966. That was the last of Spector's lush
musical arrangements known as the ''Wall of Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitzsche also co-wrote the pop hit ''Needles and Pins'' with
Sonny Bono. It became a top 20 single for the British group the
Searchers in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   His 1963 instrumental ''The Lonely Surfer'' was one of the few
records in which he received performing credit.
</P>
<P>
   He worked at one time or another with Elvis Presley, Neil Young,
Captain Beefheart, Marianne Faithfull, the Monkees and Doris Day.
</P>
<P>
   He gradually turned more of his attention toward film scores,
working on the avant garde 1970 Mick Jagger film ''Performance.''
He succeeded in more mainstream films as well, contributing
original music to ''The Exorcist'' in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   His score for 1975's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' brought
him his first Oscar nomination. The song that won him the Oscar
seven years later, ''Up Where We Belong,'' was written with his
wife, folk singer Buffy Sainte-Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other film credits are ''Mermaids,'' 1990; ''When You
Comin' Back, Red Ryder?'' 1979; ''Stand by Me,'' 1986; and ''The
Razor's Edge,'' 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Nitzsche is survived by his son, Jack Jr., from his first
marriage, to Gracia Ann May.

<HEADLINE> Lions Sign Bates, Release Oxendine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions signed free-agent
running back Mario Bates on Tuesday and released Ken Oxendine, who
was claimed off waivers from Atlanta last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bates will report for practice with the Lions on Sept. 4, after
the team's first game.
</P>
<P>
   Bates is entering his seventh NFL season. He played for the New
Orleans Saints from 1994-97 and for the Arizona Cardinals the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He has 799 carries for 2,921 yards and has scored 36 touchdowns
in his NFL career. Bates also has 50 receptions for 310 yards, and
has returned 53 kickoffs for 1,251 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions also signed four players to their practice squad:
defensive tackle Alfonso Boone, wide receivers Larry Foster and
Andre' Rone, and tailback Andy Vincent.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Martinez Sits Out Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- New York Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez was
out of the lineup Tuesday night against the Seattle Mariners
because of a hyperextended left foot, sustained while sliding into
home plate Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was available as a pinch-hitter, Yankees manager Joe
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll see how he feels,'' Torre said. ''I think he'll be OK
tomorrow. I hope I shut him down for the night. I hope I don't need
him to pinch hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said his left foot was swollen and sore. He was injured
when his foot hit catcher Dan Wilson's shin guard when he was
thrown out at the plate while trying to score from second base in
the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a little swollen and it's sore a little bit,''
Martinez said. ''I told him (Torre) I could play without any
problems without favoring it. But he decided to give me one day
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a left-handed batter, would have been in the lineup
against left-hander Jamie Moyer of the Mariners if his foot hadn't
been hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Torre had Jorge Posada at first base in Martinez's place.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, who came out of Monday night's game in the eighth
when his left hamstring cramped up, is scheduled to make his next
start Sunday against Minnesota at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Clemens was ''100 percent'' and Clemens said before
Tuesday night's game against Seattle that he felt ''fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens took part in the Yankees' warmup drills, then iced his
left hamstring as a precaution.

<HEADLINE> Forego Ready for Saratoga  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Richter Scale will carry the high
weight among 10 contenders in the 21st running of the $250,000
Forego Handicap at Saratoga Race Course on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kaster's 6-year-old will concede from 4-11 pounds to his
rivals in the Forego, which has been shortened to 6&AMP;frac12; furlongs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Since trainer Mary Jo Lohmeier returned Richter Scale from the
turf to the dirt, he has recorded five wins in six starts. With
career earnings of $1.1 million, the veteran campaigner is a
serious contender for divisional honors.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just having a very good year,'' Lohmeier said. ''He's
always had a history of foot problems, so we tried him on the turf
last year. It turned out that he only liked the turf if it was rock
hard. He's been on the dirt ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Intidab and Successful Appeal, the first two finishers in
Saratoga's A.G. Vanderbilt Handicap, will be on hand to provide
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Successful Appeal was declared the winner of the A.G. Vanderbilt
after Intidab, the first finisher, was deemed to have interfered
with him in the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Intidab was seventh in last year's Forego. Trainer Kiaran
McLaughlin is expecting a much better performance from him this
time. Meet-leading rider Jerry Bailey enhances his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer John Kimmel is confident that his charge, Successful
Appeal, will also run well in the Forego.
</P>
<P>
   ''He breezed last Wednesday and has been training very well.
He's more mature, bigger, and has more flesh than he did as a
3-year-old. Hopefully, there won't be any bumping incidents this
time. It's going to be a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   From the rail out the Forego field is: Proven Cure, 112, Shane
Sellers; Intidab, 118, Jerry Bailey; Iron Punch, 115, Carlos Cruz;
Bright Valour, 113, Pat Day; One Way Love, 116, Patrick Husbands;
Silver Season, 115, Eibar Coa; Successful Appeal, 119, Edgar Prado;
Chasin' Wimmin, 112, Jean-Luc Samyn; Shadow Caster, 113, Jorge
Chavez and Richter Scale, 121, Richard Migliore.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Claim Byrd Off Waivers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Wideout Isaac Byrd was claimed off
waivers Tuesday by the Carolina Panthers, a team in need of an
experienced receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, waived by Tennessee earlier in the day, started for the
Titans in the Super Bowl and caught two passes for 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers waived cornerback Reggie Howard to make room on the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's agent told the Gaston Gazette that Byrd would practice
with Carolina on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a good, young player,'' the agent, Jim Steiner, said.
''He runs very precise routes. I think he'll be a pretty good fit
in Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said the Panthers will assume the final year of Byrd's
contract, which pays him $472,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina had searched for an experienced receiver since Patrick
Jeffers was lost for the season with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament. His replacement, Jim Turner, also tore his ACL and was
lost for the year.
</P>
<P>
   That left Muhsin Muhammad and Donald Hayes as the only two
receivers on the roster who have ever caught an NFL pass.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, entering his fourth NFL season, became expendable when the
Titans signed free agent Carl Pickens. He started six games last
season in place of the injured Yancey Thigpen and caught 14 passes
for 261 yards with two touchdowns in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   He played in all four of the Titans' postseason games last year
and had four receptions for 40 yards.

<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates third baseman Aramis
Ramirez, who probably miss the rest of the season, was placed on
the 15-day disabled list Tuesday because of a separated left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was injured diving for a ball in the first inning Monday
night. His roster spot was taken by infielder Abraham Nunez, who
was recalled from Triple-A Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Gene Lamont said most of the playing time at third base
will go to Enrique Wilson, acquired from Cleveland on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez opened the season with the Pirates but was sent to
Nashville on April 28 with a .167 average.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning, he increased his average to .256 and was
hitting .327 in his last 27 games with four homers and 21 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont said there is a slight possibility Ramirez might be able
to play before the season ends on Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' Filmmakers Sued  </HEADLINE>
By THEO EMERY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The family of doomed fishing boat captain Frank
William ''Billy'' Tyne Jr. is suing the makers of this summer's big
screen hit ''The Perfect Storm,'' contending he was depicted in a
''false and unflattering light.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyne's two daughters and his wife filed a lawsuit Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Orlando, Fla., against Time Warner
Entertainment Co. and the two companies that produced the film. The
lawsuit contends that Tyne was cast in a negative light in the
film, that it was produced without their consent and their privacy
was violated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family felt wronged, and they wanted something done,''
said the family's attorney, Stephen J. Calvacca of Orlando.
''Fiction, as fiction, is protected speech. Fiction, masquerading
as fact, is not protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner released a statement Tuesday saying that the studio
did not need permission from Tyne's family to make the film or
portray him. The studio challenged the claim that Tyne was depicted
in a negative light.
</P>
<P>
   ''We most certainly disagree with the plaintiffs' claim that the
film in any way disparaged Mr. Tyne or tarnished his memory. This
lawsuit implicates fundamental First Amendment freedoms and we
intend therefore to vigorously defend it,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The film, based on the book by the same name by author Sebastian
Junger, tells the story of Tyne's final swordfishing expedition in
October 1991 into the heart of storms that converged in the North
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Tyne and five crew members on the Gloucester-based boat all
drowned, and the boat, the Andrea Gail, was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book became a best seller, and the movie released this
summer captivated audiences across the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, the film depicted Tyne, who was
portrayed by George Clooney, as ''emotionally aloof, reckless,
excessively risk-taking, self-absorbed, emasculated, despondent,
obsessed and maniacal.''
</P>
<P>
   The family is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well
as royalties from the movie.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Red Sox-Devil Rays
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON: RHP Tom Gordon (right elbow surgery) is scheduled to
throw off a mound for the first time Sept. 14. The injured Red Sox
closer, who is rehabbing at the team's complex in Fort Myers, Fla.,
visited his teammates before the game. Gordon, who's contract has a
club option for 2001, hopes to remain with Red Sox. ''I enjoy
Boston and I enjoy the fans,'' said Gordon, who should be ready for
start of spring training. ''I want to be here next year.'' ... RHP
Ramon Martinez (bruised right knee), who is scheduled to start
Saturday's game against Seattle, reported no problems after
throwing 45 pitches in a simulated game. ... LHP Pete Schourek
(left shoulder) said he is ready to rejoin the Red Sox after
throwing 4 1-3 innings in a minor league rehab start for Class-A
Sarasota Monday. The Red Sox are not expected to activate him until
after rosters are expanded Friday. ... LHP Jeff Fassero will make
his first start Wednesday since voicing his displeasure about being
pulled in the sixth inning of his outing last Friday at Kansas
City. ''It was something that built up and I let it off my chest,''
Fassero said. ''I'm just going on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Manager Larry Rothschild said the status of 3B Vinny
Castilla (lower back inflammation) will be re-evaluated in the next
2-3 days. Castilla, who has missed the past 29 games, could begin a
minor league rehab stint after that. ... The Devil Rays started the
day with a 4.27 ERA since June 1, lowest in the AL. Over the
season's first two months, the teams ERA of 5.77 was the highest in
the league. ''They've been more aggressive going after hitters,
working quick and throwing strikes,'' Rothschild said. ... LF Greg
Vaughn, who has been limited to DH since Aug. 7 by a right shoulder
injury, has resumed throwing from the outfield.
Indians-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians are looking for more aggressive
baserunning from five-time AL stolen base leader Kenny Lofton.
Entering Tuesday night's game, Lofton had only three steals since
Aug. 5, and 19 overall. ... Starting Sept. 1, the Indians' wild
card chances will get a boost with 20 of their last 34 games at
Jacobs Field. Cleveland is 35-26 at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Manager Johnny Oates has benched rookie 3B Mike Lamb in
favor of utility man Scott Sheldon. Lamb has been struggling in the
field with 25 errors, the most by a third baseman in the majors
this season. ... LHP Darren Oliver will make another rehab start
for Triple-A Oklahoma, meaning one more start for the Rangers by
rookie Brian Sikorski on Thursday. Oliver has been on the DL since
July 31 with a weak left shoulder. ... The Rangers honored former
team president Tom Schieffer in pregame ceremonies. A plague
recognizing Schieffer's role with the franchise from 1989-99 was
unveiled at an entrance outside the home plate entrance at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
Tigers-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Detroit is 14-11 when RHP Hideo Nomo starts. Nomo will
vie for his third straight win Wednesday. ... The Tigers have
clinched their third straight winning month, a feat they hadn't
accomplished since 1988. ... Tony Clark, striving to return from a
lumbar spine strain, went 0-for-3 Monday in a rehab assignment with
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles called up C Fernando Lunar from Double-A
Bowie to replace C-INF Mike Kinkade, who left to join the U.S.
Olympic team. ... RHP Alan Mills, sidelined with right shoulder
inflammation since Aug. 4, allowed a run in two innings Monday in a
rehab assignment with Class-A Frederick. He will likely be
activated Friday. ... The Orioles needed one more error to reach
100 in a season for the first time since 1993. ... Baltimore has
won only 11 of 34 series since the end of April.
Twins-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins entered play Tuesday with a 21-16 record
against the AL Central. It is the only division in which they hold
a winning record. The Twins are 17-24 against the AL East, 14-21
against the AL West and 7-11 vs. the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Three Royals are on pace to establish club records
in offensive categories. Jermaine Dye would finish with 38 homers
at his current pace, which would better Steve Balboni's club record
of 36 in 1985. Mike Sweeney has 116 RBIs entering Tuesday's game,
already the fifth best mark in club history. At his current pace,
he would finish with 145, well past Hal McRae's 133 in 1982. Johnny
Damon is on pace to score 142 runs, which would eclipse Willie
Wilson's mark of 133, set in 1980.
Blue Jays-Angels
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Entering Tuesday, the Blue Jays were 16-15 with a 4.70
staff ERA since Dave Stewart replaced Rick Langford as pitching
coach on July 24. But over the last nine games, Toronto starters
are 5-0 with a 2.44 ERA. ... With his .361 average, 118 RBIs and
AL-leading 39 home runs, Carlos Delgado has a chance to become only
the third player in history to win a Triple Crown and a league MVP
while playing for a team that didn't finish in first place. The
only two in that category were Ducky Medwick of the 1937 St. Louis
Cardinals, and Jimmie Foxx of the 1933 Philadelphia Athletics.
''Anything can happen in this game, but that's something that is
completely out of my control,'' he said. ''I can only worry about
what I can do, so I'm just going to try to get as many hits as I
can, and we'll check the numbers in October.'' ... The three home
runs the Blue Jays hit Monday gave them 39 this month, tying the
franchise record for August with two games left. This year alone,
they have set club records for homers in April (43), May (43), June
(48) and July (44).
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: A protest lodged by the Angels because of a disputed
call by umpire Derryl Cousins in an Aug. 21 loss at Boston was
denied by major league baseball on Tuesday -- following a hearing
held by Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer. ''I'm not
surprised,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ''I mean, history shows
that a lot of them aren't upheld.'' ... Mo Vaughn needs two RBIs to
reach the 100 mark for the sixth time in his career, and third year
in a row.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Diamondbacks-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 3B Matt Williams batted sixth for the second straight
game. Williams, who has been on the DL twice this season and missed
58 games, has batted cleanup 62 times and fifth twice. ... Manager
Buck Showalter held a 30-minute team meeting before Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Montreal is 22-21 in the first game of a series, and
15-27 in the second. ... The Expos entered Tuesday's game with a
15-10 mark against Arizona overall, including a 5-2 record this
season.
Cardinals-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Manager John Boles says he doesn't expect a lot of
roster additions when the Marlins make their September callups.
''This is not a tryout camp,'' Boles says. ''We're trying to win
games.'' ... Marlins pitcher A.J. Burnett, who hit his first
major-league homer Monday, is batting .357 this season (5-for-12).
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Through Monday, the Cardinals' 6-7-8 spots in the
order were batting .421 on the team's trip after five games. ...
Cards shortstop Edgar Renteria went 2-for-4 Monday, raising his
batting average to .358 (19-for-53) lifetime against his former
team.
Giants-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Former Pirates manager Jim Leyland visited with
Giants manager Dusty Baker before Monday's game against the
Pirates. Leyland now scouts for the St. Louis Cardinals from his
home base in Pittsburgh. ''He said around the league he's heard
that we play the game the way it's supposed to be played,'' Baker
said. ''That's a tremendous compliment.'' ... Russ Davis had been
1-for-21 as a pinch hitter before he hit a grand slam against
Florida on Aug. 21. Exactly one week later, he delivered the
game-winning homer in Monday's 5-4 victory over Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: With Aramis Ramirez likely to miss the rest of the
season because of a separated left shoulder, Enrique Wilson is
taking over at third. Wilson has mostly played the two middle
infield slots since he came to the Pirates from Cleveland in a
trade on July 29. ... Three Rivers Stadium was so dark during
Monday night's game that Giants Manager Dusty Baker asked the
umpires if all the lights were on. With the Stadium facing
demolition after the football season, there's a feeling that
weakened bulbs aren't being replaced as promptly as they may have
been in the past.
Astros-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Jeff Bagwell's two-run single in the third inning gave
him 33 RBIs in August, an Astros record for one month. He had
shared the previous mark of 31, doing it three times, with Derek
Bell. ... Tony Eusebio started the day with a 24-game hitting
streak, tied with Arizona's Tony Womack for the longest in the NL
this year. Eusebio was robbed of a hit in his first at-bat by
center fielder Jay Payton's catch on the warning track and struck
out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets purchased the contract of 2B Leandro Arias
from Class-A Pittsfield and immediately put him on the 15-day DL.
Leandro, 19, had surgery on his right shoulder on May 9. The move
gives the Mets added flexibility with their postseason roster,
which must be set by Thursday. Players on the DL, however, can
later be replaced -- meaning utilityman Joe McEwing, for example,
could be promoted from Triple-A Norfolk after the deadline and
still be eligible for the postseason. ... 3B Robin Ventura, in a
1-for-16 slump, did not start. He spent part of the afternoon
across the street from Shea Stadium watching the U.S. Open tennis
tournament.
Rockies-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Todd Helton, who leads the majors with a .397 batting
average, wasn't in the starting lineup after feeling a slight
twinge in his back. ... Wednesday's starter Julian Tavarez is 9-2
with a 3.97 ERA. In his six starts this season, Colorado is 6-0.
... C Brent Mayne is hitting .190 (8-for-42) against left-handers.
The catcher wasn't in Tuesday's starting lineup against southpaw
Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: 3B Scott Rolen wasn't in the starting lineup on
Tuesday. Rolen is hitting .355 (27-for-76) with four homers and 14
RBIs in his last 19 games. Manager Terry Francona has rested Rolen
after he has played on turf for several nights. Rolen had played
seven consecutive games on artificial turf. ... The Phillies are
23-22 in one-run games. ... RF Bobby Abreu has set career-highs in
homers (21) and doubles (45).
Reds-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ron Villone's five-hitter Monday was the first
complete game by a Reds left-hander since Mike Remlinger tossed an
8-0 shutout at Arizona on July 11, 1998. Remlinger, of course, is
now a reliever for the Braves. ... The Reds had not been held
scoreless through their first 131 games, a franchise record to
begin the season and the longest stretch by any team since the
Phillies scored at least a run in their first 158 games in 1993.
The 1932 Yankees are the only team to go an entire season without
being on the wrong end of a shutout. ... Cincinnati is the only
team with a winning record on the road and a losing record at home.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Things aren't getting any better for OF Reggie Sanders,
who started in right field while Brian Jordan rested his sore
shoulder. Having already endured an 0-for-34 skid in April, Sanders
was mired in a 2-of-19 slump after hitting into an inning-ending
double play in the second with runners at first and third. ... RHP
Greg Maddux has lost five of seven decisions since July 22, which
is more defeats than he had for the entire season in both 1995
(19-2) and 1997 (19-4). Maddux (14-8) is trying to avoid his first
year with double-figure losses since 1996 (15-11).
Padres-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres placed 2B Bret Boone on the 15-day DL with
a bruised right knee and recalled infielder Kevin Nicholson. ...
The Padres and the Double-A Mobile will be together for at least
four more years. The team announced Tuesday it had extended its
working agreement though the 2004 season. ... The Padres also
extended their working agreement with the Fort Wayne Wizards, their
Single-A club in the Midwest League, through the 2002 season. ...
At 64-67 heading into Tuesday's game, the Padres were within three
games of .500 for the first time since May 5. ... At 17-9 so far in
August, guaranteeing San Diego its first winning month since June
1999.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: After getting poked, prodded and tested for more than
five hours, Mark Grace was back in the Cubs' lineup Tuesday. Grace
left Monday's game with dizzy spells, and spent Tuesday morning
being examined by doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
''Anytime a doctor puts you in (an MRI machine), usually they think
something's wrong. That's when you get worried,'' Grace said.
''Plus, it's your head.'' Despite extensive tests, doctors couldn't
find anything wrong with him. One doctor told him he might have
been dehydrated because he drank a lot of coffee before the game
and didn't eat. ''They told me try to get more sleep, try to eat
better and just go play,'' he said. ''I've never felt that way
before and I never want to again.'' ... While the Cubs are mired in
losses again, their minor league teams are enjoying good summers.
Double-A West Tenn clinched the Southern League's West Division
second-half title Monday, and Single-A Eugene is tied for first in
the Northwest League's South Division. Single-A Dayton lowered its
magic number to one Monday in the Florida State League's East
Division second-half race. All that bodes well for the future,
manager Don Baylor said. ''Winning never gets old, even at that
level,'' Baylor said. ''If guys win in the minor leagues, that's
what they expect. ... They're going to want to continue it for a
while.'' ... SS Luis Montanez, the Cubs first-round draft pick in
June, was named the Arizona League's MVP at Mesa.
Dodgers-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: OF Gary Sheffield missed his ninth consecutive game
with the flu and a five-game suspension. ... The Dodgers have
shuffled their pitching rotation. Darren Dreifort will start
Wednesday and Carlos Perez will go Thursday. ... Los Angeles has
three outfielders injured. Besides Sheffield's flu, Devon White has
missed four straight games with a strained quadriceps muscle and
Bruce Aven was scratched before Monday's game with a strained left
oblique muscle. ''We just need to get some healthy bodies,''
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: 3B Jose Hernandez began a rehabilitation assignment
in Indianapolis on Tuesday. Hernandez, out since Aug. 10 with a
strained lower back, is expected to be the DH, but will probably
return to the team well before the end of the 20-day stint. ... The
Brewers are scoring 4.52 runs per game in the 25 games since Richie
Sexson came over from Cleveland, raising their season average to
4.40. SS Mark Loretta also returned from a lengthy stint on the DL
during that time. Milwaukee is still last in the majors in hitting
at .244. ... Through 131 games, Milwaukee opponents had stolen less
than half as many bases in 2000 (68) as in 1999 (131). Credit C
Henry Blanco, who had thrown out 34 of 60 potential base-stealers.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Bombing Secrecy Order Upheld  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A 1996 order prohibiting the release of certain
information in the Oklahoma City bombing trials of Timothy McVeigh
and Terry Nichols will remain in effect, a judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch issued the ruling after
the federal government asked whether 4-year-old order still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for McVeigh and Nichols last week asked that the order
remain in effect because of pending appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Matsch said it was the ''continuing obligation of
this court to protect the integrity of the proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh is on death row after being convicted of murder and
conspiracy in the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal
building, which killed 168 people. Nichols was convicted of
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy and sentenced to life in
prison without parole. Both men have appealed.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Warns About East Timor Militias  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations warned Tuesday that
recent militia attacks against peacekeepers in East Timor appear to
be a coordinated effort to undermine the territory's transition to
independence and discredit the interim U.N. administration.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told Security Council
members that they should be prepared for a worst-case scenario in
which the militias may try to destabilize East Timor through
''offensive guerrilla-style operations'' against civilians and U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   His unusually bleak briefing came on the eve of the first
anniversary of East Timor's vote for independence from Indonesia,
the results of which sparked a weekslong looting and killing
rampage by pro-Indonesian militias opposed to independence.
</P>
<P>
   The violence ended after an Australian-led intervention force
took control and restored calm and the United Nations Transitional
Administration, or UNTAET, began running the territory.
</P>
<P>
   However, in his briefing, Annabi said attacks in the last month
by eight groups of pro-Indonesian militias showed a new willingness
by anti-independence forces to exchange fire with U.N.
peacekeepers. Two peacekeepers have been killed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their level of activity within East Timor is reflective of a
degree of coordination and preparation that has not been seen so
far,'' Annabi said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.N. officials said pro-Indonesian militiaman and
peacekeepers exchanged gunfire near East Timor's troubled border.
The U.N. has repeatedly complained that militia gangs use refugee
camps in Indonesian-controlled West Timor as bases for border
incursions. Security on the border has been stepped up ahead of
Wednesday's anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the clash between a squad of Australian
troops and two militia members, peacekeeping spokesman Col. Brynar
Nymo said.
</P>
<P>
   Annabi said he believed that the intent of the militias ''is to
continue a pattern of violence against the civilian population and
UNTAET in order to try and undermine the transition process.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the increasing violence, plans to reduce the number
of U.N. peacekeepers in certain sectors of East Timor have been
shelved and battalions have been redeployed to bolster units that
have come under fire, Annabi said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the Indonesian armed forces, implicated in the
1999 violence, may have at least allowed the recent attacks to
occur, noting that some militia members have been found with army
uniforms and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador, Markarim Wibisono, rejected
suggestions that the mere presence of army uniforms among militia
members implied army involvement, noting ''such material can be
easily acquired on the black market.''
</P>
<P>
   While condemning the recent attacks on U.N. personnel, Wibisono
stressed that UNTAET -- not Indonesia -- is responsible for what goes
on inside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But several Security Council members said Indonesia was
responsible for curbing the source of the violence -- the militias
who operate across the border in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees echoed
that sentiment Tuesday in Geneva. A ''just and lasting solution to
the refugee problem'' depends on law and order being imposed in
West Timor's sprawling refugee camps, said spokesman Kris Janowski.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s refugee agency announced Tuesday it would resume its
operations in West Timor after a six-day suspension that followed a
recent attack on three of its workers by pro-Indonesian militia
members. The three were badly injured in last week's assault.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after Indonesian officials promised a thorough
investigation and said two of those involved had been arrested and
will be charged in court.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Dad Charged for Drugged Juice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A man who concocted a drink from
''psychedelic flowers'' was charged with negligence after a baby
sitter unwittingly served the drink to his two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   The children began hallucinating after drinking the liquid,
saying phrases like ''see the frogs'' and ''see the presents.''
They were hospitalized for several days.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' father, Thierry Cassagnol, surrendered to authorities
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cassagnol, 42, boiled some angel's trumpet plant and mixed the
broth with red Kool-Aid at his Sarasota home, police said. The
15-year-old baby sitter apparently found the concoction in the
refrigerator and gave it to the two boys, ages 3 and 5, on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Cassagnol endangered his sons by leaving the
drink in the refrigerator in a 12-ounce water bottle, near
containers of soda, juice and water. He admitted making the
concoction, according to an arrest report.
</P>
<P>
   Angels' trumpet is a hallucinogenic and poisonous herb that can
grow up to 5 feet tall. Possession is not illegal, but charges can
be filed if it is used to create a drug or if children are
endangered.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Job numbers at former air base inflated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - The agency in charge of developing the
former Plattsburgh Air Force Base has inflated the number of jobs
created at the site, a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tuesday's Plattsburgh Press-Republican, Plattsburgh
Airbase Redevelopment Corp. employs about 700 people, not the 1,000
it has been reporting. And at least 161 of these jobs are
part-time.
</P>
<P>
   Presented Monday with the results of a Press-Republican survey
of PARC tenants, CEO Daniel Wieneke said the number of jobs is in
constant flux and that the loss of firms such as AMI, which
assembles high-speed train seats, throws the tally.
</P>
<P>
   AMI left PARC in March to move to larger quarters elsewhere in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Another 30 jobs will leave PARC on Wednesday when Direct Source
leaves for the Clinton County Air Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
   Downplaying a survey conducted by the newspaper, Douglas said,
''The numbers game is not important. Its still more (civilian jobs)
than there were at the Air Force Base.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that PARC was careful to select firms that promised
relatively high wages. Last week alone, he said, two Canadian firms
were dissuaded from locating at the site because they planned to
offer minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The state, through its Empire State Development agency, helps
fund PARCs salaries, administration, advertising and infrastructure
improvements, budgeting $2.5 million for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our funding is not based on how many jobs they create,'' said
Gregory Caito, Empire States regional director in the North
Country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most successful Air Base redevelopments in
the State of New York. Were leaps and bounds ahead of other
bases,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Record Dry Spell Hits North Texas  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA K. BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOYD, Texas (AP) -- Gazing across a field of shrunken yellow
watermelons on withered vines, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
on Tuesday promised federal aid to four more counties in
drought-stricken north Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman's visit marked the 60th consecutive day without
measurable rainfall in north Texas, where crops are parched and
reservoirs are drying up. The previous record was 58 days, set in
1934 and 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ''These folks are really hurting,'' he said. ''I don't like to
be here on a day setting records -- not these kinds of records,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman has previously declared 153 Texas counties either
primary or contiguous agricultural disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   He said low-interest loans may provide some short-term relief to
farmers facing a bleak situation, but if the dry weather continues,
officials will be forced to find other ways to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drought is even more an insidious natural disaster than, let's
say, a hurricane or floods or tornados, because it happens very
slowly,'' Glickman said. ''Its impact is more long range, far
reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers agree.
</P>
<P>
   Samie Erwin, 65, who owns the 400-acre farm Glickman toured,
said the dry weather the past few summers is just as bad as the
Dust Bowl and the drought in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin's son-in-law, Jimmy Gentry, who helps grow peanuts,
watermelons and cantaloupes on the farm about 70 miles northwest of
Fort Worth, said he has already lost at least half of his crop.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just about disaster,'' Gentry said. ''I've been
farming 17 years, and I've never seen it this bad, this quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Drought conditions since 1996 have caused more than $5 billion
in losses to farmers and ranchers statewide, said Allen Spelce,
spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was plenty of rainfall in 1997, agricultural
losses totaled $2.1 billion in 1996 and 1998. Last year the drought
led to losses of $223 million. Losses so far this year are $595
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been an ongoing cycle,'' Spelce said. ''Since '96,
we've just been in the same cycle over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers say the only real relief is rain, and lots of it. But
that isn't likely to happen anytime soon, according to the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The extended forecast for north Texas calls for continued clear
skies and daily temperatures peaking around 100 degrees with only a
slight chance of rain late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Proenza, director of the National Weather Service southern
regional office in Fort Worth, said the weather pattern called La
Nina, which has led to the drought across much of the southern
United States, appears to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   That may mean normal rainfall in September, although it may not
be enough to make up for the two-month deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to say it, but there's no immediate relief in sight,''
he said.

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Barring an appeal by the government, fired Los
Alamos National Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee should be free on bail by
Friday, a federal judge said today. A prosecutor said the government is likely
to appeal. U.S. District Judge James Parker ordered the government to complete
its search of Lee's home and finalize conditions for his release on $1 million
bail by noon Friday. Lee, 60, has been jailed since his arrest Dec. 10 on 59
counts alleging he transferred restricted data to unsecure computers and tape at
laboratory. He was twice previously refused bail, including once by Parker in
December. But last week Parker said the case for holding Lee at the Santa Fe

down yesterday as part of a plea bargain worked out in cooperation with
veterans. ''We didn't want to destroy these kids lives by sending them to the

U.N. because China rejects his call for an autonomous Tibet. So Drikung Chetsang
Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist leader, conveyed the message on his behalf to more
than 1,000 religious leaders gathered for the summit. While the Dalai Lama said
that he joined the group ''in spirit,'' the Nobel Peace laureate was not invited

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSE HALL, Jamaica (AP) -- Notah Begay and Hal Sutton each shot
an even-par 71 Tuesday to tie their Shell's Wonderful World of Golf
match at White Witch Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   The players split the $150,000 prize in their debuts for the
longtime series.
</P>
<P>
   The money and one-day trip to Jamaica were unexpected for Begay,
who was asked to fill in because Vijay Singh injured his left
forearm last week. Begay has won twice on the PGA Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   The match will be shown on ESPN on Oct. 10 from 9:30 p.m. to 11
p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 8, Giants 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kris Benson benefitted from some extra rest,
allowing one hit in eight innings to win for the first time since
July 8, as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the San Francisco Giants 8-0
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Benson (9-11) had been 0-5 in eight starts since beating
Minnesota just before the All-Star break. He had been struggling
with his control, which prompted Manager Gene Lamont to push his
scheduled start back three days to give him more rest.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off as the right-hander allowed only an opposite-field
single to Barry Bonds in the first inning. Benson walked five and
struck out seven and was lifted after throwing 119 pitches. Josias
Manzanillo finished the one-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez (13-10), coming off consecutive shutouts of
Atlanta and Florida, was knocked out before retiring a batter in
the third inning -- his shortest outing in 107 career starts, except
for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up three runs in the first inning, retired the side in
order in the second, then was chased in the third when he allowed
four consecutive extra-base hits. He allowed seven runs and seven
hits two-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Wilson hit a two-run double in the first and scored on
Warren Morris' single for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Brown opened the third with a double and scored on Jason
Kendall's triple. Brian Giles doubled and John Vander Wal hit his
18th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Morris added an RBI single in the fifth off Joe Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates broke a five-game losing streak with their fourth
win in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The last Giants pitcher to pitch more than two consecutive
shutouts was Gaylord Perry, who had three in 1970. ... J.T. Snow is
in a 3-for-29 slump. ... Pittsburgh's Adrian Brown extended his
career-best hitting streak to 12 games. ... Wilson made his first
start in place of Aramis Ramirez, who went on the disabled list
with a separated shoulder sustained in Monday's game. ... Vander
Wal subbed at first for Kevin Young, who has a slight groin pull.

<HEADLINE> Another Year in Swissair Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Investigators said Tuesday they have reconstructed
the front part of a Swissair jetliner but need another year to
complete their study of the 1998 crash that killed all 229 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 111 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia
during a flight from New York to Geneva on Sept. 2, 1998. Pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit about 53 minutes into the trip, and
the electrical systems began failing about 15 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday the
investigation so far had cost $34 million and involved 2 million
pieces of wreckage, some as small as a dollar coin.
</P>
<P>
   The front 33 feet of the MD-11 jetliner have been reconstructed,
and safety board spokesman Jim Harris said the fire that caused the
crash occurred somewhere in the ceiling of that section, just
behind the cockpit wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for anything that will tell us where the fire
might have started,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   A final report was expected by the end of next year, according
to Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe insulation around halogen map lights in
the cockpit may have helped spread the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in March ordered
similar map lights on other MD-11s unplugged and inspected.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Red Sox-Devil Rays
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON: RHP Tom Gordon (right elbow surgery) is scheduled to
throw off a mound for the first time Sept. 14. The injured Red Sox
closer, who is rehabbing at the team's complex in Fort Myers, Fla.,
visited his teammates before the game. Gordon, who's contract has a
club option for 2001, hopes to remain with Red Sox. ''I enjoy
Boston and I enjoy the fans,'' said Gordon, who should be ready for
start of spring training. ''I want to be here next year.'' ... RHP
Ramon Martinez (bruised right knee), who is scheduled to start
Saturday's game against Seattle, reported no problems after
throwing 45 pitches in a simulated game. ... LHP Pete Schourek
(left shoulder) said he is ready to rejoin the Red Sox after
throwing 4 1-3 innings in a minor league rehab start for Class-A
Sarasota Monday. The Red Sox are not expected to activate him until
after rosters are expanded Friday. ... LHP Jeff Fassero will make
his first start Wednesday since voicing his displeasure about being
pulled in the sixth inning of his outing last Friday at Kansas
City. ''It was something that built up and I let it off my chest,''
Fassero said. ''I'm just going on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Manager Larry Rothschild said the status of 3B Vinny
Castilla (lower back inflammation) will be re-evaluated in the next
2-3 days. Castilla, who has missed the past 29 games, could begin a
minor league rehab stint after that. ... The Devil Rays started the
day with a 4.27 ERA since June 1, lowest in the AL. Over the
season's first two months, the teams ERA of 5.77 was the highest in
the league. ''They've been more aggressive going after hitters,
working quick and throwing strikes,'' Rothschild said. ... LF Greg
Vaughn, who has been limited to DH since Aug. 7 by a right shoulder
injury, has resumed throwing from the outfield.
Indians-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians are looking for more aggressive
baserunning from five-time AL stolen base leader Kenny Lofton.
Entering Tuesday night's game, Lofton had only three steals since
Aug. 5, and 19 overall. ... Starting Sept. 1, the Indians' wild
card chances will get a boost with 20 of their last 34 games at
Jacobs Field. Cleveland is 35-26 at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Manager Johnny Oates has benched rookie 3B Mike Lamb in
favor of utility man Scott Sheldon. Lamb has been struggling in the
field with 25 errors, the most by a third baseman in the majors
this season. ... LHP Darren Oliver will make another rehab start
for Triple-A Oklahoma, meaning one more start for the Rangers by
rookie Brian Sikorski on Thursday. Oliver has been on the DL since
July 31 with a weak left shoulder. ... The Rangers honored former
team president Tom Schieffer in pregame ceremonies. A plague
recognizing Schieffer's role with the franchise from 1989-99 was
unveiled at an entrance outside the home plate entrance at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
Tigers-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Detroit is 14-11 when RHP Hideo Nomo starts. Nomo will
vie for his third straight win Wednesday. ... The Tigers have
clinched their third straight winning month, a feat they hadn't
accomplished since 1988. ... Tony Clark, striving to return from a
lumbar spine strain, went 0-for-3 Monday in a rehab assignment with
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles called up C Fernando Lunar from Double-A
Bowie to replace C-INF Mike Kinkade, who left to join the U.S.
Olympic team. ... RHP Alan Mills, sidelined with right shoulder
inflammation since Aug. 4, allowed a run in two innings Monday in a
rehab assignment with Class-A Frederick. He will likely be
activated Friday. ... The Orioles needed one more error to reach
100 in a season for the first time since 1993. ... Baltimore has
won only 11 of 34 series since the end of April.
Twins-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins entered play Tuesday with a 21-16 record
against the AL Central. It is the only division in which they hold
a winning record. The Twins are 17-24 against the AL East, 14-21
against the AL West and 7-11 vs. the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Three Royals are on pace to establish club records
in offensive categories. Jermaine Dye would finish with 38 homers
at his current pace, which would better Steve Balboni's club record
of 36 in 1985. Mike Sweeney has 116 RBIs entering Tuesday's game,
already the fifth best mark in club history. At his current pace,
he would finish with 145, well past Hal McRae's 133 in 1982. Johnny
Damon is on pace to score 142 runs, which would eclipse Willie
Wilson's mark of 133, set in 1980.
Blue Jays-Angels
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Entering Tuesday, the Blue Jays were 16-15 with a 4.70
staff ERA since Dave Stewart replaced Rick Langford as pitching
coach on July 24. But over the last nine games, Toronto starters
are 5-0 with a 2.44 ERA. ... With his .361 average, 118 RBIs and
AL-leading 39 home runs, Carlos Delgado has a chance to become only
the third player in history to win a Triple Crown and a league MVP
while playing for a team that didn't finish in first place. The
only two in that category were Ducky Medwick of the 1937 St. Louis
Cardinals, and Jimmie Foxx of the 1933 Philadelphia Athletics.
''Anything can happen in this game, but that's something that is
completely out of my control,'' he said. ''I can only worry about
what I can do, so I'm just going to try to get as many hits as I
can, and we'll check the numbers in October.'' ... The three home
runs the Blue Jays hit Monday gave them 39 this month, tying the
franchise record for August with two games left. This year alone,
they have set club records for homers in April (43), May (43), June
(48) and July (44).
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: A protest lodged by the Angels because of a disputed
call by umpire Derryl Cousins in an Aug. 21 loss at Boston was
denied by major league baseball on Tuesday -- following a hearing
held by Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer. ''I'm not
surprised,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ''I mean, history shows
that a lot of them aren't upheld.'' ... Mo Vaughn needs two RBIs to
reach the 100 mark for the sixth time in his career, and third year
in a row.
White Sox-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox were on the losing side of a one-hitter
in the opener of the three-game series against Oakland, a 3-0 win
by the Athletics' Tim Hudson. Chicago also was one-hit on May 21 by
Frank Castillo at Toronto -- and the White Sox went on to win 20 of
their next 27 games. ... Frank Thomas needs to score one run and
draw four walks to have 100 RBIs, 100 runs scored and 100 walks for
the ninth time in his 10 seasons. He had driven in 120 runs heading
into Tuesday's game against the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Despite their 21-23 record since the All-Star break the
Athletics had picked up 1&AMP;frac12; games since the break on AL West-leading
Seattle. ... Jason Giambi was back in the lineup as the DH after
missing two consecutive games and seven overall because of a sore
left shoulder. An MRI on Monday revealed no damage in the shoulder,
and the plan was for Giambi, who was hitting .322 with 30 homers
and 104 RBIs, to DH on Tuesday and Wednesday. If his shoulder is
still sore, he will have a cortisone shot after Wednesday's game
and be able to play by Friday. The Athletics are off Thursday.
Yankees-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: 1B Tino Martinez was out of the lineup because of a
hyperextended left foot that he sustained while sliding into home
plate in the eighth inning Monday. Martinez was available as a
pinch-hitter. ''I'll see how he feels,'' manager Joe Torre said.
''I think he'll be OK tomorrow. I hope I shut him down for the
night. I hope I don't need him to pinch-hit.'' Martinez said he was
injured when his foot hit catcher Dan Wilson's shin guard when he
was thrown out at the plate while trying to score from second base.
''It's just a little swollen and it's sore a little bit,'' Martinez
said. ''I told him (Torre) I could play without any problems
without favoring it.'' Torre had Jorge Posada at 1B in Martinez's
place and Chris Turner was at C. ... RHP Roger Clemens, who came
out of Monday's game in the eighth when his left hamstring cramped
up, is scheduled to make his next start Sunday against Minnesota.
Clemens took part in the Yankees' warmup drills and then iced his
left hamstring as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: LHP Rob Ramsay was activated from the 15-day DL, where
he had been since Aug. 14 because of a strained left biceps. He
joined Arthur Rhodes to give the Mariners two lefties in the
bullpen. The Mariners optioned RHP Joel Pineiro to Triple-A Tacoma.
... In the Mariners' 2-13 slide, they have given up nine or more
runs nine times. ... Edgar Martinez's 123 RBIs were the second most
ever by a 37-year-old. Babe Ruth had the most RBIs by a 37-year-old
with 137 in 1932. In third place is Andres Galarraga, who had 121
RBIs at 37 in 1998.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Diamondbacks-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 3B Matt Williams batted sixth for the second straight
game. Williams, who has been on the DL twice this season and missed
58 games, has batted cleanup 62 times and fifth twice. ... Manager
Buck Showalter held a 30-minute team meeting before Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Montreal is 22-21 in the first game of a series, and
15-27 in the second. ... The Expos entered Tuesday's game with a
15-10 mark against Arizona overall, including a 5-2 record this
season.
Cardinals-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Manager John Boles says he doesn't expect a lot of
roster additions when the Marlins make their September callups.
''This is not a tryout camp,'' Boles says. ''We're trying to win
games.'' ... Marlins pitcher A.J. Burnett, who hit his first
major-league homer Monday, is batting .357 this season (5-for-12).
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Through Monday, the Cardinals' 6-7-8 spots in the
order were batting .421 on the team's trip after five games. ...
Cards shortstop Edgar Renteria went 2-for-4 Monday, raising his
batting average to .358 (19-for-53) lifetime against his former
team.
Giants-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Former Pirates manager Jim Leyland visited with
Giants manager Dusty Baker before Monday's game against the
Pirates. Leyland now scouts for the St. Louis Cardinals from his
home base in Pittsburgh. ''He said around the league he's heard
that we play the game the way it's supposed to be played,'' Baker
said. ''That's a tremendous compliment.'' ... Russ Davis had been
1-for-21 as a pinch hitter before he hit a grand slam against
Florida on Aug. 21. Exactly one week later, he delivered the
game-winning homer in Monday's 5-4 victory over Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: With Aramis Ramirez likely to miss the rest of the
season because of a separated left shoulder, Enrique Wilson is
taking over at third. Wilson has mostly played the two middle
infield slots since he came to the Pirates from Cleveland in a
trade on July 29. ... Three Rivers Stadium was so dark during
Monday night's game that Giants Manager Dusty Baker asked the
umpires if all the lights were on. With the Stadium facing
demolition after the football season, there's a feeling that
weakened bulbs aren't being replaced as promptly as they may have
been in the past.
Astros-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Jeff Bagwell's two-run single in the third inning gave
him 33 RBIs in August, an Astros record for one month. He had
shared the previous mark of 31, doing it three times, with Derek
Bell. ... Tony Eusebio started the day with a 24-game hitting
streak, tied with Arizona's Tony Womack for the longest in the NL
this year. Eusebio was robbed of a hit in his first at-bat by
center fielder Jay Payton's catch on the warning track and struck
out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets purchased the contract of 2B Leandro Arias
from Class-A Pittsfield and immediately put him on the 15-day DL.
Leandro, 19, had surgery on his right shoulder on May 9. The move
gives the Mets added flexibility with their postseason roster,
which must be set by Thursday. Players on the DL, however, can
later be replaced -- meaning utilityman Joe McEwing, for example,
could be promoted from Triple-A Norfolk after the deadline and
still be eligible for the postseason. ... 3B Robin Ventura, in a
1-for-16 slump, did not start. He spent part of the afternoon
across the street from Shea Stadium watching the U.S. Open tennis
tournament.
Rockies-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Todd Helton, who leads the majors with a .397 batting
average, wasn't in the starting lineup after feeling a slight
twinge in his back. ... Wednesday's starter Julian Tavarez is 9-2
with a 3.97 ERA. In his six starts this season, Colorado is 6-0.
... C Brent Mayne is hitting .190 (8-for-42) against left-handers.
The catcher wasn't in Tuesday's starting lineup against southpaw
Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: 3B Scott Rolen wasn't in the starting lineup on
Tuesday. Rolen is hitting .355 (27-for-76) with four homers and 14
RBIs in his last 19 games. Manager Terry Francona has rested Rolen
after he has played on turf for several nights. Rolen had played
seven consecutive games on artificial turf. ... The Phillies are
23-22 in one-run games. ... RF Bobby Abreu has set career-highs in
homers (21) and doubles (45).
Reds-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ron Villone's five-hitter Monday was the first
complete game by a Reds left-hander since Mike Remlinger tossed an
8-0 shutout at Arizona on July 11, 1998. Remlinger, of course, is
now a reliever for the Braves. ... The Reds had not been held
scoreless through their first 131 games, a franchise record to
begin the season and the longest stretch by any team since the
Phillies scored at least a run in their first 158 games in 1993.
The 1932 Yankees are the only team to go an entire season without
being on the wrong end of a shutout. ... Cincinnati is the only
team with a winning record on the road and a losing record at home.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Things aren't getting any better for OF Reggie Sanders,
who started in right field while Brian Jordan rested his sore
shoulder. Having already endured an 0-for-34 skid in April, Sanders
was mired in a 2-of-19 slump after hitting into an inning-ending
double play in the second with runners at first and third. ... RHP
Greg Maddux has lost five of seven decisions since July 22, which
is more defeats than he had for the entire season in both 1995
(19-2) and 1997 (19-4). Maddux (14-8) is trying to avoid his first
year with double-figure losses since 1996 (15-11).
Padres-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres placed 2B Bret Boone on the 15-day DL with
a bruised right knee and recalled infielder Kevin Nicholson. ...
The Padres and the Double-A Mobile will be together for at least
four more years. The team announced Tuesday it had extended its
working agreement though the 2004 season. ... The Padres also
extended their working agreement with the Fort Wayne Wizards, their
Single-A club in the Midwest League, through the 2002 season. ...
At 64-67 heading into Tuesday's game, the Padres were within three
games of .500 for the first time since May 5. ... At 17-9 so far in
August, guaranteeing San Diego its first winning month since June
1999.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: After getting poked, prodded and tested for more than
five hours, Mark Grace was back in the Cubs' lineup Tuesday. Grace
left Monday's game with dizzy spells, and spent Tuesday morning
being examined by doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
''Anytime a doctor puts you in (an MRI machine), usually they think
something's wrong. That's when you get worried,'' Grace said.
''Plus, it's your head.'' Despite extensive tests, doctors couldn't
find anything wrong with him. One doctor told him he might have
been dehydrated because he drank a lot of coffee before the game
and didn't eat. ''They told me try to get more sleep, try to eat
better and just go play,'' he said. ''I've never felt that way
before and I never want to again.'' ... While the Cubs are mired in
losses again, their minor league teams are enjoying good summers.
Double-A West Tenn clinched the Southern League's West Division
second-half title Monday, and Single-A Eugene is tied for first in
the Northwest League's South Division. Single-A Dayton lowered its
magic number to one Monday in the Florida State League's East
Division second-half race. All that bodes well for the future,
manager Don Baylor said. ''Winning never gets old, even at that
level,'' Baylor said. ''If guys win in the minor leagues, that's
what they expect. ... They're going to want to continue it for a
while.'' ... SS Luis Montanez, the Cubs first-round draft pick in
June, was named the Arizona League's MVP at Mesa.
Dodgers-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: OF Gary Sheffield missed his ninth consecutive game
with the flu and a five-game suspension. ... The Dodgers have
shuffled their pitching rotation. Darren Dreifort will start
Wednesday and Carlos Perez will go Thursday. ... Los Angeles has
three outfielders injured. Besides Sheffield's flu, Devon White has
missed four straight games with a strained quadriceps muscle and
Bruce Aven was scratched before Monday's game with a strained left
oblique muscle. ''We just need to get some healthy bodies,''
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: 3B Jose Hernandez began a rehabilitation assignment
in Indianapolis on Tuesday. Hernandez, out since Aug. 10 with a
strained lower back, is expected to be the DH, but will probably
return to the team well before the end of the 20-day stint. ... The
Brewers are scoring 4.52 runs per game in the 25 games since Richie
Sexson came over from Cleveland, raising their season average to
4.40. SS Mark Loretta also returned from a lengthy stint on the DL
during that time. Milwaukee is still last in the majors in hitting
at .244. ... Through 131 games, Milwaukee opponents had stolen less
than half as many bases in 2000 (68) as in 1999 (131). Credit C
Henry Blanco, who had thrown out 34 of 60 potential base-stealers.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Frederick C. Bock, who piloted one of three
aircraft on the mission that dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki,
died Friday of cancer. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Bock normally flew the B-29. But during the mission that dropped
the bomb on Aug. 9, 1945, he flew another Superfortress that was
used to measure and photograph the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He flew 36 combat missions before being selected for the highly

Jack Nitzsche:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jack Nitzsche, an Oscar-winning songwriter,
record producer, arranger and studio musician who played keyboard
on some of the Rolling Stones' hits and collaborated with many
other major pop figures of the '60s, died Friday of a heart attack.
He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Nitzsche won the best original song Academy Award for 1982 for
co-writing ''Up Where We Belong'' for the movie ''An Officer and a

   His score for 1975's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' brought

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mary T. Reynolds, an authority on James Joyce
who wrote scholarly books about the Irish writer, died Friday of
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she was known for supporting a landmark
Chinese translation of Joyce's work.
</P>
<P>
   She began her career as a political scientist in the 1940s and
taught at a number of schools, including Hunter, Brooklyn and
Queens colleges in New York City and Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   She published her first book on Joyce in 1964 while working as a
research associate at Yale University and in the 1970s became a
visiting professor in English at Yale, where she remained until
1989 when she moved to Washington.
Peter Swerling:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Peter Swerling, a mathematician who became an
expert in radar and stealth technology, died Friday of cancer. He
was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Swerling was an analyst for 13 years at the Rand Corporation
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   He developed a class of ''fluctuating target'' scattering models
in the 1950s to measure the performance of pulsed radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Swerling wrote the ''Statistical Theory of Target
Detection by Pulsed Radar'' and its principles became a key tool in
the design of practical radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed target models used for stealth technology,
which helped develop weapons used in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematician may have been inspired by a meeting arranged
by his father, Hollywood screenwriter Jo Swerling. For his 10th
birthday, young Peter Swerling said he wanted to meet Albert
Einstein. His father arranged the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein advised the boy to pursue mathematics and encouraged
him to remember important things, such as baseball.

<HEADLINE> Brawl in Devil Rays-Red Sox Game  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Eight members of the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, including five players, were ejected in the first seven
innings of Tuesday night's game against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   There were five confrontations that led to the ejections.
Manager Larry Rothschild and leadoff batter Gerald Williams were
ejected after Pedro Martinez's fourth pitch of the game. Martinez
hit Williams with a 1-2 pitch, and the outfielder charged the
mound, setting off a bench-clearing brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild was ejected by second base umpire Tim McClelland for
arguing that Martinez should have been thrown out. The game was
delayed 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Eiland, Tampa Bay's starting pitcher, and coach Bill
Russell, who became acting manager following Rothschild's ejection,
were tossed in the third after Eiland hit Brian Daubach and Nomar
Garciaparra with pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach hit the dirt avoiding a high and inside pitch, then was
hit on the next pitch. After Carl Everett hit a two-run double,
Garciaparra was hit in the back and Eiland was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Lidle was ejected in the seventh after throwing a pitch
behind Daubach and coach Jose Cardenal was tossed because he was
acting manager. Tony Fiore relieved, throw an inside pitch to
Daubach, then hit him with his second pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Both benches emptied, but there were no punches thrown. Williams
came out of Tampa Bay's clubhouse and ran back on the field, in
front of the Devil Rays' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn was ejected by plate umpire Phil Cuzzi in the bottom
of the seventh inning for arguing balls and strikes after Martinez,
who was working on a no-hit bid, threw a called third strike by
him.
</P>
<P>
   In the first brawl, Williams took a several steps toward first
base, alternating his stare between his hand and Martinez. He then
charged the mound and throwing a right at Martinez. Williams was
then tackled from behind by catcher Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was restrained by several different people, including
Vaughn and Red Sox coach Jim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable pushing and shoving after both benches
and bullpens emptied. Daubach, who emerged from the pile holding
his left arm, as pushed from behind by Devil Rays closer Roberto
Hernandez.

<HEADLINE> Pope Offers Moral Medical Guides  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Pope John Paul II sought Tuesday to lay down moral
guidelines for medical research in the 21st century, endorsing
organ donation and adult stem cell study but condemning human
cloning and embryo experiments.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's address to an international conference of 5,000
transplant specialists appeared to be an attempt to set moral
limits on such life-and-death issues as organ transplants and
related research.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul won applause from the transplant experts when he
encouraged organ donation, calling it an ''act of love.''
</P>
<P>
   But if his stance against embryo research were followed, ''all
these people with serious diseases would have no hope,'' said one
supporter of the research, Dr. Robert Goldstein of the New
York-based Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring how important he considered the issue, the
80-year-old pontiff left his summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo
outside Rome to address the International Congress of the
Transplantation Society.
</P>
<P>
   But the address went beyond being a booster speech for organ
donations.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul spelled out the church's position on
transplant-related matters, condemning the sale of organs,
insisting on informed consent on both sides of the exchange and
singling out the complete end of brain activity as an acceptable
way to determine that death has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Calling organ donation ''a genuine act of love,'' he said,
''Accordingly, any procedure which tends to commercialize human
organs or to consider them as items of exchange or trade must be
considered morally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision on who should be first in line to receive organs
can be based only on medical factors, John Paul said -- not on age,
sex, race, religion, social standing, usefulness to society or any
other standard.
</P>
<P>
   He left the door open for cross-species transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's support for organ donation was likely to have an
impact on his 1 billion-strong flock of Roman Catholics.
Traditionally, many Catholics have been adverse to both organ
transplants and cremation for reasons having to do with keeping the
body intact for resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul also spoke out against cloning and related embryo
research, a rapidly developing field in the four years since Dolly
the lamb first struggled to its cloned hooves.
</P>
<P>
   The pope renewed his opposition to both techniques just weeks
after Britain moved toward allowing limited human cloning for
research and the United States approved federal funding for
research on human embryo stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The British and U.S. actions both grew out of scientific
excitement about the promise of research on embryonic stem cells --
parent cells that go on to form most types of cells and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope the cells can some day be used to grow cells,
tissues or whole organs -- offering hope for scores of diseases from
diabetes to Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say one of the most promising areas for the research is
in Parkinson's -- a neurological ailment of which the pope himself
shows symptoms. The Vatican no longer denies he has it, although it
has never confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   In the church's view, cloning is irreconcilable with its
position that sex between married couples is the only acceptable
way to create human life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Methods that fail to respect the dignity and value of the
person must always be avoided,'' John Paul told the medical
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am thinking in particular of attempts at human cloning with
a view to obtaining organs for transplants: These techniques,
insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human
embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal
is good in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul ruled out use of embryonic cells as well, pointing
scientists in the direction of adult stem cells as the acceptable
route for research.
</P>
<P>
   Adult stem cells already have been the object of research for up
to 25 years now, with minimal results, said Goldstein, speaking by
telephone from New York.
</P>
<P>
   In all this time, ''there's no indication, none whatsoever, that
adult stem cells have the same effect as embryonic,'' Goldstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those people, where they have no other hope, this offers
remarkable hope and promise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The British and U.S. moves have prompted the Italian government
to consider a public referendum on whether Italy should follow
their lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''All points of view merit appreciation and a calm and open
discussion, without preconceptions or dogma,'' Italian Health
Minister Umberto Veronesi said after the pontiff's speech.
</P>
<P>
   One Italian scientist, Dr. Severino Antinori of Rome, says he
needs only approval from a national bioethics committee -- which
includes religious representatives, including a Roman Catholic
cardinal -- to start working on a fertility treatment for humans.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, ''the religious groups are blocking it,'' Antinori
said. ''That is very dangerous in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 8, Expos 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Greg Colbrunn homered and had three RBIs as the
Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Montreal Expos 8-7 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn hit a two-run homer in the fifth and an RBI single with
one out in the seventh to break a 6-6 tie.
</P>
<P>
   After Montreal tied the game on Michael Barrett's RBI double in
the sixth, Expos reliever Scott Forster (0-1) walked Tony Womack
and Danny Bautista to lead off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Both runners advanced on Luis Gonzalez's grounder and Colbrunn
followed with a run-scoring single to make it 7-6. Arizona went
ahead 8-6 on Scott Finley's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal closed to 8-7 in the bottom half on Vladimir Guerrero's
RBI single off reliever Byung-Hyun Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Plesac (4-0) relieved Geraldo Guzman following Barrett's
game-tying double with one out in the sixth to get the win. Matt
Mantei pitched a perfect ninth for his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   After Plesac struck out pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero for the
second out, third baseman Matt Williams made a great diving stop to
his left to field pinch-hitter Fernando Seguignol's smash down the
third-base line and threw to first to end the Expos' threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored four runs in the first off Javier
Vazquez on Bautista's RBI single, a wild pitch, and Craig
Counsell's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens and Geoff Blum hit RBI singles off Geraldo Guzman in
the bottom half as the Expos cut the lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn's homer made it 6-2 in the fifth before Jose Vidro
brought Montreal back to within one with a three-run homer -- his
22nd -- in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, who went 5 1-3 innings, allowed nine hits and six runs
in his eighth start for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, who hasn't won since July 23, allowed six hits and six
runs in five innings. He struck out five and walked one.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Williams batted sixth for the second straight game for the
Diamondbacks. Williams, who has been on the DL twice this season
and missed 58 games, has batted cleanup 62 times and fifth twice.
... Arizona manager Buck Showalter held a 30-minute team meeting
before the game.

   PARIS (AP) -- Fishermen angered by the rising price of fuel
blocked ports and roads around France on Tuesday, delaying tourists
trying to take the English Channel ferry for hours.
</P>
<P>
   They promised a protest rally in Paris on Thursday, and tried to
draw truck drivers into their movement.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen blocked at least six Atlantic coastal ports in
Normandy and closed a port in Vendee, further south. Tourists
trying to catch ferries across the English Channel at Cherbourg
were blocked for hours in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen in the southern Languedoc-Roussillon region paralyzed
oil refinery depots near Sete and Narbonne, while in Provence
fishermen blocked access to oil terminals at two ports. In
Marseille, they blocked a car-ferry port.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen have been on the offensive for a week, trying to press
the government for further concessions on the price of fuel and
other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have also protested against rising fuel prices over the
past week.

<HEADLINE> Source: CNN National Head To Leave  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN is expected to announce on Wednesday that
Rick Kaplan, the head of its national operations since 1997, is
departing as the network struggles to turn around sagging ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN staff meeting has been called in Atlanta on Wednesday to
discuss the changes, said a network executive, speaking on
condition of anonymity. The executive confirmed Kaplan's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan did not return a phone call placed to his office late
Tuesday. Network spokesmen would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who won 34 Emmy Awards as a longtime producer at ABC,
joined CNN as president of its USA operations in August 1997, given
the mission to bolster the network's viewership during times it
didn't have breaking news to depend upon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, CNN has frequently found itself eclipsed by CNBC as the
appetite for financial news increased and beset by increased
competition from Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The network proclaimed itself ''America's Campaign
Headquarters'' and placed a strong emphasis on political coverage
this year. But its ratings for the GOP convention, for example,
were 27 percent below convention coverage four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan survived a major scandal less than a year into his
tenure, when the network had to retract a story that claimed the
U.S. military used nerve gas on defectors during the Vietnam War.
Two producers were fired as a result of the May 1998 report and
correspondent Peter Arnett left CNN within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan also feuded with longtime CNN financial anchor Lou Dobbs,
who left CNN for an Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   The network, founded by Ted Turner, celebrated its 20th
anniversary this spring.

<HEADLINE> Feds Seize Lobster Traps Off Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- For the third time in recent
weeks, federal agents on Tuesday removed hundreds of lobster traps
set by an Indian group in an ongoing dispute over fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
   Two Indian boats trying to deter the 20 federal fisheries
vessels involved in the raid in Miramichi Bay off eastern New
Brunswick were capsized, and two Indians were arrested. One
fisheries officer had minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like something out of a James Bond movie,'' said Chief
Allison Metallic of the Listiguj First Nation, who has been trying
to set up peace talks at the Burnt Church reservation between
Micmac Indians and the government.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Fisheries and Oceans spokesman said the
government had to uphold the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Law enforcement is never pretty,'' Andre Marc Lanteigne said.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster dispute in Burnt Church concerns the government's
right to regulate Indian fishing versus the Indians right to hunt
and fish by their own rules for a moderate livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal said in a statement released
after Tuesday's raid that Burnt Church residents were harming
efforts to negotiate a settlement by continuing to fish.
</P>
<P>
   Burnt Church was one of five reservations on Canada's Atlantic
coast that rejected an agreement with the government that set
fishing limits in exchange for financial aid. Twenty-nine other
reservations accepted agreements.

<HEADLINE> Browns Release Terry Kirby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns released veteran running
back Terry Kirby on Tuesday and signed rookie running back Jamel
White on waivers from the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, 30 and about to start his eighth NFL season, played in
all 16 games for the expansion Browns last year. He ran for 452
yards on 130 carries, a 3.5-yard average, and he caught 58 passes
for 528 yards, a 9.8-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Until the roster move, it appeared Kirby had survived final
cuts. Kirby, 6-foot-1 and 215 pounds, came into training camp as
the backup to Errict Rhett, but lost that spot to rookie Travis
Prentice.
</P>
<P>
   White, 5-9 and 206 pounds, nearly made the Colts as an undrafted
rookie. He had a 96-yard kickoff return Aug. 24 for the Colts
against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terry Kirby has been a valuable member of this team for the
past year,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said. ''The acquisition of
Jamel White gave us four running backs, and I felt it would be
difficult to divide the running back role into four parts. For that
reason, we felt we would let Terry pursue other opportunities at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Clark, Browns director of football operations, praised
Kirby for his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of young players, and the only way to know if
they can play is to play them,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns also signed five players to their practice squad.
They are tight end Lyle Allamon, wide receiver Bobby Brown,
defensive lineman Jeff Dyra, running back Rahshon Spikes and
linebacker Ryan Taylor. Brown, a three-year starter for Notre Dame,
was an undrafted rookie free agent who was with the Green Bay
Packers during the preseason.

   ATLANTA (AP) -- The lights at Turner Field flickered and then
went out as the Atlanta Braves came to bat in the bottom of the
ninth inning against the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves trailing 4-2, Andres Galarraga stepped in to bat

<HEADLINE> Police Raid Japan Milk Manufacturer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Police on Wednesday raided the Tokyo headquarters
of Japan's largest dairy products maker, which is under
investigation for selling bacteria-tainted milk that caused a
massive food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also searched Snow Brand Milk Products Co.'s
regional main office in Osaka on suspicion of professional
negligence. No arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   Both raids were being conducted by Osaka investigators, a police
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Most of the 14,800 people
sickened in the June food poising live in Osaka, about 254 miles
west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Snow Brand case and a chain of other recent contaminations
of food with bugs, broken pieces of plastic and other objects have
triggered a national food scare and loss of public trust in Japan's
food industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Snow Brand sickenings were initially blamed on staph
bacteria in a production-line valve for lowfat milk at the Osaka
plant, which was closed down indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Later, local government and company officials said it may have
been caused by staph bacteria toxins in powdered milk produced at
another Snow Brand factory on the northern island of Hokkaido but
used at the Osaka plant to make milk products.
</P>
<P>
   The powdered milk was not sold separately on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect Snow Brand failed to take necessary sanitary
measures at its plants resulting in the food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Brand's president has resigned. No company officials have
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections conducted by Health and Welfare Ministry officials
found that that Snow Brand had also recycled milk returned from
stores, including some with expired expiration dates for freshness.
</P>
<P>
   The food poisoning caused Snow Brand to recall products and many
supermarkets stopped carrying anything made by the company.

<P>
   Sweeney's hit extended his hitting streak to 15 games and tied
him with George Brett for the fourth most RBIs in a season for
Kansas City with 118.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played in front of 11,931 fans, a season-low for
the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Stein (5-3) cruised through the first six innings, giving up
only three hits and never facing more than four batters in an
inning. But he gave up solo home runs to Matt Lawton and Corey
Koskie in the seventh before being relieved by Kris Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins took the lead in the second inning when Koskie singled
with two outs, stole second and scored on Torii Hunter's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took the lead with four runs in the third. Hector
Ortiz led off with a walk and Wilson Delgado followed with a
single. Rey Sanchez was hit by a pitch, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney then doubled to right field. Ortiz and Delgado scored on
the hit and Sanchez came across when Lawton's throw from right
field got away from second baseman Jay Canizaro for an error.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals extended the lead in the fifth. Sanchez led off with
a single and Sweeney followed with a walk. The Twins brought in
reliever Jack Cressend, who gave up a two-run double to Dye, giving
him 101 RBIs. After Quinn struck out, Joe Randa singled in Dye to
give the Royals a 7-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Royals 2B Jeff Reboulet was scratched with a bad back. He
was replaced by Wilson Delgado. ... Royals CF Carlos Beltran, who
has been on the DL since July 5 with a bruised bone above his right
knee, was in Kansas City on Tuesday for an MRI. He was scheduled to
report to Triple-A Omaha Wednesday. ... Kyle Snyder, the Royals'
No. 1 pick in the 1999 draft, has been sidelined for the season
with torn ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. He is
scheduled for ''Tommy John surgery'' Sept. 7 and is expected to be
out for approximately a year. ... The Twins have hit 101 home runs
in 132 games. They did not hit their 100th home run in 1999 until
the 152nd game. The Royals have allowed 202 home runs, most in the
majors, and tying the club record set last season. ... Randa's RBI
in the fifth gave him 85 for the season, one more than his previous
career high set last year.

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Bush on Health Care Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Al Gore touted his $100 billion plan to
help provide health care to every American child and said Tuesday
it's time for rival George W. Bush to ''put up or shut up'' on
health care policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush retorted that Gore was resorting to the kind of partisan
sniping that's paralyzed Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like his comments underline the point I made,'' said
Bush, who was campaigning in Maine and New Hampshire. ''If we want
to get something done in Washington we have to change the tone of
the discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance exchange came as Democrat Gore was in the
midst of a weeklong focus on health care, telling voters he's
offering them details of what he'd do if elected -- unlike Bush, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time for generalities without specifics I think is just
about over,'' said Gore. ''It's kind of put up or shut up time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters on his campaign airplane, Bush was
scornful.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not very presidential to me,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee backed up Gore with a new ad
on prescription drugs for Medicare. ''Bush has no specific plan,''
says the ad, the fourth in a week on the issue, which is especially
popular with seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in a photo-friendly park, listened to local
residents talk of the difficulty they've had getting coverage for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of one 2-year-old who suffered a broken leg told
Gore they eventually were able to get insurance coverage through a
federal program, but it took a bureaucratic fight, and better
outreach would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not play games with this. Let's put the facts on the
table,'' Gore said, then underscored his point with details of his
plan.
</P>
<P>
   His $100 billion, 10-year children's health proposal is an
expansion of an existing program offering coverage to children of
the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would cover children in families making up to 250 percent
of the federal poverty level. He said that would offer coverage to
the 11 million uninsured children by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to cover every child in the next presidential term,''
said Gore. ''Every child ought to have good, high quality health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Joseph Lieberman also discussed Gore's child health
care plan with parents, children and staff at Children's Hospital
in San Diego. Tipper Gore did the same in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Monday touted his plan to add a prescription drug
coverage in Medicare, and Bush said he would offer details on his
plan next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore deputy campaign manager Mark Fabiani said, ''Now the
question is what will he do for the children? What does Governor
Bush intend to do about the 11 million uninsured children in the
country, 1.4 million of whom live in Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   In response, a Bush spokesman, Dan Bartlett, contended, ''Under
Al Gore's watch, there are 2.4 million more uninsured children in
America because the Clinton-Gore administration's effort to
nationalize health care was soundly rejected by the American people
in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides rejected any suggestion Gore wasn't being
presidential, and pointed fingers at Bush for his $1.3 trillion
tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is not presidential is putting out a tax cut that
benefits the very few,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''George W.
Bush is trying to defend the indefensible. He is between a rock and
a hard place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has risen in the polls in recent weeks, making for a
dead-heat race with Bush in most surveys, and he argues that gain
has come because he's given voters specifics on issues that matter.
As they begin to increasingly pay attention, his approach will win
out, Gore argued.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said the child health care issue is an important one
in the Hispanic community, where rates of uninsured children are
higher. Hispanic voters are important voting groups in key states
such as California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also was courting native American voters, meeting with 25
tribal leaders from the All-Indian Pueblo Council, representing
tribes in new Mexico and Colorado, which endorsed Gore on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Native American voters represent about 12 percent of the
electorate in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gore then flew to Oregon to continue his focus on health care
and reunite with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally with seniors, Gore touted his $400 billion Medicare
bailout plan. ''We're trying to change Medicare to improve and
update it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reds 4, Braves 2  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr.'s two-run single in the seventh
inning put Cincinnati ahead and the Reds went on to a 4-2 victory
Tuesday night over the Atlanta Braves, who squandered a chance to
break a first-place tie in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets were routed by Houston 11-1, but the Braves
couldn't hold a 2-0 lead over the Reds. Atlanta has lost two
straight to Cincinnati and five of its last six -- all at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium lights went out as Braves came to bat in the bottom
of the ninth, resulting in a 12-minute delay. Team officials blamed
a ''power spike.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby limited the Reds to six hits and a run through six
innings, then had to leave the game because of a blister on the
middle finger of his pitching hand. Cincinnati immediately took
advantage against an Atlanta bullpen that has been shaky on the
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   After getting the first out, Mike Remlinger (5-3) gave up
consecutive singles by pinch-hitter Alex Ochoa, Pokey Reese and
Chris Stynes to load the bases. Griffey worked ahead in the count
before lining a hit to right that brought home two runs, putting
the Reds ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette drove in an insurance run with a blooper that
fell in right and wound up being a fielder's choice when Griffey
was forced at second.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (9-14) won his fourth straight start, allowing
eight hits and both Atlanta runs in six innings. He has lowered his
ERA from 5.41 at the beginning of the month to 4.57.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' relievers have been heading in the opposite
direction. Over the past six games, they have surrendered 19 hits
and 15 earned runs in 15 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta also has been a rather ordinary team on its home field.
After winning 17 of its first 21 game at Turner Field, the Braves
have gone 24-19 since then.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves worked a scoreless ninth for his 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez had an RBI single in the fourth to put the Braves
ahead, and Reggie Sanders hit his first homer in 39 days leading
off the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati halved its deficit in the sixth on Dmitri Young's
two-out homer over the center-field wall. Otherwise, Ashby was
dominating.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander struck out Dante Bichette swinging three
straight times, and seemed likely to break a personal three-game
losing streak until his finger began hurting.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Parris' wild pitch in the third inning was the 84th of the
year for the Reds, breaking the club record of 83 set in 1965. At
this pace, Cincinnati will wind up with 104 for the season, which
would easily eclipse the major-league record of 94 set by Texas in
1986. The NL record is 91, established by the 1970 Houston Astros
and tied by the 1989 Philadelphia Phillies. ... Ashby recorded the
1,000th strikeout of his career when Reese fanned in the fifth
inning. ... Andres Galarraga had three of Atlanta's nine hits. ...
A fan was escorted out of Turner Field in a bit of heavy-handed
security after slipping onto the field in the seventh inning while
trying to catch a foul ball down the first-base line. The fan
didn't interfere with Galarraga's attempt to make the catch, but
was removed from his seat anyway.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Family Welcomes U.S. Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A Cuban family who has been waiting four years to
emigrate to the United States said Tuesday they welcomed
Washington's diplomatic protest against Cuba's alleged failure to
allow all those with valid U.S. visas to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohen family said they were encouraged by the State
Department's Monday letter of protest, which accused Cuba of
putting up obstacles to legal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very encouraged by the U.S. position, it gives us some
hope,'' said Daisy Cohen, 57, who has been trying along with five
other members of her extended family since 1996 to rejoin her son,
Jose Cohen, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens were granted U.S. visas in 1996 -- two years after
Jose, a former government intelligence officer, left the country in
a raft -- but they say the Cuban government has since refused to
allow them to travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledge that Cuba allows the vast majority of
those granted U.S. visas to leave the country, but focused Monday's
protest on 117 cases in which Cuba had not granted permission.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those cases involve medical personnel, who by Cuban law
are not permitted to emigrate until four years after filing an
application; the Cuban government argues it has invested too much
in their education to let them leave under normal rules.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases, like that of the Cohens, involve the families of
people the Cuban government considers dissidents linked to the
exile community in Miami. While Jose has spoken publicly about his
family's case in Miami, his wife, Lazara Brito, denies the family
has strong political convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of tension between the two countries mounted with
Tuesday's announcement that the United States had denied a visa to
the president of Cuba's National Assembly, preventing him from
attending an international conference of parliamentarians in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The United States denied the visa to Ricardo Alarcon, a top
Cuban official, on the grounds his visit would be contrary to U.S.
national interests. It was not immediately clear whether that
decision was linked to Monday's diplomatic protest.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Devil Rays 0  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Pedro Martinez came within three
outs of his first career no-hitter, leading the Boston Red Sox to a
brawl-filled 8-0 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting leadoff man Gerald Williams in the first inning
with his fourth pitch of the night, Martinez (15-4) retired 24 in a
row before John Flaherty singled to the right-center on a 2-2 pitch
leading off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez then retired his next three batters, finishing with the
third one-hitter of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really care. I've achieved enough,'' Martinez said,
when asked if he was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had enough achievement in my career. A no-hitter is not
what's going to dictate what kind of pitcher I am. I think my
career is more interesting than one game.''
</P>
<P>
   He struck out 13, including Greg Vaughn and Fred McGriff three
times each, and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Devil Rays -- five players, manager Larry Rothschild and
two coaches -- were ejected in the first seven innings during five
altercations, primarily caused by four hit batters.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the AL Cy Young Award winner, lowered his major
league-leading ERA to 1.68, throwing 110 pitches, including 71
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, 1995, when he was with Montreal, Martinez became only
the second pitcher in the history of the major leagues to take a
perfect game into extra innings, before allowing a leadoff double
to San Diego's Bip Roberts leading off the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The only other pitcher to accomplish the feat was Harvey Haddix
of Pittsburgh in 1959. He pitched 12 perfect innings in that game
before losing in the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Under amended no-hitter rules adopted by an eight-man committee
on statistical accuracy in 1991, Martinez received credit for
neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett went 4-for-5 and equaled a career high with six
RBIs. He had a two-run double in the third, a solo homer in the
fifth and a three-run seventh-inning homer. The first homer was
Everett's 100th, including 32 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Rothschild were ejected in the first. Williams, hit
near the left hand, took a several steps toward first base,
alternating his stare between his hand and Martinez. He then
charged the mound and throwing a right. Williams was then tackled
from behind by catcher Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was restrained by several different people, including
Vaughn and Red Sox coach Jim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable pushing and shoving after both benches
and bullpens emptied. Daubach, who emerged from the pile holding
his left arm, was pushed from behind by Devil Rays closer Roberto
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild was ejected by second base umpire Tim McClelland for
arguing that Martinez should have been thrown out. The game was
delayed 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Eiland (2-2), Tampa Bay's starting pitcher, and coach Bill
Russell, who became acting manager following Rothschild's ejection,
were tossed in the third after Eiland hit Daubach and Nomar
Garciaparra with pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach hit the dirt avoiding a high and inside pitch, then was
hit on the next pitch. After Everett doubled, Garciaparra was hit
in the back and Eiland was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Lidle was ejected in the seventh after throwing a pitch
behind Daubach and coach Jose Cardenal was tossed because he was
acting manager. Tony Fiore relieved, threw an inside pitch to
Daubach, then hit him with his second pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Both benches emptied, but there were no punches thrown. Williams
came out of Tampa Bay's clubhouse and ran back on the field, in
front of the Devil Rays' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was ejected by plate umpire Phil Cuzzi in the bottom of
the seventh inning for arguing balls and strikes after Martinez,
who was working on a no-hit bid, threw a called third strike by
him.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland allowed two runs and five hits in two-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez has 67 double-digit strikeout games, including 13
this year. He has hit 14 batters, tops in the AL. His other
one-hitters were for Montreal against Cincinnati on July 13, 1997,
and against the New York Yankees on Sept. 10, 1999. ... Eiland had
hit just two batters over his previous 48 innings. ... It was the
third meeting between Eiland and Martinez since July 7, 1999. The
Devil Rays right-hander won the first meeting and the duo did not
figure in the decision in an Aug. 14 game. ... Boston 3B Lou
Merloni left with a mild concussion after the second inning.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 7, Brewers 2  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Chan Ho Park allowed one hit in eight innings
and Mark Grudzielanek drove in four runs as the Los Angeles Dodgers
beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-2 Tuesday night for their eighth
victory in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Park (14-8) allowed only James Mouton's two-out, two-run homer
in the sixth and struck out a career-high 14.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who has 44 strikeouts and a 1.66 ERA while going 3-0 in
his last five starts, didn't allow a runner until first baseman
Eric Karros made an error on Mark Loretta's grounder in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After walking pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney in the sixth, Park threw
a high 3-2 fastball that Mouton hit over the fence in the
left-field corner. Park walked three and hit Richie Sexson.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, winning while outfielder Gary Sheffield is
sidelined by a suspension and a bout of the flu, are five games
behind NL West-leading San Francisco, 2&AMP;frac12; behind second-place
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who scored five runs in the first inning of their
5-3 victory on Monday night, scored four in the second against
Jimmy Haynes (11-12).
</P>
<P>
   Backup catcher Chad Kreuter had an RBI single and Grudzielanek
had a two-run single in the rally. Los Angeles added two more in
the fourth when Haynes walked Park and Grudzielanek hit a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, a Milwaukee native, also tripled in the ninth and
scored when Henry Blanco dropped a good relay throw from Ron
Belliard at the plate. It was scored a triple and an error.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes allowed four earned runs, five hits and three walks. The
Brewers, who fell to a season-worst 19 games below .500, lost for
the third time in four games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Haynes threw 43 pitches in the second inning. ... Manager
Davey Johnson said Sheffield has lost weight during the illness and
has little energy. ... Geoff Jenkins, who was 7-for-11 with three
homers against Park before the game, struck out twice and grounded
into a double play. ... Brewers 3B Jose Hernandez had two hits in
his first rehabilitation start at Triple-A Indianapolis. Hernandez
has been out since Aug. 10 with back spasms.

<HEADLINE> Drawings of 19th-Century Civil Engineer to be displayed at NYC museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) - Selections from the Personal Papers of John B.
Jervis housed at the Jervis Library here will be on display at New
York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Entitled ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861,'' the
exhibit will run from Sept. 11 through Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Jervis is considered the foremost American civil engineer of the
antebellum era, designing and supervising the construction of the
Croton Aqueduct, New York City's first major water-supply system.
</P>
<P>
   Jervis drew the specifications for the Stourbridge Lion and
America, the first locomotives to run in America. A portion of the
America is preserved at the Smithsonian Institute. He also invented
the bogey truck, which enabled locomotives to negotiate the tighter
curves characteristic of American railways.
</P>
<P>
   He was the supervising engineer for numerous railroad and canal
projects, including the Chenango, Erie enlargement, and Delaware &AMP;
Hudson canal projects; and the Hudson River, and Mohawk &AMP; Hudson
railroads.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Closer to Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A tropical storm brushed against Taiwan on
Tuesday, dumping heavy rain on the northern part of the island
barely a week after a typhoon killed 14 people and collapsed
hundreds of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, named Prapiroon, caused little damage because its
winds were relatively weak, but officials were on alert for
mudslides and flash floods that frequently follow heavy rainfall on
this mountainous island.
</P>
<P>
   In Miaoli county, downpours triggered a landslide that blocked
traffic on a mountain road, state radio said. Forecasters predicted
that mountainous areas around the capital, Taipei, could record up
to 20 inches of rain by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that were closed on Tuesday in the cities of Ilan and
Keelung would be open on Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm becomes a typhoon when its surface wind reaches
74 mph. Prapiroon was packing winds of 62 mph, the Central Weather
Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Prapiroon, which means ''God of Rain'' in Thai, spared areas in
southern Taiwan that were hard hit by Typhoon Bilis last week.
Bilis killed 14 people and destroyed 430 houses. The storm also
caused an estimated $129 million in agricultural damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis also hit China, killing at least 19 people before blowing
itself out last week, the official China Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Worst hit was the southeastern province of Fujian, where the
typhoon first made landfall, killing 13 people, causing landslides
and inundating hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland, the
China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   In Zhejiang province, just north of Fujian, Bilis' torrential
rains loosened hillsides and caused flooding that blocked six
highways and destroyed more than 3,400 houses, the newspaper said.
It reported that landslides killed six people in Zhejiang.

<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Dean Palmer homered and drove in four runs to
back an effective pitching performance by Jeff Weaver as the
Detroit Tigers beat the Baltimore Orioles 12-2 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson and Dusty Allen also homered, and Juan
Encarnacion had four hits for the Tigers. It was Allen's first
major league homer.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit had 16 hits in reaching .500 (65-65) for the third time
this month after starting the season 9-23.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer went 3-for-4 with a walk. His 26th homer, a three-run
shot, capped a four-run third inning that put Detroit up 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver (9-11) gave up two runs and six hits in 6 1-3 innings.
The right-hander, who struck out six and walked two, is 3-1 in his
last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Richard hit a solo homer for the Orioles, who had won six
of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie John Parrish (2-3) endured his second straight poor start
for Baltimore, allowing six runs, six hits and three walks in 2 1-3
innings. The left-hander has yielded 11 runs over his last four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields hit an RBI single for the Orioles in the first
inning, but Detroit went up 2-1 in the second on run-scoring
groundouts by Deivi Cruz and Shane Halter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers pulled away in the third. Juan Gonzalez singled in a
run before Palmer hit an 0-2 pitch into the left-field seats. One
out later, Cruz chased Parrish with a double.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage continued in the fourth, when Palmer hit an RBI
single off Jason Johnson to make it 7-1. Encarnacion singled in two
runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Richards homered in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson hit his 25th homer, a two-run drive, in the eighth.
Allen homered off Chuck McElroy in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit is 17-9 in August. ... Orioles CF Luis Matos left
after bruising his left shoulder in a play at first base in the
second inning. ... Detroit is 16-8 when Palmer homers. ...
Baltimore called up C Fernando Lunar from Double-A Bowie to replace
Mike Kinkade, who left to join the U.S. Olympic squad. ... Palmer
is hitting .228 lifetime against Baltimore, but has 25 homers,
including four this season.

<HEADLINE> Astros 11, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wade Miller, Jeff Bagwell and the Houston Astros
made it a miserable night for Al Leiter and the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Miller pitched a five-hitter for his first complete game in the
majors, Bagwell hit his 40th homer and drove in three runs and the
Astros romped past the Mets 11-1 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio's 24-game hitting streak came to an end, but most
everything else went right for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is we won and everybody's happy,''
Eusebio said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who remained tied for first with Atlanta in the NL
East, got off to a great start when left fielder Darryl Hamilton
made a diving catch on Roger Cedeno's leadoff liner.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it all fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a rough night all around for everybody,'' catcher Mike
Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (14-6) left after three innings because of a strained
muscle in his right buttocks. He was pulled as a precaution with
the Mets trailing 4-0, and the team did not think he would not miss
a start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hurt it at the end of my warmups. I felt it pull and I was
just uncomfortable,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Mets right fielder Derek Bell banged his left knee into a wall
chasing a foul ball in the eighth, and limped off the field with
assistance. He was diagnosed with a bruise and listed as day to
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not serious, I don't believe,'' manager Bobby Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio's hitting streak was the best in Astros history and tied
Arizona's Tony Womack for the longest in the NL this season. The
backup catcher went 0-for-4 with a walk -- he was the only Astros
starter without a hit -- in stopping a string that started July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio was on deck when Moises Alou grounded into a double play
that ended the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it goes sometimes,'' Eusebio said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit a two-run single in a four-run third and added a
solo home run in the sixth to reach the 40-homer mark for the third
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell has 34 RBIs in August, setting an Astros record for most
in any month. He broke the mark of 31, which he had done three
times and Bell had done once for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personal things are not important,'' Bagwell said. ''I look at
this year as disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the three-time NL Central champions had the
worst record in the majors. Behind Miller, the Astros won for the
11th time in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, tagged for a team record-tying 12 runs by the Chicago
Cubs in 4 2-3 innings in his previous start, struck out seven and
walked one. The lone run against him came on Edgardo Alfonzo's
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller (3-5) pitched his first complete game in 11 big league
starts and earned his first road win in the majors. He became the
first rookie to throw a complete game for the Astros since Donne
Wall on Aug. 30, 1996, at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and Miller also singled home a run for his first RBI
in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I didn't have my stuff and my best control the last
time out,'' he said. ''I think I got over that hump tonight where I
was nervous going out there. Maybe I proved I could pitch up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, this was a coming of age game for Wade Miller,'' he
said. ''To go out there against a contender, against a team with
the best record in the league, on the road, it was outstanding. You
don't see that many complete games in baseball anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno was ejected in the eighth for arguing a called strike by
plate umpire Brian O'Nora. Cedeno pointed his finger at O'Nora and
lightly touched him on the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was no big thing,'' O'Nora said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Cedeno each stole a base as the Astros ran freely,
swiping four in all.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza had a tough day at the plate, too, in going 0-for-3. In
the fourth, he hit a grounder to third base and stayed in the
batter's box, sure he had fouled the ball off his left foot. After
the umpires conferred, Piazza was called out.
</P>
<P>
   The next half-inning, Houston's Chris Truby was called out on
appeal for leaving third base early on a tag play. Truby, who drove
in two runs, and Tim Bogar each had three of the Astros' 16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jerrod Riggan, promoted from Double-A Binghamton a day earlier,
made his major league debut and pitched two innings for the Mets.
The 26-year-old righty allowed two runs, both unearned.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bagwell hit a team-record 43 home runs in 1997 and 42 last
season. ... Slumping 3B Robin Ventura did not start for the Mets.
He spent part of the afternoon with Pat Mahomes across the street
from Shea Stadium, watching the U.S. Open tennis tournament.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Add Wrestler to Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- U.S. Olympic officials on Tuesday bowed to a
federal court and asked the International Olympic Committee to
place Greco-Roman wrestler Matt Lindland on the U.S. team at the
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   While complying with U.S. District Judge James Zagel's ruling,
which forced it to choose Lindland over military police Sgt. Keith
Sieracki, the U.S. Olympic Committee asked the same Chicago-based
appeals court to overturn Zagel's order.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has the authority to turn down the request to put
Lindland on the team, USOC spokesman Mike Moran said, adding that
the deadline for changes has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (IOC) executive board is the only entity now that can
change a roster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland, a University of Nebraska wrestling coach until April,
has been fighting a drawn-out battle in the courts and elsewhere
with Sieracki for the spot in the 167&AMP;frac12;-pound weight class on the
U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki beat Lindland 2-1 on a referee's decision at the
Olympic trials in Dallas in June. But an arbitrator ordered a
rematch after Lindland complained that he was illegally tripped.
Lindland won the rematch 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki took that to arbitration in Colorado and won. But the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago last week upheld the
first arbitration, and Zagel said Monday that should have settled
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC sent a letter to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch,
asking him to recognize Lindland ''as an athlete representing the
United States to participate in the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Zagel raised the possibility that the action could
cause the IOC to disqualify Sieracki and Lindland, leaving the
United States without any wrestler in their weight class.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that if the IOC won't accept the substitution of
Lindland, ''the IOC should then accept the selection of Keith
Sieracki and permit him to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys said the judge's recommendation might carry little
weight with the IOC, and Zagel acknowledged he has no jurisdiction
over the international body, based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he can order IOC to do anything, but I do think
USOC can accomplish the substitution,'' Lindland attorney Steven
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki, based at Fort Carson, Colo., asked a federal court in
Denver on Tuesday to issue an order confirming the second
arbitration. But that court transferred the case to Chicago for the
sake of ''judicial efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki was glum over the series of court reversals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I beat him fair and square at the Olympic trials,'' he said
from Colorado Springs. ''There has been controversy since the first
day I wrestled in the fifth grade, blown calls and stuff, and I
never protested a match.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You work your life away and then all of a sudden they try to
take it away from you because of procedure and misapplication of
bylaws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland said he is happy that the USOC is ''finally doing what
they're told to do -- following the laws of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never protested . . . a single match in my life (before
now) -- never,'' he said. ''But when the rules are so blatantly
misapplied in our sport, I had no option.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, an author of the law that
determines how the U.S. Olympic team is chosen, wrote to the
District Court in Chicago, saying it lacked jurisdiction in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens cited a 1998 amendment barring courts from issuing
injunctions involving an athlete's participation within 21 days of
the start of the games. He asked that the court withdraw from the
dispute and allow the United States Olympic Committee ''to resolve
the matter in accordance with the procedures specified by Congress
...''

<HEADLINE> Indians 12, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Steve Woodard allowed one run and four
hits in six innings for his first win since May 11, and the
Cleveland Indians routed the Texas Rangers 12-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui, acquired from Texas on July 28 for outfielder Ricky
Ledee, and Manny Ramirez each had two-run homers for the Indians,
who have taken over the AL wild-card lead by going 17-8 since Aug.
2.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome followed Ramirez's two-run homer in a five-run seventh
with a solo shot, Thome's 32nd of the season. It marked the ninth
time this year Cleveland hit consecutive homers.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard (1-2) for the first time in seven appearances since the
Indians acquired him from Milwaukee on July 28. He had two losses
and three no-decisions in five starts, and another no-decision in a
relief outing.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard's only other win this season was on May 11, 14-8 over
the Chicago Cubs 14-8 at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers rookie Ryan Glynn (3-3), in his first appearance since
fainting Aug. 11 after leaving a game, allowed allowed five runs
and eight hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed to have neurocardiogenic syncope, a fainting
condition that can be controlled with medication and a high salt
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which has made three errors, has lost four straight, six
of seven and 13 of 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro hit a solo homer in the sixth, his 34th of the
season was the 395th of his career. Palmeiro is 35th on the career
list, one behind Joe Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton went 3-for-5 for the Indians, who outhit Texas
14-6.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland took a 3-0 lead in the fourth, with Glynn contributing
two walks and a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman and Sandy Alomar Jr. had RBI singles in the
fourth, and Alomar scored the inning's final run on the wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Thome walked and Segui hit his 15th homer of the
season, his fourth since joining the Indians, to push the lead to
5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar had an RBI double in the sixth. In the seventh,
Omar Vizquel had a two-run double, Ramirez hit his 27th homer of
the season, and Thome homered for an 11-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Francisco Cordero allowed five runs and four hits in 1
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Woodard was 1-7 with a 5.96 ERA in 14 games for Milwaukee.
... Ramirez extended his hitting streak to 13 games. ... To make
room for Glynn, the Rangers optioned reliever Darwin Cubillan to
Class A Pulaski of the Appalachian League. Cubillan is to rejoin
the Rangers on Sept. 2, after Pulaski's season finishes.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 2, Phillies 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Todd Helton got some rest and Jeffrey
Hammonds picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds went 3-for-4, including a go-ahead RBI double in the
sixth inning, as the Colorado Rockies edged the Philadelphia
Phillies 2-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who needs Todd?,'' Hammonds said, jokingly. ''It was a great
game all around and we won. That's all that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the major league-high 16th for Philadelphia's Omar
Daal (3-16).
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who came into the game leading the majors with a .397
average, didn't start but entered the game in the seventh inning,
replacing starter Butch Huskey at first base. He flied out to left
in his lone at-bat, dipping his average to .396.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose (2-2) pitched six strong innings and snapped a
two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Jimenez pitched 2 1-3 hitless innings for his 17th save in
23 chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game, actually, went just the way we wanted it,'' said
interim manager Toby Harrah, filling in for manager Buddy Bell
during his two-game suspension. ''Rose pitched great and Jimenez
was outstanding. Jimenez's ball was just dropping out of sight.
There was no doubt that he was going out there for the ninth to
finish it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, who made a plate appearance in the eighth and struck
out with the bases loaded, finished with three strikeouts and one
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado broke a 1-1 tie off Daal in the sixth inning. Hammonds
looped a two-out, ground-rule double just inside the right-field
line, scoring Jeff Cirillo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was walking the line there,'' said Hammonds, second to
Helton in the NL batting race with a .357 average. ''It's a game of
inches, isn't it? That one went my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo got into scoring position behind some poor defense when
he tried to stretch a hit into a double. Left fielder Pat Burrell's
throw appeared to beat Cirillo to the bag, but second baseman
Marlon Anderson couldn't come up with the one-hopper. The play was
ruled a double.
</P>
<P>
   Rose allowed one run on three hits -- all in the first three
innings -- and retired the final seven batters he faced. He walked
five and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's toughest jam came in the fourth when he threw 28 pitches
and walked the bases loaded. He struck out Bobby Abreu on a 3-2
off-speed pitch to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good with my curveball all night and that's what I
started (Abreu) off with to get strike one,'' Rose said. ''I just
worked it from there. I was a little lucky I didn't get burned a
couple of times during that inning.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That was big-time,'' Harrah said. ''That was the biggest out
of the game and he got on a roll after it. Early on, he lost it at
times, but he was able to come back and make the big pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal yielded eight hits and two runs in seven innings. He struck
out eight and walked one. Daal is in jeopardy of becoming the first
pitcher in the majors to lose 20 games in a season since Oakland's
Brian Kingman in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he'll win his next three starts,'' Phillies manager
Terry Francona said. ''I thought he was great. It's a shame we
didn't score for him or we would talking about what a great game he
pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 1-0 lead in the third when Ben Petrick scored on
Juan Pierre's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was short-lived as the Phillies tied the game in the
bottom half of the third as Doug Glanville singled home Daal, who
led off with a double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Phillies 3B Scott Rolen wasn't in the starting lineup.
Colorado took advantage as there were four plays that went for hits
there, including Cirillo's double in the third, that just got past
Rolen's replacement, Kevin Jordan. ... Helton is 3-for-17 (.176)
for his career against Daal. ... Hammonds has 102 RBIs in 105
games. ... The Phillies' three-game winning streak ended. The team
hasn't won four in a row since July 4. ... Hammonds, who went
2-for-3 against Daal, was 0-for-8 career against the left-hander
coming in.

Rebels Threaten To Kill American Hostage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels in the Philippines threatened
Tuesday to kill an American man they have kidnapped unless the United States
accepts their demands. Jeffrey Craig Edwards Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., was
seized Monday by a faction of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, which this week
released six other Western hostages in return for a reported $6 million ransom
but was still holding 18 other captives. But the faction holding Schilling
insisted the prospect of more ransom was not behind the latest kidnapping. In
past abductions, the faction has demanded the release of Muslim militants jailed
in the United States for the World Trade Center bombing and other planned
attacks.

Aid Offered to Drought-Stricken Texas

   BOYD, Texas (AP) -- Gazing across a field of shrunken yellow watermelons on
withered vines, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman Tuesday promised federal aid
to four more counties in drought-stricken north Texas. Glickman's visit marked
the 60th consecutive day without measurable rainfall in north Texas, where crops
are parched and reservoirs are drying up. The previous record was 58 days, set
in 1934 and 1950. ''These folks are really hurting,'' he said. ''I don't like to
be here on a day setting records -- not these kinds of records, anyway.''
Glickman has previously declared 153 Texas counties either primary or contiguous

Mont. Gov.: Declare Disaster Area

   RED LODGE, Mont. (AP) -- Montana's governor asked President Clinton to
declare Montana a federal disaster area Tuesday because of its huge wildfires,
as exhausted firefighters looked hopefully toward the weekend and the
possibility of rain. Gov. Marc Racicot told Clinton the state has exhausted its
fire fighting resources and asked for a federal disaster declaration that would
free up more federal money. The governor estimated wildfires are costing Montana
businesses $3 million a day. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise,
Idaho, said there were 31 large fires burning on 674,000 acres in Montana

Ford Denies Withholding Information

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday that its first report

came in 1998 -- two years before it began replacing tires for customers there.
Ford officials in Venezuela said they began recalling tires in May only after
waiting for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. to act. The automaker denied charges that
it withheld information about defective tires that may have caused at least 10
deaths here, and also said the design of the Explorer did not contribute to
tread separations and blowouts in Firestone tires.

Police Raid Japan Milk Manufacturer

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Police on Wednesday raided the Tokyo headquarters of Japan's
largest dairy products maker, which is under investigation for selling
bacteria-tainted milk that caused a massive food poisoning. Investigators also
searched Snow Brand Milk Products Co.'s regional main office in Osaka on
suspicion of professional negligence. No arrests were made. Most of the 14,800
people sickened in the June food poising live in Osaka, about 254 miles west of
Tokyo. The Snow Brand case and a chain of other recent contaminations of food
with bugs, broken pieces of plastic and other objects have triggered a national
food scare and loss of public trust in Japan's food industry.
