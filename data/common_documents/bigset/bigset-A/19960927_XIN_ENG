<HEADLINE> UK Gravely Concerned Over Situation in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
expressed grave concern over the worsening situation in the West
Bank and urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to make every
effort to "cool the situation."
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement issued today
that the abrupt outbreak of violence in the West Bank and other
areas had left the Middle East peace process in a "precarious
state."
</P>
<P>
"We are gravely concerned by the situation on the West Bank
including Jerusalem," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Actions such as the opening of the tunnel along the Western
Wall and the recent demolition of a Palestinian community center
in Jerusalem have caused suspicion and disquiet," it added.
</P>
<P>
The British government is "urging leaders on both sides to do
all in their power to cool the situation and exercise the
statesmanship required and to step back from confrontation and
return to a path of trust and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifind reportedly said in New
York Wednesday, "It is going to be very, very important to give
the reassurance and give the signs of tangible process that can
reduce the temperature and get matters under an even keel."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israeli forces shot dead 22 Palestinians
earlier today in clashes over Israeli policy in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> PKK Rebels Burn 5 Official Vehicles in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) burned today five official vehicles
and injured one person in Hakkari province bordering Iran and
Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a group of the PKK militants blocked five
trucks on a road in Cukurca town of Hakkari province and set fire
on the trucks at 16:00 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels escaped after the incident, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi said on
Tuesday that nearly 1,000 PKK rebels have been killed in clashes
with the government troops since August 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PKK was in a state of what he termed as
complete disarray as a result of its heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war in
southeastern Turkey for self-rule since August 1984 and more than
21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and the government
troops have been killed in clashes since then.

<HEADLINE> UK Global Trade Gap Widens to 1.23 Bln Pounds in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (xinhua) -- Britain's global trade gap
widened unexpectedly in July as domestic demand for consumer goods
accelerated and sucked in more goods than were exported, official
figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today that
Britain's world trade deficit rose to 1.23 billion pounds (1.90
billion U.S. dollars) in July from 1.13 billion pounds (1.75
billion dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
The figures were against City economists' expectation of a
deficit narrowing to 775 million pounds (1.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The July deficit excluding oil and erratics widened to 1.69
billion pounds (2.62 billion dollars) from a revised 1.5 billion
pounds (2.33 billion dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that exports in July totaled 13.8 billion pounds
(21.39 billion dollars), up only 0.3 percent from June's 13.75
billion pounds (21.33 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials said that sluggish demand for British goods in the
European Union was mainly responsible for the tiny rise in the
volume of UK exports.
</P>
<P>
The 0.3 percent rise in exports was outweighed by imports of
713 billion pounds (1,105.15 billion dollars), up 1 percent,
largely due to consumption of consumer goods from overseas,
especially demand for clothing from the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the UK global trade deficit is likely to
edge up during the rest of the year as demand for consumer goods
continues to accelerate. Meanwhile, there will also be higher
demand for capital and intermediate goods as the recovery in
manufacturing gathers momentum.

<P>
DONGGUAN, Guangdong Province, September 26 (Xinhua) -- August
1st overwhelmed Shandong Boyuan 98-62 in the final to take the
title of the First Chinese Men's Club Basketball Championships
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Host Guangdong Hongyuan defeated Liaoning Angang 96-79 in the
playoff for the third and fourth places earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
August 1st jumped to a 8-2 lead but the Shandong team soon took
over the tide with strong attackings and was 18-15 ahead at the
midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
But Adijiang hit two back-to-back three-pointers to anchor a
12-1 run, which allowed August 1st to made it 29-19 with seven
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
The Army club furthered a 20-10 run to widen the margin to by
20 points at 49-29 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the August 1st team carried out a fullcourt
man-to-man defense to extend its lead all the way to a 36-point
victory over the frustrated Shandong.
</P>
<P>
In the playoff for third place, Hongyuan burst to a 18-6 lead
with seven minutes into the game and was 49-35 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning managed to storm back in the second half with
3-pointers and narrowed the gap. But the more experienced Hongyuan
used better teamwork and tougher defense to hold down Liaoning's
challenge.
</P>
<P>
The 12 first-division teams used the club championship as a
preparation for the 1996-1997 home-and-away season which starts in
early November.

MADRID, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Dufaux won the 19th
stage of Tour of Spain cycling race on Thursday, making a late
challenge to leader Alex Zuelle.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss gained 55 seconds on his compatriot and replaced
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert in second place overall after the 212
km leg from Getafe and Avila.
</P>
<P>
Dufaux stood four minutes 22 seconds behind Zuelle with three
days left.
</P>
<P>
Zuelle seemed unaffected by a stomach upset that has hit his
ONCE team but team mate Jalabert was clearly unable to cope with
the searing pace and lost more than 20 minutes, sliding out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
Dufaux promised to attack again in Friday's stage. It could be
his last chance because Saturday's time trial is a Zuelle
speciality and Sunday's largely-flat closing section
traditionally ends in a sprint finish in Madrid.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said here today that the United Nations
must be ready to deal with conflicts where and when they break
out.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, Dini said that from its original role as a force
of interposition, peacekeeping has gradually taken on the broader
tasks of participation, support for the process of national
reconciliation, and today protection of populations threatened by
inter-ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
To make the U.N.'s actions more effective in peacekeeping
operations, he proposed the following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- to involve troop-contributors in the decision-making
process;
</P>
<P>
-- to conduct annual reviews of the mission, mandate, and means
of peacekeeping operations;
</P>
<P>
-- to have readily-deployable military forces available as soon
as Security Council decisions are made;
</P>
<P>
-- to create a reliable and unified command structure for
peacekeeping operations;
</P>
<P>
-- to expand logistic support for peacekeeping operations;
</P>
<P>
-- to prioritize training programs for peacekeeping personnel;
</P>
<P>
-- to improve the financing of peacekeeping operations;
</P>
<P>
-- to fill the gap between peacekeeping and post-conflict peace
building;
</P>
<P>
-- to entrust certain peacekeeping operations to regional
organizations; and
</P>
<P>
-- to enhance cooperation between the U.N. and the Organization
of African Unity.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Leaves Germany for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu left here for home today immediately after his talks
with German Chancellor Helmut Kolh.
</P>
<P>
He had cut short his visit to Germany as a result of escalating
violence between Israelis and Palestinians, according to a senior
Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
Shi Bazak, the prime minister's spokesman, told reporters that
Netanyahu, who arrived from Paris in Germany today as scheduled
for a one-day visit, had canceled the planned talks with Speaker
of the German Federal Assembly Rita Suessmuth, as well as
opposition and Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a third straight day of violence erupted between
Palestinians and Israeli forces in the Palestinian territories,
which had so far killed at least 20 Palestinians and wounded
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Two Israelis were also killed and about 20 wounded in the
bloody fight. Despite Israeli closure of Palestinian territories,
violence erupted again first in the Gaza Strip and then spread to
the West bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a Palestinian report, Netanyahu had telephoned
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the day before cutting
short his Germany visit, appealing to him to cool the tensions and
end the latest violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly agreed to make efforts and help stablize the
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister began his Europe tour with a visit
to France, during which he was urged to restart the Arab-Israeli
peace process "on the right footing," after holding talks with
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the French president telephoned Arafat to
express support and appeal for calm, according to the president's
office. He called on all sides to calm tension, show wisdom and
resume the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The massive Palestinian protest campaign was touched off by
Israel's opening of a tunnel by the side of the Islamic holy site
of Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that its opening was solely for the sake of
tourist development, but Palestinians charged that it would
undermine the holy site.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU)
executive European Commission has adopted a proposal to enhance
the legal basis of the Telematics in Social Security program
(TESS).
</P>
<P>
The TESS program is established at the community level to
facilitate the flow of information between national institutions
through the use of telematic services, said a news release issued
here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was to better social security schemes to employed
persons, self-employed persons and members of their families
moving within the 15 EU nations.
</P>
<P>
A second aspect of the proposal is to give students access to
medical treatment benefits provided by the institution in their
place of residence or stay, for all states of health requiring
treatment instead of just in urgent cases as in the past.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward by Padraig Flynn, the EU
commissioner responsible for employment and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission prepares a proposal each year to update
the mechanisms for community-level coordination of national social
security legislation. The objective is to improve coordination
with a view to facilitating free movement within the regional
alliance.

<P>
Wetlands International was established in 1996, integrating the
Asian Wetlands Bureau, the International Waterfowl and Wetlands
Research Bureau, and Wetlands for the Americas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Forestry, there are more than
630,000 ha of wetlands in China. To date, China has set up 130
wetlands nature reserves of various types, six of which have been
listed among the world's most important wetlands.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Ministry of Forestry signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Wetlands International -- Asia Pacific,
under which they have conducted widespread cooperation in the
conservation and development of wetlands, including the decision
to set up the China Program in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry will cooperate with the China Program
of Wetlands International, continue the investigation and
monitoring of the wetlands resources in China, accelerate the
drafting of a national plan of action for the wetlands
conservation and strengthen ties with related international

<HEADLINE> Britain Attracts 24 Million Foreign Tourists in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A record number of foreign
tourists spent 20 percent more in Britain in 1995 than they did in
the previous year, said the British Tourist Authority (BTA) today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 24 million foreigners, 13 percent up on 1994, visited
the UK last year, spending a record 11.9 billion pounds (18.5
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The main reason is almost certainly the pound, which is about a
fifth cheaper against most major currencies than it was in the
early 1990s, said the BTA.
</P>
<P>
But the rise of groups like Oasis and the success of dramas
such as Sense and Sensibility were also cited by the BTA.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures for the first half of this year, said
Anthony Sell, BTA chairman, showed total numbers of tourists up 12
percent and spending up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing growth three times the world average. Most of
our competitors are seeing slower rates of growth and some are
experiencing significant losses," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Reach Accord on Fighting Sex Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) justice
ministers have agreed to extend the scope of the EU's police
agency Europol in an effort to crack down on sex trade in children
and women, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during the two-day session of EU justice
ministers in Dublin beginning earlier today, Irish Justice
Minister Nora Owen, whose country is the current EU presidency
state, announced that the ministers reached political agreement on
a plan to extend the mandate of the Europol Drugs Unit to fight
against trafficking of people.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, police officers throughout the 15-nation
bloc would be exchanged and special centers to crack down on the
crime would be established.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Storbeck, chief of the Hague-based Drugs Unit, was
quoted as saying, "We intend to fight against the work of
criminals in the trafficking of people in the same way as we fight
against drugs trafficking."

Storbeck noted that his unit, which already helped fight drugs
trafficking and money laundering, could help speed up exchanges of
information between police units throughout the EU and carry out
strategic analysis.

With Europol's help, information on missing children and people
suspected of abducting them could be exchanged in less than an
hour, he said.

<P>
Storbeck stressed that the Europol officers over the next few
weeks would meet to try and identify problems in international
investigations in different member states.

<HEADLINE> Qatar, Jordan Condemn Israel's Opening of Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein and
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani today condemned
Israel's opening of a tunnel near Al Aqsa mosque in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to Qatar News Agency, the two leaders made the
condemnation after they held talks in the Qatari capital city of
Doha.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said Israel's move to build the tunnel
constituted a violation of the sanctity of the holy city of
Jerusalem, a provocation of Arab and Moslem sentiments, and an
action that contradicted with the signed peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
They held the Israeli government squarely responsible for the
latest violence in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories, in
which more than 20 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were killed.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who arrived in Doha Wednesday from Bahrain, also
discussed relations between Qatar and Jordan and the territorial
dispute between Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state underscored the principles of mutual
respect of the sovereignty of every state over its territory, non
interference in the internal affairs of other states, and the
strengthening of security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's current Gulf tour serves as part of Jordan's
efforts to rebuild ties with the Gulf Arab countries that were
strained when Jordan tilted toward Iraq during the 1990-1991 Gulf
Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and the Gulf Arab countries have
improved since last year, when Jordan started to distance itself
from Iraq.

<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Communist Party
General Secretary and Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
emphasized the power of the press in guiding public opinion,
calling on the country's news media to insist on correct political
direction.
</P>
<P>
History has proved again and again that the guiding of public
opinion is of great significance to the growth and development of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), to the establishment and
strengthening of the people's political power, to the solidarity
of the people, and to making the country rich, strong and
prosperous, Jiang said during an inspection of the headquarters of
the "People's Daily" this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Party's news media and the Party are bound by a common
cause and the Party's news media is part of the Party's life, he
said. Therefore, the Party has insisted that the leadership of the
news media must be tightly held in the hands of those who are
loyal to Marxism, the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was accompanied by Ding Guangen, Politburo member and
member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Jiang praised the "People's Daily," the
official paper of the CPC Central Committee, for its important
role as the mouthpiece of the Party and the people over the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
The paper, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee,
has stayed true to the correct policies and has made important
contributions to the revolution, construction and reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that all of the old-generation
revolutionaries, including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, attached
great importance to the news media. He stressed the important role
played by the "People's Daily," saying that it serves as an
exemplary and guiding operation for all newspapers as well as
China's press circles as a whole.

fire. Military commanders are conducting negotiations to evacuate
the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza Strip, thousands of Palestinian protesters threw
stones and bottles at a Jewish settlement and clashes with
Israeli soldiers in near the Erez checkpoint between Israel
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The clashes continued from early morning to late
afternoon. Israel army used helicopters to evacuate wounded
soldiers and fired tear gas to try to disperse Palestinian
protesters.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, the scene of the first bloody clash Wednesday,
stone-throwing Palestinians continued fighting with Israeli
soldiers. At least four Palestinian were reportedly shot dead
in the confrontation. Israel has sent tanks to reinforce the
troops there.
</P>
<P>
Gun fighting also took place in Bethlehem area in south of
Jerusalem, as Palestinians rained Israeli border checkpoints and
military jeeps.
</P>
<P>
In east Jerusalem, hundreds of Israeli policemen scuffled with
hundreds of Palestinian demonstrators near the Damascus Gate to
the Old City, who were led by Palestinian representative Faisal
Husseini, but no violent clashes were reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Israeli officials as saying that armed
Palestinian policemen took part in all the fightings. Israeli
army on Wednesday charged Palestinian police for sparking the
first bloodshed in Ramallah by shooting at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is bracing more violence ahead of tomorrow's Friday
Prayer by the Palestinian Moslems at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Israel has imposed a total closure on the territories from
Wednesday night, and Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
chaired a meeting today to discuss the special deployment in
the city to prevent outbreak of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called the current
situation in the territories as a state of emergency. However, a
government statement denied that the minister has declared such a
state, which is militarily only second to the state of war.
</P>
<P>
Trying to calm the escalating violence, Mordechai said that he
had spoken by phone with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, who reportedly agreed to rein in Palestinian security
forces, but retained the right of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, cut
short his visit to Germany on the third leg of three-nation
European tour and returned this evening to discuss ways to calm
the situation, which is in danger of out of control.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister's Office said that Netanyahu also made the
second phone call to Arafat today in an attempt to bring
under control of the tension, but no results was produced.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli officials said that Netanyahu was expected to
set up a meeting with Arafat, which is described by many analysts
as the only way to calm the situation and save the peace process
which is in grave danger.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Netanyahu telephoned Arafat that Israel would
never try to endanger Moslem holy sites. He also telephoned
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the leading mediator between
Israel and Palestinians, asking him to help calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
The latest bloody conflicts, the worst since the two sides
made peace in 1993, were triggered by Israel's decision two
days ago to open a controversial underground tunnel in east
Jerusalem, which Palestinians accused of being a plot to
undermine the Moslem holy sites above.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
today hailed the just-concluded Europe tour by Li Ruihuan,
Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
On the way back from Moscow, the last leg of the tour which
brought Li to Poland, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and
Russia, CPPCC secretary-general Zhu Xun said that the visit has
served the purpose of deepening mutual understanding, enhancing
the friendship and broadening common ground with the five
countries.
</P>
<P>
The three-week tour, which started on September 5, is a
complete success as it has played an important role in promoting
China's relations with the five European nations, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who accompanied Li on the trip, said that the CPPCC chief
discussed bilateral relations and international issues of common
concern with heads of state and government and leaders of
parliament of the five countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press during his stay in
Switzerland, Li answered questions about the Tibet policy of the
Chinese central government and major international issues.
</P>
<P>
In his meetings with his hosts, the CPPCC chief spoke
positively of exchanges and cooperation between China and the five
countries in the political, economic, cultural and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Frequent high-level visits and the broadening scope for
cooperation between China and these countries in recent years not
only conform to the interests of the people of China and of these
countries, but are also conducive to world peace and development,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li told his hosts that China is willing to further strengthen
the friendly and mutual beneficial cooperation with the five
countries and bring the momentum into the 21st century, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader repeatedly said that the right of an
individual country to choose its development road must be
respected by other countries.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions during his trip, Li stressed that China wants
a stable domestic political situation and a lasting peaceful
international situation to build its national economy, so it has
no intentions to make trouble or create frictions with any
countries.
</P>
<P>
China treats as equals all countries, big or small, rich or
poor, powerful or week, and it expects other countries to treat it
likewise if they want to win trust and friendship from it, Li
said.

heartfelt support from the Chinese people who have get material
benefits.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Li said that the third generation of leaders
of China with Jiang Zemin at the core adheres to the theory of
Deng Xiaoping about building Socialism with Chinese
characteristics. They have the capability of pushing forward the
reform and opening up and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>

other countries and try to learn from their experiences and he

<P>
The introduction by Li about the construction of China's
Socialist democracy and the basic situation of the people's
political consultative system attracted the interest and attention
of the leaders and media of the five countries.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of visit and contact between CPPCC and the
parliaments of the five countries had played an important role in
promoting the all round relations with the five countries, Zhu

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urges West to Live Up to Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign
Minister I.S.G. Mudenge here today urged the developed countries
to live up to their commitments and abandon projectionist policies
if all countries are to benefit from the new trading arrangements
of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current U.N. General
Assembly session, Mudenge said that improved market access and
increased foreign direct investment must be accompanied by new and
innovative ways to tackle the debt burden of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He asked for the finding of a comprehensive and
once-and-for-all solution to the debt problem. Given the negative
economic trends in some developing countries, the developed world
and international financial institutions should seriously consider
debt forgiveness on behalf of low-income developing countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We, the developing countries fully accept and recognize that
we bear the primary responsibility for our own development, and
we have accordingly undertaken various economic structural
adjustment reforms, often at enormous social and political
costs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These ambitious and painful reforms could flounder if
developed countries fail to compliment these sterling efforts by
taking decisive measures to reduce the stock of our debt, as
well as removing the wall of protectionist barriers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the developed countries to take decisive
measures, as a matter of urgency, to increase the flow of official
development assistance, private investment and the transfer of
technologies to the developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Vows to Help Halt Palestinian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein said here today
that Jordan will do its utmost to help halt the ongoing
Palestinian-Israeli conflict in Palestinian self-ruled areas and
would not allow the situation to deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from a two-day official
visit to Bahrain and Qatar, the king said he was deeply concerned
about the violence and the loss of lives in the Palestinian
self-ruled territories.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king said, as far as Jordanian-Israeli peace
treaty is concerned, Jordan has a role to play in the holy sites
in Jerusalem and to resolve the issue between the Israelis and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a firmly-announced Jordanian position that the
geographical nature of Jerusalem should not be tempered with, but
he did not elaborate it.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said today that Israeli troops have shot dead
33 Palestinians today in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts brought the death toll in two days of the
fighting to 38 Palestinians. Eleven Israelis are also killed
today in the unprecedented conflict between the Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The protests were set off by Israel's decision Tuesday to open
a tunnel that runs along the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Arab east
Jerusalem. The Palestinians regard the completion of the tunnel as
"a crime" and an action to Judaize the holy city of
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Lifting Ban on Flights in No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has appealed to Arab and
other foreign countries to help lift the flight ban in the "no-fly
zones" set up over southern and northern Iraq since the end of the
1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came in a letter by Iraqi National Assembly Speaker
Saadoun Hammadi, to parliament speakers of Arab and foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The letter was carried today by the official Iraqi news agency
INA.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi pointed out the imposition of the no-fly zones were the
decision of the United States and Britain, not a Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it represents an open violation of the United Nations
Charter and the rules of international law, he said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
It was also a flagrant aggression on Iraq's sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Iraqi forces marched to northern Iraq late August,
Washington decided to expand the southern no-fly zone up to
latitude 33, which reaches to the suburbs of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the Clinton Administration was deliberately
launching a new military aggression against Iraq, and had taken a
unilateral aggressive decision to expand the illegal no-fly zone
in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This U.S. decision was supported by Britain, whereas, France
opposed it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi speaker called on his Arab and foreign counterparts
to ask their respective governments to uphold the unity and
sovereignty of Iraq, and to help abolish what he termed as the
unlawful ban on aviation and to abstain from interference in
Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraqi Minister of Culture and
Information, Abdul Ghani Abdul Ghafour, had sent messages to his
Saudi, Egyptian and Syrian counterparts, seeking support from
their countries for the abolition of the no-fly zones, according
to today's Iraqi newspaper Babyl.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since the establishment of the no-fly
zones that Baghdad is asking Riyadh, Cairo and Damascus to help
lift the flight ban over the two zones.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria, which
sympathized with Kuwait, joined the U.S.-led allied forces to
drive Iraq out of the oil-rich emirate.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sino-American relations have
been improving and the conditions are favorable for further
bettering of the ties, senior Chinese and U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
In their talks held here Wednesday evening, Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said that some positive progress has been
made in bilateral relations due to joint efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the exchanges and cooperation between the two
countries in the economic, trade and other fields have
continuously developed and expanded. The planned exchange of
high-level visits has been gradually implemented, they said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that there are still problems and
differences between the two sides, but the overall atmosphere has
been improved gradually. And there exist favorable conditions for
further improvement, they added.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that both sides should take an active and
constructive attitude and increase cooperation in resolving the
existing problems properly so as to push their relations to a
healthy and stable growth.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that the Taiwan question is still the major
obstacle that affects the stable development of China-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the U.S., from a point of view of the overall
relations between the two countries, will honor its commitments
with concrete deeds on the Taiwan question and observe the three
joint communiques, stop selling advanced weapons and military
equipment to Taiwan and refrain from having any official contacts
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that there is no change in the U.S. policy on
the Taiwan question and the U.S. government will continue to
pursue a "one China" policy and observe the three U.S.-China joint
communiques.
</P>
<P>
On the economic and trade relations, the Chinese side holds
that it conforms to the fundermental interests of the two
countries to maintain and develop normal, steady and healthy
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The annual reviews of the most-favored-nation status concerning
China not only affect the economic and trade relations between the
two countries but also damage the whole Sino-American
relationship. Qian hoped the U.S. will solve this problem as soon
as possible and once for all.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he hoped the U.S. will make efforts to solve the
problem of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said the most-favored-nation status is the
foundation of normal trade of the two countries. The U.S. is
willing to work with China to seek an appropriate settlement of
the issue so that Sino-American relations will not be strained and
disturbed any more.
</P>
<P>
Christopher reiterated U.S. support for China's efforts to
enter the World Trade Organization and said the U.S. will speed up
the negotiation process on the terms of the organization so that
the question can be solved quickly.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in the areas of
environment protection and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reiterated that to maintain high-level
Sino-American dialogues and visits is of great importance to
improving the bilateral relations. They agreed to continue their
efforts to push forward and strengthen the high-level visits of
the two countries.

GENEVA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank today
cut its discount rate by 0.5 percent, to 1.0 percent, the
lowest level since November 1979.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Bank said the move is in line with the
current decline in the country's money market rates. By lowering
the rate, the central bank is sending a signal that interest rates
will remain at low levels in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Swiss politicians and businessmen widely welcomed the cut, and
expected that it would help weaken the strong Swiss franc and
boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss economy has been in recession for six consecutive
quarters. Falling construction outlays and slow consumer spending
amid rising job insecurity have been blamed for the situation.

242 projects in the previous year, was contained in the World Bank
Annual Report for 1996 fiscal year, which ended on June 30.

<HEADLINE> Most Frenchmen Expect "Hot Autumn-Winter" in 1996: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-six percent of Frenchmen
and Frenchwomen are expecting a "hot autumn" and a "hot winter"
this year to be caused by strikes of employees of public sectors,
said a poll by the SOFRES polling group conducted lately for Le
Figaro Magazine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 59 percent of French people are guarding a bad memory
about the strike of public transport employees last November and
December, and 28 percent say they have a good memory of the time,
said the poll which was made on 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Only 12 percent of French people think that there will be no risk
of strikes in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
For those who participated in the strikes of last year, 58
percent say they have a good memory of the time, while 34 percent
have a bad memory about the strike.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of French public transport workers staged a
two-month strike last year to protest some austerity plans of Prime
Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Some trade unions have again decided to launch strikes this year
to protest the government's 1997 austerity budget law which includes
plans to lay off tens of thousands of employees in public sectors
and other government-funded enterprises in the following years.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that 81 percent of French people support the
holding of a referendum on whether to stage a strike or not, while
16 percent are opposed to the idea.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 37 Palestinians Killed on Third Day of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- For the third consecutive
day, the Palestinian territories have witnessed fierce clashes
between furious Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces and
between Palestinian police and Israeli army units, which resulted
in the deaths of 37 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
With the 5 killed Wednesday, the death toll has reached 42,
according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based
in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to increase any time because of
the many critical injuries. Hundreds of the injured were reported
in various parts of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
During the violent incidents in the entire Palestinian
territories, demonstrators stoned Israeli soldiers and hurled
empty bottles at them.
</P>
<P>
On their part, the Israeli troops used tanks, helicopters and
automatic machine guns to contain what it seems to be a new
Palestinian Intifada (or uprising). The worst incidents were
observed in the Gaza Strip, and Ramallah and Nablus in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian demonstrators started a march
early this morning from Al-Azhar University toward Nezarim
interjunction and clashed with Israeli soldiers who guarded the
tiny Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Violent incidents followed in different parts of the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The most severe violence took place in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.
Exchange of fire flared up when an Israeli army unit attempted to
cross into the autonomous area.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges of fire were also reported near Kfar Darom
settlement, Nazarim and Erez Checkpoint on the Israel-Gaza border.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24 Palestinians, including some policemen and a
young girl, were killed. More than 140 were wounded by live
ammunition and rubber bullets. 30 of the injuries are still in
serious condition. 70 sustained bullet wounds in the head and
chest. Among the wounded there are two journalists working with
foreign media.
</P>
<P>
In the farm fields of Beit Hanoun, Israeli helicopters fired at
Palestinian residents. Al-Shifa Hospital asked the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the International Red Cross to
assist them in moving the casualties to hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Doctor Outlines Final Decision on Yeltsin's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A Kremlin chief physician
tonight confirmed that the final decision on Russia President Boris
Yeltsin's heart surgery was made during the meeting of a group of
key medical experts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the independent NTV television company,
Yeltsin's chief physician Sergei Mironov said the timescale of the
preparatory period and the amount of surgery necessary were also
clarified during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the Kremlin, the operation is expected
to be carried out in late November or in early December.
</P>
<P>
"This is an operation which will return Yeltsin to full working
capacity," Mironov said, adding that it is not by accident that
Professor Renat Akchurin was chosen to perform the operation.
</P>
<P>
"This is a highly experienced surgeon who has performed
numerous heart operations, in particular for high-ranking
patients, including Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
former First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Lobov," he explained. "It
was Chernomyrdin who recommended Akchurin to the President."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the President, "who gets used to new people with
difficulty, has established good private contacts with Akchurin,"
Mironov went to say.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Yeltsin is clearly determined to have the
operation in Russia and to have it performed by a Russian surgeon.
</P>
<P>
The operation may be performed in the Chazov Cardiological
Center or in the Central Clinical Hospital because "both of them
have everything necessary, Mironov said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will be hospitalized only shortly before the operation,
the doctor said, noting that the President will spend the entire
pre-operation period in the Central Clinical Hospital or in the
Barvikha health center.
</P>
<P>
The heart bypass operation itself will last for an hour and a
half to an hour and 45 minutes, while the recuperation period will
take about six or eight weeks, Mironov said.
</P>
<P>
"The President will be able to begin working 24 hours after the
operation," he stressed, adding that "Yeltsin is now working for
2.5-3 hours a day."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief
Alexander Lebed said today that Russia is close to a dangerous
brink and needs resolute decisions.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, both secretary of the Russian Security Council and
President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to breakaway Chechnya, told
a news conference that the Russian authorities needs concentration
in handling its problems.
</P>
<P>
All problems confronting the country cannot be resolved at a
stroke, but all power branches and political camps should
concentrate on key chellenges and pool their efforts, Lebed said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the Chechen settlement remains Russia's problem
number 1.
</P>
<P>
Russia is close to a dangerous brink, and it is not an
appropriate time now to argue who takes the pride of place in
Russia and who is more rightist or leftist," Lebed said, adding
that "it is time to take resolute decisions, not to harangue."
</P>
<P>
As concerns the planned heart operation of Yeltsin, Lebed
stressed that "much depends on Yeltsin's health, and his ailing
unfortunately is delaying solution to urgent problems."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Israel, Palestinians to End Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Thursday urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to avoid
taking provocative actions which could further inflame tensions
between them, but he avoided any direct recriminations for the
outbreak of violent clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"I think that all the parties should avoid any actions which
are likely to undermine the progress of the peace and now the
important thing is to end the violence and to get back to
implementing those peace agreements," he told reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his regret over the loss of life in the past
two days, during which at least 40 people have been killed, and
appealed to both the Palestinians and Israelis "to do nothing that
will provoke a disruption" and resolve their differences through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came as battles were raging between Israeli
troops on the one side and Palestinian police and protesters on
the other side in the Palestinian cities of Ramallah, Nablus,
Bethlehem and Hebron.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 Palestinians and 10 Israeli soldiers have been
killed and hundreds of people injured in the fighting, which
erupted after Israel on Tuesday opened an underground pedestrian
tunnel in Jerusalem near the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, Islam's
third holiest site.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not level any direct accusations of responsibility
for the onset of fighting, which is the worst since the
Palestinians and Israel started their peace negotiations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that
the Clinton administration believed both parties "should take no
steps that raise new issues that cause complications in the very
difficult and complicated discussions they already have under
way". He added that the opening of the tunnel was "clearly a new
issue".
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Secretary of State Warren Christopher had talked
with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat several times, and "we're working
with them to try to work this out to restore order and peace and
then to get on with the talks".
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to do anything we can that will be of
assistance, and I've made that clear," he said.

CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak tonight urged Israel to close the tunnel it dug under the
Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem and start pulling Israeli troops
from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In an urgent message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Mubarak urged him to take prompt steps to contain the
explosive situation in the Palestinian territories and to avoid
any more violence and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by Egypt's Information Minister Safwat

Mubarak said closing the tunnel is the only means for calming
down the deteriorated situation in the region and ending violent
acts.

<P>
He also called upon all parties concerned to halt violence and
urged Israel to start pulling its troops out of the West Bank city
of Hebron, al-Sherif added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Telephone numbers in north
China's Tianjin municipality will be increased to eight digits
from the present seven digits, beginning on March 8, 1997, the
municipal post and telecommunications administration announced
today.

<P>
A "2" will be placed before the current first number, while
numbers of special three-digit phones that begin with "1", secret

exchange capacity in order to meet the rapidly-increasing demands
resulting from the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, the third largest city in the country with a
population of more than nine million, has experienced an
annual economic increase of 14 percent in the past three years.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's former foreign
minister Kasem Samosorn Kasemsri has been appointed a deputy prime
minister in the care-taker government in a royal decree announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa decided to dissolve the
House of Representatives and his decision was approved by King
Bhumibol Adulyadej in a separate royal decree.
</P>
<P>
In the royal decree, the king appointed a total of seven new
members, including one deputy prime minister, one minister and
five deputy ministers, for the care-taker cabinet to help
administer the country before the general elections, to be held on
November 17.
</P>
<P>
The posts have been left vacant by mass resignations of the
Therd Thai faction of Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai nation) party in
may and the pullout of the Palang Dharma (virtue force) party in
August.
</P>
<P>
Kasem, a non-MP, was made foreign minister under the Nam Thai
party quota in July last year by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay
Virawan for his rich experience in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, he resigned in may this year under pressure from some
party members for being a minister but not an MP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gen. Viroj Saengsanit, supreme commander of the
Royal Thai armed forces, who retires at the end of September, has
been appointed deputy defense minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- An academic paper that
presents theories of the socialist market economy has been
selected as one of the outstanding achievements in social science
research in China in recent years by the country's leading
institute in the field.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Science named 54 representative
papers, monographs, research reports, reference books and
translation works from among more than 10,000 submissions of
social scientific works published between 1992-1994.
</P>
<P>
The works covered China's economy, social development, history,
literature and language.
</P>
<P>
"The rewarded works represented the highest level of social
scientific research currently in China," said Wang Renzhi, vice
president of the academy.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the winners focused on theories of China's
opening-up and reform policies, as well as problems that appeared
during its socialist economic construction.
</P>
<P>
"They have put forward many scientific ideas on these subjects,
and have played a key role as advisor to the policy-making of the
government," Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
An article titled "What Is Socialism, How to Build Socialism,"
written by Hu Sheng, president of the academy, was given an
honorable mention.
</P>
<P>
"Choosing and rewarding good works is an effective method to
encourage social scientific workers to make greater contributions
to the development of society," said Liu Yunshan, deputy head of
the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the academy has rewarded the research
achievements of its staff. The first recognition event was held in

<HEADLINE> Pak to Establish Ties with Interim Kabul Government: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will send
immediately a delegation to establish contact with the interim
government in Kabul, said a Foreign Office spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan will also maintain its contact with the
Taliban Shoora, or council, in Kandahar, the largest city and
headquarters of the religious student militia in southern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban's taking over in Kabul has now created a
qualitatively new situation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban overran the Afghan capital of Kabul early this
morning after three days of intensive fighting between the troops
loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's first priority will call on the interim government
to show restraint and ensure the unimpeded flow of humanitarian
assistance to the population of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Pakistani government has taken note of
the fact that Taliban is now in control of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Pakistan was informed, through New
York, of the fact that former President Mohammad Najibullah had
been taken out of the UN compound shortly after the Taliban took
over.
</P>
<P>
An appeal for his safety by the United Nations was immediately
conveyed to the Taliban Shoora in Kandahar by the government of
Pakistan through its consulate general.
</P>
<P>
"At that time we were informed that the Shoora was only aware
of Najibullah's arrest," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, Najibullah was soon killed and hanged outside the UN
compound where he sought refuge after his government was
overthrown in 1992.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows at 4.7 Percent Rate in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce
Department announced today that U.S. economy grew at a quick 4.7
percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was revised down from the rate of 4.8 percent
reported one month ago but it was still the fastest rate since the
economy expanded at a 4.9 percent rate in the second quarter of
1994.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) totals at an annual rate of
6.89 trillion dollars after adjusting for inflation, compared with
6.81 trillion rate in the January-March period.
</P>
<P>
The GDP grew at a 2 percent rate from January through March
after a 0.3 percent rate in the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department reported that consumer spending,
which represents two-thirds of the nation's economy activity,
increased at a 3.4 percent rate in the second quarter, unchanged
from last month's report.
</P>
<P>
Despite rising mortgage rates, strong consumer demand drove
residential housing up at a 16.3 percent rate during the
April-June quarter rather than the 15.9 percent pace estimated
last month.
</P>
<P>
Inventories, which accounted for much of the second quarter
growth, added 10.1 billion to the GDP, down slightly from last
month's estimate.
</P>
<P>
Government spending grew at a 7.7 percent rate, up from just
1.6 percent in the previous quarter but less than the 8.2 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
And business investments, which had been a major source of
strength during the current expansion, slowed to a 3.8 percent
growth rate from 11.6 percent in the first quarter. It was even
weaker than the 4 percent earlier estimate.
</P>
<P>
The GDP report showed little sign of rising inflation. An index
measuring prices rose just 2.1 percent, compared to 2.3 percent in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the report said U.S. corporations saw their after-tax
profits slip 0.2 percent or 700 million dollars, the first decline
since a 0.5 percent drop in the second quarter of 1995. Profits
had grown 6 percent or 23.3 billion dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve believes that the U.S. economy will
slow down in the second half of this year and decided on Tuesday
to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.

<HEADLINE> UN Prepares New Aid Program To Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on Friday
announced a new aid program to meet the most essential needs of
the vulnerable Iraqis for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
The program, the UN Inter-Agency Assistance Program to Iraq,
was prepared by the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) in
cooperation with UN humanitarian agencies.
</P>
<P>
The new UN program detailed the emergency requirements for
assistance until a possible implementation of the UN Resolution
986, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of petroleum for
humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
The program will target the basic needs of the Iraqi people in
the priority sectors of food, health, nutrition, water and
sanitation, as well as other essential services to facilitate the
resettlement of the displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The DHA noted that the majority of the civilian population of
Iraq was believed to be living below the poverty line, with family
incomes currently only a fraction of pre-1991 levels.
</P>
<P>
"The cumulative effects of economic sanctions, hyper-inflation,
unemployment and a 30 percent drop in crop production this year
have led to a disquieting level of hardship now suffered by
vulnerable groups in Iraq," the DHA said.
</P>
<P>
Non-replenishment of basic food and health items in the
marketplace has resulted in price increases of 50 to 100 percent
during the period between late August and early September 1996.
</P>
<P>
Recent conflicts in northern Iraq have further aggravated the
humanitarian situation in the country, where some 20,000 people
have been displaced and an additional 39,000 forced to seek
refugee in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, contributions to essential humanitarian efforts in
Iraq has sharply declined this year with only 12 million dollars
pledged or received by the UN.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Surgeon to Return to Russia for Yeltsin's Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Prominent U.S. heart surgeon
Michael DeBakey said here today that he plans to return to Moscow
in 6-10 weeks when Russian President Boris Yeltsin is scheduled to
undergo a heart bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
The doctor who participated in a medical consultation on
Yeltsin's coming operation is to fly back to the United States
later this evening.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, DeBakey told reporters that he did not
think the change in the date of the operation a delay related to
Yeltsin's condition.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the time was necessary to prepare for the
operation, confirming that Yeltsin had signs of ischemia that will
be removed by the operation.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said bypass operations have been conducted for 32
years, given good results and promised a long, active life to the
overwhelming majority of patients. Yeltsin will need a period of
convalescence ranging from six weeks to two months after the
operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing
in the Kremlin today that the President's entourage and physicians
have in the recent weeks embarked on a certain working schedule
regarding the patient's preparation for the operation.
</P>
<P>
The President will spend an average two or three hours a day
working with documents, the spokesman said, adding that there is
no definite schedule for working meetings with him. However, he
went to say, "some meetings will be appointed when necessary."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the presidential administration is
currently maintaining rather effective contacts with Yeltsin, and
the president will remain at the Central Clinical Hospital in the
near future.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Urged to Promote Research of Agro-Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
called on Chinese scientists to strengthen agro-science research
in a bid to speed up agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member
of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said today at the
closing session of National Spark Program Conference that
agro-science research is the basis for agricultural development,
while the promotion of suitable technology in rural areas is the
key to agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rapid agricultural development could not be
achieved without major breakthroughs in agro-science research and
development of new and hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
Wen asked scientists to solve major problems for agricultural
production, such as development of quality seeds and prevention of
plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the promotion of suitable farming technology
and application of computers, remote-sensing technology in farming
and providing farmers with modern equipment.
</P>
<P>
Another major task for scientists, he said, is to spread
science and technology among farmers.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the government-initiated Spark Program, which is
China's first plan to encourage economic development in rural areas
with the help of science and technology starting 10 years ago, he
said it is a good program for encouraging agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission, said that changing the agricultural and rural economic
development mode, promoting rural economy with the help of science
and technology and improving the quality of farmers is a very
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
He called for industrialization of agriculture development,
promoting a moderately-scaled rural economy, and establishing a
number of technical-upgrading projects in rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the three-day conference reviewed the
experiences of the 10-year program and drafted a detailed
development plan for the next five years.

<HEADLINE> China To Eradicate Neonatal Tetanus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China is confident about its
ability to wipe out neonatal tetanus (NTT), and is expanding
planned immunization (EPI) across the country, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Longde, vice-minister of Health, said that the incidence
of NTT was 0.72 per thousand nationwide, which was in line with
the requirement set by the Manila Consensus, adopted by the 1993
Ministerial Consultation for the East Asia and Pacific Region, and
containing 12 mid-term goals for child development in each country
of the region.
</P>
<P>
"All provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions should
reach the goal, which is to eradicate NTT in 1995," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He said that 542 counties from eight provinces and autonomous
regions failed to drop the incidence of NTT to less than one per
thousand.
</P>
<P>
These provinces and autonomous regions, such as southwest
China's Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, northwest China's Gansu
province, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, are remote and economically-backward areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in the next five years, focus will be on these
provinces and autonomous regions, promoting new techniques for
delivering babies, and training more obstetricians for local
people.
</P>
<P>
Women in these areas of child-bearing age, from 18 to 35, who
are at high risk for tetanus, will be vaccinated with tetanus
toxoid (TT) to promote prevention of neonatal tetanus.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that given guarantees of enough human and financial
resources, he was confident that the 542 counties would soon drop
the incidence rate to less than one per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Regarding children's immunization, Wang said that China has
readjusted its policy, as the migrant population has continued to
increase.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of immunization is not a problem now in China," Wang
said. "The real problem is that students at medical schools rarely
have the opportunity to treat a patient with measles."

HONG KONG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Hong

After meeting ambassadors of five Arab countries in Pretoria,
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad told reporters: ''we urgently

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Optimistic Over Sino-US Trade Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing said here today that the prospects for Sino-US trade and
economic cooperation look good, as long as the two sides reduce
troubles and disputes and enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement this afternoon during a meeting with a
delegation of the Commission on United States-Pacific Trade and
Investment Policy, headed by its Vice-Chairman Clyde Prestowitz.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said many opportunities for Sino-US trade and
economic development have been lost, due to the US's yearly review
of China's Most Favorite Nation status, obstacles caused by trade
controversy, including the intellectual property rights issue, and
the US's unilateral trade restrictions imposed on China.
</P>
<P>
The combination of these factors has left China dissatisfied
with the current state of Sino-US trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the two countries have the potential to help each
other: China needs advanced technology, equipment and foreign
investment to develop its economy, and the US has gifted
entrepreneurs who can benefit from becoming cooperation partners
with China.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the two governments will create better conditions
for trade and economic cooperation between entrepreneurs of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Li also hopes Prestowitz's current visit to China will help
advance Sino-US relations, especially trade relations, in a more
positive direction.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views on different methods of compiling
statistics concerning the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Prestowitz, also head of the Economic Strategy Institute,
recognized the different views held by the two countries on many
issues, adding that such differences should not influence
bilateral trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should not dwell on the current
friction, "but let it pass and look to the future, while searching
for practical ways to improve US-China relations."
</P>
<P>
The US guests also listened to Li's plan for China's future
economic development. The two sides then discussed the potential
and areas for trade cooperation between China and the US.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinians Killed, 50 Wounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- At least two Palestinians
were killed and 50 others wounded as violence erupted in the
Temple Mount area in East Jerusalem after the noon prayer,
Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to rise as the clashes are still
continuing. Earlier reports by Israel Radio confirmed that one
Palestinian was killed, and five policemen were wounded in the
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police fired live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear
gas at thousands of stone-throwing Palestinian protesters in the
area, Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that many wounded Palestinians were carried away
by their fellows to nearby hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
A prayer leader told thousands of worshipers at Al-Aqsa mosque
in East Jerusalem that they must unite and protect the holy shrine.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reacted angrily to reports of
the Al-Aqsa confrontation, saying that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was going against assurances he made Thursday
night that "we have to cool the situation in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, Arafat rebuffed Netanyahu's request for an
immediate meeting, saying that there was no point in holding talks
unless the Israeli leader came with concrete proposals on how to
fulfill the promises Israel made in the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, but no time has been set
for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police have evacuated all Jewish worshipers
from the Western Wall, which is located just under the Temple
Mount.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani told Israel Television that the situation was under
police control, but the sources said the clashes were apparently
continuing as Palestinian stone-throwers still confronted with the
large crowd of the armed Israeli policemen.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has anticipated the violence in
East Jerusalem following two days of bloody clashes that have so far
left about 70 people dead and more than 1,000 wounded in the West
Bank and Gaza. More than 3,500 Israeli policemen have been deployed
in the area around the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The recent clashes were triggered by Israel's opening of a
controversial archaeological underground tunnel under the premises
of the Temple Mount, the third holiest place for Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accused Israel of opening the tunnel as a plot
to undermine the Moslem holy places.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Defense
Ministry plans to make 1997 a defense industrialization year for
the Malaysian Armed Forces to give special attention to the
development of the defense industry in line with the economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The move is also aimed at exposing people and private sector to
the defense industry so that they could participate in it in the
interest of the nation, Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said
today.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be only a purchaser of defense equipment and
weapons, we should become a producer of these items," he was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.

BRUSSELS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU),
through its executive body -- the European Commission (EC), today
welcomed a United Nations' initiative to deny 20 Rwandan citizens
refugee status, said a press release today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) refused to
grant the 20 Rwandans refugee status because they were indicted by
the ad hoc International Tribunal in connection with the 1994
genocide, said the press release.

<P>
"It is a step in the right direction," said Emma Bonino, EU
commissioner for humanitarian affairs, adding that humanitarian
principles and considerations cannot be seen as standing in the
way of international justice.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to Hong
Kong reached 5.4 million from January to June this year, posting
good growth of 15 percent over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>

percent to 1.2 million. Visitors from China totaled 1.1 million,

Pacific also saw double-digit growth, thanks to good summer
packages offered by travel agents.
</P>

The Taiwan market showed a decrease of 14 percent to 720,000
during the six-month period, mainly due to competition from Macao

<HEADLINE> China Reports on Child Development in Mid-1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Ongoing efforts of the
Chinese government in the area of children's development have
improved the basic conditions of children in China, according to
Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary-general of the State Council, who
introduced a report on "China's Child Development in the
Mid-1990s" here today.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that most of the indicators used to determine the
situation of Chinese children have reached or surpassed the
requirements set forth in the Manila Consensus, adopted by the
1993 Ministerial Consultation for the East Asia and Pacific
Region.
</P>
<P>
The document outlines 12 mid-term goals for child development
in each country of the region.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that in 1995, the mortality rate of infants was 36.4
per thousand, and that of children under five was 44.5 per
thousand, representing an average decline of 27 percent from that
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the moderate and severe malnutrition rate for
children under five was 15.8 percent, a drop of more than 20
percent compared with the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of Extended Program of Immunization (EPI) has
helped lower the rate of vaccine-preventable diseases
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the incidence and mortality rates of measles dropped
by 98.1 percent and 99 percent, compared with 1978, when EPI was
not carried out. And the incidence and mortality of whooping cough
and diphtheria lowered by more than 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of December 1995, no cases of polio were reported
nationwide for 15 successive months.
</P>
<P>
The coverage rate of safe drinking water reached 68.6 percent,
and that of sanitary public toilets hit 20.5 percent, slightly
higher than the mid-decade target.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 98.5 percent of all school-aged children across the
country had been enrolled in primary schools, exceeding the
mid-decade goal by 1.3 percentage points. The enrollment rate of
female children was 98.2 percent. The gap between enrollment rates
of male and female children was 0.66 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The enrollment rate of school-age disabled children has
increased to about 60 percent from the 20 percent reported in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, China mapped out the National Program of Action for
Child Development in China in the 1990s, in an effort to carry out
the principles adopted by the 1990 World Summit on Children.
</P>
<P>
The report made public today was based on analyses of China's
child development by relevant ministries and departments.
</P>
<P>
The report will be submitted to the United Nations Children's
Fund, to be included in a comprehensive global report on child
development by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

<HEADLINE> Situation Calms Down in Kabul, ICRC Resumes Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Situation has calmed down in
Afghan capital of Kabul and the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) will soon restore its humanitarian activities to the
war-torn country, said an ICRC official here today.
</P>
<P>
After receiving assurance from Taleban rebels earlier today,
who captured Kabul following two days' fightings outside the
capital with the government forces, a convoy of about 300 tons of
relief food will be transported to Kabul from Pakistan Sunday,
ICRC representative for Asia Jean-Michel Monoe told reporters.
</P>
<P>
ICRC expects a Taleban permission as soon as possible to resume
its flights to Kabul as hospitals in the city are at the moment
full of casualties mainly caused by the fightings, he said, but
the exact number of casualties is not yet available.
</P>
<P>
ICRC has huge stocks of medical supplies to last the capital
about six months and re-opening of the Kabul airport is one of the
top priorities to bring in whatever needed, Monoe said.
</P>
<P>
Several thousands of people fled Kabul on Thursday afternoon
in apparent fear of spreading of the fighting into the city, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Before the fightings, about 25 percent of an estimated one
million population in Kabul had been regularly receiving ICRC
assistances, added the ICRC official.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej
this evening issued a royal decree through local television
declaring dissolution of the House of Representatives with the
general elections to be held on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Government House after
the royal decree was announced, Banharn said that last Saturday he
announced he would resign within seven days to pave the way for
nomination of new prime minister, but this process could not go on
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
If this situation were to continue, it would be harmful to the
country, so he decided to dissolve the lower house, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Nam Thai (Thai leadership) party
leader Amnuay Virawan also told reporters that Banharn's abrupt
decision to dismiss the lower house demonstrated that the six
coalition parties failed to reach consensus on the choice of new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier after a meeting with the other five coalition party
leaders this afternoon, Banharn reportedly said that his coalition
partners' decision to nominate New Aspiration Party leader
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh as new prime minister had not been brought
up to him.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today praised the achievements of "Spark Program," which was
launched in 1986 to popularize agricultural technology in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting this afternoon with delegates attending a
national conference on the program, Jiang said its success proves
that Deng Xiaoping's theory that science and technology is the
primary productive force is accurate and wise.
</P>
<P>
And science and technology, when mastered by the masses, will
produce endless power and become the impetus to push forward
economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng and senior officials Jiang Chunyun, Wen Jiabao
and Song Jian also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the program as being a great invention made by
the country's science and technology circle, and also a great tool
to help farmers overcome superstition and poverty and march toward
prosperity by relying on science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is China's largest industry, therefore the situation
in the farm sector will directly affect the stability of the whole
economic and social situation, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng also spoke to the delegates, saying the program
has played a decisive role in the changes in the countryside in
the past 10 years, and has accelerated the development of
agriculture and also that of industrial enterprises based in these
regions.
</P>
<P>
"The entire world is concerned about China's ability to feed
its people, and we will give a definite answer based on facts,"
the premier said. He expressed the hope that the further
implementation of the program will make a greater contribution to
the country's economic development, especially the development of
the rural economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today blasted Israel for digging a tunnel
under Al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Iranian president noted that the digging of
the tunnel "is a clear proof that the Israelis are not for
peace."
</P>
<P>
"As long as time-bombs continue to tick in Palestine, any
attempt for peace is an exercise in futility," he said in
his Friday sermons at Tehran University campus.
</P>
<P>
He said that digging a tunnel under the Al-Aqsa mosque, the
third holiest place Moslems across the world, is "a provocative
act against the sanctities of Islam."
</P>
<P>
"It is an indication of the fact that the Israeli leaders
are liars and do not want peace," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that it was clear from the start of the
so-called peace process that a powerful time-bomb lurked
around the corner and would explode at the right time.
</P>
<P>
"Islamic Iran had warned from the outset of the
negotiations that so long as the issue of four million
Palestinian refugees was not solved, peace, in its real sense,
could never be materialized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the U.S. silence over the Israeli actions, the
Iranian president said that "it was surprising that the
Americans, who regard our criticism as detrimental to peace, do
not put pressure on the Israeli regime."

<HEADLINE> Military Leader Leads in Gambia's Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Military leader Colonel
Yahya Jammeh took a lead in Gambia's presidential election held
on Thursday, according to more than half of the official poll
results reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The West African country's Electoral Commission said returns
from 28 of 45 constituencies put 31-year-old Jammeh ahead with
76,790 votes and his major civilian rival, 48-year-old Lawyer
Ousainou Darboe, with 58,356.
</P>
<P>
Another two civilian candidates polled 9,905 and 3,125 votes
respectively. Full results are expected later today, poll
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh, coming from the minority Jola ethnic group which
accounts for only 10 percent of the tiny nation's one million
population, had received military training in the United States
before he seized power in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
He then retired from the army in August 1996 to contest the
civilian presidency.
</P>
<P>
And Darboe, coming from the majority Mandinka ethnic group of
ousted President Dawda Jawara which accounts for 40 percent of
the population, has drawn support from Jawara's followers.
</P>
<P>
A former British colony, Gambia runs inland from the Atlantic
along a river from which it takes its name. The largely Moslem
nation, surrounded by French-speaking Senegal, traditionally
depends on tourism, farming and aid to keep its economy afloat.
</P>
<P>
Western donors condemned the 1994 coup and pressed Jammeh to
speed up the transition to civilian rule. Jammeh's military
government lifted a two-year ban on politics on August 14 to
prepare for the general elections.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Launches Polio Immunization Campaign in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has launched a immunization campaign against polio
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as part of an effort to
eliminate this wild virus in the entire Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman of the UNICEF told reporters today that the
campaign, which first takes place on September 27-29, will cover
over 450,000 children aged 5 or under in Kosovo and Metohija, and
a second round will take place in six weeks, from November 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
Following an outbreak of polio in neighboring Albania this
year, six cases of acute flaccid paralysis have been reported in
the border areas of Kosovo and Metohija, with preliminary
laboratory results indicating polio as the cause.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF, altogether 27 cases of polio have occurred
in Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995, an average of five a year.
However, this year has already seen 11 cases in the country,
representing a 100 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The immunization campaign was co-sponsored by the UNICEF
together with the World Health Organization, the Rotary
International and the Mother Theresa Association.

LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Lennox lewis set to
meet American Olyver McCall for the vacant World Boxing Council
heavyweight title before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Promoter Don King's purse bid of around 9 milloin U.S. dollars
comfortably beat off the other promoters at the World Boxing
Council's headquarters in Mexico City Friday night, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, on hold for 16 months while former rival Frank Bruno and
then Mike Tyson claimed the WBC championship, will bank close to
that figure for his revenge vacant title mission against his only
previous conqueror before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
King's lost control of the WBC title when Mike Tyson
relinquished it earlier this week, and the size of his cash
commitment indicates his desire to keep the green and gold belt in
his own camp.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Decides to Dissolve Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa has decided to dissolve the House of Representatives,
according to coalition government party leaders.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the six coalition government parties met this
afternoon at the Government House to consult on who would succeed
Banharn only to be told by Banharn that he had decided to dissolve
parliament, Social Action Party leader Montri Pongpanich and
Prachakorn Thai (Thai citizen) party leader Samak Sundaravej told
reporters waiting at the Government House.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as leaders of the six coalition government
parties had been unable to agree on who would succeed Prime
Minister Banharn, who announced last Saturday minutes before a
censure vote in the Lower House that he would resign within a
week, in exchange for support from the coalition parties in the
vote.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days, key executives of Banharn's Chart
Thai (Thai nation) party insisted that the new prime minister
would come from their own party, the largest party in the 391-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, except for the Prachakorn Thai party, all four other
coalition parties were in favor of Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh becoming new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit is the leader of the New Aspiration Party, which, with
57 seats, was the second largest party in the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Banharn's government came to office on July 18 last year
following a general election victory on July 2.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: It Turns Out Not to Be Storm in Teacup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu at last decided to cut short his three-nation
European tour and rushed back to grapple with the disaster at
home.
</P>
<P>
Two days of bloody conflicts between Israeli troops and
Palestinian protesters left 69 Palestinians dead and over 1,000
wounded, according to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, a total of 11 soldiers were killed in
exchange of gun-fire with Palestinian policemen and dozens
wounded. The tragedy is bringing the peace process to the brink
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the decision in Bonn Thursday. But in Paris he
outright rejected such an idea. He might have thought that
business would be as usual after one or two days of minor
disturbances in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
He was not alone to think so. Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani told reporters that everything would be all right
next day. He made the prediction when he toured the Western Wall
and the tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem Wednesday. He had the
experience that no clashes happened at the end of last month
although the situation appeared to be explosive, as Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat furiously called for a general
strike and massive protest against the Israeli government's
decision to lift the ban on settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
The bloody event, the worst since the 1967 June 5 War, has
obviously stunned Israeli leaders and shaken the world. How
came the event? The opening of the tunnel only served as a
blasting fuse. But the root cause lies at an accumulation of
disappointment, frustration and indignation of the Palestinians
over the Israeli government's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
When the Oslo Accords were signed three years ago,
Palestinians cheered what they hoped would be a new beginning
for the Middle East and a better life for new generations. Three
years later, however, life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has
not changed much. Some would even say political, economic and
social life has deteriorated. Israel's occupation and arrogant
mentality have worsened with the formation of the rightwing Likud
government. The optimist of yesterday becomes today's pessimist.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has kept repeating the word "reciprocity" in every
public speech he has made when he talked about the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Recently in Washington,
Netanyahu said he was bound by the agreements the previous
Israeli government signed with the Palestinians. And again, He
repeated the word "reciprocity", in order to justify his
government's lack of movement in advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Recent developments have apparently driven Palestinians to
despair even farther:
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers in Hebron broke into and occupied
Palestinian-owned stores in the heart of the city which were
forced to close by the Israeli army after a horrible massacre on
February 25, 1994. When the legitimate owners of the stores came
to claim what is legally theirs, the Israeli army forcibly
prevented them, giving protection and cover to the settlers'
action. This came at a time when the Israeli army should have
pulled out of the city of Hebron according to the Oslo II
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Settlements are being gradually expanded, and new ones
being planned, even though the Oslo agreements explicitly ban
expansion or building of settlements until their status is
determined in the final stage talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian land in areas B and C is being confiscated on a
daily basis for building new bypass roads. Palestinians charge
that it is actually being expropriated to expand Jewish
settlements and to start new ones, and also to divide the
Palestinian territories into several enclaves to prevent the
creation of a viable Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
The army has continued acts of house demolition in areas B and
C of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gaza Airport is not allowed
to become operational. Free movement on the safe passage between
the West Bank and Gaza are barred. Army checkpoints are being
set up at the entrances and exits of every Palestinian city. The
character of Arab Jerusalem is being altered daily.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation to the Joint Steering Committee
talks specified at least 34 Israeli violations of the
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers last week banned Palestinians from using a
new road opened in the West Bank on expropriated Palestinian
property, saying that this road was opened for bona fide Israelis
only. Palestinians described the decision as abhorrent apartheid
and occupation metality.

BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A picture exhibition
reflecting the social activities of women's organizations in Hong
Kong and Macao opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the All-China Women's Federation and
more than 40 women's groups in Hong Kong and Macao to jointly hold
a picture exhibition in China's capital.
</P>
<P>
On display are more than 500 pictures that illustrate six

regions.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the ribbon at the opening ceremony were Chen Muhua,
president of the All-China Women's Federation, Wang Zhaoguo,

<HEADLINE> Minister of Construction on China's Housing Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China will build apartments
with a combined floor space of 1.2 billion square meters in the
coming five years, said Hou Jie, Minister of Construction today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that the task requires the building of
flats with an aggregate floor space of 240 million sq m each year.
</P>
<P>
He was outlining the country's progress in housing during an
broadcast speech on China Radio International.
</P>
<P>
This plan is made in accordance with the goal set out for
housing construction in the "Outline of the Ninth Five-Year-Plan
(1996-2000) for National Economic and Social Development and
Long-Term Goals for the Year 2010", which was adopted in March
this year at the four session of the Eighth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, by the year of 2000, per capita living space
for the country's urban residents should reach nine sq m and urban
families who still have a per capita living space below six sq m
will see their difficulties solved.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Central Government has always attached great
importance to solving housing problems for ordinary people, said
Hou.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou, China has witnessed tremendous progress in
housing construction since the founding of New China
on October 1, 1949, especially after the year of 1978, when the
country started to adopt reform measures and open to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
From 1950 to 1995, China invested a total of 1,000 billion yuan
on the building of flats in urban areas, and completed apartments
with a combined floor space of three billion sq m.
</P>
<P>
However, the contradiction between supply and demand is still
very acute, the minister went on.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994, there were still some four million urban
families where the per capita living space was below six sq m. A
half of the flats in the country's urban areas do not have
complete basic facilities, and even more houses still need to be
upgraded or rebuilt.

<HEADLINE> Minister of Construction on China's Housing Construction (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1986 the central government has adopted policies and
launched several nationwide housing projects to encourage the
building of more flats in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The most notable program is the "comfortable housing project"
which was launched last year.  The project's main purpose is to
build economic and practical apartments for working families with
low and moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
The project is carried out with the support of a certain amount
of money earmarked by the central finance and auxiliary funds
provided by local governments in local areas. The standard
flats built under this project will be sold to working families
with low and moderate incomes at cost prices.
</P>
<P>
The minister also believe that "comfortable housing project" is
closely related with China's housing reform.
</P>
<P>
"After the reform, two kinds of houses should be available for
supply: commodity houses for families with higher incomes, and
economic and practical flats for low and moderate income
families," said Hou, adding that "comfortable housing project"
will be conducive to promoting the reform in the country's housing
system, and enhancing the commercialization and socialization of
housing in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou, up to the end of this June, the central and
local governments at different levels have together invested 13.9
billion yuan for the "comfortable housing project", and have
completed 56 percent of the planned task.
</P>
<P>
In the later half of this year, the central government pumped
another five billion yuan into building more flats with a combined
floor space of 15 million sq m.
</P>
<P>
The country has been experimenting with the building of more
residential quarters in urban areas since 1990, with the purpose
of improving China's designing standards for housing and the
quality for building flats on an overall level.
</P>
<P>
By now 56 cities across the country have built 68 experimental
residential quarters, of which one third have been finished and
put into use.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that up to the end of 1995, per capita living space
in urban areas has reached eight sq m.
</P>
<P>
Housing systems in the country's rural areas is quite different
from that for urban areas. In China farmers have to build their
own houses.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1995, Chinese farmers built bungalows or
low-storyed houses with a combined floor space of some 10 billion
sq m, and the per capita living space for farmers is 22 sq m.

<HEADLINE> WWF Campaigns Against Abusive Huntings in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
has launched today a new campaign against abusive huntings in
France, where many rare species of animals are being killed.
</P>
<P>
Illegal huntings are increasing rapidly, according to a
statement by WWF, a non-governmental international organization of
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
From Sunday, the hunters will be able to pull their triggers in
nearly all the French territory except Sarthes, that will lift the
ban on October 6.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, game huntings in water began as early as July 20 in
14 localities that coincided with the peak period of reproduction
for fish, lamented WWF.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the French territory are ruled by the hunters
during the hunting season, said WWF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some French real estate property owners have
protested the hunting, because the hunters are protected by a law
which says that owners of less than 20 hectares of land do not
have the right to ban hunters from their properties.
</P>
<P>
This law, called Verdeille law, contradicts with the
non-hunting right recognized by the European Commission of Human
Rights which bans hunters from entering the properties of others.
</P>
<P>
The hunters have already caused serious environmental pollution
by leaving behind 8,000 tons of bullet lead on the ground each
year, WWF pointed out.

TOKYO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Costs for the 1998 Nagano
Winter Olympics could become larger while only three-quarters of
the sponsorship revenue has been met, according to chief organiser
Makoto Kobayashi.
</P>
<P>
Total operating costs for the Winter Games have already risen
from 690 million U.S. dollars to 859 million. And Kobayashi, the
director-general of the Nagano Olympic Organising Committee
(NAOC), said they could rise further.
</P>
<P>
He also said only 75 percent of the sponsorship revenue target
of 239 million U.S. dollars had been met.
</P>
<P>
Transportation could also be a problem with almost one-third
of the 68 events at the Game based near the resort village of
Hakuba, 50 kilometer west of Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi said facilities were almost complete and he did not
expect any problems with environmental issues or security.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinians Killed, 50 Others Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- At least two Palestinians
were killed and 50 others wounded as violence erupted in the
Temple Mount area in east Jerusalem after the noon prayer,
Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to rise as the clashes are still
unfolding. Earlier reports by Israel Radio confirmed that one
Palestinian was killed, and five policemen were wounded in the
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police fired live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear
gas at thousands of stone-throwing Palestinian protesters in the
area, Palestinian sources said. Witnesses said that many wounded
Palestinians were carried away by their fellows to nearby
hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police have evacuated all Jewish worshipers
from the Western Wall just under the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani earlier told Israel
Television that the situation was under police control, but the
sources said the clashes were apparently continuing as
Palestinian stone-throwers still confronted with the large crowd of
the armed Israeli policemen.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has already anticipated the violence in
east Jerusalem after two days of bloody clashes that have so far
killed about 70 people and wounded over 1,000 others in the
territories. More than 3,500 Israeli policemen have been deployed
in the area around the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
The recent clashes were triggered by Israel's opening of a
controversial archaeological underground tunnel under the premises
of the Temple Mount, the third holiest place for Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accused Israel of opening the tunnel as a plot
to undermine the Moslem holy places.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Since Shimon Peres's defeat in election in May, people have
neglected the fact that Palestinians and Israelis have been living
in a state of "no war and no peace" and of "with and without" the
peace process which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
more or less explicitly tried to sabotage.
</P>
<P>
But today one can no longer turn a blind eye to the bloodbath,
cynically provoked by the same Netanyahu, in which 60 people have
been killed in the fightings on Palestinian territories in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official said that the Palestinian police were
ordered to shoot only in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
-- By calling Israel's opening of a tunnel beside an Islamic
holy site in east Jerusalem a crime, and appealing for a general
strike and demonstrations by Palestinians, PLO leader Yasser
Arafat has once again engaged in an arm wrestling with the Hebrew
state. Facing a quasi-war, he is still looking for a political
solution before the situation completely gets out of control.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Security Services and the Israeli Defense Ministry
had warned Netanyahu of the consequences of opening a tunnel
beside an Islamic holy site in Jerusalem, but the Israeli prime
minister shrugged off the warning and signed the order to open the
tunnel on the eve of the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur before he
made his Europe tour, which he suspended due to escalating
violence at home.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Bloody riots, exchange of fires of automatic weapons and
scenes of a war have engulfed the whole Palestinian autonomous
territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip on the second day of
confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
demonstrators. Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has
declared a state of emergency and a total blockade of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
At a security meeting on Thursday, Netanyahu refused to close
the tunnel opened on Tuesday beside an Islamic holy site in
Jerusalem, which has triggered the eruption of Palestinian anger.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton has urged both sides to
take positive measures to end the riots, while France has urged
Netanyahu and Arafat to meet immediately to build a just and
lasting peace.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's retail prices for
commodities and services in September rose by 0.3 percent compared
with that in August, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The General Department of Statistics said the inflation rate in
September was estimated at 2.5 percent as compared with the 2.2
percent recorded in August.
</P>
<P>
Service costs in September recorded 0.4 percent rise and
non-food commodities 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was the first rise, though very slight, after four
consecutive months of price decline which began in May.
</P>
<P>
The price rise in September was mainly due to the price hike of
electricity and water which recorded 3.2 percent rise, and of fuel
at 1.9 percent rise.

PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed people
in France rose by 39,500 or 1.3 percent of the workforce, compared
with those of July, according to the statistics published by the

</P>
<P>
The increased number has brought the unemployed to a total of
3,085,100.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the jobless followed a 0.7 percent drop in July,
which was mostly attributed to summer jobs and training courses in
summer, which removed the unemployment figures temporarily.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry said that in all groups, men were worse hit
by unemployment than women in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of unemployed people in August went up by
2.8 percent as is compared with that of the same month last year,
said the National Agency for Employment.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who entered job market in August was

<HEADLINE> China Works out Regulations on Police Enrollment, Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China announced today two
regulations to strengthen the enrollment and dismissal of police.
</P>
<P>
The two regulations, issued jointly by the Ministry of Public
Security (MPS) and the Ministry of Personnel, are aimed at raising
the overall quality of the police force, said Zhu Chunlin, an
official with MPS.
</P>
<P>
The regulations were formulated in accordance with the Police
Law and Provisional Regulations on Government Civil Servants. They
are significant for personnel reform in public security
departments, and will help raise the operational capacity of the
police force, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people of poor quality and not suitable for public
security work have been admitted, and they have seriously affected
the image of public security departments and people's police," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, people unsuitable or unqualified to be a police can
not be removed quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Regulation on Police Enrollment includes qualifications for
applying to be a police officer, the contents of examinations and
related approving procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Regulation on Police Dismissal offers detailed articles on
approving procedures in police dismissal, unemployment insurance
for those being dismissed, and the right for dismissed police to
file appeals.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent the overuse of powers of dismissal, public
security departments will be supervised by governments at their
level, or public security departments of higher levels.
</P>
<P>
The two regulations go into effect beginning today.

<HEADLINE> Qatari, Israeli FMs Meeting canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Qatari government has
decided to cancel a scheduled meeting between Qatari Foreign
Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, an official from the Qatari Foreign Ministry in
Doha announced today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today from the Qatari
capital, the meeting, requested by the Israeli side, was to take
place on the fringes of the current 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In a report carried today by the Qatari news agency, the
official expressed Qatar's strong denunciation of the "bloody
incidents" in the territories under the Palestinian National
Authority, in the wake of the opening of a tunnel by Israel near
the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site.
</P>
<P>
He said the tunnel would threaten the safety of the Mosque as
well as the foundations of old Islamic buildings above the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "this infamous action constituted a
violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and threatened to
dynamite the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
The official said that Qatar has appealed to all
countries of the world to denounce the Israeli government's act and
to put an end to such irresponsible practices that may plunge the
area into an atmosphere of tension.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Tani made a telephone
call Thursday evening to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat,
expressing Qatar's condemnation of the current "regrettable"
incidents in Jerusalem and other Palestinian territories.

LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Farmers in England have just had their most profitable year,
thanks to high produce prices, world shortages and EU aid
payments. Average net income rose by 29 percent to a record 363
pounds (545 U.S. dollars) a hectare. But this year plummeting
wheat and potato prices and a slump in beef sales will hit profits.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Public sector workers in Britain are not falling behind
private sector employees despite the government's continuing
public sector wage bill freeze and trade union claims to the
contrary, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared to
be trying to back away from the brink of war with the Palestinians
Thursday night by seeking an urgent meeting with their leader,
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The backlog in culling cattle to eliminate BES from the
national herd is worse than expected, the British Government
admitted Thursday. But Rogr Freeman, the Chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster, said steps were being taken to prevent a heavy
burden on farmers.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves Loan to Indonesia for Health Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) approved here today a 45-million-U.S.-dollar loan to
Indonesia for a family health and nutrition project, which is to
benefit some 122,000 families in remote and less developed areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the families, with the support of their
community and local health care providers, will be trained to
identify their health and nutritional problems and learn to choose
appropriate solutions.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that this will help improve and sustain their
health and nutritional status and enable them to participate fully
in the social and economic development of their regions.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two decades, Indonesia has achieved progress in
improving the health of its population.
</P>
<P>
However, several key health indicators, such as the infant
mortality rate, the death rate of children under five years old
and life expectancy at birth, remain unsatisfactory as compared to
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Decade-long Hi-tech Program Bears Fruit (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"So far, China has applied the technique to 173 million ha of
field and acquired an yield increase of 260 billion kg," said Hou
Yunde, a chief scientist of the China National Expert Committee
for Bio-technology Development in Program 863.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have successfully improved some crops via
plant genetic engineering and cultivated agronomically important
traits such as insect resistance, disease resistance, stress
tolerance and higher nutritional quality, said Jia Shirong, a
leading scientist in the field of bio-technology.
</P>
<P>
"We have bred new varieties of wheat which can resist yellow
dwarf and powdery mildew viruses," he said. "Meanwhile, we are
planting on a trial basis a strain of wheat to which we have
transferred genes resistible to wheat scab."
</P>
<P>
Insect attack is a major problem in crop cultivation. In
1991-93 the yield losses due to cotton bollworm in China amounted
to nearly ten billion yuan. "Now we have bred transgenic cotton
which is resistant to bollworm," Jia said. Particularly suitable
to the environment of the Yangtze River Valley and North China,
the country's major area for cotton growth, the bollworm-resistant
cotton has developed to the third generation and shown a radical
insecticidal rate of over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement in the bio-technological field of Program
863 is a series of special pharmaceuticals developed over the past
decade, according to Hou.
</P>
<P>
Hou and his colleagues have developed a genetic vaccine of
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Compared with the former plasma-derived
vaccine, the new vaccine is "cheaper but more effective and
safer," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, he said, seven new medicines and vaccines developed
under Program 863 have been put on the market; 17 items under
biological preparations will soon finish clinical trial use and
come into the market, and 50 others are at the stage of laboratory
research.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this century," Hou said, "the annual output
value of those hi-tech pharmaceuticals will reach five billion
yuan."
</P>
<P>
Two other rising industries -- information and new material
hi-tech industries -- also benefit from the country's hi-tech
program. Supported by the research achievements of Program 863
workers, a number of information hi-tech enterprises have been set
up in China and are getting internationally competitive, said Zhu
Lilan.
</P>
<P>
One of them is the Dawning Information Industry Corporation
Ltd., founded in 1995 to industrialize Dawning series computer
systems developed by the National Research Center for Intelligent
Computing Systems (NCIC) as key projects of Program 863. Its
revenue in 1996 is expected to reach 150 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The total import of computers, mostly high performance ones,
in 1995 was over 2.75 billion US dollars," Zhu Lilan said. "The
success of Dawning-1 and Dawning-1000 has built a sound foundation
for China to manufacture high performance computers with our own
property right."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new hi-tech material industry has emerged in an
embryonic form, Zhu lilan said.

<HEADLINE> China Trying Harder in Eradicating Poverty (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China has redoubled its
efforts to wipe out poverty across the country over the past few
years and the efforts have been a success.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, China has succeeded in lifting 15
million among its total poor population of 80 million out of
poverty, a remarable achievement when the global impoverished
population keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
For rural households, the current poverty line is set at an
annual per capita net income of no more than 500 yuan (some 60
U.S. dollars), less than one third of the national rural average
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Back to 1994, when the country's poor population numbered 80
million, the State Council, the highest governing body, drafted
the "Project 87 Against the Citadel of Poverty" -- to get the last
80 million impoverished people in our country out of poverty by
and large within around seven years, starting from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Now to eliminate poverty for the remaining 65 million Chinese
living below the poverty line before the end of the century proves
to be a formidable challenge, although they account for a mere 7.1
percent of China total rural population.
</P>
<P>
"That means that we must lift 13 million people out poverty
annually, almost three times the figure we have managed to reach
in the past few years," said Liu Junwen, an official with the
Office of the Leading Group of Economic Development in Poor Areas
under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"But the poverty in which these 65 million people are living
constitutes the hardest nut to crack due to various deep-rooted
geographical and socio-economical adversities," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few of them live in karst regions in southwestern
China, featuring barren stone mountains denying the growth of any
crops. In Guizhou alone, more than 70 percent of the province's
total area is petrified with little soil left.
</P>
<P>
Other poor regions fall into the types of arid land, loess
plateau carved by big ravines, deep mountainous areas, and
desertized, and bleak highland at such an altitude that sheer
survival itself is regarded as a miracle.
</P>
<P>
Adverse ecological conditions and frequent natural disasters
have reduced people in these areas into extreme poverty and
handicapped their social and economic development. Mostly out of
easy reach of industrial and commercial hubs, these poor regions
are distant from modernization.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these difficulties, the Chinese government is
"determined" to fulfil the target of Project 87. "The whole party
and the entire nation are mobilized into the anti-poverty drive,"
said Liu.

<HEADLINE> China Trying Harder in Eradicating Poverty (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to fulfill the target set out in the Project 87, the
central government's annual input into the poverty-elimination
program has risen from 3.2 billion yuan in 1985 to more than 10
billion yuan this year, while local governments' input has also
grown accordingly, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The funds has been used to improve infrastructure and
communications facilities of the poor regions, while the emphasis
is aimed to enable people in poor reions to get developed mainly
through their own efforts, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 122 central government departments and institutions
have involved themselves in Project 87 by contracting to help 330
state-designated impoverished counties to get rid of poverty. In
1995, they introduced a total investment of 990 million yuan and
821 development projects to these areas, while running training
courses for a total of 49,000 local officials and farmers.
</P>
<P>
This year, nine developed provinces or municipalities have
contracted to help nine underdeveloped provinces in pairs, and
four rich coastal cities are joining efforts in supporting one
other poor inland province to eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
While development projects are launched with fund, information
and new technology flowing to poor regions in such a pattern of
help, there are also personnel exchanges with officials from
developed areas to take corresponding leading positions in poor
areas, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Many non-governmental organizations have joined in the
anti-poverty drive in their own way. China Population Welfare
foundation and China Family Planning Association, for instance,
have jointly put forward a "Program of Happiness" specifically to
fund poor mothers in their development projects.
</P>
<P>
With the "happiness" loans of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan to each,
village women in Longshan County of central-south China's Hunan
Province would plant fruit trees, improve the soil to increase
production, buy and raise pigs, cows, sheep or chickens, or go in
for food processing businesses. They are expected to repay loans
with interest in one to three years, when they will be better off,
and the "happiness" loans will be extended to other mothers in
need.
</P>
<P>
Aid-to-the-poor activitiers vary in forms, Liu said. "But they
all follow the guidelines of eliminating poverty through
sustainable growth rather than relief," Liu noted, adding that
"Our emphasis is aimed to help impoverished people and poor areas
to become capable of self-development."

<HEADLINE> 450 Rebels killed, 300 wounded In Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, September 27 (Xinhua)-- More than 450 rebels were
killed and about 300 others injured in fighting with government
troops in the Kilinochchi District of Sri Lanka's Northern
Province on Thursday, according to a military spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that more than 1,000 Tamil rebels launched
two attacks on the government troops and that the government
troops fought back valiantly, repulsing the attackers.
</P>
<P>
However, some rebels managed to penetrate the government
troops' defenses, resulting in casualties among the troops.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also used a number of suicide bombers, who when
fired upon, exploded themselves in close proximity to the troops,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The troops during a search of the area have so far recovered
138 dead bodies of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, 75 army personnel including five
officers were also killed and 10 officers and 146 soldiers
injured, he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Calls for "U.N. For All Its Members" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has made a call
for a "U.N. for all its members" and spelt out Singapore's vision
for a "truly representative, effective and united United Nations"
at the 51st U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the U.N. General Assembly, which was
distributed here today, Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar
said big powers should work with small states to make the U.N. a
truly representative and effective body, noting that small states,
namely nations with population of 10 million or less, form 59
percent of the world body's membership today.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, a credible U.N. should not be
regarded as a mere tool of its largest members, Jayakumar said,
stressing the need for reforms to work out a new relationship
between the Security Council and the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The sad truth is that today the U.N. plays little or no
practical role in the management of the most important political,
strategic and economic questions of our time," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said a "U.N. for all its members" would include an
expanded U.N. Security Council, greater participation in Security
Council procedures by non-council members in informal
consultations on questions affecting them and a greater say in
U.N. spending for the majority of states that support its budgets.
</P>
<P>
On Security Council reform, he said discussions have shown a
wide consensus that increase in permanent membership by only
industrialized countries would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"We support the expansion of the Security Council by up to five
new permanent members as part of a comprehensive package that
would, among other things, include the consequent adjustment of
non-permanent membership to maintain a balanced ratio," he said.

<HEADLINE> Decade-long Hi-tech Program Bears Fruit (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Program 863 workers chose to develop a number of products
highly needed in the national economic construction over which
China claims advantages.
</P>
<P>
"The choice proves to be a wise one," said Shi Likai, chief
scientist of the China National Expert Committee for New Material
Development in Program 863. "It has promoted the forming of
China's new hi-tech material industry."
</P>
<P>
Nickel-hydric battery, a new generation of green energy, has
been a focus of international competition. Program 863 scientists
surmounted key technical problems, and China now is capable of
producing 50 million AA type nickel-hydric batteries a year. The
capacity will be further enhanced to 200 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China used to rely on the import for high performance
multi-layer capacitors (MIC) with low sintering
temperature. Program 863 workers managed to crack the hard nut and
are manufacturing them in two enterprises: the Zhaoqing Fenghua
Electronic Factory in Guangdong and the Chengdu Hongming
Electronic Components Factory in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Diamond holds out a promising prospect of application to realms
like electronics, optics, acoustics and mechanics. Owing to the
limited resources of natural diamond, development of artificial
diamond film arrests the world's attention. Shi and his colleagues
have developed several kinds of preparation technology. And
enterprises manufacturing diamond film have been set up in Beijing
and Jinzhou, in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Zhu said that Program 863 has exerted profound
influence over China's science and technology development and
science system reforms.
</P>
<P>
"While molecular biology, which used to be a blank spot in
China, has been developed remarkably these years, some biological
engineering operation which used to be deemed as the most advanced
technology in the world now turns into routine laboratory means,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
At the sam time, the Chinese scientists involved in the program
have established cooperative ties with their counterparts in more
than 20 countries while constructing a nationawide hi-tech
research and development network.
</P>
<P>
After all, Program 863 is "a long-range plan", said Wang
Deheng. "It takes a long time and Herculean labor before it can
show a spectacular effect on the national economy."
</P>
<P>
So far the progress has been satisfactory, he said, but "we
need to work harder and be prepared for a protracted warfare."

<HEADLINE> Qatar Condemns Israeli Opening of Tunnel under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al Thani Thursday evening described Israel's opening
of a tunnel near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest
shrine, as an "absolute disregard and challenge of Moslem
sentiments."
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
Thursday evening, the emir hoped that the Middle East peace
process would continue in accordance with principles of the
Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed the latest developments in
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted Wednesday and Thursday between Palestinian
protesters and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following Israel's decision earlier this week to open the
archaeological tunnel that runs near the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
So far, at least 44 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were
reportedly killed in the clashes, the worst since the signing of
a 1993 breakthrough peace accord that ended a six-year
Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Kabul International Airport to Reopen Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kabul International
Airport, which has been closed for almost one year, will reopen as
soon as technical difficulties are solved, said a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Airport is now in the hand of the Taliban Militia which
captured the whole city of Kabul early this morning.
</P>
<P>
An airport official was quoted as saying that there was no
obstacle to the reopening of the airport once technical problems
were solved and the Taliban permission was received.
</P>
<P>
The long-time closure of the airport was due to the Taliban
siege on Kabul since last October.
</P>
<P>
All the civilian and military planes owned by the Afghan former
government led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani had to use the
Bagram Airbase, 50 kilometers north of Kabul, since the airport
was in the range of the Taliban's rocket fire.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World's Second Largest Steelmaker  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China's iron and steel
industry has maintained robust growth ever since it replaced its
US counterpart as the world's second largest steel producer in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The country produced 94 million tons of steel in 1995, further
narrowing its gap with Japan, currently the world's largest
steelmaker with a reported steel output of 101.6 million tons last
year. In the same year, China's output of pig iron reached 101
million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to produce 110 to 120 million tons of steel by
the year 2000 and become the world's No. 1 steel producer in the
following 10 to 15 years," said Liu Qi, minister of metallurgical
industry.
</P>
<P>
When New China was founded in 1949, however, it was only able
to produce a meager 158,000 tons of steel and 250,000 tons of pig
iron a year.
</P>
<P>
This means that, in less than half a century, China's annual
output of pig iron has jumped by almost 400 times and its annual
steel output, by about 600 times.
</P>
<P>
The iron and steel sector has undergone a major breakthrough in
technological transformation.
</P>
<P>
By 1978, converters had replaced open hearths, a popular device
in the 1950s and 1960s, as the dominant steelmaking means. At
present, the steel-making capacity of converters in China is about
75 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the number of
electric furnaces for steel making. Thus far, China has 1,580
electric furnaces with a combined annual production capacity of 24
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Continuous casting, which can increase efficiency and save
energy, was used to produce 43.8 million tons of steel billets and
slabs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, continuous casting has a rate of 47 percent in
China's steel industry, the fourth highest in the world. In the
next five years, the rate is expected to reach 75 percent,
according to the ministry plan.
</P>
<P>
Today, China is able to produce almost all varieties of steel
products made by developed countries, though in limited quantities
for some varieties, according to ministry officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
The last couple of years have witnessed significant increases
in the production of quality steel products such as cold-rolled
sheets, cold-rolled silicon sheets, galvanized sheets, tin plates
and oil pipes.
</P>
<P>
The national output of cold-rolled steel, which had long been
in short supply on the domestic market, has increased from 2.22
million tons in 1990 to 3.73 million tons in 1995, up 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country exported five billion US dollar-worth of
metallurgical products, most of which being steel and steel
products.
</P>
<P>
The rise of China as a major steel manufacturer in the world is
owed partly to the introduction of foreign funds and technologies,
which started in the late 1970s following the implementation of
the policies of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, the country's iron and steel sector
imported 4.03 billion US dollar-worth of technologies and
equipment. Part of the money, 2.5 billion US dollars, was in the
form of foreign loans and accounted for 13.23 percent of the
country's total investment in its iron and steel sector during the
period.
</P>
<P>
Despite impressive progresses, the Chinese iron and steel
industry still faces a number of problems such as outmoded
technologies and equipment, high consumption of energy and low
productivity, said Liu Qi.
</P>
<P>
Besides, in terms of the variety and quality of its steel
products, the industry cannot meet the demand of the country's
rapidly developing economy.
</P>
<P>
China still has to rely on imports for some steel products
needed by its automotive, petroleum, power and chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese iron and steel industry plans to carry out
large-scale technical renovations in the coming five years. During
the period, it hopes to build up at least six large, modern iron
and steel companies that are up to international standards.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the industry expects to satisfy 95
percent of all varieties of rolled steel needed on the domestic
market and make more than 90 percent of all rolled steel in
accordance with international technical standards.
</P>
<P>
If all the targets are met, China will have become an iron and
steel superpower in terms of both quantity and quality at the
beginning of the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of people
proved to have been infected with AIDS in Tanzania mainland
reached 1.2 million by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day seminar in the town of Mbeya, Southwestern
Tanzania last Tuesday, Minister for Health Zakia Meghji said the
AIDS epidemic was spreading very fast that the number of people
suffering from the disease would be more than two million by 2000
in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from Mbeya today, rampant
sexual behaviour among the people is the main cause of the spread
of AIDS in sub-Sahara countries including Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The health minister urged fellow Tanzanians to abandon habits
which may lead to the infecion of AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
"Those who perish are the ones upon whom their families
depend. So far, there are 200,000 orphans whose parents have died
of AIDS and their number will reach more than one million by the
year 2000," she warned.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said that even the number of street children had immensely
increased causing a headache to the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Research has shown that even school children are infected with
AIDS and about 60 percent of boys and girls under 18 years of age
engage themselves in sex and very few of them take necessary
precautions from being infected with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The number of school children whose blood was tested in Dar es
Salaam and proved to have AIDS rose from zero percent in 1987 to four
percent in 1992," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar organised by the Medical Association of Tanzania in
cooperation with the National Association for Controlling AIDS, is
being attended by 200 participants from the Ministry of Health and
Non-Governmental Organizations from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.

Militia which captured the Afghan capital early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Holl strongly condemned the Taliban for the grave violation of
the UNSMA premises which enjoys immunity under international law.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of Najibullah and his companions and the
subsequent killing of them did not possess any legitimate judicial
procedure, he added.
</P>
<P>
Holl noted, "The UNSMA deeply deplores the tragic event which
cast a doubt over the willingness of those responsible to achieve
reconciliation and guarantee justice in the areas controlled by
them."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holl said that the UN has made strenuous efforts,
for humanitarian reasons, to find a solution to the case of
Najibullah, with a view to enabling him to return safely to his
family.
</P>
<P>
"Najibullah had formally abjured any political activity in the
future," he added.

<P>
Immediately after the extra Diet (parliament) session was

dissolution rescript at a plenary session signed by Hashimoto and
his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the cabinet had endorsed the prime

</P>
<P>
Japan needs to radically transform itself to cope with changes
taking place around the world, said Hashimoto.
</P>

The prime minister added that he is seeking a renewed public
mandate because of the successful conclusion of the issue of the
U.S. bases in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming elections, the first since 1993, will also be the
first under a new voting system combining 300 single-seat
constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats,
replacing the current 511-member house elected under a multi-seat
constituency system.

in the lower house, had maintained a three-way ruling coalition
with the Social Democratic Party and New Party Sakigake, which had
35 and 14 seats in the House respectively.

by the state-run Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) as part of
the government's expansion plan, Shipping Minister A.S.M. Abdur
Rob confirmed at a meeting to mark the World Maritime Day
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At present, only a small portion of the country's foreign
trade is handled by local ships.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Shipping Ministry, 18 ships owned
by the BSC carried only 9 percent of the total export cargo and
1.97 percent of the import cargo during the five years up to June
1995, compared to 14 percent and 3.59 percent handled by private
sector ships.
</P>
<P>
The country's total number of ocean-going vessels has fallen to
28, including 18 owned by the BSC, in 1995 from 37, including 20
state-run ones, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken steps to make the transportation of
cargo by local ships less hazardous and thus enable it to become
more profitable.

The program, comprising 17 major subjects in bio-technology,
information, automation, energy, new material, astronautics and
laser, has borne rich fruits, according to Zhu Lilan, member of
the State Council's Hi-tech Central Coordinating Panel.
</P>
<P>
"We have made achievements in 1,398 items of hi-tech research,
out of which 1,200 are from the realms of bio-technology,
information, automation, energy and new material, and 198 from the
fields of astronautics and laser," she said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 550 of the 1,398 items of achievements
reached or approached the advanced world level in their respective
fields, 659 items won national or ministry level prizes, and 266
items were patented in or outside China, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
One of the success stories is the studies and application of
CIMS, standing for Computer Integrated Manufacturing System, which
has shown great potential in renovating and modernizing China's
traditional industry, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Cheng, director of the State CIMS Engineering
Research Center of China, China has led the world in both the
research and application of CIMS.
</P>
<P>
The technology of CIMS has been successfully applied to a dozen
other large and medium-sized enterprises. "By the year 2000,
hundreds of enterprises will be using CIMS," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
While the new technology of automation is upgrading the
traditional industry and actuating the development of pillar
industry, Zhu Lilan said, breakthroughs are made in
bio-technological studies, which are playing an important role in
agricultural and medical development.
</P>
<P>
One of the world-level achievements is the technique of
two-line hybridization of rice. A test in an experimental plot of
267,000 ha showed a 10-15 percent increase in the yield over
routine three-line hybrid varieties.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Not to Grant Amnesty to Illegal Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
has rejected a request by the Singapore Contractors' Association
(SCA) for an amnesty to illegal foreign construction workers,
local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
An amnesty will not solve the problem, the Labor Ministry was
quoted as saying in a statement issued on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a concerted effort must be made by the
Ministries of Labor, Home Affairs and National Development, and by
contractors to upgrade the industry.
</P>
<P>
The SCA asked for the amnesty when it met with officials of the
three ministries on Wednesday and it also requested a dialogue
with the ministries to discuss the issue and the industry's labor
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Several large contractors were fined recently for having
illegal workers on their sites and the SCA had asked for an
amnesty so that illegal workers could be registered.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministries told the SCA that such an amnesty would
not solve the problem. They said an amnesty granted in 1989 to
illegal workers and immigrants did not prevent the problem from
recurring.
</P>
<P>
The ministries also said contractors had been given enough time
to respond to the Foreign Workers' Amendment Act, which took
effect on March 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, main contractors are held accountable for any
illegal workers found on sites, even if they are hired by
sub-contractors.
</P>
<P>
On contractors' concerns that work permit rules do not allow
them to hire enough foreigners, the Labor Ministry cited figures
showing that most contractors can recruit additional foreigners
even under the present ratio of one Singaporean to five foreign
workers.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses PNA of Violating Signed Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government
accused today the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of
violating the signed agreements in current bloody conflicts that
have taken a death toll of over 70.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government made the accusations in a statement
issued after a six-hour security cabinet meeting which lasted
overnight to 2 a.m.today. Defense Minister Yitzahk Mordechai and
other military and security heads briefed Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on the situation in the Palestinian territories
following two days of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the shooting by Palestinian police
constituted severe violations of signed agreements and has
endangered the future of the Middle East peace process. It called
on the PNA to halt the fighting by restraining its forces and
resume peace talks without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has put its military and security
forces on high alert across the territories and Jerusalem,
instructing them to take "all necessary means to defend the
Jewish civilians, settlement residents and soldiers."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who declared a state of emergency in the
territories Thursday, has given strict orders to Israeli soldiers
to avoid conflicts with Palestinians, but they should take any
positions possible if necessary to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who cut short his visit to Germany and returned
home Thursday evening, once again telephoned PNA President Yasser
Arafat to discuss the situation. But the two failed to fix a
meeting or reach any agreement on how to calm the tense
situation.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said that Netanyahu might hold a summit meeting
in Cairo today with Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
the leading Arab mediator between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat visited Palestinian victims of the clashes Thursday
night in hospitals in the Gaza Strip, denouncing the violence as
a "massacre" by Israeli forces. He said 69 Palestinians has been
killed and 1089 others wounded in two days of widespread bloody
confrontation, caused by Israel's opening of controversial
underground tunnel under the premises of Moslem Holy sites in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, Israel Radio said that 11 soldiers were
killed and 58 others wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to restore order, Arafat on Thursday reportedly
ordered his security forces to halt fighting with Israeli
soldiers, except returning fire in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The current conflicts are the worst since the two sides made
peace in 1993. The situation is similar to the Intifada, or Arab
Uprising, between 1987 and 1993, which featured the confrontation
between stone-throwing Palestinian teenagers and armed Israeli
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Denies Piracy Charges Against Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia denied that 11 of
its soldiers had been engaged in piracy in Thai waters and
dismissed piracy charges made against them by Thai authorities.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers could not be charged with piracy because they were
only carrying out their duties, Cambodia's Koh Kong Governor Rung
Pramkesorn said, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The 11 Cambodian soldiers were arrested by the Thai Navy off
Thailand's eastern coast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were reportedly seized along with their patrol
boat by the Thai Navy after a brief clash off the eastern coastal
province of Trat, when they were allegedly attempting to rob a
Thai trawler.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side said that the trawler was in Thai territorial
waters and that the Cambodian soldiers would face charges of
illegal entry, illegal possession and use of weapons, piracy,
resisting arrest and illegal use of radio communication.
</P>
<P>
However, the soldiers claimed that the Thai trawler was fishing
in Cambodian waters.
</P>
<P>
Governor Pramkesorn also accused the trawler of illegally
fishing in Cambodian waters.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers currently are detained at a police station in Trat
province and they will soon be transferred to the Trat Prison.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Up in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Cases of tuberculosis in
Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, rose by 40 percent in the first four
months of this year, according to the latest city council
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Health officials warn that at least 3,000 deaths every year
for the past decade were attributable to the communicable
disease.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate suggestion of the specific measures that
are being put in place to combat this growing problem, they said.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise is linked to various factors including
overcrowding, malnutrition and the higher than before prevalance
of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
But statistics are likely to be much higher, especially as
some TB patients are admitted to private hospitals or the main
referral hospitals, and are therefore not reflected on council
records.

<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is trailing other
South Asian countries in the economic growth pace due to political
unrest and civil strife in the past year, according to a World
Bank annual report published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the overall growth rate of the region
comprising seven countries was estimated at 5.3 percent in 1995.
All the South Asian countries achieved significant economic growth
except Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, it added.
</P>
<P>
Political difficulties and civil strife in Bangladesh and Sri
Lanka contributed to dampening private sector dynamism and
restrained growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that maintaining sound economic
fundamentals and pushing ahead with economic reforms were
essential if the region was to take full advantage of the
enormous potential for further growth in private capital flows to
the region.

<HEADLINE> Rao to Appeal to Supreme Court Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- India's former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao is expected to make an appeal to the
Supreme Court today against the high court order.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court Thursday rejected Rao's Wednesday plea for
anticipatory bail in the Lakhubai Pathak cheating case of 100,000
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Justice Mahajan in his brief order said that he did not agree
with Rao's counsel's contention that even in a case where only
summons had been issued by the trial court, the accused can move a
higher court for anticipatory bail.
</P>
<P>
Additional sessions judge Ajit Bharihoke in his September 21
order summoned Rao to appear in person before the court on
September 30. Rao made a plea for anticipatory bail in fear of
being arrested on September 30 in the court.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Rao's arrest appears imminent as Ajit
Bharihoke has been left with little option regarding the arrest of
Rao.

<HEADLINE> 145 Rival Students Injured in Armed Clashes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Armed clashes between pro-and
anti-government student groups in Kushtia and Barisal, Bangladesh,
have left at least 145 persons injured, said reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
In the western district of Kushtia, students belonging to the
opposition Jamaat-E-Islami backed Islamic Chhatra Shibir and the
ruling Awami League's student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL)
clashed at the Islamic University for the 2nd consecutive day on
Thursday, leaving at least 100 people injured.
</P>
<P>
The rival militant student activists fired gunshots
indiscriminately while chasing each other, witnesses said, adding
that more than 150 villagers carrying logs, iron rods, spears and
machetes joined in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
As the situation went out of control, the university
authorities have decided to close the campus indefinitely and all
resident students have been asked to vacate the halls immediately.
</P>
<P>
In Barisal in the south, at least 45 people including three
policemen were injured in a series of clashes between the BCL and
the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-backed
Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several hand-made bombs were used during the clash from the
morning till late night. Police lobbed at least 26 rounds of tear
gas canisters and arrested nine people.

<HEADLINE> hke092719#-#-India's Congress Group for Withdrawing Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A section of India's
Congress party leadership is advocating immediate withdrawal of
support from the United Front government in the light of P.V.
Narasimha Rao being charge-sheeted in the St. Kitts forgery case,
according to Congress sources here today.
</P>
<P>
While Rao is to approach the Supreme Court Friday to seek
redress for the rejection of his anticipatory bail plea Thursday
by the Delhi High Court in the Lakhubhai Pathak cheating case of
100,000 US dollars, many of the Congress leaders loyal to the
former party president are of the opinion that Rao has to strike
back politically for his survival.
</P>
<P>
A move is already on to persuade new party chief Sitaram Kesri
to call a meeting of the Congress Working Committee, the highest
policy-making body of the party, to discuss the "emerging
undemocratic trend of implicating politicians" and take the
decision to withdraw support to the Deve Gowda government.
</P>
<P>
It is a political anomaly that the Congress would go on
supporting a government which is implicating the leader of the
main party which is supporting it from outside, some Congress
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Rao's political survival now depends on how well
the Congress manages to fight the legal battle politically, they
further said.
</P>
<P>
The Deve Gowda government's game plan is to isolate Rao and
encourage his detractors to build up pressure within the Congress
to share power with the United Front, they added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Debt Reaches Alarming Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's debt has risen to
an alarming level with increasing loans from developed countries
and international financial institutions, a cabinet minister said.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Tungky Ariwibowo said in Bandung,
West Java, Thursday that Indonesia's foreign debt is believed to
have exceeded the psychological level of 100 billion U.S. dollars,
reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
"Higher foreign debt obligation, plus its interests and rising
imports, will definitely lead to a higher current account
deficit," the minister warned.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia suffered a 6.9 billion dollar current account deficit
in 1995, up from 3.5 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Many economic observers predict that the country will incur a
current account deficit of up to 8 billion dollars this year,
despite the government's effort to bring it down to 5 billion
dollars during the 1996/97 fiscal year ending March 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto last month sounded a warning about the
nation's current account deficit, saying it was still within
limits, but had reached 3.3 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) in the 1995/96 fiscal year, which ended last March.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the target set by the Sixth Five-Year Development
Plan (1994-1999) which is limited to 2 percent of GDP, our deficit
is too large," Soeharto said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Mayor Arrested for Suspected Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese mayor was arrested
on Friday because of suspicion he received bribes.
</P>
<P>
Akira Takahashi, 73 , the mayor of Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture
in central Japan, is suspected of accepting millions of yen from a
contractor involved in a project to build a bicycle racing stadium
in 1994, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police also arrested his eldest son, Yoshitake Takahashi, 47,
and three officials of the Ando Corporation, a medium-sized
building contractor based in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The officials are suspected of having sent the bribes to the
mayor to gain his support for the company in winning the
contract. The mayor's son allegedly conspired with his father to
receive the bribes, police said.
</P>
<P>
The three Ando officials are Hirotaka Ito, 61, a managing
director, Hiroaki Kimura, 54, a manager at Ando's Nagoya branch,
and Tatsuo Natsume, 55, a manager at the Toyohashi branch, who was
the head of the Nagoya branch during the period in question.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's son has already been indicted on charges of bid
rigging in an electric facility project last year commissioned
by the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Akira Takahashi, became mayor in April 1983 and was in his
fourth term. He denied part of the allegations against him, but
the other four suspects had basically admitted the allegations,
police claimed.

<HEADLINE> Franc-Zone Countries Satisfied with Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- France and franc-zone countries
said today they have been pleased with the economic progress in
their countries since the devaluation of the African franc in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A communique, released today at the end of the Financial
Ministerial Conference of France and Franc-Zone Countries, said
that countries with currencies linked to the franc have seen
economic growth, falling inflation, growing exports, and improved
finances since the 50 percent devaluation of the franc in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It said that 1996 economic growth in the group is expected to
reach or surpass 4.6 percent, and inflation held below 5 percent,
compared with rates of 14.8 percent in 1995 and 27.8 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The communique hailed the achievements as ``encouraging'' and
attributed them to structural reforms among the franc-zone
countries, most of whom have managed budget surpluses through
cutting public spending and increasing financial income.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said reforms would continue under the auspices of the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
But African franc-zone countries said at the conference that
they wanted to see their debt burden eased.
</P>
<P>
The 14 African franc-zone countries include Benin, Cameroon,
Comoros, Congo, Togo, Equatorial Guinea, the Burkina Faso.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes Australian Ambassador Would Enhance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
expressed the hope that the appointment of John Maccarthy as the
new Australian ambassador to Jakarta would help enhance bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia welcomes Maccarthy's appointment as Australia's
ambassador to the country. We hope he could further strengthen the
cooperation of the two neighboring countries," Foreign Affairs
Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl said last night.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia and Australia share the same interests and
need to keep good relations for its own sake and that of the
region's stability.
</P>
<P>
Maccarthy has served at the Australian Foreign Affairs and
Trade Department since 1968, holding posts of ambassador to
Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico and the United States. He was appointed
on Thursday ambassador to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Maccarthy's appointment came after Indonesia rejected the
appointment of Miles Kupa to replace Allan Robert as new
Australian ambassador.
</P>

Indonesia said Kupa was "not suitable" for the position in
terms of enhancing the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Australia disapproved of Indonesia's
appointment of retired Lt. Gen. Herman Benhard Leopolt Mantiri as
ambassador to Australia due to his statement regarding the
November 12, 1991 incident in East Timor.

<P>
Mantiri reportedly defended actions of Indonesian soldiers in
the incident as "quite proper."
</P>

The rejection left the post vacant for several months until

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Allows ValuJet to Fly Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- ValuJet Thursday got
federal permission to fly again, three months after the budget
carrier was grounded following a fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
"ValuJet has met all of the FAA's (Federal Aviation
Administration), requirements and they've met all of our
requirements and we've certificated them to fly," said John
V. Coleman, director of the Transportation Department's Office of
Aviation Analysis.
</P>
<P>
He said the airline was authorized to resume service
"virtually immediately."
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, ValuJet President Lewis Jordan told a news
conference that the airline would resume flying Monday,
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department's ruling was condemned by the
Association of Flight Attendants, which had opposed
re-certification of the airline. Association President Patricia
Friend claimed that the approval "ignores a voluminous record of
safety violations and incompetent management."
</P>
<P>
Friend said the union would appeal to the federal court in an
effort to prevent the airline from flying.
</P>
<P>
The department said it reviewed ValuJet's management and
financial conditions and concluded that it had "demonstrated a
positive disposition to comply with all applicable laws and
regulations."
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said ValuJet should have little
trouble attracting passengers but that the airline must now
perform impeccably to succeed.

<HEADLINE> NATO Inclines to Keep Troops in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force may stay in Bosnia after its mandate expires in
December this year.
</P>
<P>
At an informal meeting on Wednesday and Thursday in Bergen,
Norway, NATO defense ministers reached a consensus on keeping the
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia after the mandate of its
current mission expires on December 20, but they did not make a
final decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The ministers asked alliance generals to study how they would
carry out future missions if continued military involvement in
Bosnia is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that the number of personnel would be
decreased from the current 52,000 to 25,000, in keeping with the
situation in the region following the general elections earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
A formal decision on the issue will made early December at the
annual meeting of NATO defense minister in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the Bergen meeting also discussed NATO's
eastwards expansion and its "Partner for Peace" program.

<P>
TOKYO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States dollar jumped
above the 110.50 yen line in Tokyo early Friday morning, following
its upward trend in major overseas markets overnight.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service said the dollar's rise was triggered by an
unexpected cut in interest rates in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was sold at 110.51-56 yen at 9 a.m., slightly down
from late Thursday's quote of 110.60-70 yen in New York but up
from 110.30-40 yen in London late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was traded at 110.38-40 yen at 5 p.m. in Tokyo on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also gained ground against European currencies,
which traders said were weakened by the rates cut in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Traders forecast the dollar's upper limit would be capped at
around the 110.70 yen line.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Takes Quebec Separation to Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Minister Allan Rock
announced today that the federal government will ask the Supreme Court
of Canada to clarify the rules under which Quebec could separate if it
votes Yes in the next referendum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the House of Commons, Rock stressed that the federal
government is not contesting the right of Quebecers to vote on their
future in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
But, he said Quebec separatists are wrong when they say that a Yes
vote would automatically give them the right to create a separate
state.
</P>
<P>
"It is contrary to Canadian law, unsupported by international law
and is deeply threatening to the orderly governance of our nation," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The responsible and effective thing to do is submit the issue for
determination by the Supreme Court," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government will ask the court the following questions:
</P>
<P>
-- Can the government of Quebec take the province out of Canada
unilaterally?
</P>
<P>
-- Is there a right of self-determination under international law?
</P>
<P>
-- If there's a conflict of between domestic and international law
on the question, which one takes precedence in Canada?
</P>
<P>
It could be a year before a judgment is rendered, justice officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard responded immediately by saying that
Quebec's government will ignore the court judgment.
</P>
<P>
"What's happening in Ottawa will in no way affect Quebec's
political future, which will be decided by Quebecers and Quebecers
only," said Bouchard, who has promised not to hold another referendum
for three or four years.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Allegedly Involved in Palme Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sweden today asked South
Africa to provide any information it has about alleged South
African involvement in the murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof
Palme 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We take this information seriously," said Pierre Schori,
junior Swedish foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today at a trial in Pretoria, Eugene de Kock, a
convicted apartheid assassin, implicated South African security
services in the 1986 assassination of Palme, according to local
press reports here.
</P>
<P>
Schori said Sweden, through its embassy in Pretoria, has asked
the South African authorities to provide information about de
Kock's implication of South African security services in the
murder.
</P>
<P>
De Kock alleged that Craig Williamson, a notorious South
African agent, played a role in the murder code named "Longreach"
operation.
</P>
<P>
Williamson was commander of a secret service whose task was to
eliminate political opponents of South Africa's apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
Palme, an outspoken opponent of apartheid on the international
arena, was shot in the back in downtown Stockholm on February 28,
1986, as he and his wife walked home from a movie theater without
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
A suspect was tried for the crime in 1989, but the court
acquitted him, calling the evidence circumstantial. Since then few
leads have emerged.
</P>
<P>
Lars Jonsson, a detective with the Swedish police team looking
into the murder, said Sweden has had this information since 1987,
but he declined to say whether he thought the allegations were
true or whether they had been seriously studied before.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Urges Israel to Take Peace Process Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's foreign minister
said today that the only way for Israel to break the recent
escalation of violence in the West Bank is to fulfil the
obligations of the 1993 Oslo Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lena Hjelm-Wallen said that the Israeli Government "must now
show in deeds that it takes the peace process seriously."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the clashes between the Israelis and
Palestinians in West Bank, in which dozens of people, including
police and Palestinians, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government also urged Palestinians and Israelis
to stay calm.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry Jan Egeland
said that Norway had been in touch with top-level Palestinians and
Israelis and asked both sides to show moderation.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Agreement was signed by Israel and the Palestinians in
1993 and set the framework for ending half a century of conflict
between the two.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Palestine and Israel agreed not to resume
military confrontation, but hold talks over issues concerning
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, repatriation of Palestinian
refugees, security and the final Palestinian-Israeli joint
borders.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States
government has approved the appointment of Colombian Mines and
Energy Minister, Rodrigo Villamizar, as that country's ambassador
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision ended a period of nearly three months in
which the seat of the head of the Colombian mission remained
vacant.
</P>
<P>
Former occupant of the Colombian diplomatic seat, Carlos Lleras
de la Fuente, was not immediately replaced by the Colombian
government.
</P>
<P>
Over the vacant period, the Colombian mission was under the care
of Charge d'Affaires Mauricio Echeverri.
</P>
<P>
Villamizar was Colombia's ambassador to Tokyo until the
beginning of 1995, when he was recalled and appointed general
director of the 11th Summit of Chiefs of Government, and of State,
of the Non-Aligned Movement Countries, held in Cartagena in
October, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Villamizar, born in Cali, graduated as an engineer in the Del
Valle University, and studied in Austin, Texas for a master's
degree in economics. The diplomat has been mines and energy
minister for more than one year.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian
intelligence services have uncovered 57 plots to assassinate
President Ernesto Samper, who has been in power for more than two
years, presidential security sources revealed today.
</P>
<P>
But Samper's life was only in serious danger twice when he
visited the Chaparral and Malaga municipalities this year.
</P>
<P>
The security sources didn't say whether the plots were planned
by his political foes, drug traffickers or guerrillas,
</P>
<P>
President Samper is facing a political crisis for the alleged
use of drug trafficking money in his electoral campaign and an
unprecedented guerrilla offensive.
</P>
<P>
Secret police and high-ranking officials of the Colombian
government have in the past denounced conspiracies to topple
President Samper and to undermine his prestige, but have
nevermentioned assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president has said in several interviews that he
frequently receives threats to his life. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister and New
Aspiration Party (NAP) leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has warned
that the six-party coalition could fall apart if political turmoil
continues on Saturday, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The six parties would have to meet to discuss whether they will
stay together or separate if Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa,
who last Saturday promised he would resign within seven days,
remains in office after tomorrow, Chavalit was quoted as saying on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Things must be cleared up on Saturday and his party would stand
by the deadline, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of whether Banharn would name him as new prime
minister, Chavalit said Banharn and he had talked about it,
indicating that what they talked about must be honored.
</P>
<P>
The coalition parties are now ready to form a government and
they are merely waiting for the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party to
settle internal problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nam Thai (Thai Leadership) Party leader Amnuay Virawan on
Thursday also said that if the new prime minister could not be
nominated in the next one or two days, his party would quit the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that Banharn would continue to serve
as a caretaker prime minister after he resigns if the deadlock
over choosing his successor remains among the six coalition
parties.

DOHA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka completed its Asia
zone group 10 World Cup qualifiers by beating the Philippines 3-0
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But its prospect to advance to the second round will be decided

two teams in the group as only the group winner will compete
against other nine group winners for three berths for the World

Striker C. Stenwall scored the opener in the 27th minute for
Sri Lanka at the Khalifa Stadium, Roshan Perera made it 2-0 in the
55th minute and netted his second in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Filipinos, doomed to bow out of the
tournament prior to the game, failed to create any scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Qatar will meet India to decide the winner of the
group, yet India has a long and tough way to qualify if only they
can beat Qatar by more than six goals.

<HEADLINE> One Million Costa Ricans Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A new study showing that
almost a third of Costa Ricans live in poverty has reopened
controversy over former president Rafael Angel Calderon's claims
that his administration had made great progress in reducing the
number of people in need.
</P>
<P>
One million Costa Ricans live in poverty, with some 328,000
living in abject poverty and don't have enough food to eat,
according to a university study published today
</P>
<P>
The figures appear to contradict claims by former President
Calderon that during his term of office from 1990 to 1994, poverty
levels had fallen from 24 to 17 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
But the report's authors, Arlette Pichardo and Keynor Ruiz, say
that their findings do not necessarily mean that poverty is
increasing in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
They say their calculations are based on an up-dating of the
costs of the so-called "basic basket" of staple food to the latest
prices.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over poverty levels in the country is likely to
continue as there is no definitive agreement on the most accurate
methods of calculating and defining poverty.

PANAMA CITY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Two new cases of leprosy
have been reported in Panama, bringing the total to 133, the

Iska Viejo, the director of Palo Seco hospital, one of four
specialist leprosy treatment centers in Latin America, said
536,000 new cases have been reported worldwide, while one million
of the 12 million old cases continue under treatment.

<HEADLINE> NZ Labor Leader Leads in First TV Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Labor Party
leader Helen Clark has won her first psychological victory by
outperforming her opponents in the first television election
debate.
</P>
<P>
Before a group of random selected undecided voters last night,
leaders of the National Party, the Labor Party, New Zealand First
and Alliance debated a range of issues including health care and
superannuation.
</P>
<P>
Clark scored an approval rating of 41 percent, compared with a
poor 13 percent for National Party leader and Prime Minister Jim
Bolger, who was on the defensive from the very start.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters registered an approval
rating of 31 percent and Alliance leader Jim Anderton got 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Clark also took the opportunity to extend an olive branch to
Anderton, whose Alliance has been locked in a long-simmering
dispute with Labor.
</P>
<P>
She said she will talk to Anderton after the election on terms
on which Labor and Alliance could work together in the future
government.
</P>
<P>
Anderton quit the Labor Party in 1989 due to differences over
Labor's policies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ Parties Differ Over Major Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Economic policies, social
welfare, education and health issues will be at the center of
concerns among New Zealand's voters in the election now only 15
days away.
</P>
<P>
These are also the major areas dividing the major parties,
whose interests overlap on these issues.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Party is making use of the economic
achievements in the past few years to woo the voters. The economy
has been growing, unemployment has sunk to a low level not seen in
more than a decade, and the government finance is in good shape
with a rising surplus.
</P>
<P>
These gains provide the National with a ready justification of
its policies. The party is using them to compare with the
situation six years ago when its arch rival, the Labor Party, was
in power.
</P>
<P>
The National Party also makes use of the gains to attack the
opposition, arguing that all will be lost if the present economic
course is altered.
</P>
<P>
On economic issues, the parties hold different views on two
major laws, the Reserve Bank Act and the Employment Contract Act.
The National wants to keep the acts intact, while the opposition
parties want to modify or even to scrap them.
</P>
<P>
On the Reserve Bank Act, which empowers the bank to fight
inflation without government interference, the Labor Party and New
Zealand First have said they want to ease the inflation target to
minus one to 3 percent instead of the current zero to 2 percent.
However, the Alliance wants to repeal the Act.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Contract Act, enacted by the National in 1991,
aims to liberalize the labor market by dismantling the monopoly of
trade unions. It abolished the compulsory union membership and
allowed workers to negotiate individual contracts with employers.
</P>
<P>
The Labor and the Alliance charge that the Act put the
employers at an advantage in industrial bargains, allowing them to
press down the wages. Both of them want to annual the Act.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance and New Zealand First also oppose the sale of
state enterprises, and vow to buy back the companies already sold
to private investors.
</P>
<P>
The National is particularly vulnerable in the fields of social
welfare, education and public health. All the opposition parties
have accused the government of ignoring the poor people by cutting
welfare and increasing the expense for education and health care.
</P>
<P>
They have all pledged to spend more in these areas by slowing
down the pace of debt repayment if they are elected to form the
next government. Labor and the Alliance have also said they will
raise income tax for the high-income earners while reducing the
tax level for the low paid.
</P>
<P>
The National Party has made no specific promise in these
fields. Instead, it said its tax cuts starting in July will
benefit all and the New Zealanders will have more to spend after
another round of tax cuts starting next year under a National
Government.
</P>
<P>
It also indicates that with the rising budget surplus, the next
government would be in a position to spend more on social areas.

<P>
HOHHOT, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have excavated 20 tombs
of a nomadic tribe which roamed the area 1,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Xianbei ethnic group, initiated in northeastern China,
moved to present-day Inner Mongolia around the third century and
later moved to Shanxi Province to establish the Northern Wei
Dynasty (386-534).
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the excavation of the Xianbei Tombs offers
material to study the history of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
Pottery vessels, coins, gold, bronze iron and pearl ornaments
have been unearthed from the tombs.
</P>
<P>
What is more attractive to the experts might be stones to seal
the pass leading to the burial room and wooden wheels under large
coffins, which are rarely seen in other Xianbei tombs found
previously.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing's Auto Company to Issue B Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chang'an Automobile
Company in Chongqing City is to raise 600 million yuan (72 million
U.S. dollars) to expand production of small family cars.
</P>
<P>
The plant, based in the important industrial city on the middle
reaches of the Yangtze River, will raise the funds by issuing B
shares aimed at overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Sources report that the Chongqing-based auto company will float
250 million B shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in October,
one of the only two stock exchanges in China. The other is based
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
There are two kinds of shares floating at Chinese stock
exchanges, with A shares designed for domestic investors and B
shares for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The money raised will be used to build projects, including the
installation of new assembly and engine production lines, as well
as the establishment of an automobile research center.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Suzuki Corporation, which is confident of China's
bright prospects for the development of the country's mini car
market, has decided to purchase 125 million shares from the total
issue. Each share will have a purchase price of 2.96 yuan. The
Japanese company has promised not to transfer the shares within
three years.
</P>
<P>
Chang'an Automobile Company has become one of China's leading
mini car production bases. Last year its penetration in the
domestic market reached 21.4 percent, and the company earned 220
million yuan in after-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
The company, which used to be a military industrial production
unit, switched to production of civilian products in 1980s. In the
early 1980s it began production of mini cars.
</P>
<P>
The company set up a joint venture with the Japanese Suzuki
Corporation in 1991 to build "Auto" brand mini cars, with a
designed annual production capacity of the joint venture reaching
100,000 mini cars.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of the joint venture, "Chang'an-Suzuki" company,
to boost the annual production capacity to 150,000 Auto mini cars,
has been approved by the authorities of relevant departments.
</P>
<P>
The Cathy Securities Company will be responsible for
underwriting the B shares.
</P>
<P>
When the issue is completed, Chang'an company's total shares
will reach 756.19 million, with B shares accounting for 33 percent
of the total.

<HEADLINE> 500-year-old Altar Group Found in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 mongolian-style
altars dating back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) have been found
on the northern side of Mount Yinshan in north China's Inner
Mongolian Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the group is the largest of its
kind ever found in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian-style alter is a pile of stones initiated in the
Warring State Period (476-221 BC) and was then used as a road
mark. Later it became a site for offering sacrifices to the
natural gods.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found alter group was located on a mountain top.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the group is a major altar, which is six
meters high with a diameter of 25 meters at the base. It was made
wholely of black stones and is decorated with religious ornaments.
</P>
<P>
Fragments of helmet, porcelain wine cups, and iron arrow heads
dating from Yuan have also been found at the site, suggesting that
the site was also a military look-out point.

<HEADLINE> Moon Cake Market Booms Despite Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The moon cake market has been
booming despite modest price hikes in the Chinese capital, as the
traditional Mid-Autumn Festival falls today.
</P>
<P>
It is a tradition to eat and give moon cakes, indicating family
reunion during the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth day of the
eighth month of the lunar calendar, today on this year's Gregorian
calendar.
</P>
<P>
Competition in the cake market centers around uniquely-designed
packings, since most cakes are very similar. This year, the
wrappings are made of paper, plastic, iron, satin or baskets,
according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"It is for one of my friends. The box can still sing after the
cakes are eaten up," said Mr Li from Henan Province after spending
68 yuan (8.2 US dollars) on six cakes packed in a music box at the
downtown Xidan Shopping Center.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a box of cakes usually ranges between 20 and 50
yuan (two to six dollars), though some high-end cakes go for as
much as 589 yuan (71 dollars). And the average price of each cake
has risen to eight yuan from last year's five yuan.
</P>
<P>
Stores are targeting consumers who buy the cakes as gifts, said
Wang Xueming, deputy manager of the Guixiangcun Group, a leading
food company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A downtown shop of the Guixiangcun Group sells moon cakes for
some 100,000 yuan per day these days, said its manager.
</P>
<P>
Cake prices usually drop dramatically, sometimes by 90 percent,
after the festival. But many people just buy in time for the
holiday, and will not wait for the savings.
</P>
<P>
Sources claim that the city has prepared six billion yuan worth
of goods for the Mid-Autumn Festival and the forthcoming National
Day which will fall on October 1, an increase of 20 percent over
the same 1995 period.

<HEADLINE> Declaration Issued on Controlling River Pollution in Anhui, Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A joint declaration on
controlling pollution in the Wohe River that flows through 12
counties in Henan and Anhui provinces has been issued by the
legislatures of the counties.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the people's congresses, governments and
environmental protection departments of the 12 counties recently
met in Mengcheng County, east China's Anhui Province, to discuss
measures to control pollution in the Wohe River and the Huaihe
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Wohe River, the second longest tributary of the Huaihe
River, originates from Kaifeng, central China's Henan Province,
and flows through an area of 1,595 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
River pollution caused by factories, particularly township-run
ones, causes an estimated loss of at least 100 million yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Mengcheng County People's Congress proposed to its counterparts
in eleven other counties in the Wohe River Valley that concerted
efforts should be made to bring the pollution under control.
</P>
<P>
People's congresses of other countries responded positively,
leading to the issue of the joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the declaration, waste water discharged by
manufacturers in the Wohe River Valley must meet government-set
standards before the end of 1997, and all factories causing
serious pollution, such as small paper mills with an annual
production capacity of less than 5,000 tons, must close
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also states that people's congresses of the 12
counties will formulate regulations and rules to step up control
of water pollution.
</P>
<P>
The congresses must also give equal emphasis to economic growth
and environmental protection, the declaration adds.

<HEADLINE> 21,000 Resettled for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China has resettled 21,000
people to make way for the construction of the Three Gorges
Project, the world's largest water-control endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement task remains arduous as 29,400 people will
have to resettle before that time, said a resettlement official
with the Three Gorges Project Construction Commission under the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has invested 4.43 billion yuan (about 534 million
US dollars based on current prices) in the resettlement program,
the official said here today.
</P>
<P>
To ensure proper use of funds granted for the resettlement, the
commission's resettlement bureau has imposed three rules to be
observed by governments in the reservoir area in central-west
China.
</P>
<P>
-- It is forbidden to use the resettlement fund for the
construction of projects unlinked to the resettlement plans, the
development of real estate, or the buying of stock.
</P>
<P>
-- It is forbidden to use the resettlement fund to cover
administrative expenses, construct luxury buildings or buy cars.
</P>
<P>
-- It is forbidden to randomly adjust major projects for
resettlement without approval. The state will find where the
responsibility lies if losses are incurred from unauthorized
adjustments of projects.
</P>
<P>
China will eventually have to resettle over one million people
for the construction of the 17-year hydro-electrical project
scheduled for completion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has developed 15,300 hectares of new
cultivated land, built 780,000 square meters of houses, and has
launched 118 projects for urban infrastructure construction, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 256 industrial or mining enterprises are under
construction, 64 of which have been completed. Construction of the
infrastructure facilities for the new seats of Zigui, Xingshan,
Badong, Wushan, Yunyang and Fengjie counties are in full swing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ministries or commissions under the central government have
also made substantial progress in supporting the Three Gorges
Reservoir area. They have set up 820 projects and allocated aid of
nearly 1.6 billion yuan (about 193 million US dollars) for the
area.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Province, Home to Numerous Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Remote Guizhou, a backward
southwestern Chinese province, has benefited a lot from its large
number of natural and man-made lakes, a senior local government
official said.
</P>
<P>
Provincial power bureau director Chang Junwu told Xinhua that
since 1949 over two billion yuan has been spent building over
1,200 reservoirs, which are beautifying the province along with
natural lakes.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has many rivers, and is one of China's most rain-rich
provinces, with an average annual rainfall of 1,191 mm, while its
water reserves, hydraulic reserve and explorable hydraulic
resources are very rich.
</P>
<P>
The large number of natural and artificial lakes have helped
Guizhou develop its agricultural sector, with some 670,000
hectares of farmlands under irrigation networks supported by the
lakes.
</P>
<P>
The lakes have also become a huge tourist resource for the
province, creating beautiful scenery, numerous species of plants
and animals, buildings of different historical periods and various
geological attractions, such as caves, peaks, underground lakes
and waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province has set up eight national-level, and
24 provincial-level scenic sites. Every year around 10 million
domestic tourists, and over 100,000 overseas travelers, visit
Guizhou, bringing over 600 million yuan and over 20 million US
dollars to the province in tourist income.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Gains Momentum in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Few people were optimistic
about the private sector in Shanghai when the first private
enterprise opened in 1988.
</P>
<P>
But today nobody can ignore the existence of private companies
which number close to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years the private sector has experienced
rapid expansion. Now 49,000 private firms have been set up in the
city, with a total registered capital of almost 29 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over 520,000 people are engaged in private business, including
98,000 investors and 427,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Private firms are involved in many industries, with five per
cent of them hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
The booming private economy has been a new source of local
government revenue. In the first eight months alone, the sector
handed over 775 million yuan in tax, while the figure for the
whole of 1995 stood at merely 589 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Private business has created many employment opportunities in
the city. In the recent two years, the sector has hired 85,000
from among the jobless.

<HEADLINE> Tea Growing China Plans Massive Coffee Plantations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China, famed for its tea, is
planning to quench the thirsts of the world's coffee drinkers.
</P>
<P>
A 340 million yuan five-year plan to expand coffee production
is to be carried out in warm and mild Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan the province will, as its first phase of
construction, build a 5,000-hectare coffee farm and a coffee
processing plant with an annual output of 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, in southwest China, has 40,000 ha. of land suitable for
growing coffee. Its arabica compares favorably with that planted
in Colombia and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The province already grows coffee on 3,300 ha. with an annual
output of 2,000 tons. The acreage for coffee production will be
expanded by 16,000 ha in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Yunnan received 1.16 million US dollars-worth of
donations to raise its state-of-art for coffee production in
accordance with an agreement signed by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
With advanced equipment imported from Germany and Italy, the
province has greatly improved its products, which are selling well
in big coffee importing countries such as the United States,
Britain, Japan and Australia.

<HEADLINE> American Family Earnings Up for First Time in 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The average family income
in the U.S. increased last year for the first time in six years,
the U.S. Census Bureau reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that median household income in the U.S. was
34,076 dollars in 1995, up by 2.7 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
That was the first real increase in six years after adjusting
for inflation but the family income has not yet returned to its
1989 level of 35,421 dollars in terms of 1995 dollars, the U.S.
Census Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the bureau said there were 36.4 million
people living in poverty in the United States last year, 13.8
percent of the population. That was down from 14.5 percent a year
earlier, moving 1.6 million people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The poverty level for a family of four in the United States was
15,569 dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the overall drop in poverty, the number of poor
children in the country dropped from 15.3 million in 1994 to 14.7
million in 115, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the U.S. Midwest was listed as the only region
which made a significant financial gain from 1994 to 1995 with a
7.2 percent increase in median income. Other regions also showed
improvements but the increases were within the statistical margin
of error of the study, U.S. census officials said.

<HEADLINE> China Taking Follow-up Actions of 4th World Conference on Women (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to carry
out the spirit of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women by taking active follow-up actions.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hairong, office director of the Women and Children's
Working Committee of the State Council, said, "Our follow-up
actions in the past year or so have centered on the advancement of
women."
</P>
<P>
"The most important action China is taking is the
implementation of the Program for the Development of the Chinese
Women (1995-2000)," she said.
</P>
<P>
Promulgated by the State Council in August 1995, the program is
the first of its kind in China that sets a task and major targets
for the development of Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
The general target for the development of the Chinese women by
the end of the century is, as stipulated in the program, to
markedly improve the quality of the Chinese women as a whole, and
to further seek women's equal rights in political, economic,
cultural, social and family affairs.
</P>
<P>
Among the eleven specific targets, women's political
participation is listed as the first. The program stipulates that
women's participation in decision-making and management of the
state and social affairs should be improved.
</P>
<P>
The program states: "Vigorous efforts should be made to make
sure that women are present in the government leadership at all
levels, and the percentage of women in the leadership of
government departments be greatly raised."
</P>
<P>
As for women's right to education, the document requests that
nine-year compulsory education should be made universal by and
large.
</P>
<P>
Other targets are set on women's economic involvement, labor
rights, health care and family affairs.
</P>
<P>
The program points out that governments at all levels and
social organizations are responsible for the implementation of the
document.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hairong said that the implementation of the program is,
first of all, the responsibility of government at all levels.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, governors and mayors from China's 30
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions were invited to a
symposium sponsored by Liu's committee on how to implement the
program as part of the follow-up action.
</P>
<P>
Later in Beijing, a large-scale mobilization meeting was held
for leading officials of the State Council departments,
representatives from all social institutions and organizations, as
well as chief editors of 30 major news organizations based in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
While giving publicity to the spirit of the '95 Conference on
Women and the program, and holding training courses for government
leaders at all levels, the committee also demands that every
province, municipality and autonomous region and State Council
department stipulate their respective plans promoting women's
development, in the light of the program.

<HEADLINE> World Airports Post Healthy First Half Traffic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Passenger traffic for the
first six months of 1996 at the world's airports grew by seven
percent over the same period of last year, while cargo volume was
up five percent, the Geneva-based Airports Council International
(ACI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest ACI airport traffic report which
contains data from 458 airports worldwide, Africa registered the
strongest first half passenger traffic growth, up eight percent,
followed by Asia/Pacific and North America, each up seven percent,
Europe and the Middle East, each up six percent.
</P>
<P>
Latin America/Caribbean saw a two percent growth in passenger
traffic for the first six months.
</P>
<P>
In terms of cargo volume, the Middle East reported the strongest
first half growth, up 18 percent over the same period of 1995,
followed by North America, up six percent, and Asia/Pacific and
Europe, each up four percent.
</P>
<P>
Africa saw a modest fall of one percent in cargo volume while
Latin America/Caribbean was down 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, ACI Director General Oris W. Dunham
said that the ACI figures lend support to the recent airline
forecasts of over seven percent annual growth in passenger traffic
from 1996 through to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This is very healthy growth and all parties in the air
transport industry must redouble their efforts to get more
capacity out of the system -- that means more efficient passenger
and cargo processing, and the maximum use of new technologies both
on the ground and in the air," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Taking Follow-Up Actions of 4th World Conference on Women (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To date, 15 provinces and municipalities have come up with
their own programs of women's development, including Hebei,
Shandong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces have set concrete goals, some of which are even
higher than those stipulated in the program itself.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that governments at city and county levels are also
requested to work out their own plans in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese women's organizations are also doing their
parts in the follow-up actions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from spreading the spirit of the Beijing Conference and
the program in the whole society through its sub-federations down
to the village, the All-China Women's Federation, an organization
for women throughout the country, is doing some practical things
for women, according to Liu, who is also vice-chairman of the
federation.
</P>
<P>
One of its focal efforts is directed on a series of "women
making contributions" actions, she said.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities is "aid-to-women-in-poverty" action.
</P>
<P>
Women's federations at all levels plan to help one million
women eliminate poverty by the end of this century, by extending
appropriate techniques to women, helping them develop a courtyard
economy and promoting mutual aid between women in wealth and
poverty, in urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The "women-doing-pioneering-work" action aims at helping the
laid-off women workers in cities. Women's federations will
cooperate with local local departments to help one million women
become re-employed in the next five years, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The "women-eliminating-illiteracy" action is to support the
State Education Commission to help three million women eliminate
illiteracy every year.
</P>
<P>
Two other actions focus on urging and helping more women to
assume leading positions and become decision makers, and on
encouraging women to play an active role in promoting the
socialist ethics.
</P>
<P>
"These activities will serve as major follow-up actions of our
federation, which will unite and mobilize women all over the
country to make contributions to the country's modernization drive
and people's prosperity," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Women Journalists Association, an organization for
some 8,000 women journalists based in Beijing, carried out its
media watch program with a better organized network set up in
March this year to monitor China's major newspapers on their
gender consciousness.
</P>
<P>
In march, the network conducted a research on eight national
newspapers on their front-page coverage of women and women's
by-lined front page reports.
</P>
<P>
While continuing such monitor programs on newspapers on a more
regular basis, the network will extend its watch to TV programs.

<HEADLINE> China's Open Policy in New Era (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China's policy of opening
wider to the outside world has attracted streams of foreign
businesses, which have brought with them investment capital,
technology and management expertise, thus enliving the Chinese
economy.
</P>
<P>
A survey report shows that the gross national product has grown
at an annual rate of 12 percent on average in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, foreign-funded enterprises paid close to 70 billion
yuan (8.4 billion US dollars) in taxes, almost one-tenth of
national tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, with its total imports and exports amounting to
280 billion US dollars, China ranked 11th among the world's top
trading nations. China's dramatic rise as a trading nation is owed
largely to its open policy: foreign-funded enterprises accounted
for about 40 percent of its total imports and exports last
year. In the first quarter of this year, their proportion rose to
45.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
By May this year, China's foreign exchange reserves reached 85
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As China begins to execute its new 9th Five-year Plan this
year, and with the 21st century only five years away, the
government earlier this year formulated a development program for
the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, China will increase its openness in
terms of geographical area and business scope.
</P>
<P>
"In geographical area, we will promote more foreign investment
in cities along major transport lines and the establishment of
foreign investment zones in provincial capitals," Lin Qihui, an
official of the Special Economic Zones Office under the central
government, said.
</P>
<P>
"In business scope, we will gradually allow foreign businesses
to play a greater role in fields where they have been more or less
restricted such as mining, banking, retailing and insurance," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Another principle is to "improve quality" in terms of the open
policy's implementation. This, according to Lin Qihui, means to
increase economic efficiency and returns for all projects
involving foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China will become more choosy in approving new
projects. "Projects that use new and high technologies will be
encouraged and those that pollute the environment rejected," Lin
says. Also, administration and taxation of foreign-funded
enterprises will be strengthened, he says.
</P>
<P>
Other major principles include: the foreign investment sector
is to operate in accordance with market economics; future growth
should rely mainly on improved management and the use of advanced
technologies rather than on more project launches, and
preferential policies will be replaced by increased vitality of
the enterprise as the impetus for future growth.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, from April 1 of this year, foreign-funded enterprises
can no longer enjoy tax exemption for their imported manufacturing
equipment. At the same time, China has reduced its tariff rates,
from an average of 35.9 percent to 23 percent to allow Chinese and
foreign-funded enterprises to compete on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had approved a total of 260,000
foreign-funded enterprises, almost half of which have gone into
operation; and aggregate foreign investment had reached 135
billion US dollars, making China the second biggest recipient of
international investment money in the world after the United
States.
</P>
<P>
With political stability and a huge market, China is confident
of its continued attraction for foreign investors, and plans to
receive another 150 billion US dollars in foreign direct
investment in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Close Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) urged Israel to close the mountain
tunnel which kindled clashes between Palestinians and Israeli
soldiers over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers clashed in the areas of
Nablus, Ramallah and Gaza over the tunnel by the side of the
Islamic holy site of Temple Mount opened by Israel September 23.
During the massive protest campaign over the past few days, a
number of Palestinians were killed and hundreds of others were
wounded, including some Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the opening of the tunnel was solely for
the sake of tourism, but Palestinians charged that it would
undermine the Islamic holy site.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of OIC considered the crisis in Jerusalem was
resulted from the Israeli refusal to fulfill its commitments made
in the ongoing peace process, according to a communique issued by
the Committee on Palestine of OIC Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers condemned all those Israeli actions and called
for the immediate cessation of such actions, the communique said.
In particular, they condemned the recent Israeli oppressive
measures against the Palestinian people, including the use of
gunfire which resulted in scores of casualties.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the immediate closing of the tunnel under
the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Ready to Normalize Relations with Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic has said his country will fully normalize relations with
Bosnia once state bodies, legitimately elected by the people, have
been set up there.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement during an interview which will be
published in the first issue of Dedeljni Dnevnik (Sunday Daily)
magazine on Friday in Novi Sad, the capital of the northern
Serbian province of Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
Central government and parliament in Bosnia will start working
after the September 14 elections are verified by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said the Yugoslav leadership's consistent policy of
peace, good neighborly relations and cooperation had brought about
a significant change in the international community's attitude
towards Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had become a crucial factor of peace, stability and
good neighborliness in the region and that it was entitled to
expect the U.N. Security Council to definitely remove all
sanctions within a deadline stipulated by the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accords, the sanctions against Yugoslavia,
which was suspended last November, will be completely lifted 10
days after the elections was held in Bosnia. But the United
Nations has decided recently that the lifting will take place 10
days after the general elections were verified by the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said Yugoslavia had met all obligations stipulated in the
Dayton accords and that the international community had
acknowledged its constructive role and contribution to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton accords have secured international recognition to
the Serb people and a legalization of Bosnian Serb entity
Republika Srpska, which has been definitely confirmed by the
holding of the elections, Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
The national interest of the Serb people in the Republika
Srpska, is peace, above all, and economic, democratic and social
development and progress, the Yugoslav president added.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said that agreements on a normalization of relations with
Macedonia and Croatia had confirmed Yugoslavia's readiness for
cooperation and good neighborliness with all former Yugoslav
republics.
</P>
<P>
He added that talks were under way with the Muslim-Croat
Federation of Bosnia on the establishment of economic, transport
and other relations.
</P>
<P>
Future cooperation in the area of the former Yugoslavia should
be part of a process of association with European and other
integrations, which is in the interest of all states in the
region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Perry: U.S. Troops Could Return to Bosnia if Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry indicated today that the United States would
seriously consider the participation of American troops in the
follow-on NATO mission in Bosnia after the current U.S.-led NATO
peacekeeping forces withdraw from the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who is participating a meeting of NATO defense ministers
in Bergen, Norway, told reporters that the United States would
send troops back to Bosnia next year if the Western military
alliance deemed it "necessary and appropriate."
</P>
<P>
The current 52,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force is planned to
pull out at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But France, Germany and other U.S. European allies have been
calling on the United States to form a new allied military force
to help keep peace and post-war reconstruction in the war-torn
former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
"I realize that many allies have said that they would only
participate in a follow-on force if the United States
participated," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is not prepared to make a commitment at this
time, but we are prepared to consider participating if the NATO
study shows that our involvement is necessary and appropriate," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief said that the Clinton administration would
carefully consult with the U.S. Republican-controlled Congress
before making any decision on any U.S. participation in the
follow-on NATO mission.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Might Soon Lift Sanctions against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
sanctions against Yugoslavia might be lifted soon as situation in
Bosnia is improving considerably following the nation-wide
elections in mid-September, European ministers said today.
</P>
<P>
They spoke after the foreign ministers from the five-nation
"contact group" on Bosnia met Carl Bildt, international peace
coordinator in Bosnia, at the U.S. mission to the United Nations
on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly in New York earlier in
the day. The group comprises the United States, France, Germany,
Britain and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I think there was agreement right around the table that the
conditions laid down in Dayton have been broadly satisfied and
that it's appropriate for the sanctions to be lifted pretty soon,"
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's days we're talking about, not weeks," Rifkind
said.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told reporters that
he expected this within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
But other participants of the meeting said that the U.N.
Security Council could not lift the sanctions until the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had
certified that the situation in Bosnia met the standards laid down
by Dayton Agreement. OSCE supervised the Bosnian elections on
September 14.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said that he wanted the U.N. Security Council to specify
that it was ready to reimpose sanctions if necessary.
</P>
<P>
This could be done "against anyone that would undertake actions
that would threaten the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina or in other
ways seriously jeopardize the implementation of the peace
agreement," he stressed.
</P>

The United Nations imposed the sanctions against Yugoslavia in
1992 because of Serbia's alleged role in fomenting the Bosnia war.
The sanctions were suspended shortly after the Bosnian peace
agreement was reached in Dayton, Ohio, in last November.

<P>
Yugoslavia has been calling for the earlier formal lifting of
the U.N. sanctions which reportedly caused the country more than
50 billion U.S. dollars in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UK Lib-Dem Leadership Split Over Labor Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Liberal Democrats
ended its 4-day annual conference today in Brighton amid heated
debate on whether the party should join a coalition with Labor
after the next election.
</P>
<P>
Party leader Paddy Ashdown told delegates in his farewell
address that it would soon be "decisive day for Britain" in the
crucial last parliamentary poll of the century.
</P>
<P>
He also called on British voters to elect a substantial force
of Liberal Democrat MPs to the next parliament, enable the party
to put the "backbone" into the next government with radical
policies on welfare, education and crime.
</P>
<P>
While the party conference officials tried desperately to turn
delegates' attention to policy debates on the economy,
unemployment and energy, the question over whether the party
should be willing to join a coalition with Labor after the next
election still dominated the conference.
</P>
<P>
Ashdown himself said during the annual gathering in a series
of broadcast interviews that the party was "sovereign,
independent, and distinctive....but if working with others,
because they've come to agree with us, delivers those things, and
is good for Britain, then I'll do it."
</P>
<P>
As for the suggestion by Alex Carlile, Welsh Liberal Democrat
leader, that the party's MPs might take seats in a Labor
government, Ashdown said:"If I wanted to be a cabinet minister, I
probably wouldn't have been a Liberal Democrat."
</P>
<P>
That statement prompted political observers here to believe
that it is probably a realistic view of Liberal Democrats'
prospects.
</P>
<P>
But Labor's chief whip, Donald Dewar, played down the Liberal
Democrats as little more than "an important pressure group". The
observers said such statements are for public consumption. Behind
the scenes, Labor and the Liberal Democrats are conscious that
after the election they may have to work together.
</P>
<P>
However, Shirley Williams, a former Labor cabinet minister
rebuked the Labor in her speech at the conference by saying
Liberal Democrats would not "sell out" for a share in government.
</P>
<P>
"Liberal Democrats must not be diverted from our key policy
objectives. We must not exchange them for a handful of government
posts," she told delegates.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who joined the Liberal Democrats in the 1980s,
said:"It is our responsibility to hold any new government to them,
to support it in achieving them, to remonstrate or even withdraw
our support if it fails to attempt them."
</P>
<P>
The observers said the most thoughtful approach, designed to
hold the Liberal Democrats together without alienating Labor, has
been outlined by Menzies Campbell, the party's foreign affairs
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He believes that party should go hell for leather to win as
many votes as it can, to increase its moral case for a change in
the system of elections for the Commons to give his party fairer
representation.
</P>
<P>
After the election, Campbell believes the Liberal Democrats
should keep an open mind about whether to attempt a coalition with
Labor, in the event of a Labor victory.
</P>
<P>
He believes it is consistent with 30 years of Liberal Democrat
history to work for a realignment of British politics to create a
new "center left, non-doctrinaire, non-socialist" bloc.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Recalls Spy Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has agreed to
voluntarily recall a naval attache at its embassy in Washington
who allegedly received classified military information from a
Korean-American working at a U.S. naval intelligence office, U.S.
officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Foreign Ministry officials informed their American
counterparts in Seoul that Capt. Baek Dong-Il who arrived in
Washington in Oct. 1, 1994 for a three-year term, will be removed
from his post in Washington as the Clinton administration had
requested, State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said.
</P>
<P>
"He's been instructed to return to Seoul," he said. "This was
one of the items on our agenda, but it does not resolve the
issue.... We continue to insist on South Korea's full
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
An FBI affidavit released on Wednesday said that Baek Dong-Il
has received at least 50 secret documents from Robert Chaegon Kim,
working at the U.S. Office of Navy Intelligency in Suitland,
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 56, a native of Seoul, became a U.S. citizen in 1974 and
began working for the U.S. naval intelligence office in 1978. He
worked on a computer system that gave him access to top-secret
documents generated by other U.S. intelligence-gathering agencies.
</P>
<P>
Kim was arrested on Tuesday night when attending a reception at
Fort Myer, Arlington.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Kim did not apparently reveal any
information that could damage U.S. national security, such as the
names or locations of American intelligence agents. His action,
however, was unusual as was connected with such a close ally of
Washington, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration said it Praised the move (of
recalling Baek back to Seoul) as a good first step and predicted
the incident would not cause a rupture in relations with South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Is Yugoslavia's Internal Affair, President Lilic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic has stated that the southern province of Kosovo is an
internal affair of Yugoslavia and its Republic of Serbia, whose
"state integrity cannot be a subject for discussion as regards any
question."
</P>
<P>
This principled stand of Serbia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, for which there is a consensus throughout the world,
must be observed, President Lilic said in an interview to the
first issue of "Nedeljni Dnevnik" (Sunday Daily) which will be
published on Friday in Novi Sad, the capital of the northern
Serbian province of Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent accord between Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova had crowned
six years of efforts towards the establishment and operation of
Serbia's educational system in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached early this month has ended Albanians'
six-year boycott of the state school system by the province's
ethnic Albanians, which has persisted in spite of repeated calls
by Serbian authorities for the return of young ethnic Albanians to
regular schools.
</P>
<P>
The new move will help ease tension in Kosovo where the ethnic
Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the 2 million population
in the province, have often clashed with local Serbs and Serb
police in hopes of establishing a separate state.
</P>
<P>
Lilic noted that a large number of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
have shut themselves in ghettoes, putting their children and
youths into a very bad health and educational situation.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president said he maintained that the priorities
in the improvement of the situation in Kosovo were the
humanitarian aspects of the problem: education, health and medical
services, and social welfare services for children, women and the
elderly, so that space would open for the settlement of the
outstanding political issues.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Stresses Insistence on UN Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar today reiterated that all members of
the United Nations must adhere to the U.N. Charter in conflict
resolution, peace-keeping and peace making.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current session of the
U.N. General Assembly, Kadirgamar said that despite fashionable
theories about the need to limit national sovereignty, the U.N.
members remain sovereign, independent states.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "where the U.N. intervenes, it should do so
expressly within the terms of the Charter. The consent and
cooperation of states is vital, to ensure the success of any U.N.
endeavour which impinges on the territory of a member state," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In playing its role in conflict resolution and peace making, it
is important that U.N. should not stray into domestic issues and
conflicts which are within the domestic jurisdiction of the states
concerned.
</P>
<P>
"The Organization should play its role only with the acceptance
of the countries concerned....Otherwise, U.N. action could be
counter-productive and could lead event to the exacerbation of
conflicts. Nor should the U.N. mandates be used to serve the
interests of any one state of group of states," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations must not be used as a franchise to give
legitimacy to causes that may not reflect the general will of
the membership on whose behalf the Security Council should act
at all times, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, more than ever before, we must reaffirm our collective
respect for the fundamental principles of the Charter," he said.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Announces Plan to Stop Drug Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno said Thursday the dangerous drug methamphetamine "has
begun to spread rapidly from the West Coast across America," and
announced a new cooperative strategy in the Midwest involving 18
U.S. attorneys and 14 states.
</P>
<P>
"Methamphetamine manufacture and use has begun to spread
rapidly from the West Coast across America," Reno said. "...The
time to stop methamphetamine is now before it sweeps across the
country."
</P>
<P>
Reno made the announcement at her weekly news conference in the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The westward expansion of the meth phenomenon is marked by a
dramatic increase in the number of meth lab seizures this year,
according to Justice Department statistics.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in fiscal year 1995, there were 44 lab seizures
in Missouri by law enforcement at all levels. In the fist nine
months of fiscal 1996, there were 171 seizures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Thomas Monaghan of Omaha, Neb., said the meth
problem "in the Midwest is unique in that it is more rural in
nature."
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine stimulates the central nervous system and can
be made from simple and often legal "precursor" chemicals. It can
be made in "mom and pop" operations, especially in Missouri and
Kansas, Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
Monaghan said meth is no longer a drug used by young white
males, but has begun to show up in high schools and even junior
high schools.
</P>
<P>
A big danger, he said, is that the purity of the drug has
changed from 30-35 percent "to almost pure methamphetamine." The
drug costs less to manufacture than crack cocaine, he added, but
is sold for the same price.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very dangerous, very, very violence-inciting drug,"
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorneys coordinating the new strategy are based in
Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, south and central Illinois, North
and South Dakota, Kansas, Arkansas, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado,
Nebraska, Iowa and Utah.
</P>
<P>
Each U.S. attorney will designate an assistant to coordinate
meth investigations among federal, state and local law
enforcement. Also the U.S. attorneys will use some of their funds
to train law enforcement to detect precursor chemicals,
investigate labs, safely seize meth-making materials and
understand the effects of the drug.
</P>
<P>
The DEA and FBI have already begun training in many of the U.S.
Districts in the Midwest, the U.S. attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorneys' group also will launch a public information
project about the dangers of meth and develop school and
community-based programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanganyika
Farmers' Association (TFA) is in the process of reviving its
cooperation with its sister commpanies in Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Closing session of the fifth conference of
the Southern African Association's Farming system research and
extension (SAAFSRE) in Arusha, Northern Tanzania today, TFA
Managing Director Elias Mshiu said that before the break-up of
the East African Community in 1977, the TFA enjoyed good
cooperation with the Uganda Farmers Association (UFA) and the
Kenya Farmers Associaiton (KFA).
</P>
<P>
"We are again in the proceess of reviving this cooperation and
--- our great interest is to cooperate and collaborate with as
many other institutions with whom we share common objectives as
mucyh as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Study Finds Stunted Lungs in Young Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers have found
that lung development is impaired in teen-agers who smoke as few
as five cigarettes a day.
</P>
<P>
The more cigarettes teen-agers smoked, the longer they smoked,
the greater the damage to lung growth and breathing capacity.
While both boys and girls suffered lung damage from smoking, girls
were even more seriously affected than boys by comparable amounts
of cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
The findings were based on a 15-year study of more than 10,000
youth, which was conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of
Public Health and at Women's hospital in Boston. The latest
findings are being reported today in the New England journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that contrary to past experience, in
which boys were much more likely to smoke than girls, teen-ager
girls are taking up smoking at a faster rate than boys. 19 percent
of girls now smoke in adolescence, as against 17 percent of boys,
and every day, more than 3,000 adolescents in the United States
begin to smoke, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The annual tests of the lungs of children ranging from 10 to 18
years old show that children who smoked fared less well than those
who had never smoked. And the degree of lung impairment was
directly related to the amount they smoked and how long they had
been smoking.
</P>
<P>
The researchers advised teen-ager smokers to give up smoking as
soon as possible. Teens who do not take up smoking are likely to
have better respiratory health both in adolescence and later on in
life, they said.
