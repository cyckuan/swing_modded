<HEADLINE> Influx of Kazakhs Changes Kazakhstan's Ethnic Makeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Influx of Kazakhs and exodus of
other ethnic groups would change Kazakhstan's population makeup in
the near future, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report in the newspaper Ecological Messenger projected that
Kazakhs would account for 57 percent of the country's population
by 2015, 11 percent up from their current level.
</P>
<P>
Population experts attributed the change to immigration. More
Kazakhs would pour into Kazakhstan from neighboring countries and
other ethnic groups would begin an exodus out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Kazakhstan received some 2 million
immigrants during the 1991-1996 period, and a total of 721,000
people left for other countries during this time.
</P>
<P>
A January 1995 census showed there were 7.6 million Kazakhs and
5.8 million Russians in the country's population of 16.6
million. The number of Kazakhs would shoot up to 10 million and
that of Russians would drop to 3.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Start Exporting Oil Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid announced today that Iraq will start exporting crude oil
within the third phase of the oil-for-food deal early next week
from the Iraqi port of Al-Bakr and the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Rashid said that Iraq this
morning began pumping out oil to the oil tanks in both Al-Bakr and
Ceyhan for export
</P>
<P>
Rashid said that Iraq will give priority to the nations and
companies that support lifting the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions
on Iraq, and that there are no restrictions on Iraq's dealing with
any nation or company.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil pricing mechanism has been submitted to the
U.N. Sanctions Committee for approval, he said, adding the pricing
plan is expected to be approved within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Iraq stopped exporting oil early last month, claiming that it
will not sell oil under the third phase of the oil-for-food deal
between Iraq and the United Nations until the U.N. agrees to its
new plan for distribution of food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday approved the
distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, which came into effect in December,
1996, allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil over six
months to buy food and other humanitarian goods. The third phase
of the deal was approved by the U.N. Security Council on December
4, 1997.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Algeria to Discuss Steps Ending Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain, the current rotating
European Union (EU) Presidency state, urged here today the
Algerian government to hold talks with the EU in a bid to put an
end to the massive massacres in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
During a BBC television interview, British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said that the Algerian massacres will be a priority of
the British EU presidency and the 15-nation bloc may also be
prepared to help provide aid to communities shattered by the
massacres.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who had earlier proposed to send a high-level EU
delegation to Algeria, stressed that the urgent objective must be
to contain the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"We need to make it clear to the Algerian government that the
deep concern that exists in Algeria is shared in the wider
community and to explore with them how they might be able to
perform more successfully against the terrorists," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that hundreds of Algerian civilians have been
killed in the first few days of the holy Moslem month of Ramandan
and the Armed Islamic Group was likely to be blamed for most
killings.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary said that the Algerian situation would be
put on the agenda of the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting due to
be held on January 26.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Relief Efforts for Snowstorm Victims in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has, over
the past few months, exhibited extraordinarily great concern over
the snowstorm-hit people in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of financial and material assistance have been
sent to the affected areas, mainly in north Tibet's Nagqu
Prefecture, where many people have suffered from devastation
by the accumulation of heavy snow since last September.
</P>
<P>
A number of senior government officials, including Vice-Premier
Jiang Chunyun and State Councillor Li Guixian, have helped direct
relief activities and called on the local government and the
armed forces to provide full support for the victims.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army has sent vehicles and personnel to
assist the victims, with military aircraft airlifting large
quantities of relief materials to the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has played an extremely important role
by dispatching eight rescue teams to join in the relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the regional government has provided 27.25
million yuan in relief funds, 350 tons of food and 500 tons of
coal to the affected counties.
</P>
<P>
Local governments from throughout the nation have also donated
relief materials to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Command centers have been set up in all the devastated areas in
order to ensure the smooth shipment and distribution of relief
supplies and funds to the victims.
</P>
<P>
"The snowstorm in 1927 killed tens of thousands of Tibetans,"
said Losang, an 84-year-old Tibetan herdsman. "No one
has died of starvation or exposure when snowstorms hit Tibet last
September, although it was much heavier than that in 1927.
</P>
<P>
"We will never forget the love and kindness exhibited by the
government."

<P>
TEHRAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Iran has
denied reports that it is cooperating with the Bank Hapoalim of
Israel, the Iranian newspaper Salam reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Iranian bank said that it cut off relations
with the Israeli bank in 1980 and has no communication with it
since then, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
It described the report about its cooperation with the Israeli
bank as "mere lie".
</P>
<P>
Israel radio recently reported that Bank Hapoalim, one of the
three leading banks in Israel, retains ties with the Iranian bank
during the past five years despite the severance of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The radio also said that representatives from the two banks
signed an agreement in Cairo in 1992 on direct exchange of credit
documents.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Iranian Foreign Ministry denied reports about
cooperation between Iran and Israel, saying that the reports of
the Israeli media are aimed at distorting the image of the Islamic
Republic.

<HEADLINE> Iran Starts Geological Prospecting in Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it has
started geological prospecting operations in the Caspian Sea in
order to confirm its oil and gas reserves, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Oil Minister for Oil and Gas in the Caspian Sea
Ali Majedi was quoted as saying that it was the first time for
Iran to carry out geological prospecting works in the Caspian sea.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the prospecting operation was an essential step
for the country to estimate the oil and gas reserves in the area.
</P>
<P>
Although the Caspian littoral states and some international
institutions have announced their estimates about the oil and gas
reserves in the Caspian Sea, he said, the estimates could not be
confirmed because prospecting works have not been carried out
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, with an estimated reserve of 15.5 billion
barrels of crude oil and some 8.3 trillion cubic meters of natural
gas, is reported to be another oil and gas production center like
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the legal status of the sea, Majedi said that it
comprises the rights of sea navigation, exploitation of natural
resources over and under the seabed and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
However, the five Caspian littoral countries, namely Iran,
Russia, Khazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, have not reached
an agreement over the issue, he said, adding that the most
serious difference among the littoral states was how to explore
the natural resources in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly announced opposition to any unilateral
exploitation of the natural resources in the Caspian Sea, urging
the littoral states to speed up their negotiations to determine
the legal status of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Iran lodged a strong protest against Azerbaijan
after Baku started its oil exploitation from the Cheragh
reservoir of the Caspian Sea.

ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police have seized 12
kilograms of pure heroin in operations against drug trafficking
in Anatolia, central Turkey, semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Eskisehir Security Director Aydin Genc as
saying that the Turkish police stopped a car from Gaziantep
province bordering Syria to Eskisehir province on Friday and
seized the pure heroin hidden in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The police also detained five people in connection with the
drug trafficking, said the police officer.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a key transit route of drugs to Europe from the area
bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1996, Turkish police seized
4.4 tonnes of heroin, or 40 percent of the world's total haul,
12.3 tonnes of hashish, 233 kilograms of opium, 13 kilograms of
cocaine and 1,157 kilograms of base morphine.

<HEADLINE> EU: FIFA'S Agents' Licence System Clumsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EU)
said it would warn world soccer's ruling body FIFA that its
licensing system for the agents of professional players was too
heavy-handed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Willy Helin, spokesman for EU's Competition Commissioner Karel
Van Miert, said the Commissioner had asked for a rapid warning
letter regarding the licence system for professional player agents
be sent to FIFA.
</P>
<P>
The Commission particularly took aim at a requirement that
prospective agents make a deposit of 200,000 Swiss francs (about
135,593 U.S. Dollars) to obtain a licence.
</P>
<P>
Helin said the process for agents must get approval by both
their national federations and FIFA was rather heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
The Commission was reacting to complaints, saying that FIFA
rules may infringe EU regulations banning abuse of dominant
position and other restrictive practices.
</P>
<P>
The agents' licensing system was introduced to prevent the
abuse of unqualified agents acting as go-betweens who were accused
of racking up transfer fees artificially.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the European Court of Justice banned transfer fees for
out-of-contract players and removed limits on the number of
foreign players playing in clubs throughout the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Commission reiterated on Wednesday that it would not allow
such transfer fees despite allegations that the new system was
threatening small clubs.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new home sales went
up in November to the highest level in more than 11 years, the
Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Stimulated by strong consumer confidence and low mortgage
rates, new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 830,000, the highest since April 1986, the
department said. The figure represented a 5.1 percent gain from
October, the sharpest in a year.
</P>
<P>
New home sales surged 23.4 percent to a rate of 79,000 in the
East, highest in six months. They jumped 14.9 percent in the
Midwest to a rate of 162,000, the most since December 1993, and
4.9 percent in the South to a rate of 382,000, the most since
February.
</P>
<P>
Strong sales pushed the inventory of unsold homes down by 1
percent to 285,000 in November. That's a 4.2-months supply at the
current sales rate, the lowest backlog since July 1971.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home was 140,000 U.S. dollars in
November, a 2.4 percent drop from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
with unemployment at a 24-year low of 4.6 percent in November,
consumer confidence has soared to the highest level since 1969.

WARSAW, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Poland was a nation of 38.66
million people at the end of 1997, or 20,000 more than the total
in 1996, with the lowest growth since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Polish Central Statistics Bureau showed the
country's population increased only 0.1 percent three years in a
row, due to a low natural population growth rate in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The migration trend, now gaining momentum, also contributes to
the slow growth, as each year about 20,000 Poles move outside and
only 8,000 foreigners immigrate into the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of city dwellers are 23,000 more than those in the
countryside, resulting in the minimum gap since 1945.
</P>
<P>
The trend of moving from rural to urban areas has been
stagnated, while more urban dwellers are moving into small cities.
</P>
<P>
Polish women count for 51 percent of the population with
average life expectancy of 76.6 years, compared to men's 68.1
years.

UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,800 people
have died in Somalia as a result of the floods, a
latest report from the United Nations Department of Humanitarian
Affairs (DHA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the report, DHA says the United Nations Coordinator for
Somalia has confirmed that as of December 31, 1997, 1,855 people

Severe diarrhoea, malaria and respiratory infections are
reported to be widespread and have already taken a heavy toll.
Cholera outbreaks have been confirmed in Mogadishu and Merca,
and there are sporadic cholera cases in Kismayo, says DHA.
</P>
<P>
United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations
have appealed for 12.8 million U.S. dollars to move their joint

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The navies of Israel, Turkey
and the United States ended today their one-day joint maneuver in
eastern Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli corvettes, two Turkish frigates and one
U.S. destroyer took part in the exercise, code-named Reliant
Mermaid, which was held some 30 to 150 kilometers off the Israeli
coast.
</P>
<P>
The ships set off from the Haifa Port in northern Israel early
this morning to begin the exercise, which involved over 1,000
sailors from the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. and Israeli helicopters and an Israeli
reconnaissance plane also joined the small fleet in conducting
drills on searching for and rescuing ships and sailors in distress
on the sea.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai flew to the Israeli
Saar 5 corvette to inspect the drills. Rony Ben Yehuda, Israeli
Liaison officer aboard the U.S. destroyer, described the
search-and-rescue exercise as successful, saying that Israeli
navy would hold more exercises with Turkish and Jordanian navies
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The three-way naval exercise has been widely condemned by the
Arab world despite the assurances of the three countries that the
exercise was not targeting any other country.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world has become increasingly critical of Turkey,
accusing it of forging a strategic relationship with Israel mainly
aimed at deterring Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter plane pilots have been conducting long-range
flight drills over Turkish air space under a military cooperation
deal signed with Turkey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Iran blasted the
Israeli-Turkish alliance and the three-way naval exercise for
destabilizing the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the only Arab country that maintains close ties with
Israel, sent its Naval Commander Hussein Khassawneh to observe the
drill. But Egypt has refused the invitation to send observers to
the drill.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ex-President to Be Prosecuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
state president P W Botha would have to appear in a court since
he refused to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
Botha would be summoned to the George Regional Court in the
Western Cape Province on January 23, South African Press
Association quoted Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
Botha will face a two-year imprisonment or a fine of 20,000
Rand (4,080 U.S. dollars) if convicted on the main charge of
failing to appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
The alternative charge against Botha is hindering the
commission in the execution of its duties.
</P>
<P>
Kahn told a news conference that the decision was hard to make
considering Botha's age and health.
</P>
<P>
"He is almost 82 years of age and no attorney-general in any
civilized country lightly decides to prosecute a person of his
age, especially given Mr. Botha's medical history."
</P>
<P>
Kahn said he had considered all the circumstances and decided
that a prosecution was warranted in law and in the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
He added that the TRC had decided not to press charges in
relation to media references to its standing, and there would be
no further charges.
</P>
<P>
Botha has called the truth commission "a circus" and a "witch
hunt" against apartheid leaders, and said repeatedly that he
would not testify before it.
</P>
<P>
Botha had defied three subpoenas of the TRC for hearings of
the role of the former State Security Council, which he chaired
in height of the apartheid conflict.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu laid formal criminal charges against
him on December 19 when he failed to turn up at the hearing for a
third time in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Botha and the TRC flared up in mid-November
last year when Botha told a Sunday Afrikaans newspaper that he
would rather be prosecuted than appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was president between 1984 and 1989, refused to
apologize for the activities of his government, which vehemently
implemented apartheid policies. He insisted that he had done
nothing wrong.

<HEADLINE> UK Wants EU to Play Support Role in Mid-East Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain, which is holding the
European Union (EU) presidency, wants the EU to play "the best
supporting actor" in mediating the Middle East peace talks with
Washington as the chief mediator, according to a British
government official.
</P>
<P>
The senior British official was quoted by Reuters as saying
today: "We have to recognize that the United States is the chief
promoter of the Arab-Israeli peace process."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are re-engaging and Britain is well placed to
influence the Americans," the official said, adding, "We will try
to use the (EU) presidency to build a more effective bridge
between the European Union and the United States in peacemaking."
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook was determined to use the six-month British presidency to
achieve practical results.
</P>
<P>
During the British presidency, the official said that the Labor
government is likely to propose European monitoring of Palestinian
security cooperation with Israel and settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
"We could contribute by setting objective yardsticks on issues
such as security cooperation, which the Israelis use as a reason
for holding back on withdrawals from Palestinian territory," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Hold Municipal Polls, Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will hold municipal
elections on April 18 on a non-party basis and conduct a
population and housing census on March 2-18 this year, the cabinet
decided on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold municipal elections in April was made in
the light of recommendations made by the four provincial
governments and the General Council Meeting of the ruling Pakistan
Muslim League on Monday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The elections had been scheduled for February 7, but the
General Council Meeting did not approve the date because of harsh
weather conditions in the month in certain areas of Balochistan
and the North West Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming population and housing census will be the first
one in the country since 1981. A national data base will be
created during the census.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also discussed a summary submitted by the Ministry
of Water and Power and disapproved any increase in tariff rates.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Invite Bids for Deep-sea Oil Tapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Ministry of
Petroleum will invite international tenders for the first batch
of deep-sea oil tapping projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by the Petroleum Minister Albina
Assis during her meeting here with the Angolan Petroleum
Corporation and heads of foreign oil companies operating in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The areas to be opened to international tenders are rich in
oil resources, she said, adding that development in the areas
will help boost petroleum industry in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that in 1997, her ministry has approved
oil tapping in certain areas, including the approval for foreign
involvement in oil tapping in six new areas.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in the past two years, three large
off-shore oilfields had been discovered in Angola with the
collaboration of a French oil company, with respective oil
reserves of 100 million tons, 660 million barrels and 700 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Albina also hoped that foreign oil companies in Angola would
cooperate closely with the Angolan government this year to
maintain an annual growth of 10 percent in the country's oil
industry.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Six Opposition Parties Agree to Form Diet Bloc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Six Japanese opposition parties
decided Wednesday to form a joint parliamentary bloc to seek to
bring down Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government.
</P>
<P>
The six parties -- the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the
Taiyo Party, From Five, the Democratic Reform Party, the New Party
Fraternity and Voice of the People, as well as some independents,
will form a bloc of 97 members in the 500-seat House of
Representatives or the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the six parties said the bloc, to be headed by
Former Justice Minister Megumu Sato, was to be named the People's
Confederation of Democrats, Fraternity and Taiyo, or Minyuren.
</P>
<P>
The six parties and the Reform Club will also make a joint
group of 44 members in the 252-seat House of Councillors or the
upper house.
</P>
<P>
The two blocs will be the largest opposition groups in each
house, but will still be far weaker than the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party which has 259 and 118 seats in the lower and
upper houses respectively.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration, the six parties said that the new bloc will
demand that the government give precedence in the short term to
stimulating the economy instead of reducing the country's fiscal
deficits.
</P>
<P>
They also said they were determined to forward their proposals
to improve the economy at the 150-day regular Diet (parliament)
session which convenes on Monday and fight against the Hashimoto
government.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the six parties reached the accord after two
days of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The New Party Fraternity, Voice of the People and Reform Club
are three of the six groups formed after the New Frontier Party
(NFP) was dissolved in late December, while Taiyo and From Five
were formed by politicians who previously defected from the NFP.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Surge In UK With Imports Taking bigger share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.17 million cars were
sold last year, the third best on record in Britain, according to
the figures released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) announced
that 1997 sales were up 7 per cent from the 2.025 million recorded
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Registrations in December reached 84,000 cars, up from 78,141
recorded during the same month in 1996, SMMT said.
</P>
<P>
But the market still remains below its peak of 2.3 million
sales recorded in the boom year of 1989.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT figures also show that imports took a rising share of
the market, accounting for more than 65 per cent of total sales.
</P>
<P>
The Retail Motor Industry Federation (RMIF) said building
society windfalls and booming consumer confidence had boosted the
market, offsetting the rises in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But Christopher Macgowan, the RMIF's chief executive, predicted
sales would drop back slightly to 2.15 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Overhaul of Canada's Immigration System Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A massive overhaul of Canada's
immigration policy is needed to restore public confidence in the
system, according to a government-appointed panel.
</P>
<P>
The panel stressed the need for simpler immigration rules and
more stringent controls on people who claim refugee status in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
In a report released Tuesday, the panel recommended a yearly
cap on the number of newcomers and places greater emphasis on
English and French proficiency among all immigrants, including big
investors.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants who enter Canada without a basic knowledge of either
language should pay a tuition fee to offset the cost of language
training, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended the creation of two separate pieces
of legislation, one that deals with immigration and citizenship,
and another that covers refugees.
</P>
<P>
The report will open to public consultations next month. After
that, government bureaucrats will set to work on crafting changes
to the existing immigrant and refugee guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation could be ready by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Produce No Decision on Bombing Conspirator's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Terry Nichols escaped a death
sentence Wednesday as his jury deadlocked in the penalty phase of
the second Oklahoma City bombing trial in Denver, Colorado, and
was dismissed by the judge, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, a death sentence can only be imposed by a
jury. U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch had promised he would
issue a penalty of less than life in prison if jurors decided to
put the decision in his hands.
</P>
<P>
The jury had three options: issue a death sentence, send
Nichols to prison for life without parole, or send the case back
to the judge.
</P>
<P>
Nichols was convicted on December 23 of conspiracy and eight
counts of involuntary manslaughter for the April 19, 1995, bombing
that killed 168 people. He was acquitted of first-degree murder
and use of a truck bomb in the deadliest terrorist act ever on
U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
Nichols' former Army buddy, Timothy McVeigh, was convicted of
11 counts in June, including murder, conspiracy and use of a truck
bomb.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Buries Hope for Early Tax Reform in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The German government Wednesday
decided to drop its attempt to seek a compromise this year with
the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) on a major tax
reform in the country, saying that it is now up to the voters to
make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellory Minister Friedrich Bohl said in a statement
Wednesday that because the SPD was not ready for major
compromises, further tax negotiations this year would not "make
any sense".
</P>
<P>
He also announced that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling
coalition would hold on to its original tax reform package which
incorporates a net tax cut of 30 billion German marks (16.8
billion U.S. dollars) and would seek voters' support for the plan
during the next general elections scheduled for September 27, this
year.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Wednesday by leaders of the German ruling
coalition consisting of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) and the
junior partner Free Democratic Party (FDP).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the government's decision on Wednesday had
made it technically impossible to implement any major tax reform
in Germany by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tax reform is one of the major initiatives launched by Kohl's
government last year to boost the country's competitiveness as an
investment site and to attack the country's record high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The SPD has used its majority in the upper house of the German
parliament to block the government plan, saying that it is too
costly and socially unfair.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the government's refusal to conduct further
negotiations, the SPD said Wednesday that it would consider
whether it is now necessary to draft its own tax reform plan.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Museum to Be Under Tighter Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Antiquities Museum in
downtown Cairo will soon be well protected under a security plan,
Egypt's Culture Minister Farouk Hosni said today.
</P>
<P>
The security plan that was implemented almost 14 months
ago in the Egyptian treasure house will be "fully effective" as
early as next month, Hosni, also Chairman of the Higher
Antiquities Council, told the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The new plan includes using high-tech to secure all parts of
the museum and its surrounding areas against theft, fire or
terrorist attacks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 190 surveillance cameras have already been fixed on all
the doors, entrances and exits inside the museum and its
storehouse to provide the museum with a 24-hour protection, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the new security plan is estimated at 10 million
Egyptian pounds (2.94 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The protection of the museum, which houses some of the world's
most fascinating antiquities such as the mummies of many pharaonic
kings, is part of a comprehensive one-billion-pound drive to
enhance security in all Egyptian museums.
</P>
<P>
Security around the museum has been tightened since two
Egyptian brothers bombed a tourist bus parked in front of it last
September, killing nine German tourists and injuring 24 others.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of security coupled with the renovation program
of the museum since last summer to provide a new layout for some
chambers, as well as to install new lighting, ventilation and
air-conditioning systems, and specially designed showcases.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Museum houses a collection of antiquities on the
complete history of Egypt from the Pharaonic, Greco-Roman, Coptic
and Islamic periods to the present.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Vehicle Sales Up 18 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada's vehicle sales hit their
highest level last year since 1989, reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sales of cars, trucks and minivans jumped 18.2 percent for the
year to 1.39 million vehicles from 1.17 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Trucks led the way with an increase of 26 percent while car
sales climbed nearly 12 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
December sales finished the year strongly, aided by rebates and
reduced interest rates offered by some manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
And recent interest rate increases in the country actually
helped sales because people wanted to lock in financing before
interest rates jumped further, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the Big Three Canadian automakers recorded double digit
percentage increases in sales.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. reported 36,085 vehicle sales in
December, up 53.4 percent over 23,531 in December 1996. Total
vehicles sales for 1997 were 315,842, up 14.7 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
General Motors of Canada Ltd. reported 42,237 vehicle sales in
December, up 43.5 percent over December 1996. Total vehicle sales
for 1997 were 450,739, up 18.5 percent from that in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Canada Ltd. reported 23,243 vehicle sales in December,
up 9.9 percent over December 1996. Total vehicle sales for 1997
were 256,162, up 7 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign car makers also did well. Their December sales hit
32,336, up 59 percent over December 1996. Total sales for 1997 hit
361,250, up 30 percent from 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A Slice of life in Britain is
revealed in Britain 1998, an Official Handbook, published Tuesday
by the government's Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The handbook forecast that Britain's population will reach a
peak of 61.2 million by the 2020s and will start to fall from
about 2025.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, 1.06 million people emigrated from
Britain, and 1.19 million moved here from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The average age at which women give birth increased to 28.6
years in 1996 from 26.8 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was revealed that while the number of households
rose by seven million between 1961 and 1996, to 23.5 million,
average household size fell during that period from 3.1 to 2.4 and
has nearly halved during the course of the century.
</P>
<P>
The number of married couples has fallen by four percent during
the 1990s as many more people are choosing to live alone. In 1996,
12 percent of adults, comprising 28 percent of households, lived
on their own.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mixed Reactions in S. Africa to Botha's Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- There are mixed reactions
in South Africa to former state president P W Botha's prosecution
for defying a subpoena of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC).
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn announced today that
Botha would have to appear in court for failing to testify before
the TRC in hearings for the former State Security Council (SSC).
</P>
<P>
Botha would accordingly be charged in the George Regional
Court in the Western Cape Province and would be summoned to
appear on January 23.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he faces a two-year imprisonment or a fine of
20,000 Rand (4,080 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress immediately issued a
statement welcoming the move, saying it "underlines the principle
that no one is above the law irrespective of status in society."
</P>
<P>
The decision would "send a clear message that those who show
contempt for the feelings of victims of gross human rights
violations and the TRC processes will bear the consequences of
their own actions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision will reinforce the confidence of the majority of
people in the TRC process," it said.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was installed after the 1994 democratic general
elections to investigate atrocities in the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Dullah Omar also expressed his approval of
the prosecution move. He called on South Africans to respect and
accept the decision.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that we establish the rule of law in South
Africa."
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law requires that all law must apply equally to
all persons irrespective of status," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is my wish that justice should take its course and that
the South African public will see it in the same light."
</P>
<P>
The National Party, which Botha once led, however, complained
that the TRC had double standard in handling the cases of Botha
and ANC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The TRC's actions against Botha were in sharp contrast to the
accommodating attitude to ANC leaders who were granted blanket
amnesty, NP spokesman Daryl Swanepoel said.
</P>
<P>
"The different ways in which the role-players of the past are
handled by the TRC, and the lack of a uniform standard for all,
substantially undermines the remaining integrity of the TRC,"
said Swanepoel.
</P>
<P>
While conceding that "the law now has to take its course" and
appealing to Botha to respect the law, the spokesman said the TRC
had acted wrongly in forcing the issue to the current point.
</P>
<P>
The white-based Conservative Party also attacked the TRC. It
repeated earlier statements that the TRC was bent on undermining
Botha and belittling the Afrikaner, who had made the largest
contribution to South Africa's development.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Freedom Front, Constand Viljoen, said the issue
was not against Botha alone, but had impact on the entire
Afrikaner community. He appealed to all Afrikaners for moral
support to Botha.
</P>
<P>
"It (the prosecution) is not morally correct and will
definitely not contribute anything to making South Africa more
acceptable."
</P>
<P>
The TRC said it regretted the current situation, but added
that it had given Botha every opportunity to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped that matters would not have reached this
eventuality. We would have preferred that the current impasse
between Mr. Botha and the commission did not end up in a court of
law," TRC deputy chairman Alex Boraine said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It should have been possible to resolve differences, even
serious differences, through dialogue and discussion, as has been
the case in so many hearings of the TRC."
</P>
<P>
Boraine even appealed to Botha to change his mind at the last
minute to cooperate with his commission.
</P>
<P>
"Even in this 11th hour I would appeal to Mr. Botha to change
his mind and agree to appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
"If he refused to do this, then the law must take its course.
No one is above the law -- neither the lowliest nor the highest
in the land."
</P>
<P>
Botha, 81, was president between 1984 and 1989. The TRC laid
criminal charges against him last month immediately after he
defied a third subpoena to testify for the hearings of the SSC, a
powerful "inner cabinet" which Botha chaired in height of the
apartheid conflict.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Botha and the TRC flared up in mid-November
1997 when Botha told an Afrikaans newspaper, Rapport, that he
would rather be charged than appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Botha refused to apologize for the activities of his
government which vehemently implemented apartheid policies and
called the TRC a "circus" and a "revenge camp against the
Afrikaner."
</P>
<P>
However, he said last month that he would respect the law and
appear in court. His lawyer, Ernst Penzhorn, today confirmed that
his client would accept the summons and answer charges in court
on January 23.

<HEADLINE> Identification Process Goes Smoothly in Western </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman said the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is helping the people of
the territory to prepare for a referendum to decide between
independence and incorporation into Morocco.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, between December 3 last year and
January 5 this year, a total of 16,350 person were convoked and
10,036 were identified.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara was a Spanish colony until 1976 when Spain
withdrew and released itself from international responsibility
over the territory. The territory was subsequently occupied by
Morocco, a move which was opposed by the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO Front)
which took arms against Morocco forces.
</P>
<P>
Following diplomatic initiatives by the Organization of
African Unity and the United Nations, Security Council approved
a settlement plan for Western Sahara in 1990. Under the plan,
there would be a ceasefire, and a transitional period during
which the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations would be in charge of matters relating to the
referendum, assisted by the MINURSO.
</P>
<P>
The Plan was eventually bogged down by the two parties'
difference on certain groups of people to be included in the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough was achieved last year when a new Special
Envoy of the Secretary-General brought the two parties together
and they agreed to resume the identification process.

<HEADLINE> Britain Firm on Conditions over Zimbabwe's Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain said today it is
prepared to help finance Zimbabwe's land resettlement program
provided designed schemes are transparent, beneficial to the
poorest in the country and that the government fulfills its
international obligation regarding protection of investment.
</P>
<P>
Tony Lloyd, British Minister of State at the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office responsible for African affairs, told
journalists at the end of his two-day visit to Zimbabwe, his
country however had no direct obligation to fund land reform.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain's commitment was in the spirit of good
relations and as part of its moral obligation towards poverty
alleviation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said he had spelt out to Zimbabwe's acting President
Simon Muzenda the three parameters that Zimbabwe has to meet if
its request for further funding for land resettlement from
Britain was to be heard.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement scheme had to be done to benefit the poorest
people.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to help further on the basis that land
distribution should begin with poverty eradication. The
information we have is that significant land has not been
distributed to the poor landless people," Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
The other important factor was that the designed schemes
should be transparent in terms of guarding against corruption and
misuse of land.
</P>
<P>
The scheme also had to be done according to Zimbabwean law and
in compliance with the international obligations Zimbabwe has
already signed.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe has signed an investment protection agreement with
Britain although this has not yet been ratified. It says that
there cannot be arbitrary expropriation of investment," Lloyd
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the present land resettlement plans have not
conformed with these parameters. Our commitment is to help on
that basis but this has not yet been met," he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year the Zimbabwean government released a
list of over 1,500 farms earmarked for compulsory acquisition for
which compensation would be made for developments and not for
land.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said that if Britain wanted
"its children" to be full compensated it should provide the
money.
</P>
<P>
But Lloyd said his country had no direct obligation to do
that, adding his generation was not the generation which
benefited from the colonialism.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the current move by Zimbabwe had damaged the
country's international credibility as an investment destination
and this was a matter of concern.
</P>
<P>
Britain has provided the money for Zimbabwe's land
resettlement since 1980. However, it stopped land reform
assistance in 1989 following reports of failed resettlement
schemes.
</P>
<P>
Consultations have been going on for the resumption of further
assistance, but Britain has been against Zimbabwe's policy of
compulsory land acquisition, saying it has to be done on a
willing seller and willing buyer basis.

HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's acting president
Simon Muzenda today held a meeting with Tony Lloyd, British
Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, on
economic and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd is the first British minister in Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labour government to visit Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Lloyd told reporters that the visit
signified the importance with which his government viewed
relations with Zimbabwe as a partner in the southern African
region.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my visit has to do with strong relations we
have with Zimbabwe which go deeper than our differences on the
land issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd also said he had cancelled the trip to Zambia after the
arrest of former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda who was now on
house arrest, although there were no formal charges.
</P>
<P>
"This was not acceptable and therefore I could not complete
that part of my trip," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's KDP Releases 61 Rival PUK Captives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP) has released 61 prisoners of war (POW) of its rival Iraq's
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) under the instruction of KDP
leader Massoud Barzani, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a KDP radio report as saying that due to the
Ramadan (Islamic holy month of fasting), the KDP released the PUK
captives who were captured during the armed clashes between the
two rival groups in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the KDP released the PUK POWs in Erbil
region under the KDP control and they were taken to their homes in
the region under the PUK control.
</P>
<P>
PUK Chairman Jalal Talabani last Thursday sent a letter to
Barzani, seeking a broad reconciliation in a bid to set up a
permanent peace in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Talabani expressed his hope that Barzani would give a
"positive reply" for the future and freedom of the Kurdish people
in the region, proposing a high-level meeting between the two
factions to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two groups agreed on their latest ceasefire last November
after Talabani's forces attacked KDP's positions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two rivals have been fighting for the control of northern
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi government was
rendered ineffective by the U.S.-led allied forces to exert
influence there.

NICOSIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus was not affected by the
one-day Turkish-Israeli-U.S. joint naval maneuver that ended today
in eastern Mediterranean, according to a Cypriot government
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides
said that "we are following the developments. We have got
assurances that the exercise has nothing to do with Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cypriot Defense Minister George Charalambides said
Tuesday that the Cypriot government believed the three-nation
military maneuver would not heighten tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rising tension leading to dangerous episodes
in the region seemed to be over.
</P>
<P>
The search-and-rescue exercise code-named "Reliant Mermaid" was
held today, despite condemnation from neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Two Turkish frigates, a U.S. destroyer with two helicopters
and four Israeli vessels participated in the maneuver.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Envoys to Visit Cyprus for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Several top foreign envoys will
come to Cyprus at the end of March to prepare for the new round of
U.N.-sponsored direct talks between the two communities' leaders
on the island, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides as saying
that he was officially informed that U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Advisor for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez would be in Cyprus at
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, who visited Cyprus last November, had assured that he
would return to the island after next month's presidential
elections in the Greek Cypriot-controlled southern areas to
organize the peace talks between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
After Cordovez, Britain's special representative for Cyprus
Sir David Hannay would visit the island, followed by
U.S. Presidential Emissary, Richard Holbrooke, according to the
president.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of direct talks between Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash last summer failed to produce any results
after Denktash refused to negotiate in the wake of the EU
decision to start accession negotiations with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island in a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible progress has been achieved.

<P>
PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Wednesday said that European countries will get closer in their
economic policies in 1998, as the European single currency is one
year away from being implemented.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the Paris-based diplomatic corps in the
Elysee presidential palace, Chirac said that the process for
European countries to join the single currency should be
accompanied with an affirmation of the European social model.
</P>
<P>
"As an element for growth and jobs, the single currency will
lead us to a progressive rapprochement of our economic policies.
This process should go hand in hand with the affirmation of the
European social model," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a "competitive'' Europe will not contradict
a "humane" Europe, and instead the two features owned by Europe
can be complementary with each other.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the euro should be "a happy event" for all
countries in the world, as it would help stabilize international
monetary system.
</P>
<P>
"It will bring a major contribution to a better balance of the
international monetary system. Its birth will be an happy event
for all your countries," he told the ambassadors of all countries
to France.

<HEADLINE> Global Consulting Market to Continue Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Global management consulting
revenues are forecast to grow at an annual rate of nearly 16
percent to reach 113 billion U.S. dollars in 2000, according to a
U.S. research group.
</P>
<P>
Consulting revenues are expected to soar to 85 billion dollars
in 1998 from 73 billion dollars in 1997 and 62 billion dollars in
1996, with 98 billion dollars projected for 1999, the Kennedy
Research Group said in a press release today.
</P>
<P>
The Group, a leading information source on the management
consulting and executive search professions in the U.S., said the
business boom stems from growing demand on the part of new
business entrants and clients' pursuit of "one stop shopping".
</P>
<P>
As a result, consultants are forced into new service lines,
moving downstream from pure advisory work to implementation.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of information technology also helps boost the
consulting industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Group, the information technology share of the
consulting market is expected to rise to nearly 70 percent by 2000
from the current 64 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denounced for Violating Hebron Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Council today
denounced Israel for continuous violation of the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
the Palestinian Council said that Israel is still reluctant to
implement the Hebron agreement by refusing to carry out its troop
redeployment in the West Bank and to open the Shuhada Street in
Hebron city.
</P>
<P>
Israel also refused to close the vegetable market opened by the
Jewish settlers in Hebron without the approval of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), the council said.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron agreement, signed a year ago between Israel and the
PNA, stipulates that Israel implement its troop redeployment in
the West Bank in three stages, with the second stage to be
completed by last September.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli cabinet so far still can not agree on the
scope and timing of the second troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Shuhada Street has been closed by Israel for long due to
the conflicts between the Arab citizens and the Jewish settlers in
the city.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli actions would destroy the peace process and there
are dangers of possible explosions in the West Bank if Israel
continues violating the Hebron agreement," the council said.
</P>
<P>
It called on the sponsors of the peace process -- the United
States and Russia -- to put pressure on Israel to respect the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring the peace process back on track, U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross returned to the region Tuesday to have talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA President
Yasser Arafat on the redeployment issue, but no progress was made
till now.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief condemns Recent Attacks on Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today deplored the recent aerial attacks on Bamiyan airfield
in central Afghanistan while world Food Programme aircraft were
delivering emergency humanitarian relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the spokesman's office, Annan said
the attacks were carried out despite clearances received in
advance from the Taliban authorities. They not only prevented the
delivery of urgently needed food to 160,000 vulnerable people who
rely on the United Nations assistance, but also jeopardized the
safety of humanitarian workers.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General called on the Taliban authorities to
allow the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance and to
cease any action which endangers the safety of humanitarian
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief stressed it is unacceptable that the United
Nations personnel should be deliberately targeted while carrying
out their humanitarian mission.
</P>
<P>
He has instructed UN representative in Afghanistan to continue
to press the Taliban to give an assurance that the airlift of
food supplies to central Afghanistan can be safely resumed, the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> German Phone Fees Row Urged to be Solved Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Deutsche Telekom and its
competitors Wednesday were urged to meet next Monday in order to
negotiate a quick end to their dispute over telephone fees.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was triggered off when former monopoly of Germany's
telecoms market, Deutsche Telekom, last week announced it would
charge customers 95 marks (52 U.S. dollars) for changing
long-distance service providers and 53 marks for those who took
their phone number with them when they left Telekom.
</P>
<P>
Private competitors to Deutsche Telekom, which is still mostly
state-owned, complained such a move would harm a market that only
became fully open on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Telekom suspended its plan Tuesday to wait for a yes or no from
government regulators. It holds the extra charges to be necessary
for covering additional high costs of the open market.
</P>
<P>
It said it would spend 500 million marks over the next five
years on computers and software to handle customers who switch to
new carriers.

<HEADLINE> Germany Calls for Joint EU-Arab Efforts to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Wednesday suggested that countries of the European Union
(EU) and the League of Arab States (LAS) make joint efforts to
help stop a recent surge of massacres in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Kinkel in letters to Arab leaders
including LAS General Secretary Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Maguid and
Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, the German foreign ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
It followed another initiative from Kinkel over the weekend
which called for the dispatch of a EU mission to Algeria to offer
help to the government in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In the letters, Kinkel had expressed confidence that the
Algerian government would make all efforts to combat terrorism.
However, he also stressed that the crisis could not be solved by
military means alone and that a political solution was needed, the
German foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Given Algeria's strong resistance to all outside interference,
Kinkel said that the EU respected the country's sovereignty. But
he still held that a joint EU-Arab effort would be helpful.

<HEADLINE> Swine Fever Breaks out in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,000 pigs had died of
African swine fever since the disease broke out last December in
Beira city, in central Mozambque's Sofala Province, the
Mozambique News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the disease has spread to Caia and Gorongosa
regions in the province.
</P>
<P>
Swine fever first broke out in Sofala province in 1995, when
almost all pigs raised in the port city were affected.
</P>
<P>
Reports said swine fever is incurable. Local veterinarians had
advised regions which have not yet been hit by the epidemic to
kill all pigs and sell their meat.
</P>
<P>
They have also warned people to kill all pigs affected by the
fever and burn them before further damage is done.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government reportedly promised to compensate
pig raisers for their losses despite financial difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Bans Satellite News Broadcast by Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon today decided to ban
private television stations from airing news and political
programs via satellite, claiming some of them are harmful to the
country's image and its relations with other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a cabinet session Wednesday morning
and then declared by Lebanese Information Minister Bassem Al Sabaa
through the radio Voice of People.
</P>
<P>
Al Sabaa announced that the government has decided to withdraw
satellite newscast licenses from the privately owned Lebanese
Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) and Future Television station owned
by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
They are the only two stations which are allowed to air news
and political programs on satellite among the six functioning
stations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tele-Liban, the only state-run station, will be authorized to
operate satellite political and news programs service and other
stations may relay them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, he said, the government has ordered to form an
11-minister-committee to submit an assessment report of the
country's media to the cabinet within two months.
</P>
<P>
The government made the decision because some political and
news programs on satellite broadcast only focus on Lebanon's
negative issues and never show anything positive, he explained.
</P>
<P>
These programs have tarnished Lebanon's image and threatened its
relations with other Arab countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some Gulf Arab countries have complained that Lebanese TV
programs contain the social values and traditions that are
unacceptable to them.

ATHENS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece today voiced its opposition to

Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman

<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to rising foreign demand,
the orders for German machinery products continued to surge in
November, representing a seven percent increase over the level a
year earlier, Germany's machinebuilding association VDMA reported
Wednesday in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The VDMA said orders from last September to November registered
a rise of 19 percent on an annual base. During the three months,
foreign orders were up 29 percent while domestic orders up six
percent, compared to the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In November, overseas orders increased by 12 percent while
domestic orders stagnated partly due to the German government's
delay in reforming economy, according to the organization.

<HEADLINE> Asia Crisis Having No Impact on Euro: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's executive
body, the European Commission, today ruled out the possibility
that the financial crisis in Asia would have any impact on the
bloc's single currency plan.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis is likely to have a very limited impact, almost
negligible impact, on growth in Europe, and will have no impact on
achieving the euro within the foreseen timetable," Yves-Thibault
de Silguy, EU commissioner for monetary affairs, told a press
conference following a Commission discussion of the Asia crisis.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner told reporters that the EU's economic growth
prospects remained good, adding that there was no reason to alter
the Commission's growth forecast of three percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development put their forecast for the EU
growth at 2.8 percent for the year of 1998.
</P>
<P>
De Silguy also brushed aside suggestions that a deflationary
spiral could arise from Asia's crisis, saying that it was too soon
to start talking about the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Asian financial crisis continued Wednesday in the wake
of disappointment at Indonesia's 1998 budget and a weak Wall
Street performance on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner explained that since trade with Asia only
accounted for 2.2 percent of the bloc's gross domestic product and
nine percent of exports, there should be little risk that the
crisis would spread to EU countries due to trade links.
</P>
<P>
But de Silguy said the EU should remain alert to the situation,
adding there was also no reason to be totally complacent.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in Asia has complex causes and the mechanisms of
contagion are also complex," he told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said Asia's poorly supervised financial system
and the former ties between many Asian currencies and the U.S.
dollar were the main causes of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the crisis had resulted in a global
reallocation of capital, particularly in favor of U.S. and
European markets.
</P>
<P>
"This has boosted the dollar and driven down long-term interest
rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Silguy believed that the Asian countries had to find a
solution by themselves to the ongoing crisis. But he also
expressed his support for the assistance advocated by the IMF in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU should not substitute international
financial institutions, adding that it was the IMF's job to play a
key role in resolving the Asia crisis.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the Asian countries to reform their financial
systems and to reinforce their regional economic cooperation on
the EU model.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also reiterated the EU's support for China's
full integration with the global economy through future membership
of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata today condemned the escalating
violence in Burundi where an armed attack forced some 8,000
civilians to flee the tiny central African state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in Maramvya village in Bujumbura
Province and among the fled are around 3,000 survivors of last
week's massacre at the nearby village of Rukaramu, which left
more than 150 people dead, said a UNHCR report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Innocent civilians are clearly the targets. As in the attacks
on Congolese refugees in Rwanda, most of the victims are women
and children who are being chased further and further from their
homes," the commissioner was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers, including UNHCR staff, said they were unable to
reach Maramvya Tuesday to check for casualties, but met several
wounded villagers on the road leading to the area, a few
kilometers from the captial's airport.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR had already been providing aid, including blankets,
jerrycans and high protein biscuits, for the survivors of the
Rukaramu massacre which also caused 2,000 returnees to flee from
UNHCR's Gatumba transit center a few kilometers away.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Turkish-Israeli Military Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's growing military and
defense cooperation with Israel has drawn harsh criticism from
the Muslim world and Arab countries who fear it would change the
region's balance of power.
</P>
<P>
As the latest proof to such a cooperation, Turkey and Israel,
together with the United States, held naval and air joint
exercises in the international waters near Israeli coast today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed a series of military and defense
accords under which they share airspace and bases for training
purposes.
</P>
<P>
They have undertaken to jointly produce 500-kilometer-range
Arrow missiles and hundreds of 150 kilometer-range Popeye II
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israel will upgrade Turkish F-4 warplanes in a contract worth
630 million U.S. dollars, and will compete to win another
100-million-dollar deal of upgrading 48 Turkish F-5 fighters.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Jewish state are discussing several
defense-related projects under which Israel will supply the
Turkish Air Force with helicopter Airborne Rescue System and
modernize Turkey's aged M-60 tanks.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Israel is offering its Phalcon model to Turkey
which plans to buy a number of early-warning aircraft (AWACS) with
a total value of 800 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have defended their tightened military
ties. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said the relationship
"does not pose a danger for any third country."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who paid a visit to
Turkey recently, described the relationship as a strategic one,
adding "it is not targeted against anyone."
</P>
<P>
Both countries reportedly regard Iran, Syria and Iraq as
sources of potential threats.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is locked in a range of disputes with the three Muslim
neighbors. It accuses Syria of backing its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) and it is also in hot disputes with Damascus
over water resources and territory.
</P>
<P>
It accuses Iran of trying to export the Islamic revolution and
is deeply concerned about the ballistic missile potentials in Iran
and Syria.

<TEXT>
<P>
There are about 2,500 to 3,000 PKK rebels who often cross into
Turkey from northern Iraq to attack civilian and military targets
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The honeymoon between Turkey and Israel has worried the Muslim
world which believes the relationship is aimed at increasing
Israel's military superiority over its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In its eighth summit held in the Iranian capital of Tehran last
month, the 55-member Organization of the Islamic Conference passed
a resolution indirectly denouncing Turkey for its growing military
ties with Israel. Demirel had to withdraw from the meeting early
to shun criticism.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries in the Middle East, especially Syria, Iran
and Egypt, have criticized Turkey for its closer links with
Israel, saying that it threatens peace and stability in the region.
Syria has accused the two countries for forging a "covert
alliance."
</P>
<P>
The al-Baath newspaper, the organ of Syria's ruling Baath
party, said recently in an editorial that "this unannounced
alliance aims not only to bury the (Middle East) peace process,
but also to achieve new gains at the expense of the Arabs and
their legitimate rights...and consequently, to impose a 'fait
accompli' policy."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has said that "these
policies will lead to an arms race and the return of tension to
the region."
</P>
<P>
Iran has complained about the expanding military ties between
Turkey and Israel, and accused Turkey of sheltering Iran's
opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that Turkey will continue to further ties
with Israel in the fields of military and defense industries
despite increasing pressure from some Arab countries in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Rejects EU Proposal on Aid to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government Wednesday
categorically rejected a proposal by the presidency state of
European Union (EU), Britain, on European aid to the victims of
massacres committed by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Habib Chawki Hamraoui, spokesman of the Algerian government,
said that Algeria has not "solicited any form of aid" to the
population of the region struck by the massacres, according to
reports from Algiers.
</P>
<P>
"The Algerian people have the well-known dignity and have not
solicited any form of aid for their victims... They urge by
contrast the respect of their martyrs fallen in the fight against
terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also condemned the "barbarous crimes" committed
over the past several days, while reiterating the "firm and
unshakeable" rejection of all international interference.
</P>
<P>
He called on Algerians to "double mobilization and vigilance"
and said the government would continue its fight against terrorism
"without fail."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Algerian government to make a
public declaration after several hundred people have been killed
in Algeria since the beginning of the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan last week.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Algeria said 62 people were killed and 48 wounded
in a latest wave of violence committed against civilians by
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
In a response to some news reports by Western media, the
spokesman also said that the Algerian government condemns any
"attempt which tries either to cover up or spread doubt over the
sources of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He said the Algerian government is taking into account
different attitudes held by "all its partners."
</P>
<P>
The EU will discuss the forms of aid to be brought to the
victims of the massacres during an experts' meeting in Brussels on
Thursday.

ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's implementation of
10-mile air space will not be recognized by any country, including
Turkey, as it is against international law, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Necati Utkan said today.
</P>
<P>
Utkan made the remarks at a weekly press conference here after
Greece Tuesday criticized Turkey for violation of its airspace.
</P>
<P>
He said that the implementation of the 10-mile national air
space "is an absolute violation of international law."
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Ministry sources said Tuesday that when Greece
celebrated Epiphany, Turkish F-16 warplanes infringed air control
regulations in the Athens flight information region (FIR) north
and south of Lesvos island in the eastern Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
On 14 occasions, Turkish warplanes violated Greek national
airspace in the region over the islands of Psara, Chios and
Oenousses, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time (in one month) that the Turkish air
force is carrying out provocations during a religious holiday in
violation of an agreement to refrain from such actions during
religious holidays and anniversaries," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Greece and Turkey reached a "memorandum agreement" to
promote confidence-building measures between the two countries on
the principle of good-neighborliness. The agreement calls for
respect of each other's major religious holidays.
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Day, Athens also condemned Ankara for violation of
its airspace by Turkish jet fighters.

BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners living in Germany
totaled 7.31 million by the end of 1996, amounting to about 9
percent of the country's total population, the latest available
government data released today said.
</P>
<P>
According to a German government report, the largest group of
foreigners, 2.05 million, are ethnic Turks, who account for about
28 percent of Germany's total foreign population.
</P>
<P>
They are followed by 754,000 Yugoslavs, nearly 600,000
Italians, 363,000 Greeks, 342,000 Bosnians, 283,000 Poles, 202,000
Croats and 185,000 Austrians.
</P>
<P>
About 1.43 million, or 20.5 percent, of all the foreigners were
born in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Almost two thirds of all Turks and Greeks, and 71 percent of
Italians have already lived in Germany for 10 or more years. A
large number of them are so-called guest workers who began
migrating to Germany nearly four decades ago to help ease the
country labor shortage after World War II.
</P>
<P>
However, despite their long-time residency, most of the
immigrants had not been fully integrated into the German society
so far, the report admitted.

<HEADLINE> Nemtsov on Main Task in Russia in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Main tasks for Russia in this
year is to keep the improving economic situation under control,
and to have "major structural transformations in the country",
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Interfax news agency Nemtsov
said such structural transformations are economic growth, slashed
taxes, and timely pay.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country should finally abandon "the common stock"
principle of making social benefits available to all but actually
to no one and adopt a social security system, by which benefits
are addressed to those who really need them, Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
Another major restructuring task, in Nemtsov's opinion, is "to
establish an elementary state order: secure customs borders so
that there would be no contraband and fight against the illegal
production of vodka and alcohol."
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov stated that the main task in 1998 is to achieve an
economic growth, "above all an industrial growth of up to four
percent a year." He believed this can be achieved by changing the
system of taxation.
</P>
<P>
As for privatization, the First Deputy Prime Minister holds it
is not a goal in itself, nor is it the main means to attain an
economic growth. He stressed that "competition is more important
than privatization. Creating competitive conditions is more
important and healthier for society than privatization".

place of viable marketing structures is of paramount importance
to enabling farmers sell their products at a reasonable price and
improve their financial status to purchase inputs and finished
goods through the intensification of endeavors to add more gains
to the success scored in attaining food self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the five year peace, democracy and development
program envisaged by the EPRDF has proved successful over the
past two and half years. The EPRDF should strive to achieve self-
sufficiency in food at the family level in arid areas devising
mechanisms of raising the income of the populous residing in
those localities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meles emphasized that roads, power supply, telecommunications
and the provision of safe water could play for the enhancement of
development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the EPRDF to diversify and
raise the quantity of export items in a similar favor through
which it has scored achievements in boosting agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,050 participants attended the conference. The agenda of
the conference is the implementation of the front's five year
peace, democracy and development plan and the election of council
and executive committee members.

<HEADLINE> Ross: No Information on Further Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross said here today that he has not yet received any
information on the further redeployment in the West Bank during
his talks with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman at the
president's residence today, Ross told reporters that no statement
from the Israeli side concerning the extent of the second
withdrawal has been given to him since he began a new round of
efforts to advance the peace process Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat Tuesday
night, said that in today's meeting Weizman and he discussed ways
to get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that it is very important for Israel to continue
the peace talks, but he did not express his opinion on the further
pullback.
</P>
<P>
The president asked Ross and his advisers to give backing to
Netanyahu, who is mired in a domestic political crisis generated
by the resignation of moderate Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu Tuesday also refused to discuss with Ross the
exact scope of the second withdrawal, saying that no decision on
the issue has been taken by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
But local media reported that Netanyahu intends to reduce the
scope of further redeployment from over 10 percent to 8 percent so
that his proposal on the issue can be passed by the cabinet, which
is dominated by the right-wingers after Levy's departure.
</P>
<P>
However, Ross Tuesday night informed Arafat that the United
States is sticking to its position that Israel must hand over at
least 10 percent of the territories to the Palestinians in the
second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat, who attended
Tuesday's meeting between Arafat and Ross, today confirmed that
Ross believed internal political crisis in Israel should not
change Israel's stand to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross will meet Netanyahu and Arafat again before he concludes
his mission Friday.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves Financing for Belize Highway Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 16
million U.S. dollar loan to Belize to help upgrade and maintain 64
kilometers of the Southern Highway.
</P>
<P>
The resources will also be used to help rehabilitate about 176
kilometers of rural feeder roads.
</P>
<P>
The preparation work started in 1993. Earlier last year, the
IDB approved a 2.6 million dollar loan to finance technical
assistance for addressing some environmental and social concerns
within the context of a regional development plan to be prepared
with active participation of local residents.
</P>
<P>
The overall objective of the highway project is to improve the
economic opportunities for the people living in the southern
region by integrating that part of the country into the rest of
Belize.
</P>
<P>
Upgrading the road is designed to increase traditional and
nontraditional agricultural activities, promote tourism, improve
access to education, health and other social services as well as
reduce soil erosion and highway maintenance costs.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rejects UN Peace Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said today that he will not consider any peace proposals
by the Untied Nations at the moment, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the announcement following his meeting with
U.N. Cyprus envoy Gustave Feissel in Nicosia, the capital of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier press reports said that U.N. special adviser on
Cyprus, Diego Cordovez would visit Cyprus in March with a set of
peace documents.
</P>
<P>
"If Cordovez comes here, we will talk with him, but we will not
discuss any documents," Denktash was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader declared as "dead" the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks concerning Cyprus last month when the
European Union (EU) officially invited Greek Cypriots for the
accession talks, while excluding Turkey from the enlargement
process.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the Cypriot government had no legal right to
apply for EU membership on behalf of the whole island, whose
northern third was controlled by Turkish Cypriots and Turkish
army.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish troops
intervened in the wake of an abortive pro-Greece coup.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to find new common ground for starting the
talks. The common ground is the reality on the ground," Denktash
said, adding that the international community should recognize
the legitimation of the Turkish Cypriot authorities.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, however, said that Turkish Cypriots did not want to
kill the peace process, adding that they would be as flexible as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that the U.N. is adopting a
"wait-and-see" approach and will make concrete decisions after the
Cypriot presidential elections scheduled for February.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been sparing no
efforts to strive for a settlement of the protracted Cyprus
issue, but so far no substantial results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Seeking Alliance with Non-Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official today
denied that his government is bending the country's pan-Arab
policies to seek alliance with non-Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
While delivering a speech to the Parliament today, Jordan's
Deputy Prime Minister for Services and Administrative Development
Abdullah Ensour said that Jordan is not seeking any military or
political alliance through its participation as an observer in the
U.S.-Turkish-Israeli navy exercise in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Joint military exercises have been taking place in the region
for some 20 years and some of them even involved the countries
that are now criticizing Jordan's participation in the three-way
one-day exercise, said Ensour.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh, in another speech
to the Parliament, echoed Ensour's views, saying that Jordan's
participation is only a sovereign issue and the exercise is just
for search and rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The current exercise is dramatized by the media in a way that
goes beyond military and political significance, Tarawneh told the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators attacked the Jordanian government for sending
Navy Commander Hussein Khassawneh as an observer to the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the only country in the Arab world that responded to
Turkey's invitation for the exercise and sent an observer there.
</P>
<P>
The joint exercise, code-named Reliant Mermaid, was held
today. It lasted only four hours. Five U.S., Israeli and Turkish
warships and some aircraft and helicopters took part in the
exercise which is widely thought to target Syria and Iraq and has
been drawing harsh criticism from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and Iraq are spearheading an Arab campaign
against the growing military cooperation between Turkey and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed two military cooperation agreements
in 1996 and are discussing several defense-related projects.

<HEADLINE> Shortlist of Arms Suppliers to S. Africa Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's military
equipment overhaul moved into the decisive phase as the Defense
Ministry has approved a shortlist of products and suppliers for a
proposed 10-billion-Rand (2.04-billion-U.S. dollar) arms deal, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"A shortlist of products and suppliers has been approved and
countries are in the process of being informed accordingly," Defense
Ministry spokesman Puso Tladi said today.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to elaborate which countries made the list
until the relevant countries had been formally informed of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Germany, Britain, Canada, Italy, Spain and
France had made the cut, while arms manufacturers from Russia, Brazil
and Denmark had been excluded.
</P>
<P>
The six countries were expected to receive a formal request for
proposals within the next few weeks. The document would call for
detailed offers on counter-trade and financing for the weapons.
</P>
<P>
The process has been slow mainly because no detailed plans for
counter-trade measures were made.
</P>
<P>
The program requires the suppliers to invest a portion of the value
of the contracts in civilian and military production in South Africa
to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The offers would be processed and presented to Defense Minister Joe
Modise and then the cabinet, probably in the second quarter of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal includes corvettes, submarines, fighter aircraft
and tank.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that five corvettes were shortlisted, including
the German Meko 200 and 200A, the French Lafayette, and ships offered
by Spain's Bazan and Britain's Yarrow yards, the Business Day
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Italy's offer, which included a proposal to build two of the four
warships in South Africa, was rejected on technical grounds. The ship
offered by the state-owned Fincantieri yard was judged unsuitable for
South Africa's rough waters.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Daimler-Benz, France's Mirage and Sweden's Saab Gripen
are understood still to be in the running as the South African Air
Force's next generation of fighter-trainer jets. Neither Britain's
Hawk nor Russia's Mig-29 are understood to have made the cut, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Three manufacturers -- Canada's Bell, Italy's Agusta and the
French-German firm, Eurocopter -- are still in the race to supply the
successor to the South African Air Force's Alouette light utility
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Westland and France's Cougar were shortlisted as
potential maritime helicopters which would become part of the
corvette's equipment.
</P>
<P>
Among the battle tanks shortlisted are the French Leclerc and the
British Challenger. Russia's T-80U tank was excluded as Russia's
counter-trade offer did not meet minimum requirements, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks UN Peacekeepers to Stay Longer </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIRUT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon today asked the United
Nations to extend for another six months the mandate of its
Interim Forces in South Lebanon (UNIFIL) which expires on January
31, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The request was contained in a letter addressed to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan by Lebanese ambassador to the
U.N. Samir Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the role played by this troop over the past
years, saying that in view of the current Israeli occupation of
south Lebanon and repeated attacks on this area, the UNIFIL
reflects the international community's commitment that Lebanon
must regain its full authority on its territory.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL takes the responsibility of helping assure Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon and restore peace and security on
both sides of the frontier, the ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong peacekeeping force was established in March,
1978 after Israel's invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has long complained that the force has been ineffectual
in protecting its northern border from Lebanese guerrillas
attack.

<HEADLINE> 1.2 Million People Affected by Drought in PNG: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 400,000 Papua New
Guineans were experiencing critical shortages of drinking water,
and 1.2 million people overall were affected by the punishing
drought there, an official report released here Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by Australia's official aid agency AusAID on behalf
of the Papua New Guinea (PNG) government, the report warned that
the situation in PNG would worsen before improving around May.
</P>
<P>
"Even with reasonable amounts of rain from now onwards, the
number of people without adequate food will continue to increase
with the worst period to occur, around February and March 1998,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
"From April 1998 onwards conditions will improve reasonably
quickly, so that by May 1998, probably only those people who live
in the high altitude areas will remain with no local means of
support."
</P>
<P>
The report also warned of continued problems with the nation's
water supply, saying 47,000 people had only extremely limited
amounts of contaminated water for drinking, and 363,000 others had
to carry water of variable quality for excessive distances.
</P>
<P>
"Despite rain during November and December, most local sources
of water remained inadequate," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Water is expensive for aid agencies to transport and difficult
to distribute.
</P>
<P>
But the report said it expected the water supply to improve
over the next two months, as long as rainfall continued.
</P>
<P>
And it said an epidemic of dysenteric disease, which may have
been expected from the drinking of polluted water, had not
occurred.
</P>
<P>
"Around 1.2 million people or 40 percent of an estimated 3.15
million rural dwellers in PNG are suffering a severe, and to some
a life threatening food shortage," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who found themselves without food other
than what they could collect from the bush had grown to 260,000,
while those who had only small, inadequate amounts of food had
expanded three times to an estimated 980,000.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that replanting was vital, saying in parts
of PNG, there was a critical lack of planting material.
</P>
<P>
It also said there were many reports of people dying from what
appeared to be the complications of eating bush foods, in
particular bush leaves.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan Thursday said that
Australia's relief efforts to distribute food to remote areas in
PNG by air would be stretched to the limit by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that by the end of this month we will be putting
out around about 1,000 tonnes a month which is just about as much
as we can handle militarily," McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian relief operation had distributed 1.3 million
kilograms of aid materials, he said.

BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese National Defense
Minister General Chi Haotian today reiterated that China should
be always prepared for a people's war, though the world has
developed into a hi-tech age.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the remarks during a lecture at the National Defense

In his lecture, entitled "People's Wars under Hi-Tech
Conditions", the minister said that the theory applies to the new
situation, and is applicable to problems and challenges
accompanying the rapid development of high technology.
</P>
<P>
Development of the nation's hi-tech industry has provided
great impetus to the theory of the people's war, according to Chi.
</P>
<P>
He urged emancipation of the mind, correctly understanding
the trends in worldwide military developments and learning from
foreign armed forces in order to deal with new problems the Chinese
army might meet under the new situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China produced 166.3 tons of
gold in 1997, up 37.9 percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dexue, director of the Gold Administration under the
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, made the announcement today at
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The country's gold industry earned profits during 1997,
despite the world's sluggish gold market.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the achievements to the gold industry's ongoing
market-oriented restructuring which has strengthened management
and the viability of local gold producers.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that China's gold industry faces difficulties
and challenges centered on the fact that the gold prices are
declining on both international and domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the country is short of gold
resources.

<HEADLINE> Service Industry Important for Hong Kong: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said here Thursday that Hong Kong must take action to preserve and
enhance its position as a premier services center in Asia through
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a tripartite forum on Hong
Kong's service industry attended by government officials,
businessmen and academics, Donald Tsang, financial secretary of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said Hong Kong's
economy is now firmly rooted in services.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy has been transformed from the manufacturing
industry to the service industry in the past two decades, Tsang
noted. "We must build on our strengths in order to sustain our
economic growth. Services will continue to provide our competitive
edge in the days to come."
</P>
<P>
"This contributes to my confidence that Hong Kong will be the
first among others in rising up from the financial turmoil
troubling Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsang asked the participants of the forum to express their
views on how Hong Kong can best take advantage of the reform of
the state-owned enterprises in China's interior areas and how Hong
Kong can make the most of global trade and investment
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to identify the challenges and opportunities
that lay ahead as the world enters the Information Age and think
about how Hong Kong should prepare itself for the next phase of
the services era and what Hong Kong should do to increase its
services productivity in order to enhance its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"There may not be ready answers to these questions but I look
to you for views so that we can make a start in identifying the
way forward. Identify the obstacles and problems so that we can
together tackle them, and eventually overcome them," Tsang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
attended a ceremony today marking the signing of a Sino-Foreign
cooperative contract for coalbed methane production in Huaibei
coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The project between the China United Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd.
(CBM) and U.S.-based Texaco, the first of its kind officially
approved by the state, will involve the exploration of 2,663
square kilometers of coalbed methane resources in east China's
Anhui Province. The project will involve a total investment of 500
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with senior Texaco Vice-President Robert Black
prior to the signing ceremony, Premier Li Peng said that China has
vast coalbed methane resources, and noted that the planned
exploration and use of related resources will yield substantial
profits.
</P>
<P>
"This will conduce to improving China's energy structure,
accelerating the development of a clean gas energy industry,
reducing air pollution and protecting the environment," according
to Li,
</P>
<P>
The development of coalbed methane in Huaibei coal mines will
have even greater significance since there are a large number of
people living in cities along the Huaihe River, said Li, adding
that related efforts will greatly benefit people living in the
area and enhance the environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the Chinese and U.S. sides cooperate closely to
ensure that the project enters production at an early date," said
Li.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed the need for strong management, improved
efficiency, exploration and the introduction of new
technology.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has appointed 28 famous Iranian political, economic,
cultural and religious figures as presidential advisors to help
him in the country's administration.
</P>
<P>
Khatami hoped that the advisors would offer proposals and
suggestions to him after consultation with other groups, Iran's
evening newspaper Kayhan reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that it was the first time for an Iranian
president to appoint so many presidential advisors and it showed
Khatami's determination to enforce rule of law in the country and
to solve the problems facing the country, particularly the issues
of freedom of speech, inflation, unemployment and the youth.
</P>
<P>
During the May presidential elections campaign last year,
Khatami promised a new Iranian society with rule of law and more
freedom for the people.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of rule of law in the country,
Khatami formed last November a five-member body to monitor the
implementation of the country's constitution.

<HEADLINE> HK Basic Law Promotion Committee Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Basic Law
Promotion Steering Committee held its first meeting Thursday to
discuss the overall stratagem for the promotion of the Basic Law
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of every citizen to have a basic and
clear understanding of the contents of the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic
of China, said Anson Chan, administrative secretary of the SAR and
chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Chan told reporters after the meeting that the Basic Law sets
out very clearly how the principle of "one country, two systems"
operates, what are the systems that will continue to operate
within the SAR and the rights and obligations of each citizen.
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose of the Steering Committee would be to try and
take an overall view and in particular to coordinate the effort of
all the different parties who are currently involved in promoting
the Basic Law," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the question of promoting the Basic Law is not a new
matter, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
It is an issue that has been dealt with for many years, both
through government efforts and in particular through the sustained
effort of people like members of this committee, through other
voluntary agencies and other organizations, she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan went on to say that the targets of the promotion of the
Basic Law are the community, school students, civil servants and
overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The committee will hold regular meetings in the future to
discuss how to further promote the Basic Law, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, set up on January 2 with Chan as the chairman
and Ko Siu Wah as vice-chairman, comprises 13 non-governmental and
 nine governmental members.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Complaints Rise Sharply in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 saw a
substantial rise in the number of consumer complaints, totaling
11,535 cases and making it the highest on record, the Hong Kong
Consumer Council announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of complaints went up 31 percent from 8,805 cases in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The categories that recorded most complaints included
electrical and telecom appliances, with 1,763 cases; furniture,
with 976 cases; and properties, with 777 cases.
</P>
<P>
Modeling agencies registered 638 cases in 1997, representing a
steep rise of 215 percent over the previous year. Dried seafood
and ginseng shops and beauty saloons also saw a notable rise in
complaints.
</P>
<P>
The jump was probably due to the current economic downturn as
the bulk of the increase occurred in the latter half of the year,
said the council's chairperson, Anna Wu, who predicted that the
rising trend is likely to continue into 1998.
</P>
<P>
Research on consumer policy issues, trade practices and legal
protection will be the main focus of work for the council in the
new year, she said.
</P>
<P>
The research will provide much needed crucial information for
improving consumer protection as the marketplace becomes
increasingly globalized and complex.
</P>
<P>
Consumer education will also be a priority, to enable consumers
themselves to safeguard their own rights and interests in the
purchase of goods and use of services, she added.

<HEADLINE> Port of First Asylum Policy to Be Scrapped: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Security Peter
Lai announced Thursday that the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government has decided to abolish the port of first
asylum policy for Vietnamese people arriving here illegally in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been made with regards to "changed
circumstances in Vietnam, the nature of recent illegal arrivals
and widespread calls in the community for scrapping the port of
first asylum policy," the official told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), the legislature of
the SAR, carried a motion on August 20 last year urging the
government to end the policy imposed by the British government in
1979.
</P>
<P>
"What the abolition would mean in practical terms is that there
would be no more special treatment for Vietnamese illegal arrivals
in Hong Kong in future. They would be treated in the same way as
are illegal arrivals from any other country," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The change of policy would involve amending the Immigration
Ordinance, which contains special provisions for screening for
refugee status and review procedures for Vietnamese people
arriving in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent a possible influx of Vietnamese into Hong
Kong between now and the passage of the amendment bill by the PLC,
it is proposed that the special provisions of the ordinance should
cease to apply to new arrivals with effect from Friday when the
amendment bill is gazetted, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of the port of first asylum policy is part and
parcel of a package of measures to deal with the remaining
Vietnamese problems in Hong Kong, following the completion of a
comprehensive review conducted by the government of its policy on
Vietnamese refugees (VRs), Vietnamese migrants (VMs) and
Vietnamese illegal immigrants (VIIs).
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has for the past several months won full
support from the Central People's Government, either at
international conferences related to the issue or in negotiations
with the Vietnamese side, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Since the emergence of the Vietnamese boat people in 1975, Hong
Kong has received more than 200,000 people from Vietnam. Of these,
some 143,000 have been resettled in third countries and about
69,000 VMs and VIIs have been returned to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In terms of numbers, this represents a successful resolution of
98.5 percent of the problem, Lai told an earlier briefing to
members of a PLC panel on security.
</P>
<P>
But there still remain about 1,200 VRs, 700 VMs and 1,100 VIIs
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The government will press the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees to continue its best efforts to resettle the VRs and it
will also work together with the Vietnamese government to
repatriate the others, Lai said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Spend More on Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government Thursday
decided to spend more to help the development of science, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told a cabinet session that
more than four percent of the 1998 state budget would go to the
country's research institutions.
</P>
<P>
At the same session, the cabinet approved guidelines for
reforming the research system in years 1998-2000, and Chernomyrdin
urged the implementation of the program.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said economic reforms in
the country were impossible without the development of science and
the speedy implementation of these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Budget funds, Bulgak said, should be spent primarily on state
scientific research institutions and priority research projects.
</P>
<P>
The science budget was estimated at 14.2 billion redenominated
rubles (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, rising from the
10 trillion old rubles (1.7 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet decided to use private funds for
science, which currently account for 25-50 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Bulgak warned of a "brain drain," saying Russia had only 1
million scientists in 1997, compared with the 2 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,200 Russian scientists have so far settled down outside
the country permanently and 30 percent changed their occupations
mainly due to the lack of project funding.

<HEADLINE> Somali Shilling Appreciates Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Amid the anarchy in the
country, the super decentralized economy of Somalia is
strengthening with the Somali Shilling increasing in value
against foreign currencies in Mogadishu's main business centers.
</P>
<P>
Today, the U.S. dollar took a new low in its history in
Mogadishu's main Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar which was sold 8,700 against the Somali
Shilling six months ago, today is exchanged with only 6,300 in
the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
Business and money dealers agreed that the new depreciation of
the dollar is related to the new political trend and optimism
following the Cairo agreement signed by the Somali factions
including the two main warlords, Ali Mahdi and Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Abdi Mohamed Ali, manager of a local business company in
Bakara market, told Xinhua that despite the hope for a political
settlement in the near future, many Somalis are receiving hard
currencies from their relatives abroad for the Holy month of
Ramadan and the Eid festivals that follows.
</P>
<P>
Another clue devaluating the dollar is the wish of the
businessmen to sell out all their stock before air and seaports
in Mogadishu are opened. Goods from the new seaport will of
course be much cheaper than those imported through the natural
seaports outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is trying to get rid of the old stock," said Ali.
</P>
<P>
Business movement within the country is also contributing to
the devaluation of the hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
Muhidin Trabune, another prominent import and export dealer,
said traffic restrictions as a result of the recent heavy rains
in southern Somalia are playing a major role in creating a
business stagnation.
</P>
<P>
"No one can import more goods when his store is still full of
the old goods," he noted, adding "all roads to the southern
regions are cut and Mogadishu can't consume all we have, so what
to do with the dollars."
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of hard currencies are not confined to the
U.S. dollar alone, but the Saudi Riyals, the Ethiopian Bir and
the Kenyan Shillings as well.
</P>
<P>
As the essential food items such as the sugar, flour and rice
are getting more expensive in the southern regions of the
country, Mogadishu is moving smoothly with the benefits of the
dollar depreciation. Each 50 kg bag of sugar which was sold US
$22.50 is today sold less than US$20.50 in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, local food products of maize and sorghum still remain
unaffected by the money exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The money exchange business employs many Somali in the
different markets throughout the capital. Dozens of young Somalis
go to the markets before dawn to make their living from the
exchange benefits. Sometimes, these youngsters loose their money
especially when the dollar makes a quick loss of value.
</P>
<P>
There has been no central bank or government to deal with the
values of the currencies or fight the fake money which might be
injected into the market-oriented economy of the country.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Increase Trade With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan plans to increase its
trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by
about 10 percent during the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Annual trade between the two sides now is estimated at around
45.8 billion rupees (about 1.04 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry believes that by the end of the 1997-98
fiscal year (ending on June 30, 1998), the trade volume between
Pakistan and ASEAN will cross the 50 billion rupee (1.14 billion
dollars) mark.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Commerce Ministry said Thursday that the
Pakistani government has finalized an elaborate strategy to
further trade ties with especially Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has instructed the
Commerce Ministry to find ways and means to boost economic and
trade relations with ASEAN, they said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports to ASEAN during 1991-92 were worth 9.7
billion rupees (220 million dollars) while imports from that
region amounted to 16.9 billion rupees (384 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports to ASEAN increased to 10.2 billion rupees
(232 million dollars) in 1994-95 while its imports from the region
snowballed to 40.4 billion rupees (918 million dollars) in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is now planning to find markets for its steel,
electrical and farm products and manpower in the ASEAN region.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Pakistan is expecting investments from ASEAN
countries, especially Malaysia, for setting up a range of
medium-sized and large hi-tech industries in the industrial zones
to be set up along the Lahore-Islamabad motorway, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has already agreed to set up a huge mechanical complex
to manufacture machinery for the engineering industry in the
proposed industrial area near Chiniot, Punjab Province.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Requests Mid-Term Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa Thursday asked King Birendra to dissolve parliament
and hold mid-term polls, as the opposition has planned a
no-confidence motion against his coalition government, the King's
Principal Press Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said a cabinet meeting held on Thursday morning
made the decision, and the prime minister flew to Pokhara, 120
kilometers west of Kathmandu, in the afternoon to see King
Birendra, who was inaugurating the Janapriya Multiple Campus
building there.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) on Wednesday evening decided to table a
no-confidence motion against the present government, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 96 MPs from the CPN-UML and the Chand faction of the
National Democratic Party (RPP) have formally requested the King
to convene a special session of the parliament to discuss their
no-confidence motion, said a notice issued by the King's Principal
Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The King has not made a decision yet on the two requests, a
Royal Palace source said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government led by Surya Bahadur Thapa came to
power on October 7, 1997 after the coalition government headed by
Lokendra Bahadur Chand was brought down by a no-confidence motion
moved by the Nepali Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
The present government, the sixth since 1990, is a coalition of
the NC, the RPP and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party.

<HEADLINE> Study Identifies New Clue to Cause of Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientists announced Thursday the
identification of a new clue to the cause of the diabetes, opening
a possible new way for treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
American researchers wrote in the journal Nature that the
progression of diabetes may be linked to the failure, by a set of
T-cells, to produce the substance interleukin 4 (IL-4).
</P>
<P>
Diabetes would be caused when cells in pancreas are destroyed
by the body's immune system, said the researchers at Harvard
University in Boston, Massachusetts, of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The pancreas produce insulin, the hormone that in turn controls
sugar metabolism.
</P>
<P>
Experiments on mice have shown that IL-4, a hormone that has
anti-inflammatory properties and can suppress the immune system,
appears to hinder the development of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
If IL-4 is no longer made, the last obstacle to diabetes is
removed and the T-cells can destroy cells in the pancreas.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, stimulating the production of IL-4 may help prevent
the development of diabetes, which affects 135 million people
worldwide and kills 2.8 million every year.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said their next step would be to find out what
triggers the production of IL-4. At the same time, more work needs
to be done to bring the experiments to clinical trials.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Port Achieves 14 Million TEUs in Container </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Port has
achieved a container throughput of 14.12 million TEUs (twenty-foot
equivalent units) for the year ending December 31, 1997, a 9.1
percent increase over 1996's 12.94 million TEUs, the PSA
Corporation said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the achievement as "very satisfactory" given the
prevailing economic and currency crises in the region, PSA
Corporation Chairman Yeo Ning Hong said this year's result is
testimony that the customers continue to find value in using the
services at the Singapore Port.
</P>
<P>
He said the port had worked hard to reduce customers' cost by
providing highly reliable service in berthing their ships on time,
delivering fast handling rates and providing faster connections
for transshipment containers.
</P>
<P>
High productivity played an important role in the achievement
of 14 million TEUs, Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
For the third generation container vessels of PSA Corporation's
major customers, the average number of containers handled per
vessel call was more than 2,000 TEUs. They were serviced at an
average rate of 88 containers per hour, the fastest in the world,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Plunge in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Interest rates in Sweden
dipped low Wednesday as hopes were high about ongoing wage talks,
and the U.S. Federal Reserves delivered optimistic tones.
</P>
<P>
The yield on ten-year Swedish government bonds fell by 11 basis
points to an all-time-low of 5.72 percent, while short-term paper
fell by about 4 basis points.
</P>
<P>
While Swedish yields plummeted, the interest rate gap between
Sweden and Germany shrank to only 53 points.
</P>
<P>
A domestic factor affecting the rates is Sunday's agreement by
the paper and forest workers' union to accept wage increases of
2.5 percent this year and 2.4 percent for the following two years.
</P>
<P>
This has led to expectations that negotiations by the metal
workers' union, retail clerks' union and others will also lead to
only moderate wage increases, thus unlikely to spur inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish rates were also affected by U.S. Federal Reserves
Chairman Alan Greenspan's speech on Saturday, in which he warned
about the negative effects of deflation.
</P>
<P>
The speech was seen as a sign that the Federal Reserves,
functioning as the central bank of the United States, will not
raise interest rates on February 3-4.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Calls for Joining WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Agriculture
Issa Kalantari has urged the government to apply for the
membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Iran Daily
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iran can not long afford to stay away from the WTO and should
make efforts to win entry into the organization in the near
future, Kalantari said at a meeting of managers of the Rural
Cooperatives Organization.
</P>
<P>
Experts, however, have cautioned that by joining the WTO,
Iran's industries would face serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture minister argued that setting the goal to join
the WTO will give Iran the momentum to develop the agricultural
sector by canceling government subsidies and encouraging
competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers can set up organizations to help upgrade the quality
of their goods, and make better use of technical facilities to
compete in international markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that if Iran becomes a WTO member, the
government is able to levy taxes on farmers rather than subsidize
them.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the government gives too much subsidies to
bread consumption, saying that 6,000 billion rials (about 2
billion U.S. dollars) are earmarked annually for subsidizing wheat
and bread.
</P>
<P>
He called on Iranian farmers to invest in agriculture. He
suggested that if each of 1.5 million farmers invests 1 million
rials (about 333 dollars), a body with a capital of at least 150
billion rials (about 50 million dollars) will be formed to help
develop the agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Norway Urges Israel to Move Peace Process Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Foreign Minister
Knut Vollebaek has urged Israel to take measures to move the
Middle East Peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek made this appeal in Tel Aviv today during his
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which
the two had detailed discussions on the peace process, according
to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek, who arrived Israel from Jordan on Wednesday to
continue his current Middle East tour, was reportedly said in
Amman before his departure that Norway believes that the Oslo
Accords should be the basis for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek's meeting with Nytanyahu was attended by Terje Larsen,
newly appointed Norwegian government's special envoy on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Larsen was actively involved in formulating the Oslo Accords
five years ago, when he worked behind the scenes to keep the
Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organization negotiators on
target.
</P>
<P>
Larsen's appointment put him in the same league as U.S.
peace coordinator Dennis Ross and European Union peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos insofar as the international effort to help
bring the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Ross is now on his shuttle diplomacy between Israel and
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to work out the plans
of Israel's troop pullback in the West Bank. But so far no
progress was made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to meet Netanyahu later in the evening
again after holding talks with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat.

of the Amalgamated Transport Union in Kenema.
</P>
<P>
The Executive members had paid a call on the minister to
appeal for "increased security" for their inter-city vehicles
transporting essential goods.
</P>
<P>
Mansaray warned that his administration "will not hesitate to
take drastic action against Kamajor supporters" including
paramount chiefs suspected of covertly aiding the Kamajors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the ongoing war itself, reports from Zimmi near
the Liberian border in the south said government troops continue
to battle with a well armed Kamajor band for the second straight
day after an initial lull in the fighting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The area is now unsafe so I decided to pull out my family,"
said Brima Kebbie, a farmer, in a telephone interview in Kenema.
According to him, hundreds of mud-houses have been torched and
rice plantations destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Another civilian spoke of hundreds of civilians killed as
rocket propelled grenades missed their targets and landed on
civilian settlements.
</P>
<P>
"The kamajors are bringing reinforcement continuously across
the Mano River Bridge accompanied by a number of white men whose
identity is unknown," he added.
</P>
<P>
The military high command in Kenema confirmed the heavy
fighting but said casualty figures are being compiled.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic fighting has also continued in the eastern diamond
mining town of Tongo, said the High Command.
</P>
<P>
"We are consistently beating them back," said a military
communique which is being disputed by the Kamajors who said they
killed over 20 government soldiers and surrounded the government
forces.
</P>
<P>
There has not been any independent confirmation of both
claims. The military forces in Bo said they have killed 35
Kamajors while it lost five soldiers in the fighting on the
outskirts of Bo, Sierra Leone's second largest city. Fighting
died down on Tuesday but the area remained tense, residents said.

BAGHDAD, January 8 (Xinhua)-- Iraq today refuted the
statements of the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. claiming that 95
percent of the contracts of food and medicine within the second
phase of Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program has been approved.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency INA quoted a spokesman for the Iraqi Trade
Ministry as saying that the real percentage was not more than 77
percent.
</P>
<P>
Seven months had passed since the implementation of the
second phase of the oil-for-food deal, but Iraq had only
received foodstuff worth of 295 million dollars out of 1212
million dollars allocated for the procurement plan, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said if the U.S. Ambassador checked well records of the
Security Council Sanctions Committee, he would discover that the
percentage of the contracts which had been ratified was not 95
percent, but it does not exceed 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that baby milk and other materials under
contracts of the second phase have not reached Iraq yet, adding
that under the U.S. pressure, food contracts worth of 90 million
dollars have not been recorded by the Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on the international community to put
pressure on the U.S. and the Sanctions Committee to record
these contracts and not to delay the food contracts concluded
within the third phase of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2
billion dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its people.

<HEADLINE> Australia Disappointed at Canada's Beef Quota Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Acting Prime
Minister Tim Fischer Thursday accused Canada of reneging on an
agreement to restore Australian beef imports, which were cut by
7,000 tons a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said his country would keep pushing Canada for full
restoration of beef quota arrangements as negotiated during the
long-running Uruguay round of trade talks, which led to the
creation of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Australian beef exporters met their quota last year and could
this year have supplied at least the agreed level of 42,000 tons,"
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At Fischer's request, senior officials from the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade called in Canada's High Commissioner
William Schumacher to inform him of Australia's disappointment
after his country allocated Australian beef exporters only 35,000
tons as its annual import quota.
</P>
<P>
After a year of intense lobbying by trade officials and the
cattle industry, Australia had expected Canada to allow it to
restore beef exports to the previous annual quota of 42,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Canada's decision prompted the Australian cattle industry to
call on the Australian and Canadian governments to hold urgent
talks to resolve outstanding trade issues, such as beef quotas.
</P>
<P>
Cattle Council of Australia President John Wyld said the local
beef industry has been working collectively for the past year in
an effort to have the original quota restored.
</P>
<P>
Australian access to the Canadian market was slashed a year ago
for purely political reasons, Wyld said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian cattle industry will not take this decision
lightly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada announced last February that Australia's 1997 beef quota
had been slashed as it had not used the full 42,000-ton quota in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The decision was expected to cause Australian beef exporters to
lose nearly 9 million U.S. dollars in income from its fourth
largest export market.
</P>
<P>
Beef exports are just one area of contention between the two
Commonwealth nations. Australia was accused last year of hiding
behind a threat of unacceptable disease risk to block imports of
fresh Canadian salmon.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Rightwing Coalition Members to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today urged hardliners within the coalition to
support the planned second phase of further troops redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a conference of Jewish parliamentaries here,
Netanyahu stressed he would advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process by carrying out the necessary troop pullback in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu warned that if there is no progress in the peace
process, the leftists would stage a comeback to seize power. In
earlier remarks, he described the election victory in 1992 by the
Labor Party as a disaster for the country because it resulted in
the Oslo peace accords and Israeli handover of occupied land to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader added bluntly that if those who support
"the careful and responsible move" will remain in the government,
while those do not can quit.
</P>
<P>
After the conference, Netanyahu convened a meeting of heads of
coalition parties to discuss the latest political turmoil caused
by the resignation of Foreign Minister David Levy this week and
to lobby for their support to the proposed redeployment. Rafael
Eitan of Tsomet, Aryeh Deri of Shas Party, Natan Sharansky of
Israeli Baaliya and Avigdor Khahalani of The Third Way were
invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks ahead of his third round of talks
with visiting U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross, who is
pushing for progress in the peace process. Ross' mediation here
is aimed at preparing for President Bill Clinton's pending
meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
leader Yasser Arafat later this month.
</P>
<P>
Due to the resignation of Levy, a leading moderate within the
rightist coalition, Netanyahu's maneuvering room has been
dramatically reduced. A group of rightist lawmakers have
threatened to topple Netanyahu if he goes ahead with the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Many now doubt how Netanyahu could carry out the second
redeployment since his government has in fact become hostage of
the hardliners. The Defense Minister Yithzak Mordechai, Another
dove within the government, threatened Wednesday night to resign
if the government could not implement the pullback within three
months.
</P>
<P>
Under heightened U.S. pressure to carry out the redeployment,
Netanyahu repeatedly assured Washington that he would honor the
promise he made. But he is reportedly scaling down the
proposed percentage of pullback from over 10 percent to 8
percent in order to appease the hardliners.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has made it clear that it would firmly reject anything
that is less than 10 percent. For its part, the PNA has been
demanding for a 30 percent withdrawal at every stage of the
three-phase pullbacks.

<P>
FREETOWN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Solomon Rogers, chairman of
the war council of the Sierra Leonean rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), today dismissed reports of a possible split between
the military government and the RUF following the former's
disciplinary actions in the alleged looting of the Iranian
Embassy on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Out of the eight men implicated, six were members of the
Sierra Leone Army while two were from the People's Army made up
of the former RUF combatants.
</P>
<P>
RUF captain Browne was dismissed from the People's Army while
the RUF's Battle Group Commander, Lt. Colonel Issa Sesay was to
lose three months' salary.
</P>
<P>
"There is no split because of the decision," Rogers said.
Rogers, who is Secretary of State for Agriculture and Forestry,
said, "this action will not in any way bring cracks in the
alliance since the Anti-looting Decree was agreed by all in the
alliance."
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that Sesay was inadvertently implicated in
the mess by his personal assistant (Captain Browne)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Browne, together with five soldiers in the Sierra Leone army
including the man who first announced the May 25, 1997 coup, are
now detained at the maximum security prison in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The government said their detention is necessary as they had
tried to influence the People's Army to mutiny against the
decision to punish them for their alleged crimes.

The 16-year-old Guo Jingjing was philosophical at her
defeat. "This is as it should be, the Russian diver was very good
tonight and was better than me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The judging was also very good," Guo added.
</P>
<P>
Chantelle Michell, who placed 10th after the semi-finals,
clawed back to win a bronze medal for Australia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chinese duo Sun Shuwei and Tian Liang garnered 326.34
points in the men's synchronized platform diving to win China's
first gold medal in the championships.
</P>
<P>
Sun and Tian highlighted the 10-meter event with their best
dive of the night - a back three and a half somersault - to beat
Germany's Michael Kuehne and Jan Hempel into second place with
Russia's Alexandr Varlamov and Igor Loukashin narrowly behind on
third.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair made a spectacular start, scoring 99.60 after
the first two rounds, to establish a lead over the Chinese and
Germans going into the third round.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese, who throughout the competition matched
execution with brilliant synchronization, performed a superb
forward three and a half somersault in their third dive to go into
a lead they never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
Kuehne and Hempel were delighted with their silver medal.
"Despite being the European champions last year we have had a
terrible run up to the world championships because I have started
studying and Jan has been ill," Kuehne said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is only in the last eight weeks or so when we have
really started performing well again," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Makes progress in Privatizing SOEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
made some progress in privatizing state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
since coming to power 18 months ago, the Bangladesh Observer
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the government has finalized the process for
disinvestment of 32 SOEs, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
To transfer loss-making SOEs to private entrepreneurs is part
of the government policy.
</P>
<P>
SOEs in this South Asian country incur a total loss of 434
billion taka (9.6 billion U.S. dollars) every year, and the
government sustains a loss of 25 billion taka (552 million
dollars) in the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
The government has already enlisted 54 SOEs for disinvestment
in the current fiscal year starting July 1, 1997, while the
Privatization Board, which is in charge of the work for
privatizing the loss-making industries, has enlisted 87 SOEs for
disinvestment, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial units now awaiting disinvestment include 21 jute
mills, 19 textile mills, 21 steel and engineering units, 10 sugar
and food businesses and eight chemical units, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress that has been made, a number of problems
remain such as delay in implementation of the decision for
disinvestment because of the absence of concrete directives and
commitment by political leaders and resistance from the trade
unions, it said.

<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Thursday will meet
representatives of unions and associations of jobless people to
discuss "concrete and immediate improvement" of the emergency
situation of jobless people, after demonstrations were held in
Paris and other French cities Wednesday in protest of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
-- The general directors of police forces of Turkey and seven
European countries concerned with the recent exodus of 1,000 Kurds
toward Europe will meet Thursday in Rome to discuss ways to
contain the immigration of Kurds. Germany is very critical of
Italy over the issue and wants a "concrete result", while Italy
wants Turkey and Greece to stop networks of illegal immigration
and seek a common action by European police forces.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French city of Strasbourg Wednesday decides to mark out
the areas considered to be "difficult" and to reinforce the police
force there. City officials and deputies are considering imposing
a curfew on teenagers to restrict them at home after certain hours
in the night. Moreover, girls become more and more involved in the
juvenile delinquency in France, as many of them are using violent
methods identical to those used by boys.
</P>
<P>
-- While the Asian currencies continued to collapse, the creditor
banks of Western countries, especially France and Germany, are
looking for a solution to short-term debts owed by South Korea. The
center of gravity of the unprecedented Asian financial collapse has
shifted to Indonesia, where the currency rupiah is yielding ground
after the government announced a budget plan which is little
convincing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
attended a ceremony today marking the signing of a Sino-Foreign
cooperative contract for coalbed methane production in Huaibei
coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The project between the China United Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd.
(CBM) and U.S.-based Texaco, the first of its kind officially
approved by the state, will involve the exploration of 2,663
square kilometers of coalbed methane resources in east China's
Anhui Province. The project will involve a total investment of 500
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with senior Texaco Vice-President Robert Black
prior to the signing ceremony, Premier Li Peng said that China has
vast coalbed methane resources, and noted that the planned
exploration and use of related resources will yield substantial
profits.
</P>
<P>
"This will conduce to improving China's energy structure,
accelerating the development of a clean gas energy industry,
reducing air pollution and protecting the environment," according
to Li,
</P>
<P>
The development of coalbed methane in Huaibei coal mines will
have even greater significance since there are a large number of
people living in cities along the Huaihe River, said Li, adding
that related efforts will greatly benefit people living in the
area and enhance the environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the Chinese and U.S. sides cooperate closely to
ensure that the project enters production at an early date," said
Li.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed the need for strong management, improved
efficiency, exploration and the introduction of new
technology.

<HEADLINE> Australia Refuses to Apologize to Aborigines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Thursday refused to follow Canada's example to make a formal
apology to indigenous people for its white assimilation policy
during 1910-1970 that forcibly removed aboriginal children from
their families.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Canada's formal apology for decades of
discrimination against aboriginal people, Australian Acting Prime
Minister Tim Fischer said: "Australia's constitution is not
Canada's, Australia is not Canada, there are differences."
</P>
<P>
Canada formally apologized overnight for decades of
discrimination, including the widespread abuse of Indian children
at federally-funded boarding schools, following a report into
treatment of indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the Canadian experience had no link to Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government had set up the boarding schools for
Indian children, whereas in Australia, the practice of removing
Aboriginal children was largely in the hands of state governments
and the church, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer expressed personal deep regret for past wrongs but told
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio that no
comparisons could be drawn between Australia's situation and that
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"(Prime Minister) John Howard gave a strong personal apology,
expressed his full regret, as I do, for so much which has happened
in the past, but it did happen in the past," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
He said a government apology would not be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
"Let's get on with the task of building a better life for the
Aboriginal people in practical ways, that's what we are doing, and
I am proud of the efforts that we will continue to do in that
regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 100,000 aboriginal children were forcibly separated from
their families during 1910-1970 under Australia's white
assimilation policy.
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal leaders have called on the government to follow
Canada's lead and apologize for the past treatment of indigenous
people.
</P>
<P>
Some indigenous leaders have condemned Fischer's response,
saying Australia was increasingly isolated for its stance.
</P>
<P>
Ray Robinson, government-appointed acting chairman of a
commission in charge of aboriginal affairs, accused the government
of being unable to face up to history.
</P>
<P>
"Our present-day government may not be responsible for
implementing past policies but it is responsible for dealing with
the history we inherited," Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley said Canada's apology
offered Australia another chance to deal with the issue.

<P>
Black said that Texaco cherishes its long-standing cooperation
with China and expressed hope that the project will signal a good
beginning for bilateral cooperation in the production of coalbed
methane.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. side will do its best to ensure the success of
the project.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and a number of other senior Chinese
officials attended today's meeting and signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The two firms will reportedly jointly explore over 60 billion
cu.m. of prospective coalbed methane resources. Some 300 wells
will be drilled during the exploration and production period, with
each well expected to produce 5,000 cu.m. of methane daily, and
500 million cu.m. annually.
</P>
<P>
The China CBM was founded in May 1996. Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Li Peng penned the following respective
inscriptions marking the founding of the company: "Rely on
scientific and technological progress, and develop the the coalbed
methane industry for the benefit of the people"; and "Develop
coalbed methane and explore new energy resources".
</P>
<P>
China has designated a number of coal mines in Liaoning, Anhui,
Hebei and Shanxi provinces to pilot for coalbed methane
exploration. Two coalbed methane bases in Shanxi Province are
expected to engage in industrial exploration.
</P>
<P>
Related coal mines and bases will reach an annual production
capacity of one billion cu.m. of coalbed methane by the end of
this century, with the figure expected to rise to 10 billion
cum. by the year 2010. This will in turn form a complete
production scope for the exploration and use of coalbed methane,
and will lay a solid foundation for China's use of new energy
resources.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Unhappy with U.S.-Israel-Turkey Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is not happy about the
naval exercise jointly staged by Israel, Turkey and the United
States in eastern Mediterranean, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before a cabinet meeting, Kasoulides
said the Cypriot government considers military cooperation
between Israel and Turkey "a development which we do not favor."
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus was not passive over the issue and had made
"friendly representations" to the government of Israel last
month.
</P>
<P>
"We got the assurances we wanted," he said, adding "this does
not stop us from stating that we are not happy about the
three-nation military exercise."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides noted that relations between Cyprus and Israel are
very good, just as relations with Arab countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
However there was no need for military cooperation between
Turkey and Israel, he said, because that creates concern to
neighboring Arab states and upset balances with friendly
countries such as Cyprus, Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides said Wednesday that
Cyprus was not affected by the exercise, but pointed out the aim
of the exercise, which was described as humanitarian, was "not
compatible with the human rights violations in Turkey and the
genocides this state has carried out".
</P>
<P>
The one-day exercise Wednesday described as a "success" by
U.S. and Israeli military officers, was condemned by neighboring
Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a strong supporter of Cyprus, also criticized the
exercise, saying it does not contribute to peace and stability in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: China's Energy Development Enters New Stage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China United Coal-bed Methane
Co. Ltd. (CUBM) and Texaco Inc. signed a contract here today to
jointly explore 2,663 sq km of methane resources in east China's
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The region where the two investment partners will cooperate on
exploration is believed to have more than 60 billion cubic meters
of coal-bed methane resources.
</P>
<P>
During the exploration period, 300 wells will be sunk at an
investment of 500 million U.S. dollars. When completed, the wells
should produce 500 million cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
This is China's first large coal-bed methane development
project with overseas cooperation. The contract with the
U.S. energy giant marks the beginning of easing energy shortages
and improving energy structure in China in the next century. The
agreement is considered to also mark a new period in the country's
energy development.
</P>
<P>
Coal-bed methane is commonly known as coal-mine gas and is
basically the same thing as conventional natural gas. Each 1,000
cubic meters of coal-bed methane can produce heat equivalent to
one metric ton of petroleum. The gas can be used either as fuel
for cooking, power generation or as high-quality raw material for
producing fertilizer, carbon black and formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all that China is relatively deficient in
resources, with the per-capita figure only 47 percent of the
world's volume. Energy experts predict that by the year 2000 the
gap between supply and demand in China will be 21 million to 25
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with energy shortages, China has an irrational energy
structure compared to that of developed countries. With the
proportion of coal as high as 75 percent, petroleum and natural
gas make up one-third and one-tenth of the world's averages,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's abundant coal-bed methane long has been wasted despite
energy shortages. To prevent gas explosions, 600 million cubic
meters of coal-bed methane are annually drawn from mines. The coal
mines are not only a polluted environment, but also contribute to
a serious loss of natural resources.

<P>
Exploration and utilization of coal-bed methane, considered a
strategic energy of the 21st century, has drawn the attention of
all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's total coal-bed methane resources are listed at 35,000
billion cubic meters, equivalent to 45 billion tons of standard
coal and equal to the country's conventional natural gas
resources, and three times the reserves in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The CUBM was founded in 1996 jointly by the Ministry of Coal,
the Ministry of Geology and Natural Resources, and the China
National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corp, with an aim to advance
the exploration of coal-bed methane in China.
</P>
<P>
CUBM is responsible for the prospecting, exploration of
coal-bed methane resources, related production, pipeline
installation, transmission and processing of coal-bed methane.
</P>
<P>
The company has been given an independent budget status and the
autonomy of cooperation with overseas partners, as well as a
series of other corporate preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Chen Minghe, chairman of CUBM, held that the exploration and
utilization of coal-bed methane has bright prospects even though
China started late.
</P>
<P>
"But exploration of coal-bed methane demands high investment
and has great risks, so China will practice strategies including
increasing overseas cooperation to introduce more technology and
funds so as to advance development of the coal-bed methane
industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, international companies from the United States and
Australia have invested in the exploration of coal-bed methane in
China. In addition to today's contract-signing, CUBM has completed
negotiations over cooperation with overseas investors in six
coal-bed methane exploration projects.
</P>
<P>
China has designated coal mines in Liaoning, Anhui, Hebei and
Shanxi provinces as pilot projects for coal-bed methane
development. It will is considering setting up two coal-bed
methane bases in north China's Shanxi Province to undertake
industrial exploration.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, these coal mines and projects
should be able to produce one billion cubic meters of coal-bed
methane annually, and 10 billion cubic meters by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce New Curriculum in Senior Middle Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China will soon introduce a new
curriculum into senior middle schools nationwide to encourage
students to learn more, the State Education Commission announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The current curriculum was written in 1990 and is considered
outmoded. Many people have criticized the courses as dull and
eroding students' creativity. They say the curriculum is not good
for teaching students how to solve practical problems.
</P>
<P>
The new curriculum will incorporate class meetings, scientific
inventions, sports, artistic performances and social activities
into the formal courses. Also, a morality course will be
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
An obligatory course will be added to improve students'
artistic sense.
</P>
<P>
"The curriculum places importance on basic knowledge, skills
and capability, and is aimed at developing the student's
personality," said Ji Baocheng, a commission official in charge of
the reform.
</P>
<P>
The curriculum will also allow students to choose some courses
in which they are interested and which might be helpful for
their employment if they cannot enter university after graduation.
</P>
<P>
The curriculum has been used by 210,000 students on a trial
basis in Shanxi and Jiangxi provinces and Tianjin Municipality
selected by the commission. The commission's goal is for every
senior middle school in China to use the curriculum by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Education experts said that the reform will directly affect 10
million students on campuses.
</P>
<P>
They say only when the education sector in China takes into
consideration the moderization drive, the world and the future,
can it cultivate people who are able to cope with challenges in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The term of China's senior middle school is three years, and
the students' age ranges between 16 and 19.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Air Force pilots
survived Tuesday when their F-16 fighters collided over the Utah
Test and Training Range west of the Great Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred in the afternoon during a training
mission, said Capt. Dennis Mehring of Hill Air Force Base, some
105 miles (170 kilometers) east of the test and training range.
</P>
<P>
One of the pilots, Capt. Scott Hufford, managed to land his
fighter at a nearby airfield while the other, Capt. Paul
Hertzberg, ejected safely, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Hertzberg's fighter, however, crashed on the training range.
</P>
<P>
Since last September 13, when an Air Force C-141 transport
collided with a German military plane off the coast of Africa and
killed 33 people, Air Force B-1B, B-52, T-38 and F-16 have
experienced crashing, missing target, colliding in a number of
disasters and incidents.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's collision has been under investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A workshop on international
actuarial systems and the development of actuarial science in
China was hosted by the Insurance Institute of China and United
Kingdom-based Eagle Star Insurance Company here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first workshop of its kind held in
China. Officials from Chinese government agencies such as the
People's Bank of China and the State Commission for Restructuring
Economic Systems, professionals from nine countries and regions
including the United Kingdom and the United States, and executives
from China's top insurance companies attended the discussion.
</P>
<P>
The delegates held that the growth of an actuarial system and
intensive training of actuaries are crucial to the building of a
sophisticated insurance industry in China.
</P>
<P>
Duncan Ferguson, president of the British Institute of
Actuaries, said: "The Institute of Actuaries would like to see a
Chinese actuarial institute qualify as a full member of the
International Actuarial Association in time and will be pleased to
help the Chinese actuaries achieve that objective."
</P>
<P>
As an attempt toward this end, the London-based institute,
together with Eagle Star and China's Central University of Finance
and Economies held an award ceremony here Wednesday for Chinese
actuarial students who had excellent performances in the master's
program co-sponsored by the three parties.
</P>
<P>
This was the third award ceremony held since the program was
launched in 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to Ferguson, the success rate for the Chinese
students who were enrolled in the program is 70 percent on the
examinations, while that of British students is 50 percent. The
achievement was especially hard won because the exams are
conducted in English, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, Eagle Star has spent 10 million yuan
(1.2 million US dollars) on the program. It plans to inject
another 5 million yuan in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Eagle Star, the first European insurer to have a presence in
China, set up a representative office in Beijing in 1992, and has
two more representatives in Shanghai and Guangzhou.

CHANGSHA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Shaoshan, hometown of late
Chinese leader Mao Zedong, has become a giant outdoor museum
dedicated to the country's revolutionary history.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years 40 Chinese leaders visited Shaoshan in
Xiangtan County, central China's Hunan Province, and wrote
inscriptions, while nearly 20 universities and colleges made the
place a center for moral education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that Shaoshan has been visited by 14
million people from other parts of China since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Since the Hunan provincial government designated Shaoshan as a
revolution memorial center and tourism resort in 1986, local
residents have restored historic relics and built additional
tributes to the revolution.
</P>
<P>
A bronze statue of Mao, a forest of stone tablets with
inscriptions of Mao's poetry and Mao's library have been
constructed in addition to Mao Zedong's former residence and
memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
The local government also collected 10,000 pieces of documents
with historic value and precious articles left by Mao, and has
initiated a publicity campaign to promote the exhibition of this
material.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia's gross domestic product
(GDP), industrial output and retail trade grew by 1.2 percent, 3.2
percent and 3.9 percent respectively in 1997, Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country also saw an 11 percent inflation, lower than half
of the 1996 level, a 2.5 percent increase in incomes and a 5.7
percent decrease in unemployment, Chernomyrdin told the first
cabinet session of the year.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Interfax News Agency as saying the country
entered the New Year without wage arrears, with over 15 trillion
rubles having been channeled from the federal budget to provinces
to pay off the arrears.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Russia, together with the government,
managed to guarantee the stability of the ruble in 1997, despite
the international financial crisis, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin indicated that tax collection would be the main
task of the cabinet in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The low tax collection led to the poor implementation of the
budget, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held here today
to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Beijing
Institute of Nuclear Engineering.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng wrote inscriptions
marking the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's inscription calls for the institute to follow the

</P>
<P>
Li's inscription encourages the institute to actively develop
nuclear power technology so as to strengthen China's nuclear power
industry.
</P>
<P>
The institute has completed 716 design projects over the past
four decades, including 58 projects which have won awards on
either the national or ministerial levels. Some 469 of 1,054
scientific research projects have also won high-level prizes.
</P>
<P>
The institute, staffed by more than 1,300 experts and
technicians, made eminent contributions to the production of
China's first atomic bomb, first hydrogen bomb, and first
nuclear-powered submarine.
</P>
<P>
The institute is in charge of designing the second-phase
project at the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in east China's
Zhejiang Province, the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant in south
China's Guangdong Province, and the Lianyungang Nuclear Power
Plant in east China's Jiangsu Province. The second-phase project
at the Qinshan Nuclear Plant will be China's only domestically
designed and built nuclear power plant for commercial use during

NEW DELHI, January 8 (Xinhua)-- Indian Prime Minister Inder

in India.
</P>
<P>
"We are evolving from a single party rule to multi-party rule
and as an observer away from the seat I occupy, multi-party rule
is inevitable," Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
"Any government that will come to power after the elections
will be a coalition government," he said shortly after his
inaugural address at the fourth global partnership summit
organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in
Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu in southern India.
</P>

All the three or four major combinations that were in the race
for power in the polls were basically coalitions. The forthcoming
polls to be held from February 16 this year would see installation
of yet another coalition government at the center, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Up in Light Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
closed in positive territory after a day marked by light trading
Thursday, with investors keeping a weather eye on the mercurial
Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Scott Emms said the local
bourse was still keeping a close eye on what was happening in
Japanese and Hong Kong sharemarkets and their potential impact on
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously Japan has had a bit of a positive influence today,
but overall it was a pretty steady day," Emms said.
</P>
<P>
There were renewed fears of a flow-on effect impacting on the
U.S. economy if the Japanese Government in particular did not take
action to fix the country's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 3.8 points up at 2,650.7, off a
low of 2,633.7, with an improvement in industrial stocks
offsetting continuing weakness in major resource companies.
</P>
<P>
Overnight in New York, stocks finished modestly lower after
rebounding from a steep slide spurred by the mounting uncertainty
over how much U.S. companies are being hurt by the economic crisis
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the all industrials index finished the day 11.3 points
stronger at 4,574.5.
</P>
<P>
The banking index shot up 42.3 points to 5,683.4, with the
Commonwealth Bank following on from Wednesday's comparatively good
performance to again be the best of the banks, up 20.4 cents.
Commonwealth shares reached an intra-day high of 18.68 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANZ closed steady at 10.31 Australian dollars, National
Australia Bank rose 29 cents and Westpac added six cents.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 2.9 points to 1,111.6, among
resource stocks BHP was down 10.3 cents, amid continuing copper
price weakness, WMC lost 10 cents and MIM gained three cents.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was a light 320.84 million shares worth
930.59 million Australian dollars (595.57 million U.S. dollars),
with rises slightly outnumbering falls by 495 to 492.

<HEADLINE> Macao Yaohan Group Declared Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Yaohan Department Store,
one of the chain shops of the Yaohan Group, was declared bankrupt
by a Macao court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was the latest insolvency of the worldwide
group. The Macao store, which opened in 1992, stopped running last
November following the announcement of liquidation of the Yaohan
Hong Kong store.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News quoted a court notice as saying creditors
should report to the court their creditor's rights within 60 days
from the publication of the notice on the Government Gazette.
</P>
<P>
An independent commissioner will be appointed later by the
court to handle the liquidation affairs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the department store resumed its operation just days before
Christmas in the name of "New Yaohan" with the agreement of the
liquidator of the Yaohan Hong Kong store, property owners and
renters of the Macao store.
</P>
<P>
The largest property owner, the Macao Tourism and Amusement
Company, paid a bail of 1.6 million patacas (about 200,000 U.S.
dollars) for a six-month trial operation before the reopening of
the store.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Yaohan owes some 600 creditors a total of more than
200 million patacas (about 25 million dollars), including rents to
property owners and initial investment to its parent company.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge Sharply on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plunged sharply
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) fell all the way down from 1,368.06 points to 1,270.7
points at the closing of trade on Thursday, losing 97.36 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said fears that Indonesia's financial turmoil will hurt
Singapore banks' earnings fueled a sell-off in banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, concerns that the slumping property market in
Singapore will hurt banks' earnings also triggered selling in
banking stocks, they said.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 243.47 million units,
valued at 502.99 million Singapore dollars (about 282.58 million
U.S. dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 338 to 47, while
227 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies Engineering was the most actively
traded counter as it registered a turnover of 15.56 million units.
It was followed by Asian Food and Property which had 12.3 million
shares traded. DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Land was next
with 12.01 million units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Ipco Warrant led the gainers of the day as it rose by 17 cents
to finish at 1.15 U.S. dollars. IPCO increased by 10 cents to end
at 2.4 U.S. dollars, while Liang Huat was up by 8.5 cents to close
at 38 Singapore cents.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, DBS Foreign was the biggest loser as it
declined by 1.9 dollars to end at 11.9 Singapore dollars. OCBC
(Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation) Foreign and the UOB (United
Overseas Bank) Foreign fell by 1.2 dollars each to close at 7.5
and 7.2 Singapore dollars respectively. OUB (Overseas Union Bank)
Foreign lost 95 cents to finish at 5.25 Singapore dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong share prices shed
almost three percent Thursday amid fear of rising interest rates
as Southeast Asian currencies plunged to new record lows.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, which traces the performance of 33 blue
chips listed on the Hong Kong bourse, fell 284.08 points, or 2.98
percent Thursday to close at 9,254.53.
</P>
<P>
The losses came after the key index tumbled nearly 600 points,
or six percent Wednesday to dive below the 10,000-point benchmark
level. The sharp plunge was triggered by the continuing steep fall
of regional currencies, according to brokers.
</P>
<P>
Property shares were the hardest hit, which plummeted 612
points, or 4.85 percent Thursday. Other sub-indices for finance,
utilities, commerce and industry also dropped.
</P>
<P>
H shares (China state-owned enterprises listed on the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong), and red chips (China-affiliated
corporations), both fell by more than eight percent.

Turnover stood at 12.528 billion HK dollars (1.6 billion US

<HEADLINE> Joint Study on Realignment of Waters Near Macao to Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Macao and the Pearl River Water
Resources Committee (PRWRC) of China will do a joint study on
the realignment of the waters near Macao.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Macao Harbor Bureau and of the PRWRC
under the Ministry of Water Resources signed an agreement here on
Wednesday on the realignment plan. The two sides will each make
their own efforts to complete a report to be submitted early next
year.
</P>
<P>
The joint study aims to work out ways to ensure a smooth
release of floodwater at the estuary of the Pearl River, to expand
shipping, to protect water resources and to make reasonable use of
shoals, said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The area for the planned dredge will cover more than 200 square
kilometers around Macao, with the realignment of three waterways
as the key task.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost about 15.1 million yuan (about 1.82
million US dollars), of which each side will share half. After all
study is completed, a report on the planned realignment will be
submitted in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, reckless reclamation projects
alongside the waterways near Macao have produced a negative effect
on the water flow, the release of floodwater and the water
environment, experts said, adding that a scientific and reasonable
development of the area is urgently needed.

<P>
NANJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- About a dozen public-spirited
citizens in China's Jiangsu Province were the recipients recently
of 44,000 yuan as a reward for their heroic deeds in the country's
anti-crime campaign.
</P>
<P>
The reward money came from the provincial public security
department and the province's Public Security Volunteers
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"Those public security volunteers are merely representatives of
the millions of public-spirited citizens across China," said a
provincial public security department official, "to see what is
right and have the courage to act on it is a Chinese virtue and
every citizen's obligation."
</P>
<P>
One of the eleven recipients, He Guixia, who works in the
registration office of the Xuanwuhu Hotel in Nanjing, provided a
dozen important pieces of information to local police in 1997,
which helped them solve ten major criminal cases and recover more
than 50,000 yuan worth of stolen goods and illegal currency,
according to an official with the foundation.

<HEADLINE> HK Legislature Voter Registration Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Robin Ip, deputy secretary for
Constitutional Affairs, said here Thursday that the vote
registration in functional constituencies (FCs) for the May
Legislative Council election (FCs) has improved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of voter registration in FCs at a press conference
here Thursday morning, Ip said the situation in agriculture and
fisheries, transport, and insurance is particularly encouraging.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the situation in a number of FCs is still
worrying, including sports, performing arts, culture and
publication, import and export, textiles and garment, information
technology and wholesale and retail.
</P>
<P>
Ip urged those eligible voters in FCs to get registered as soon
as possible before the deadline of registration on January 16.
</P>
<P>
The first Legislative Council election of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region will be held here on May 24, this year.
</P>
<P>
The 60-member Legislative Council will be made up of 20 to be
returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections,
30 by functional constituencies and 10 by an Election Committee
election.
</P>
<P>
The functional constituencies which are composed of major
organizations' representatives of 30 sectors such as urban and
regional councils, health services, insurance, finance, labor and
social welfare are of importance in the community.
</P>
<P>
Ip said: "we have had a series of briefings for major
organizations to explain the registration process and to urge
their members to get registered."
</P>
<P>
The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) is making thousands
of telephone calls to those eligible voters for registration and a
second round of letters have also been issued by the REO to
eligible voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ip said it will not be possible to extend the voter
registration deadline owing to the tight timetable for preparing
the first legislature election, with many key steps governed by
statutory deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The REO has to publish a provisional register before February
15. This means after the close of registration on January 16, the
REO has less than a month to verify the eligibility of the
electors, process the data by computer, and print the register, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting some suggestions for compulsory registration, Ip
stressed that this will not be adopted for this coming election.
</P>
<P>
"After the election in May, we will, as usual, review the
various aspects of the election, including the method of voter
registration," he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Runs Out of Puff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The embattled Australian dollar
again ran out of puff Thursday as it sank from the highs reached
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed the session at 63.68 U.S. cents, up from
63.43 late Wednesday, but nowhere near the 64.55 reached in an
offshore rally.
</P>
<P>
The currency had started trading on a much stronger footing
after the U.S. dollar fell markedly against the Japanese yen
overnight thanks to Bank of Japan intervention.
</P>
<P>
However, the Australian dollar's strength was short-lived as
the greenback again strengthened at the expense of regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
This followed a meeting early Thursday in Washington between
influential Japanese Vice-Minister for International Affairs
Eisuke Sakakibara and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about possible joint intervention by the central
banks to halt the U.S. dollar's surge and the Japanese yen's slide
kept the greenback in check early.
</P>
<P>
However, no news of joint action emerged and the U.S. dollar
strengthened against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah was again the main regional victim,
crashing past the psychological 10,000 level against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah's plunge came amid speculation about a debt
moratorium by Indonesia and concerns over a lack of commitment by
Jakarta to International Monetary Fund reforms.
</P>
<P>
Locally, retail sales and building approvals data released
Thursday were largely ignored by both the foreign exchange and
debt markets as they focused on developments offshore.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Australian dollar will be kept bouncing
between 0.60 and 0.65 U.S. dollars for several months as fears of
an imminent current account deficit blowout gather momentum.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended Thursday at 84.39 yen from 84.61
Wednesday and at 1.1621 Deutsche marks, from 1.1634.

<HEADLINE> Zambezi Basin Selected for Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambezi River basin has been
selected as initial focus for collaboration on improving
availability and management of African water resources, according
to lastest issue of Africa recovery.
</P>
<P>
As the largest of the the African river systems flowing into
the Indian Ocean, the Zambezi River basin has been selected as a
focus by the special initiative's informal water working group to
demonstrate coordination of U.N. efforts and inter-agency
cooperation, the U.N. publication said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambezi basin must be managed effectively to mitigate the
effects on water supply of increased population, industrial and
mining development, and greater irrigated food production, the
U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
Over 250 million people in Africa have no access to safe
drinking water, and almost 300 million lack adequate sanitation,
it said.
</P>
<P>
"If the current situation does not improve, an estimated 500
million Africans are likely to be without safe water and
sanitation by the year 2020 given the rate of population growth,"
said the publication.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) have developed a project for the
equitable use of shared water resources which will be tested in a
pilot project and sector studies in the Zambezi basin, and
replicated in the other water basins in the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) are working
on a project to rehabilitate and improve the network for
monitoring water quality within the Zambezi basin.
</P>
<P>
The Zambezi Basin, shared by eight countries and covering
about 1.35 million square kilometers, forms a major part of SADC,
where over 70 million people lack access to safe water.

<HEADLINE> Motorola to Increase Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Motorola will increase its
investment in China from 1.2 billion U.S. dollars to 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars by the year 2000, said P.Y. Lai, president of
Motorola (China) Electronics Co.
</P>
<P>
The Motorola production center in Tianjin, a port city
neighboring Beijing, has absorbed 1.2 billion U.S. dollars and
turned itself into a powerful manufacturing force with
approximately 10,000 employees, Lai said. A second Motorola
production center will be located in Suzhou City of east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The company also will invest 280 million U.S. dollars in Leshan
of northwestern Sichuan Province, to start an export-oriented
semi-conductor industry, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
All investment will come directly from the profits Motorola has
made in China, he said. By 2000, the company's investment will
amount to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lai said Motorola is confident in the potential here because of
China's lasting economic boom and the government's commitment to a
stable currency exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The country's stable political situation, high economic growth
rate and foreign currency reserves of 140 billion U.S. dollars
were cited by Lai as factors in a sound financial order and smooth
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Motorola will launch its North Asia business center
in Beijing this year, and will enhance cooperation with China in
such frontier technologies as satellite and data communications
systems.

<HEADLINE> Divorce School Opens to Resolve Marital Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China's divorce rate has been
increasing in recent years as a result of overwhelming social
changes brought on by the country's reform and opening-up drive
which started in 1979, according Wenhui Bao a major Chinese
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the situation, Beijing has opened a divorce school
providing courses and a counseling service to help estranged
couples mend their endangered marriages.
</P>
<P>
Students of the school are couples who have applied for
divorce. The teachers are volunteers from the district Trade
Union, the Federation of Women and the court system.
</P>
<P>
Among the first eight couples to graduate from the school, one
couple withdrew their divorce application.
</P>
<P>
"The schools' efforts in saving marriages, though weak, are
very worthwhile," said Chen Yijun, a researcher at the Sociology
Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social Science.
</P>
<P>
China's divorce rate has climbed from 3.7 percent to 8.7
percent in the 1981-1991 period, and Beijing's rate has jumped
from 2.5 percent to 16.6 percent in the same period. The rate
climbed to 23.8 percent in 1995, and 25 percent in 1996. And the
divorce rate is expected to increase in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested providing scientific knowledge about marriage
and family to the public, and educating engaged couples to be more
aware of their responsibilities for families and children.
</P>
<P>
"The divorce school is just a beginning, " Chen said. "More
such agencies should be available to provide legal and
psychological counseling to these couples."
</P>
<P>
The rising divorce rate in China, especially in urban areas,
can lead to many social problems in housing, children's education,
custody and division of property, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
More trained sociologists who specialize in marriage and family
sciences are needed to help women and men deal with the
psychological and social problems when divorce is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
The school was opened by the Marriage Registration Office under
the Civil Affairs Bureau of Chongwen District, one of five urban
districts of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese social organizations plan to open more schools to
try to avoid or save ruptured marriages.

<HEADLINE> Civilian Wounded by Israeli Shelling in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was
seriously wounded early this morning during an Israeli
bombardment of two Lebanese villages in south Lebanon, a local
Radio report said.
</P>
<P>
The Orient Radio said that at 1:40 am local time, Israeli
artillery began to fire mortar rounds on Majdel-Zewin and
Mansuli, about 50 kilometers south of the country's southern port
city of Saida and on the edge of the Israeli occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
Beisi, 65, was struck by a shell and was immediately transferred
to a nearby hospital. The attack also damaged several homes of
civilians in these villages, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Lebanese civilian which was wounded by
Israeli bombardment since the start of this year. The previous
one was wounded in the same area three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Six hours later, Iranian-backed Hezbullah, or Party of God,
donated a roadside bomb against a patrol of South Lebanese Army
(SLA), Israeli militia ally, when they were travelling on a road
inside the occupation zone, according to a statement released by
Hezbullah.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the explosion had inflicted direct
casualties on the SLA soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The tit-for-tat conflict between Israeli troops and Lebanese
guerrillas has lasted for more than 10 years since Israel carved
out a 1,200-square-kilometer area in south Lebanon as a security
zone to protect its north from guerillars attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Barely three days after the
announcement of the national budget, Lagos state, which embraces
the country's economic nerve center, put forward its own budget,
with roads on top priority.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the state budget Wednesday night on local
television network, Administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa said 1.5
billion Naira (about 19 million U.S. Dollars) out of the 16.8
billion Naira budget will be voted for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The money will be spent on "rehabilitation and construction of
new roads and pedestrian bridges" to improve the poor road
conditions that cause both traffic bottlenecks in many places of
the metropolis and quick damage to vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Like the case of the federal budget, the state government has
also given education the second biggest share, with an allocation
of 500 million Naira (6.25 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The amount will be equally voted for the improvement and
upgrading of physical structures in the state's tertiary
institutions and construction of other capital projects.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors which draws the state government attention
include health, tourism, power, social welfare and refuse
disposal.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Personal computer owners in
the northeast China city of Changchun have began to adopt a new
attitude toward the computer as their numbers grow, according to a
recent survey by the "Changchun Evening News".
</P>
<P>
The city's residents now have a better understanding of the
personal computer and more people are coming to regard the machine
as an helper in their daily lives instead of a toy.
</P>
<P>
Of 1,710 people questioned by letter and fax, college students
showed the most enthusiasm for the computer and accounted for 29.3
percent of the replies. Other responses came from the field of
medicine, education, and the military.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that nearly half those responding wanted a
brand-name computer like Legend, IBM, or Compaq, the clear
favorites of the people of Changchun.
</P>
<P>
As for price, about 40 percent of those responding said that
they prefer computers that cost from 7,000 to 10,000 yuan. At the
same time, people are looking for greater speed, a wider range of
functions, and greater workability in their computer.
</P>
<P>
The Internet was the most favorite item in the survey for about
three-fourths of those responding, and half the people were keen

<HEADLINE> China to Crack Down on Illegal Cultural Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Culture is
planning a nationwide crackdown on misbehavior in karaoke halls,
night clubs, art galleries and VCD shops.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhengchun, a spokesman for the ministry, said at a news
conference here today that the market is developing quickly and
there is a certain amount of chaos and disorder. Because of that,
he said, steps will be taken this year to cope with the problems.
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems cited by Huang include VCD piracy, illegal
publications, vulgar performances, sexual services, gambling, and
sales of fake artwork.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 1998 has been designated by the ministry
as China's first "Legal Year for the Cultural Market," during
which the market is expected to get on a sounder track.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will try to implement three new regulations on
cultural market management, make the supervision team more
powerful to enforce the new rules, and launch a publicity campaign
to make everyone understand the law.
</P>
<P>
Illegal activities will be policed, and a clean market will be
restored, he vowed.
</P>
<P>
This will be one of the greatest actions China has ever taken
over the past decades to manage the cultural market, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongde, minister of culture, has signed a regulation on
administrative punishment to guide the crackdown on illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
China has 4,000 cultural supervision offices with 50,000
workers.

<HEADLINE> Economic Reforms Enjoy Consensus in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral said Thursday that the economic reforms process has won the
support of major political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the fourth global partnership summit organized by
the Confederation of Indian Industry in Chennai, capital of Tamil
Nadu, southern India, Gujral said, "Let me assure you that the
reform process enjoys a good measure of consensus and major
political parties have made it part of their economic agenda."
</P>
<P>
"That the agenda of reform has been embraced practically by all
state governments, which are led by different political parties,
including some regional parties, is demonstrative of the growing
conviction that this is the road ahead for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some caution and prudence, you will agree, is necessary on
this score as also on the overall issue of opening up of the
economy, particularly in the wake of severe economic and financial
crisis enveloping some of the East and Southeast Asian countries.
We need to draw lessons from what has happened while charting out
our course for the future," he further said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent Planning Commission meeting, he pointed out, it was
felt that the country needs to double its investments in
infrastructure areas in the next five years from what was done in
the last 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Adopt Confidence-building Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will adopt
confidence-building measures before it resumes importing poultry
and starts rebuilding its own poultry industry, local newspapers
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted Michael Suen Ming-yeung, who acted in
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang's place during
her official visit to Beijing earlier this week, as saying that
the measures would be announced in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The measures would include steps raising the standards of
sanitation and hygiene in Hong Kong, particularly on the farms,
wholesale markets and retail outlets to make people eat chickens
again, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, Chan has confirmed that she heads a
task force handling the bird flu matters, and stressed that the
task force was "nothing new" and that she and Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
had been keeping a close watch on the "whole avian flu affairs."
</P>
<P>
The priorities of the task force reportedly are to examine ways
to ensure sanitation in transporting chickens.
</P>
<P>
Defending the SAR government's efforts to handle the bird flu
problems, Suen said Wednesday: "We acted swiftly once we noted the
problems, and the actions were undertaken by various policy
bureaus and departments."
</P>
<P>
"Now we need more departments to get involved and the
coordination is getting wider," Suen said, adding that "that's why
Mr. Tung announced last (Tuesday) night that Mrs. Chan should
coordinate the actions."
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the SAR government will work better in
the future and will not disappoint the people of Hong Kong.

MACAO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive atlas of Macao has
been published here for the first time and is now available in
bookstores in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Published by the Macao Foundation, the atlas is composed of
maps, forms and explanations in Chinese, English and Portuguese
languages. It is said to be best for academic study, students and
teachers as well as tourists.
</P>
<P>
The maps and forms show the details of Macao's geographical
location, geological structure, waters, landscape, change of
coastlines, climate, population distribution, residential areas,
land use and reclamation from sea.
</P>
<P>
It also shows the details of industrial distribution, the ups
and downs of foreign trade, hotels and scenic sites, schools and
cultural facilities. The atlas also includes a detailed map of
Macao streets.
</P>
<P>
It gives users an introduction of Macao's history, location and
transportation, among other things.
</P>
<P>
The atlas is so far the most comprehensive one published in
Macao. Due to excessive reclamation from sea, the latest map,
which was published in 1993, has been described as outdated.
</P>
<P>
Macao including its two islands now has a land mass of about 23
square kilometers and a population of 425,000 in mid-1997.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Leftist Rebels Make Progress in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks between the
Philippine government and the leftist rebel National Democratic
Front (NDF) have made progress by reaching an agreement on human
rights issues, a statement from the government negotiation panel
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The accord was reached after two and a half days of intensive
discussions on the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Right and
International Human Law in The Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, the panels are encountering
difficulty in resolving some contentious provisions and they
agreed to continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
The NDF wants the inclusion of provisions from the Geneva
Conventions and Protocol I which refer to rules on the conduct of
international conflict between sovereign states, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government panel insists that inclusion of such provisions
impinges on the government's constitutional sovereignty and
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The government accepts the inclusion of humanitarian principles
and standards governing internal conflict as embodied in Common
Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, the political wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, has been engaging in the peace talks with the
government sporadically on human rights issues since 1992 in the
Netherlands, where rebel leaders live.
</P>
<P>
The NDF and its military wing, the New People's Army, have
fought the government for more than three decades and still has a
presence in many hinterland areas, including some rural villages
around metropolitan Manila.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Prospects for Forming National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A national unity government
for Israel in order to same the Middle East peace process? This
has become a hot topic here but is unlikely to turn into reality
very soon.
</P>
<P>
The reason: opposition Labor Party Chairman Ehud Barak is
against it.
</P>
<P>
Following David levy's resignation as foreign minister on
Sunday, some politicians of the ruling Likud Group expressed
their worries about the right-wing coalition government's future
political stability. They pointed out that the immediate threat to
the government would be the issue of how to carry out the second
stage troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is the coalition government that has internal
conflicts on Israel's long overdue troop redeployment. The
majority cabinet and Knesset (parliament) members of the coalition
oppose the pullback.
</P>
<P>
At least eight Likud Knesset members (KMs) have expressed their
strong opposition to the redeployment, warning Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu that they would support a no-confidence motion
against him if he agrees to a further pullback.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak, from Likud, announced Wednesday night
that he would quit the government unless it implements a further
pullback in the West Bank in three months.
</P>
<P>
With the departure of dovish Levy and his Gesher (bridge)
Party, the Likud faction is left with only a one-set majority in
the 120-seat Knesset. This razor-thin parliamentary majority could
easily bring the government down if some coalition KMs vote
against the government along with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
In this circumstances, the coalition partner the Third Way
Party has raised again the proposal of forming a national unity
government with the Labor Party, not only for the purpose of
maintaining the political stability, but for the sake of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres also discussed this proposal
on Wednesday in the Knesset with his Labor colleagues, suggesting
that the Labor reach an agreement with the coalition to join the
Netanyahu government for six months, during which there would be a
substantial West Bank pullback.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would also call for holding elections after six
months, and that after elections, both parties would set up a
national unity government and rotate the premiership.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu will kill the peace process to save his government.
His majority is too slim to pass redeployment. I wanted to assure
the necessary majority for redeployment," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
But his proposal was rejected by Barak, the party leader, who
said such an agreement could save Netanyahu and his coalition from
tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
The Third Way Party, in a statement issued Wednesday night,
called Barak and the Labor members to adopt Peres's proposal and
urged Labor to rise above party interests and unite to further the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the current political situation and party conflicts
in Israel, however, prospects for forming a national unity
government are really dismal, at least for the time being.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Giant's Income from Premiums up 35.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest insurance
company reported a 35.7 percent increase in its premium income
last year while maintaining its market share at above 70 percent,
company statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) received 78.8
billion yuan (9.5 billion U.S. dollars) in premiums in 1997, up
35.7 percent from the previous year, or 117 percent of the
budgeted figure, company chairman Ma Yongwei announced today.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that PICC's annual life insurance premiums
surged more than 80.89 percent to 38.9 billion yuan last year,
while those from property insurance were up 8.3 percent to 38
billion yuan. Premiums from the re-insurance business jumped 32.9
percent to 10.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
While the PICC's premium income grew steadily last year, its
payment viability improved markedly.
</P>
<P>
Company statistics indicate that the value of PICC's reserve
funds for insurance responsibilities by the end of 1997 was 11.88
billion yuan, or 20 percent, more than a year ago. Bank deposits
accounted for 45 percent of the insurer's total assets at the end
of last year, up 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese insurance giant paid a total of 36.86 billion yuan
in redemptions in 1997, according to Ma, who attributed the stable
business growth of its company to increased efforts to prevent and
ward off financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the PICC established a specialized agency for the
management of high-risk business as well as improved financial and
accounting practices among its grass-root subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: No Need for Iran to Resume Ties with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) - Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami stated early this morning that there was no need for
Iran to have diplomatic relations with the United States since
Washington was still adopting a hostile policy towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We fell no need for ties with the U.S. especially as the
modern world is so diverse and plural that we can reach our
objectives without U.S. assistance," Khatami said in his interview
with the American TV network CNN.
</P>
<P>
Khatami in his first address to the "great American people"
criticized the U.S. Administration for its policies of
domination, saying that the "policies pursued by American
politicians outside the United States over the past half a
century since the World War II was incompatible with the American
civilization which is founded on democracy, freedom and human
dignity."
</P>
<P>
"I fell that American politicians should realize the fact
and adjust themselves with the standards of the Anglo-American
and American civilization and at least apologize to their own
people because of the approach they have adopted," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was the U.S. politicians that have
adopted a hostile policy against Iran, "they have tried to
inflict economic damage upon us, a clear example of which is
the d'Amato Act which represents a continuation of Cold War
mentality" and the allocation of 20 million dollars to topple
the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Khatami believed that there were some mistrust and
misunderstanding between the two nations, which was caused by
the American policies.
</P>
<P>
"There must first be a crack in this wall of mistrust to
prepare for a change and create an opportunity to study a new
situation," he said, adding "unfortunately, the behavior of the
American governments in the past up to this date has always
exacerbated the climate of mistrust and we do not detect any sign
of change of behavior."
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami noted the Iranian nation has no intention to
insult the American nation when they chants "Death with the U.S.A"
and burn the American flag, saying that "these slogans symbolize a
desire to terminate a mode of relations which existed between Iran
and the United States" and was a response to the remark of former
U.S. defense secretary who said the Iranian nation must be rooted
out.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed regret to the occupation of the American
embassy in Tehran by Iranian students in November, 1979, saying
that everything must be analyzed within its own context and the
incident occurred "within the context of revolutionary fervor and
pressures to which the Iranian nation was subjected."
</P>
<P>
"Today we are in the period of stability, and fully adhere to
all norms of conduct regulating relations between nations and
governments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reiterated his stance for dialogues between the Iranian
and American nations, saying that nothing should prevent dialogue
and understanding between the two nations, especially between
their scholars and thinkers.
</P>
<P>
"I recommend the exchange of professors, writers, scholars,
artists, journalists, and tourists," he said, but adding that
"the dialogue between civilizations and nations is different from
political relations."
</P>
<P>
Last month, Khatami announced his readiness to have a dialogue
with the "great American people," a stance welcomed by top
U.S. officials including President Bill Clinton who said "I expect
nothing but a dialogue with Iran."
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that there were still many
hurdles on the way for a direct dialogue between the two
governments, particularly the strong opposition from both
governments to the rapprochement between the two
countries.

process forward, local newspaper the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official visit is Vedrine's first trip to Lebanon since
taking office in June 1997. After visiting Lebanon, he will go on
to Syria and Jordan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the stay in Lebanon, Vedrine is to hold talks with his
Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz on the need for a greater
European role in the deadlocked Middle East peace talks, said a
Lebanese Foreign Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The source described the trip as an "exploratory" venture in
view of the change in the French government, following the
Socialist Party majority victory in the national elections last
June.
</P>
<P>
The official visit would confirm France's support for peace on
the basis of the U.N. Security Council Resolutions 424, 425 and
338 and for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's itinerary includes the opening on Monday of the new
French Consulate here.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to meet with Lebanon's president, prime
minister and parliament speaker on the final day of his visit, the
source said.

<HEADLINE> Northern Chinese Province Developing Pillar Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province will take chemicals, building materials, metallurgy,
machine building and foodstuff as its pillar industries in the
economic plan for the 1995-2010 period.
</P>
<P>
This is a revised plan after the province found its pillar
industries previously set by the provincial government were
similar with that of Beijing and Tianjin, said Miao Ziyi, head of
long-term planning division under the provincial planning
commission.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the proportion of the added-value of the five pillar
industries in Hebei's gross domestic product (GDP) will be
increased from one quarter to more than one third, Miao said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid overlapping with other regions, Hebei will lay the
emphasis on sensitive materials, medical intermediate and refined
chemicals, high grade cement, new materials, deep-processed
metals, light-duty automobiles and spare parts, power transmission
equipment, environmental facilities and food packing machinery,
and protein drinks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt had decided to lift the ban on importing
textiles to comply with relevant rules regulated by the World
Trade Organization, the Egyptian Gazette reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian government imposed a 54 percent tariff
on imported textiles, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic textile producers, however, feared that the
decision of last week would expose them to keen competition of
Turkey and Asian countries despite the tariff.
</P>
<P>
They said high taxes, smuggling and expensive raw materials
would make it hard for them to compete with foreign rivals,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources
Suleiman Reda had said the decision was expected to result in a
boom of the Egyptian textile industry after a long period of
isolation and lack of competition.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A newly built poly-propylene plant of Kuwait had
sold its first batch of product in the domestic market and it was
expected to produce more for export, according to the Kuwaiti News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Bahbahani, marketing manager of the plant belonging to
the Petrochemical Industries Company said the plant sold 24.75
tonnes of its product Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that it would sent its first shipment of 250 tonnes to
Syria next week and will export its product to other Arab
countries, India, Pakistan, China and countries in Africa and
Europe as international demand for the material was increasing.
</P>
<P>
The plant's annual producing capacity stood at 100,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- More than 2 million passengers traveled through the
Beirut International Airport last year, set a record after the end
of Lebanon's civil war in 1990, the Lebanese Daily Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
This indicated a 17 percent rise over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Transportation Omar Miskawi attributed the
growth to increased political stability of the country, according
to the paper.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's Manufacturers Association had urged the
Industry and Trade Ministry to double this year's Export Promotion
Fund to 260 million shekels (74 million U.S. dollars), the local
daily Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The association said the supplementary funds would be used to
maintain the existing overseas markets and develop new markets in
the light of pessimistic forecast for world economic this year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The demand for manpower in Israel rose by an
average of 15 percent in 1997, the Jerusalem Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The demand for academic and management professionals increased
by 23 percent and 19 percent for engineers, according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the demand for construction workers had dropped by
47 percent due to an industry slump, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli economists had anticipated that Israel's
gross domestic product would increase by 2.7 percent this year,
the Jerusalem Post newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
And the rate of export expansion was estimated at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This implied a stagnation of the Israeli economy, said
economists.
</P>
<P>
But the inflation rate would be down to 7 percent because of
budget cuts, sound monetary policy and a decrease in import prices
resulting from the East Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Industry and Trade Ministry had begun to
study the implications of the Asian economic crisis on Israeli
economy and formulate tackling measures, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Dov Mishor, director-general of the ministry, said that the
crisis erupted in Southeast Asia last year could adversely affect
Israel's economy because it exports 20 percent of the goods to the
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the crisis would mainly hit Israel's consumption goods,
as the living standards in the Southeast Asian countries had been
severely reduced.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Reiterates Iran's Opposition toward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) - Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today reiterated Tehran's opposition to the Middle East
peace process, but noting that Iran would not stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
In his interview here with the U.S. TV network CNN, Khatami
said that "we have declared our opposition to the Middle East
peace process because we believe it will not succeed. At the same
time, we have clearly said that we do not intend to impose our
views on others or we would stand in their way."
</P>
<P>
"In our view all Palestinians have the right to express their
views about their land, including millions of Palestinians in
diaspora, they too have a right to self-determination," he said,
adding that "only then can there be a lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Khatami, in his first televised address to the American people,
stated that "we seek a peace through which Jews, Muslims and
Christians, and indeed each and every Palestinians, could freely
determine their own destiny and we are prepared to contribute
toward the realization of that peace."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process is not just and it does not
address the rights of all parties in an equitable manner, he said,
adding that Iran is prepared to contribute to an international
effort to bring a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran has "the greatest respect for all
Palestinians who are concerned about the future of Palestine,"
calling on the United States to avoid support for Israel."
</P>
<P>
Iran is not against Jewish people, Khatami said, adding that
the Zionists constitute a small portion of the Jewish people and
have openly declared and proven in practice that they are
expansionists.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli intransigence in the course of the current peace
process, and its failure to honor its own undertakings has
enraged even U.S. allies in the region, he said, "in my view
peace can come to the Middle East when all Palestinians, Jews and
Muslims alike, can determine the future of the land."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. Administration for accepting the
"Zionist" influence in its policies, saying that "the impression
of the people of the Middle East and Muslims in general is that
certain foreign policy decisions of the U.S. are in fact made in
Tel Aviv and not in Washington."
</P>
<P>
Khatami also denied the accusation that Iran is seeking
weapons of mass destruction, saying that Iran has joined the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the official representatives
of the International Atomic Energy Agency have inspected Iran's
facilities and confirmed that Iran's nuclear programs are for
peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that those who are so concerned about saving
humanity from nuclear weapons, fully support Israel which is a
nuclear power and is unwilling to join the NPT or accept IAEA
safeguards while leveling allegations against Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian President stated that Iran is not a nuclear
power, and will not intend to become one.

<HEADLINE> China to Have Registered Auditors on Environment Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China will have its first group
of registered auditors in environment management systems (EMS)
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The register of EMS auditors will play a very important role
in ensuring the quality of auditors and the recognition of
international environmental standards to enterprises," said Chen
Chunyu, an official with a national registration committee for
auditors of environment management systems.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the committee has begun accepting applications for
registered auditors.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people from across the nation have applied to be
registered auditors, including a large number from east coastal
areas. "There are also people from southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality and Sichuan Province," Chen said, adding that the
deadline for applications is January 31.
</P>
<P>
Many of the applicants have experience in environmental
management or have received training. Chen said that all
applicants must pass an examination to be registered auditors.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 China introduced the ISO14000, a set of international
standards for environmental management. China set up a committee
to promote the environmental qualifications of the International
Standards Organization last year. The registration committee is
its subordinate.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Use Rare Earth to Increase Fish Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The fish yield in ponds is
expected to increase at least 10 percent if the fish takes fodder
with a rare-earth aminoacid additive newly developed by Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Agriculture said the additive,
developed by scientists from the Heilongjiang Research Institute
of Aquatic Products, is an encouraging invention and a
breakthrough in the fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
The fish fodder additive is made of rare earth chloride
together with methionine and lysine.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the newly developed additive is easier to keep
and for fish to digest in comparison with the simple rare-earth
additives such as rare-earth chloride and rare-earth nitrate.
</P>
<P>
Trial fish breeding with the newly developed fodder additives
also proved its effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> Kibaki Vows Never to Accept election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Opposition Democratic Party of
Kenya (DP) has vowed never to accept the results of the
just-ended 1997 General Election and go to court to challenge the
outcome of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted DP Chairman Mwai Kibaki as
claiming at a rally here Wednesday that there was massive rigging
during the December 29 General Election.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki, the runner-up in the presidential race, hit out at his
fellow opposition colleagues, religious leaders and
non-governmental organizations who have recognized the outcome of
the polls.
</P>
<P>
"We'll never agree that Moi won fairly. Rigging is rigging,"
he stressed, adding that "we'll go to court, we'll go to
Parliament and to wananchi (people) and demand justice."
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Development Party (NDP) and Social
Democratic Party (SDP) officials did not turn out at the rally
although they were on the list of the speakers.
</P>
<P>
Presidential poll losers like Wamalwa Kijana (Ford-Kenya) and
Raila Odinga (NDP), opposition Safina and religious organizations
have so far accepted the poll results.
</P>
<P>
World leaders including those from the United State, China,
and European Union have recognized the outcome of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Odinga and Kibaki said last week that they had rejected the
election results and demanded a repeat of the polls within 21
days.
</P>
<P>
However, a day after President Daniel arap Moi's swearing in,
Odinga reversed his position, saying that he had accepted the
outcome of the elections.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States Postal
Service issued the first stamp of this year Monday in celebration
of the Chinese Year of Tiger at a ceremony held in Seattle.

Year stamps in 1992. Clarence Lee, a Chinese-American from Hawaii,
whose work has a special paper-cut style, is chosen to design the
stamps.
</P>
<P>
The 32-cent new stamp, of which 51 million pieces have been
printed, features a multicolored tiger in the center, with the
Chinese calligraphy "Year of the Tiger" on the left upper corner.

<HEADLINE> Coup Plotters Alleged to Relocate Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The persons arrested in
connection with the alleged coup plot in Nigeria last December
have as one of the plans to return the national capital from
Abuja to Lagos, the government has revealed.
</P>
<P>
"They had already concluded arrangements on relocating the
federal capital back to Lagos," said federal Capital Territory
Minister Lt.-Gen. Jerry Useni, quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing members of the committee of traditional rulers and
leaders of thought in Abuja Wednesday, Useni said the coup
plotters had intended to bombard the presidential villa,
assassinate the head of state and some other prominent figures.
</P>
<P>
"The coup would no doubt have turned out to be the bloodiest
in the history of this nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abuja, located in the middle of Nigeria, was built as national
capital beginning 1970s. but most of the ministries and
parastatals did not move from Lagos to the capital until late
1996 at a sternest warning of the government.
</P>
<P>
Most of foreign embassies and media headquarters are still in
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Alhaji Buhari Bala told visiting Guinean Ambassador Alhaji
Abraham Doubkour the coup plotters intended to extend the
transition to civil rule program for another 18 months, in
addition to plans to loot the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
Before the two ministers, Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi had
voiced similar accusations when he briefed the corps of African
envoys in Abuja Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The coup attempt was uncovered by the government on December
21, 1997 and 12 suspects, including Chief of General Staff
Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya and two former ministers, were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations had been completed before a special
panel was set up on December 29 for a month-long further
investigations.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Textile Industry Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANHUI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The textile industry of China's
Anhui Province has improved somewhat in 1997 year and is expected
to reduce losses by about 130 million yuan from the more than 400
million yuan of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the January-November period, the sector's losses were
down 84.69 million yuan, or 22 percent, from the same period of
last year, according to the provincial textile council.
</P>
<P>
The improved efficiency was achieved by reducing the number of
spindles and redundant workers, increasing research, and
supporting the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
The province has gotten rid of 100,000 spindles this year and
laid off 63,000 workers. It plans to eliminate 280,000 spindles
and further cut its work force by 25,000 people next year, and the
sector expects to be showing a profit within three years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Plunges to New Record low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah plunged to
a new record low of 10,000 against the U.S. dollar at noon trade
Thursday from 8,450 per dollar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 a.m. local time the rupiah opened with 9,500 against
the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost about 250 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the main causes of the weakness of rupiah
were the strong demand for dollars by the corporate to pay
maturing short-term debts and the worry expressed by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the Indonesian government's
commitments to restructure the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 119 billion dollars foreign debts, out of them 65
billion dollars were private sector debts. The private sector has
to pay 9.6 billion maturing debts at the end of 1997, official
sources said early.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials on Tuesday called Indonesia's economic crisis
worrisome, faulting the Jakarta government for failing to follow
through on pledges to restructure the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which agreed on an IMF-led bailout of over 30
billion dollars in October last year, has committed to conduct a
series of reforms, including reforms in financial, fiscal and
banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, the Indonesian government announced a budget that
failed to meet target set by the IMF under the bailout deal.

<HEADLINE> Egypt FM: 1998 Decisive for Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has said that 1997 is "a bad year for peace" in the Middle
East and that the decisive moment for the peace process is "round
the corner," local newspaper Al Ahram reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the English weekly, Moussa said that the
"first few weeks of 1998 may well determine the fate of the peace
process as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Moussa was not optimistic about the prospects for
the peace process in 1998. "My expectations are not very bright. I
am not very optimistic. I hope there will be room for some
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
This depends on what is going to happen in the U.S.-Israeli and
U.S.-Palestinian meetings," Moussa said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
In order to break the peace deadlock, U.S. President Bill
Clinton will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the
White House on January 20 and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat two days later.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the U.S. role, particularly in the coming few
weeks, will be instrumental, "simply because there remains nothing
within the framework of the peace process but for the U.S. to play
its role as an honest broker."
</P>
<P>
"Now the critical moment has come. Now is the time the
U.S. must play this role with vigor and even-handedness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa blamed Netanyahu's uncompromising policies "putting
everything in terms of black and white" that brought the peace
process to this "either/or" situation.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu's policies have brought into sharp focus the real
Israelis policies and demands under the Likud, with no sugar
coating on them, non, whatsoever," said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the resignation of Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy, which has put the Likud-led right-wing coalition government
in Israel on the brink of collapse, was no excuse for
procrastination.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, a veteran of Egyptian-Israeli peace negotiations,
insisted that Washington was fully capable of brokering a balanced
peace, despite Netanyahu's intransigence, citing U.S. mediation
between Israel and Egypt nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister showed adamance in upholding the
Palestinian rights, saying that "Egypt will never help sell out
the Palestinian cause or facilitate its liquidation."
</P>
<P>
"If it is liquidation that is being discussed, then you can
count us out," said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Israel established diplomatic relations in 1979 but
the ties have never been warm. They further strained over the
deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Companies' Joint Sponsorship of HK's New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom and China
Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd. announced here on Thursday that they had
joined hands to sponsor the annual Lunar New Year fireworks
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
The two leading telecommunications companies of Hong Kong will
provide a total of 6.8 million HK dollars (0.87 million US
dollars) for the 23-minute Fireworks '98, which will light up the
sky of the Victoria Harbor on January 29. This is the 17th annual
New Year Fireworks display in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The display will consist of over 18,000 fireworks shells from
China's inland, Japan, Spain, Germany, Italy and the United
States. The shells will be launched from four barges in a
triangular layout in the harbor waters, which is expected to
provide the best possible views for the usually large Near Year
crowds.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study is currently underway on the possibility of
placing speakers systems at key locations on both banks of the
harbor, to relay, for the first time in Hong Kong, the soundtrack
accompanying the display.
</P>
<P>
"This year's display is much more meaningful as it is the first
Lunar New Year since Hong Kong's handover when the people of Hong
Kong and the inland areas can celebrate together.
</P>
<P>
"Our joint sponsorship with China Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd. for
the fireworks display shows the confidence in both the future of
Hong Kong and the continuous cooperation between the SAR and the
Mainland," said Linus Cheung, Chief Executive of Hongkong Telecom.
</P>
<P>
"In jointly sponsoring the traditional New Year fireworks
display with Hongkong Telecom, we aim at bringing happiness to the
celebrations of the Hong Kong citizens," said Chen Zhaobin,
Vice-Chairman and President of China Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The show consists of three sections, namely "New Year Salute",
"A Golden Celebration" and "Fortune Extravaganza".
</P>
<P>
And special low-level fireworks have been arranged between two
sections, which allows time for smoke to disperse.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, today highlighted inscriptions penned by foreign
statesmen and celebrities in its sixth edition to mark the
centenary of the birth of China's late Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai served as China's premier from 1949 when the
People's Republic was founded to 1976.
</P>
<P>
Norodom Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, wrote that the respected
and beloved Premier Zhou Enlai is the great and immortal hero of
the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said in his

<HEADLINE> Zambia Bank Aims at 9 Percent Inflation Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia has targeted
a further reduction in the inflation rate to nine percent by the
end of December 1998 while economic growth has been pegged at
between five and six percent, Zambia Daily Maily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Felix Kani, Economics Department Director of the central
bank, said Wednesday that he was confident the targeted inflation
reduction and economic growth for 1998 were sustainable going by
last year's reduction of inflation from 35 percent to 18.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The confidence comes from several sources of growth, among
them mining, tourism and the banking and financial services
sector.
</P>
<P>
Kani pointed out that the on-going privatization of copper
mines, which represent Zambia's first economic pillar, will
improve operations and increase output through advanced
technology and astute management.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that little or no growth is expected in the
country's agricultural sector because of the effects of the El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
But because of the expected growth in the other sectors, the
dampening effects in agriculture would be offset, according to
the bank official.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Threatens to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yithzak Mordechai has threatened to resign unless the government
implements the further redeployment in the West Bank within three
months, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, touted as the leading dove within the government
after the resignation of Foreign Minister David Levy earlier this
week, sounded the threat on state television Channel 3 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate, but said the government was capable of
carrying out the long-delayed troop redeployment and must do so.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier to
discuss the consequences of Levy's resignation and the current
visit of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross. Ross is here to prepare for
President Bill Clinton's meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat later this month.
</P>
<P>
He said things have changed since Levy's resignation, adding
"we must seek a way to make an effort and advance with the
process."
</P>
<P>
He also demanded the Palestinian National Authority make
efforts to fight terrorism and fulfill its commitments.
</P>
<P>
The departure of Levy, a leading moderate within the rightwing
coalition, has reduced the government's parliamentary majority to
the minimal 61 seats in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
This has drastically limited Netanyahu's maneuvering space in
carrying out the second pullback, over which some hardline
lawmakers threaten to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Ross held a second meeting with Netanyahu Wednesday night to
brief the Israeli leader on his meeting with Arafat a day
earlier. He told Netanyahu that Arafat would firmly reject the
reported single-digit percentage withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross also pushed for progress in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on building the Gaza airport, seaport and safe
passage between Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said Netanyahu has scaled down the
proposed percentage of second pullback from about 10 percent to
eight percent during his talks with Ross. Netanyahu is also
proposing combining the second and third redeployments stipulated
in the Oslo accords and Hebron agreement into a single operation.
</P>
<P>
Top on Ross' agenda is to try to get the two sides to agree on
a security document on improving bilateral security cooperation
and fighting terrorism. Israel has been demanding for some changes
to the draft document.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's tough position evidently resulted in postponement
of a scheduled meeting between Ross and Arafat in Bethlehem
Wednesday night, and the meeting was rescheduled early Thursday in
Ramallah in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Leather Export Low in COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The export of leather and
leather products remains low in the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) region although it has the abundant
resource, Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Robert Arunga, Director of COMESA
Leather and Leather Products Institute, as saying recently that
the institute will promote and develop the leather industry in
the region to achieve its full potential.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's cattle accounts for 60.9 percent of the cattle
population in Africa, 37.4 and 54.2 percent of the continent's
sheep and goats respectively.
</P>
<P>
The few COMESA countries dealing in the leather industry
produce low value products and are not dealing in finished
products. The countries export raw materials, it quoted an
Ethiopian publication, the Entrepreneur, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Only Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Zimbabwe are said to have
sizable leather industries out of the 20 COMESA states.
</P>
<P>
As to Africa it accounts for only 1.1 percent of the annual
world trade in leather despite its estimated 18 percent share of
the global livestock population, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Determined to Go Ahead With Port Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
determined to go ahead with a much delayed port development
project in the Southwestern city of Galle, a senior government
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
M.H.M. Ashraff, minister of port development, rehabilitation
and reconstruction, said the cabinet at a meeting Wednesday
reaffirmed its commitment and determination to carry out the
project with the objective of spearheading the overall
socio-economic development of the Southern region.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, a breakwater will be constructed while the
port be dredged to improve the capacity of the port.
</P>
<P>
The project was first discussed during the tenure of the
previous government under the United National Party (UNP) in
September 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ashraff said the selected bidder of the project, the UK-China
Consortium, was almost on the point of finalizing the necessary
financial support in collaboration with a Malaysian company when
the economies in Southeast and East Asian countries suffered a
currency devaluation of unprecedented magnitude.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the international monetary circumstances that
frustrated the government's expectations in mobilizing the
requested financial support and caused the delay.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Build First Oil Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Construction of Vietnam's first
oil refinery starts Thursday with a ground-breaking ceremony at
Dung Quat Bay in the central coastal province of Quang Ngai.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited refinery is being built by the state oil giant
PetroVietnam after potential foreign investors pulled out of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The refinery will cost about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars and has a
design capacity for refining 6.5 million tons of crude oil a year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very difficult and complicated project marking a
decisive breakthrough in the development of a petrochemical
industry," PetroVietnam's President Dr. Ho Si Thoang told Vietnam
News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the refinery, called Dung Quat Refinery No.1, is "very
essential" for Vietnam's development.
</P>
<P>
PetroVietnam submitted a feasibility study in march last year,
which was prepared in collaboration with government-employed oil
consultants for the construction of the Dung Quat project.
</P>
<P>
Currently, PetroVietnam plans to get 600 million U.S. dollars
from profits it has accrued through joint venture oil exploitation
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Another 400 million U.S. dollars will come from foreign loans,
while the remaining 500 million U.S. dollars is yet to be raised.
</P>
<P>
The complex will include not only the first oil refinery, but
also a number of petrochemical factories.
</P>
<P>
Some refined products will be processed afterwards to produce
aromatic hydrocarbon compounds for use by the petrochemical
industry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Domestic Debt Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's domestic debt is set
to hit a record 4.7 billion U.S. Dollars in the near future,
posing a threat to both the economy and the government's credit,
the weekly Business reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the southern African country's debt currently
stands at 60 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (3.5 billion Dollars), but
gratuities to former Zimbabwean Freedom Fighters and the
acquisition of over 1,700 farms for their resettlement would add
about 20 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (1.2 billion Dollars) more to
the debt.
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted the latest quarterly guide to the economy
from the First Merchant Bank as saying that at this level debt
service and government salaries would equal to the tax collected.
</P>
<P>
''This means that all the funds needed by the government to
provide the actual services expected of it will have to be
borrowed,'' the bank said.

<P>
It noted that as the government was under pressure to borrow
as little as possible because the money would add further to the
debt and costs of debt services, it would have to scale down its
services to the public.
</P>
<P>
This, said the bank, had already caused the scale and quality
of the services of most ministries to deteriorate and they could
now be expected to decline further.
</P>
<P>
The bank said interest and capital repayments due in the
existing debt in the 18 months ending December 31, 1998, already
came to a total of about 20 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (1.2 billion
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It added that with the ''intensification of political
pressures and the more vigorous restatement of the government's
land redistribution intentions,'' a severe decline in confidence
had become evident in the business community.

<HEADLINE> New Satellite Network on Way to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will benefit from the
setting up of an advanced satellite telecommunications network
which will enable mobile users and remote villagers to
communicate at affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
Four other southern African countries, Zambia, Botswana,
Mozambique and Namibia, have also been listed as first
beneficiaries of the 50-million-Dollar deal to be implemented in
two phases by African Continental Telecommunications Ltd (Actel),
the weekly ''Business'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Actel told the weekly that services will be
marketed in conjunction with telecommunications corporations of
the five African countries and in-country service providers.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to be in place by
late 1999, with the repositioning of a geo-stationary satellite
leased from American Mobile Satellite Corporation (Amsc).
</P>
<P>
Under the first phase, the satellite leased from Amsc will be
repositioned from its current orbital slot at 101 degrees west
(where it serves customers in the U.S.) to 11.5 degrees east.
</P>
<P>
This will enable it to provide mobile and fixed point
telephone services to businesses and individual customers in
rural and urban Africa.
</P>
<P>
Phase two will involve the construction and launch of a
replacement satellite with expanded geographic and service
delivery by 2001.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in
China have provided 17 million jobs for China, 10 percent of the
non-agricultural working people, according to sources from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, China has approved the establishment of more than
300,000 overseas-funded enterprises, and the 145,000 of them which
are now operational employ 17.5 million foreign and Chinese
workers with foreigners accounting for only hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC sources also said that from 1992 to 1996, taxes
paid by overseas-funded enterprises added up to more than 200
billion yuan with an annual average increase of 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
That figure was 4.25 percent of China's total industrial and
commercial tax revenue in 1992, and 11.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of last year, the tax amounted to 45.9
billion yuan, an increase of 53.18 percent over the same period of
1996, and accounted for 12.89 percent of China's industrial and
commercial taxes during the period.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) has got a total of 114 out of 222
Parliament seats in the just-concluded 1997 General Election, the
East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that out of the 210 elected seats, KANU had
collected 108 while all opposition parties in the country
garnered 102.
</P>
<P>
The 102 opposition seats are divided as follows: Democratic
Party of kenya (39), National Development Party (21), Ford-Kenya
(17), Social Democratic Party (15), Safina (4), Ford-People (3),
and Shirikisho, Ford-Asili and Kenya Social Congress one each.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Kivuitu, Chairman of the Electoral Commission of Kenya,
was quoted as saying Wednesday that in accordance with Kenya's
Constitution, KANU will be required to nominate six Members of
Parliament (MP).

<P>
The Democratic Party of kenya will nominate two MPs while
National Development Party, Ford-Kenya, Social Democratic Party
and Safina will each nominate one MP, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kivuitu noted that the proportion was calculated on the basis
of the parties' strength in parliament.

The commission chairman pointed out that all political parties
can nominate election losers as MPs, giving hope of returning
posts to former MPs and cabinet ministers who lost in the
December 29 general election.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asian Crisis May Hit Bangladesh Exports: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The economic turmoil in Southeast
Asia may affect Bangladesh's long-term exports though the country
has so far managed to protect itself from the crisis, a finance
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term prospect of export may be affected by the
changes in exchange rates in Southeast and East Asian countries as
their competitiveness is increasing as a result of devaluation,"
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria was quoted as saying by the
local press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's exports for the first five months of the current
fiscal year beginning July 1 rose "vigorously" with a growth of
over 20 percent over the same period of the last fiscal year, said
Kibria.
</P>
<P>
He expected the growth momentum of the country's short-term
exports to continue and remain unaffected by the Southeast Asian
crisis, "since most of our exports go to Europe and North
America."
</P>
<P>
The country's export earnings were recorded at 2.22 billion US
dollars during the July-November period, compared with 1.76
billion dollars in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal
year, according to statistics from the Exports Promotion Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister cautioned against a possible slowdown in
the country's long-term export due to the massive devaluation
caused by the currency crisis in Southeast Asia. "We have to
remain vigilant in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve of Bangladesh stood at 1.66
billion US dollars at the end of December. "The reserve will be
rising in the coming months," as there was a higher export growth,
said the finance minister.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Botha Unlikely to Be Jailed: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Former state president P.
W. Botha is unlikely to be jailed even if he is found guilty of
failing to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC), The Star daily today quoted legal experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was served with a summons from Western Cape
Attorney-General Frank Kahn Wednesday to appear in George
Regional Court on January 23.
</P>
<P>
Under the founding bill of the TRC, the 81-year-old Botha
faces a two-year imprisonment and/or a fine if convicted.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see Mr. Botha going to jail under any
circumstances," said Krish Govender, attorney and spokesman for
the National Association of Democratic Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
He said the case against Botha could take one or two years
because of the amount of documentation involved and the technical
and legal battle that would be triggered.
</P>
<P>
Botha has refused to testify before the TRC in person on the
workings of the now defunct State Security Council, which he
chaired during the height of apartheid conflict in the 1980s; on
raids into neighboring countries; the state's chemical warfare
program and the murder of anti-apartheid activists.
</P>
<P>
Govender said Botha could get his lawyers to challenge the TRC
because he had submitted a 1,800-page report to the TRC to answer
its questions.
</P>
<P>
He could also appeal against a court decision to the
Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a long time before Mr. Botha even enters
the box. I also believe that even if he is given a jail sentence,
either Mr. (President Nelson) Mandela or Mr. (Deputy President
Thabo) Mbeki would pardon him as final act of reconciliation,"
Govender said.
</P>
<P>
Another expert, Lionel Reichenberg, said Botha could buy time
by getting doctors' health certificates or appealing to higher
courts.
</P>
<P>
The TRC sued Botha after he defied a third subpoena of it on
December 19.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was trying to accommodate him after he failed to
appear for the first time in November 1997, citing health
reasons. But tension began to build up when Botha told an
Afrikaans newspaper, Rapport, that he would rather be prosecuted
than appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu, who was angry with Botha's attitude
toward his commission, had threatened him with legal action ever
since.
</P>
<P>
Tutu failed to lay criminal charges against Botha on December
5 only because of a small legal defection in the second subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was president between 1984 and 1989, refused to
apologize for the activities of his apartheid government and
called the TRC "a circus" and "a revenge camp against the
Afrikaner."
</P>
<P>
The TRC was set up after the first all-race general elections
in 1994 to probe human rights violations in the apartheid era.

<HEADLINE> Top Thai Exporters Back Shorter Forex Holding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exporters
associations have expressed support for the government's decision
to allow exporters to hold foreign currency for a maximum seven
days instead of 15 days of receipt, and urged more steps to curb
currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the measures are necessary for curbing
currency speculation but called for easing liquidity to facilitate
exports, according to the Bangkok Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vorapong Pitchpongsa, president of the Rice Exporters'
Association, said that it is unlikely for farm product exporters
to be involved in money speculation as they need fast cashflow in
baht for purchase of export items.
</P>
<P>
Viroj Amatakulchai, president of the Federation of Thai Textile
Industries, said that if exporters should be allowed to hang onto
foreign currency, they would use the money, at this time of tight
liquidity, to fund manufacturing rather than to speculate.
</P>
<P>
He said the high interest rates introduced to prop up the baht
had made borrowing from banks prohibitive for manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
If manufacturing companies stay inactive for lack of funds, the
threat to the economy grows and the stability and the value of the
baht are further affected.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Krirkkiat Phipatseritham of the University of the Thai
Chamber of Commerce, said investors turn to currency speculation
because the stock market is poor, pushing the baht lower than the
level it should be.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to introduce more comprehensive
measures to tackle speculation in foreign currency.

MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market
dropped by 5.24 percent Thursday on fear of a weaker Asian
currency market and the uncertainty of the country's economic
future.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange composite index (Phisix)
plunged 91.49 points to 1,655.85 points while the broader
all-shares index fell 26.36 points to close at 504.36.
</P>
<P>
Worries of further increase in interest rates and higher
inflation in the first quarter of 1998 also put pressure on the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
Total value turnover was at 1.43 billion on a meager volume of
678.45 million shares, the lowest in almost five years.
</P>
<P>
The continuing negative investors' sentiment on a volatile
currency market has pushed down the Phisix for the third
consecutive days. The Phisix shed 52.24 points on Tuesday and
73.26 points on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the chaos in the stock market will not ease as
Asian currencies continue to reel under speculative attacks.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Proposes Using Currencies Other than US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim disclosed Thursday that his country
proposes to work out new agreements with supplier countries so
that imports can be made using currencies other than the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Under new contracts we hope that imports from the ASEAN
countries, China, Pakistan and India could be made using their
respective currencies," Anwar, who is also finance minister, told
reporters after chairing a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on
Essential Goods at the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(MITI) and the Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs Ministry would
meet importers soon to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said imports denominated in U.S. dollars had become more
expensive following the depreciation of the ringgit against the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is compounded by the fact that not only imports
from the United States and Europe are denominated in U.S. dollars,
but also those from other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar has been appreciating steeply against
Malaysia's currency -- the ringgit. The ringgit which touched an
intra-day low of 4.8800 to the greenback Wednesday kicked off
Thursday at 4.5800/61 to the U.S. dollar.

SHANGHAI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shanghai
municipality, the largest commercial and industrial center in the
country, has worked to use foreign funds in a more efficient way
as the total sum of suck funding drops.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the municipality approved 1,802
foreign-funded projects in 1997, with a contracted foreign
investment of 5.32 billion US dollars, down 14.4 percent and 8.4
percent, respectively, from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The structure of foreign investment has been improved, said
local officials, noting that more money flew to industrial
projects. The municipality also made the best use of foreign funds
for its agriculture and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more trans-national firms entered the
municipality. In 1997, Shanghai General Motor, the largest
foreign-invested project in the city, was set up.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five out of the 100 world top industrial transnational
firms listed in "Fortune" have invested in the municipality.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will continue to encourage foreign
investment in agriculture, high-tech projects, environmental
protection projects and infrastructure construction. It will put
in force detailed rules on foreign-funded projects
recently.

<P>
The government attributed the achievement to the taxation
authorities' efforts to intensify management and supervision over
tax collection.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing and Suzhou cities in the province also kept files for
high-income people while Wuxi and Nantong set up a computerized
network to collect taxes from resident foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the province launched special checks on collection
operations. Statistics show that last year, the province checked
out 380 million-yuan worth of tax evasion, accounting for one
fourth of the total revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government started to enforce the Personal Income
Tax Law in 1994, with revenues increasing by around 60 percent per
year between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year China's personal income tax revenue amounted to some
25 billion yuan, according to the latest statistics of the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT).

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Fishing Firm Gutted by Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A fish processing and
exporting company in Dar es Salaam has been gutted by a fire,
suffering a loss of more than 40 million shillings (about 80,000
U.S. Dollars), press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Two containers of fish processing equipment and instrument for
three boats owned by "Fruit de la Mer" Ltd, each worth 20 million
shillings, were burnt to ashes after the fire broke out at around
11 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Losses of other properties are not immediately known, said the
company's sales manager, Salim Issak.
</P>
<P>
The fire may disrupt the business of the company, which has
operated for two years at Chang'ombe in the city.
</P>
<P>
Employees and the city's fire brigade have devoted all efforts
battling the tongues of flames, but were frustrated by poor
equipment and lack of water and foam, the company's engineers
said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Environmental Committee of Poverty Africa,
Lieutenant Colonel, Juma Mnyube, blamed the firemen and called on
the government to equip them with adequate facilities.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is suspected to be an electric fault,
engineers with the company said.

<HEADLINE> No Plan to Control Forex Trade in Malaysia: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday his government did not have any
plan to impose a control on foreign exchange trade following the
drop of ringgit to its lowest level recently.
</P>
<P>
"If we say we are going to do that, it will result in loss of
confidence. And when there is loss of confidence, it will result
in the ringgit to further deteriorate," he told reporters after
launching an Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA)-initiated campaign to
consolidate integrity in the government machinery here.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the ringgit kicked off the day at 4.5800 to the
U.S. dollar against the close at 4.5900 Wednesday when the State
Bank intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the
local unit. The ringgit touched an intra-day historical low of
4.8800 to the greenback Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that as trading of foreign exchange could not be
controlled, Malaysia had to face the effects from foreign exchange
trade.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have the power to determine the value of our
currency. It is the market forces which determine it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The position has been reversed. Now, market disciplines the
government, not the government disciplines the market. Now,
governments in East Asia are being disciplined," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Peso on Free Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso has been
caught in a new round of turmoil together with other regional
currencies since the start of 1998, with its value plunging nearly
16 percent against the U.S. dollar during the past four trading
days.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the first trading day this year, the peso fell to
a record low of 41.80 pesos to the greenback from the close of
40.11 pesos on December 29, the last trading day in 1997, in the
Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic spot foreign
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The peso continued to slide against the dollar this week, with
the peso-dollar exchange rate breaching the vital psychological
level of 45 pesos to one dollar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the peso plunged nearly 6 percent to a scary low of
45.20 pesos to one dollar from the previous low of 42.65 pesos
recorded Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 6-percent fall represented the largest single-day loss
since July 11 last year when the Central Bank was forced to allow
the peso to move in a wider range.
</P>
<P>
The peso plummeted to a new low of 46.50 pesos to the dollar
Wednesday, but managed to strengthen toward the end of trading and
closed at 45.35 pesos to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local currency has so far depreciated more than 70 percent
against the greenback since its de facto devaluation in July last
year. The exchange rate prior to the currency crisis was at 26.40
pesos to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the new round of free fall of the peso to
fears of a further weakening of the currency, a tremendous demand
for the dollar by corporates and the unabated tumble of other
Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
Many participants in the Philippine Dealing System were
unwilling to sell dollars in anticipation of a further fall of the
peso and the shortage of dollars in return forced the peso lower,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
"The currency market is being entirely driven by sentiment --
and the fear is that the peso will fall further," said Cora
Guidote, head of Philippine equities at UBS Securities Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"Sentiment is so bad. Volume shows that this is a one-sided
affair. There are no sellers. You have to have a lot of guts to
sell dollars," said one trader.
</P>
<P>
This sentiment was reflected clearly Tuesday, one of the most
remarkable days in the six-month-old peso crisis, when no deals
were made in the first 30 minutes of trading as banks refused to
buy the peso at prices within an initial volatility band designed
to prevent sharp fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The trading paralysis forced the Bankers Association of the
Philippines to widen the trading band for the peso from 4 percent
to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said declines in other Asian currencies also
added to the pressure on the Philippine currency. Many believe
that with the Thai baht falling to as low as 53 baht to the dollar
this week, it is unreasonable for the peso to stand still.
</P>
<P>
But the drastic fall of the Indonesian rupiah early this week
was the direct cause of the current wave of currency turmoil in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the peso's sharp decline is the
increasing demand for the dollar by local corporates, which needed
badly dollars to repay their maturing dollar-denominated loans and
to expand business.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said the Central Bank of the Philippines seems to
run out of ammunitions in fighting currency speculators who are
relentlessly attacking the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank, whose gross international reserves dropped to
as low as 9 billion dollars as of the end of 1997, merely enough
to finance three-month imports, can hardly intervene in the
currency market.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson defended the
non-intervention policy, saying attempts to intervene in the
market were futile and would only deplete the country's dwindling
foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Central Bank did take some measures to prop up the
peso, including the one-percentage-point hike of the overnight
borrowing rate to 12 percent Wednesday to add speculation cost.
But the downtrend of the peso remained.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank and the Bankers Association are now planning
to open a 30-day non-deliverable forward (NDF) facility in dollar
this week.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, customers can buy NDF contracts from banks
which in turn will cover their dollar loans with the Central Bank.
As a result, firms with unhedged foreign exchange exposures need
not crowd the spot foreign exchange market and the pressure on the
peso is expected to ease.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that by the end of this week, when people calm
down and the pressure is not too great, things may get better. But
they added that the latest wave of plunge of the peso and other
regional currencies indicated that the currency turmoil plaguing
the region was far from over.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Restructure National Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Railways of
Zimbabwe (NRZ) is seeking funds to enable it to retrench about
4,000 workers, as the loss-making parastatal embarks on major
restructuring aimed at transforming it into a viable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
NRZ board chairman Sam Geza said yesterday the government is
currently negotiating with the World Bank to provide the fund of
over one billion Zimbabwe Dollars (60 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The parastatal currently employs nearly 11,000 people, a
situation which Geza said is not commensurate with the
organization's capacity.
</P>
<P>
''We have to correct the ratio of salaries and wages to the
gross revenue of the NRZ, which should be 35 percent, and not the
current 70 percent. this present situation is totally
unsustainable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Geza said his six-month-old board will move quickly to
commercialize the NRZ in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Before the retrenchment exercise begins, the parastatal will
first identify those units ''which should be scratched
completely, and those whose services could be out-sourced.''
</P>
<P>
Irrelevant posts will also be identified and abolished. All
the retrenched workers will be given their packages.
</P>
<P>
The commercialization of the NRZ, which has been on the cards
since 1990, will see the separation of the organization's
operations from infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
''In about two months from now we should have a total physical
separation of the two. The aim of the whole restructuring
exercise is to bring down tariffs on both rail and road networks
so that they compete internationally,'' Geza said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has already agreed to the separation of
infrastructure from operations, and what was now left was to
translate this into practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
A four-member task force consisting of staff from the NRZ
management was set up last December to steer the restructuring of
the parastatal.

PERTH, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil opened the women's water polo
action in the world swimming championships with a 9-5 victory over New
Zealand on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Camilla Pedrosa gave Brazil a lead after four minutes of scoreless
action. She and Julia Albuquerque then scored goals less than a
minute apart to put their side 3-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand netted the first goal through Jillaine Heather with
nine minutes left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand outscored Brazil 2-1 in the second quarter when Leah
Wistrand and Emma Jones both found the net as Brazilians slackened
off.
</P>
<P>
Brazil woke up from lethargy in the third quarter as Mariana
Secches scored twice and Danusa Da Silva contributed one goal, putting
the Brazilians 7-3 up.
</P>
<P>
Cristiana Pinciroli completed Brazil's tally one minute into the
fourth quarter. Wistrand scored to pull New Zealand to within four
with just under three minutes remaining in the match, but the team
would get no closer, falling by a final score of 9-5.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Coutinho said that defence was the key to their
victory.
</P>
<P>
"Since we played against New Zealand in December we have been
working really hard on defense which was really strong today," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Coach Tips Top Diving Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The West Australia Institute of
Sports' head diving coach Steve Foley believes the best-ever
diving will be seen at the Perth world swimming championships.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly the biggest and I think the depth of diving is
twice as good as it was here seven years ago," Foley was quoted by
West Australia Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
This year, picking a winner in any of the events will not be
easy.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the standard of divers had increased and the
improvement had made it difficult to predict how the events would
unfold.
</P>
<P>
"It is a little bit unpredictable this time, In Rome, and the
last time in Perth, we tended to know who would battle out for the
gold and silver, whereas this time, even though there might be a
few favorites, anything is possible," he told West Australia Daily.
</P>
<P>
Chinese divers dominated the 1991 Perth world championships,
winning four of the six gold medals at stake.
</P>
<P>
It was a similar story in 1994 in Rome when Chinese women again
dominated, with Yu Zhuocheng winning the men's three-meter
sprinborad gold.
</P>
<P>
Although Russian, Canadian, German and American divers will be
among those challenging for top honors, China will again put up a
strong performance.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are ranked No.1 in the world at the moment so they
will still be the ones to beat," Foley was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The addition of synchronized diving to the championships also
would be a major boost to the sport even though some people have
doubts over its inclusion.
</P>
<P>
"In the diving community it is probably taking a little bit of
time to get going," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"But what we are finding is the public and media are absolutely
loving it, and when it is done properly it is fantastic," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Gem, Jewelry Export Earnings Down in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's gem and jewelry
export earnings in the first 11 months last year stood at 10
billion rupees (167 million U.S. dollars), a 13.7-percent drop
from a year earlier, according to figures released by the Gem and
Jewelry Authority Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Average monthly earnings were 911 million rupees (15.2 million
dollars) last year, down from about 1.06 billion rupees (17.6
million dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the whole year of 1996, the country earned a total of 12.7
billion rupees (211 million dollars) from gem and jewelry exports.
</P>
<P>
The largest share of the 1997 earnings came from cut diamonds,
which amounted to 7.78 billion rupees (129.7 million dollars),
while gem exports netted 1.36 billion rupees (22.7 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's major gem and jewelry markets last year were Japan,
the United States, Germany, Australia, Italy, Switzerland,
Singapore, Thailand and France.
</P>
<P>
The authority is confident that exports this year will show a
certain increase thanks to the implementation of the government's
tax relief measures in favor of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the tax exemption package, gold, gem and jewelry industry
will be exempted from income tax as well as the National Security
Levy. Imports of gold and gem are now also duty-free.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Gem and Jewelry Authority has been empowered to
collect a fee of 1 percent from the sale of rough stones and use
the proceeds to provide insurance cover to gem miners.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Works to Boost Government Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday launched a campaign to consolidate the
integrity of the government machinery.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was initiated by the government's Anti-Corruption
Agency (ACA).
</P>
<P>
At the launch, held at the agency's headquarters here,
Mahathir, who is also home minister, handed over a copy each of
the Anti-Corruption Act 1997 and the Prime Minister's Order 1/98
to eight senior officials representing the government's management
system.
</P>
<P>
The new act provides the ACA with additional powers to deal
with graft perpetrated with growing sophistication.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Mahathir reminded leaders and administrators
that perpetrating graft against the have-nots is a form of social
oppression.
</P>
<P>
Left unchecked, corruption may build up public resentment
against the establishment and subsequently undermine national

"If the administration or its members collude with greedy
traders or entrepreneurs, the consequence will be escalating
operating and development costs," he said. "It is the people who
would have to bear these costs whereas most utilities meant for

unaffordable."

Integrity and trustworthiness are part of good ethics in any

<HEADLINE> No Chance of Bird Flu in Nepal: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- There is no chance of an
outbreak in Nepal of the bird flu, which has claimed four lives in
Hong Kong, The Kathmandu Post Thursday quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is not even remote chance of occurrence of the
particular strain of influenza causing virus H5N1 at present in
Nepal since no poultry products are imported from Hong Kong," D.
D. Joshi, an pathologist from the National Zoonosis and Food
Hygiene Research Center, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dr. B. B. Karki, director of the Epidemiology and Disease
Control Division, agreed. "We have the habit of eating well-cooked
chicken meat, unlike in Hong Kong, where they prefer half-cooked
dishes, so there is no chance of emergence of this disease in
Nepal," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that no one can be one hundred percent sure that
the particular strain of the virus does not exist in Nepal since
there are no well-developed laboratory facilities and enough
pathologists to trace the virus.
</P>
<P>
The bird flu was last seen in Nepal in 1974-75, he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Southeast Asian Currencies Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian currencies have
tumbled again and again to breathtaking new depths since the first
trading day of the new year, and these is no sign that they may
regain their strength anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian currencies started off the new year on the
wrong foot. Last Friday, the first trading day of 1998, the
Malaysian ringgit and the Philippine peso fell to fresh lows,
while the Indonesian rupiah and the Singapore dollar also slumped.
</P>
<P>
This week, the downward trend continued with most of southeast
Asian currencies hitting new historic lows. Most of the currencies
have lost at least 10 percent of their value against the dollar in
the past few days. The Japanese yen also fell to its record low in
six years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that high demand for dollars by companies to
repay or prepare short-term debt payments is one of many factors
that caused regional currencies to fall to new record lows.
</P>
<P>
The short-term debt payment by corporations will continue to
cause short supply of dollars in the region, they added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 62.2 percent of Asia's debt to
international banks was due to mature within this year. As Much of
Southeast Asia's debt is short-term and has to be paid soon,
companies have to buy in dollars to meet future debt payments for
fear that the dollar will be more expensive later.
</P>
<P>
However, while companies scramble for dollars, few
international investors are willing to buy Asian shares and sell
dollars into Asia because slowing economies are expected to hit
profits in the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the big gaps between the demand and the
supply of dollars are making the outlook for regional currencies
bleak in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Besides, less central bank interventions in the currency
markets recently, due to a drying up of foreign reserves, also
failed to stop falls of regional currencies in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the country's foreign exchange reserves
have reduced to 9 billion dollars, just enough for three months of
imports, from 10.9 billion dollars last July, when a Thai currency
crisis began to spread to the rest of Southeast Asia. The
situation in other Southeast Asian countries proved no better.
</P>
<P>
Without enough foreign reserves, the central banks could hardly
succeed in their interventions in the foreign exchange market and
arrest falls of regional currencies. If they do, they most
probably might only suffer big losses, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
But lack of confidence in Southeast Asia's economic health and
political stability is one of the major factors that drive
regional currencies to record lows.
</P>
<P>
The fear of worsening in the debt crisis in South Korea and
Indonesia, political uncertainty and possible social unrest in
some countries have also limited buying interest of investors and
encouraged corporate hedging activities since the beginning of the
new year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
During the last trading days, Indonesia's rupiah led the crash
of regional currencies as investors showed much concern about the
country's presidential elections in March and its national budget.
</P>
<P>
When the budget was unveiled on Tuesday, it was greeted with
disappointment and the rupiah quickly dived to new lows of 8,450
to the dollar against the opening 7,500/7,900.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that as Singapore is Jakarta's major trading
partner, the continuous drop of the rupiah will make the Singapore
dollar more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
At present, Southeast Asian countries have entered the period
of economic reforms and re-adjustments to save their economies,
and the full negative effects of the six-month old crisis will
begin to bite the region.
</P>
<P>
The economic adjustments and the impact of the crisis would
lead to more unemployed people, more closures of banks and
corporations in the months ahead. Any bad news will cause jitters
in the region's currency market.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the downward trend of regional currencies
is unlikely to change in the near term, and the situation might
only change in the later part of the year when the worst period of
the crisis is over.

<HEADLINE> Ciorbea Brushes off Minister's Reinstatement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea categorically rejected Wednesday the Democratic Party's
request for former transport minister Traian Basescu's
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea said in a statement following talks with coalition
parties: "This is unrealistic from the viewpoint of laws, politics
and morality."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the ruling coalition National Peasant's
Party, the National Liberal Party and the Hungarian Democratic
Union disagreed with Basescu's resumption of his post.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during the current period of reform and
transition, the cabinet shake-up was very normal. Even for the
prime minister, he would make no exception.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, which is responsible for the nomination
of a transport minister, exerted pressure on the government,
saying that Basescu was the most appropriate nominee, and the
prime minister should not lose sight of Basescu's achievements
during his term of office.
</P>
<P>
Basescu was dismissed on December 29 following his remarks
that the Romanian government was incompetent. The former transport
minister said in an interview published at the same day that the
"government did not have the strength to take important
decisions." He criticized the "useless 18-hour long sessions" of
Ciorbea's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Basescu, one of the more competent ministers in the government
and known for his frank talk, is the second minister to be sacked
within a week.
</P>
<P>
On December 23, Romania's foreign minister, Adrian Severin, was
asked to resign by President Emil Constantinescu after accusing
several politicians and newspaper editors of spying on behalf of
foreign powers.

<HEADLINE> University of Science and Technology Attracts Overseas Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, more and more
overseas scholars have returned to work for the University of
Science and Technology of China (USTC).
</P>
<P>
The USTC, one of China's key universities located in Hefei,
capital of east China's Anhui Province, now has more than 400
professors or research fellows who returned from overseas. About
30 people who obtained doctoral degrees abroad choose USTC a
year. The university also invited nearly 100 overseas scholars to
be its part-time professors or senior scholars.
</P>
<P>
Returned scholars hold two thirds of USTC's positions in charge
of scientific research, teaching, school management, foreign
affairs and postgraduate education.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four-year-old Ye Xiangdong was appointed vice-director
of USTC's school of engineering after he returned from Russia with
a doctor's degree.
</P>
<P>
Professor Sun Weidong, 36, was assigned to be in charge of the
USTC information center.
</P>
<P>
USTC worked out preferential policies to attract overseas
scholars. Those who decide to join USTC will have priority in
having research funds, labs, assistants as well as
apartments. USTC leaders even take the responsibility to find jobs
for the spouses of the overseas scholars and schools for their
children.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Zheng Yongfei from Germany was invited to work at USTC
in 1993. The university helped him successfully apply for national
research funding for outstanding young scientists the next
year. Zheng was then selected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), China's top natural science research body, as one of the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts to Help Hybrid Rice Growth in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese rice experts have
left for Bangladesh to help the neighboring agricultural country
to draft a national plan for spreading hybrid rice technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Kunlu and Wu Xiaojin, two experts on hybrid rice research
from Hunan-based China national hybrid rice engineering research
center, is to make appraisal of installations of the hybrid rice
research institutions and breeding capacity of hybrid rice seeds
before helping make a medium-range development plan of hybrid rice
for the country.
</P>
<P>
During their four-month stay in Bangladesh, Zhou and Wu is to
make trial growth of high-yield Chinese hybrid rice and teach
local agro-technicians techniques of breeding seeds and
cultivating hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is a country with a big population but a small
amount of per capita land. The rice output accounts for 95 percent
of the country's grain output. The hybrid rice technology is
expected to help the country to raise the rice production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has funded a
medium-term development plan of Bangladesh's research and seed

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt urged residents in border areas to work with the
government to promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, made the call at an opening ceremony for a
bridge on the Kengtung-Mongla road in eastern Shan state of
Myanmar, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Former Chinese Star Says China Remains No.1 in Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Chinese diving star Li
Kongzheng said China remained the world top diving power despite its
lackluster performance last year.
</P>
<P>
"There is no country able to match China in depth of talents, said
Li, platform silver medalist in the 1984 Olympic Games and now head
coach of the U.S. diving team.
</P>
<P>
"China is certain to dominate the diving events at the Perth world
championships," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's prowess in diving has been affected by retirement of Fu
Mingxia, women's three-time Olympic gold medalist, and semi-retirement
of men's Olympic springborad champion Xiong Ni.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese world championship team is now led by 1992 Olympic
men's platform champion Sun Shuwei, who failed to qualify for the 1996
Games because of injuries, and Yu Zhuocheng, springboard runner-up to
Xiong in the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Threat to China, if any, will come from Russia which boasts two
world-class divers Dimitry Sautin and Vera Ilyina, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Sautin, 1996 Olympic champion in platfrom, fared well in 1997, the
year he concluded with a sweep of the World Cup platform and three-meter
springboard titles in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, who lost only once in his five encounters with Chinese
divers last year, made Chinese officials worried.
</P>
<P>
"Sautin is our top threat and he is nearly invincible," said
Chinese diving team leader Yuan Jianwei.
</P>
<P>
Li Kongzheng said that Yuan was overstating the situation.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Chinese divers were focusing on the National Games in
Shanghai and it seemed they didn't pay much attention to other
competitions," Li said. "The year of 1998 will be different."
</P>
<P>
Ilyina is Russia's top women diver who triumphed in the U.S. Open,
Rome Grand Prix and European championships last year.
</P>
<P>
Li is one of those Chinese divers-turned-coaches who are coaching
outside of China.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese coaches are everywhere in the world, and in the United
States alone, there are over 40 Chinese coaches," said the world top
coach Xu Yiming, whose students have won nine Olympic and 26 world
championship gold medals for China.

<HEADLINE> Alligator Thriving in Breeding Center, Languishing in Wild (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Population of Chinese alligator,
once on the verge of extinction, is now multiplying, but not in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from the country's largest alligator breeding
and research center in east China's Anhui Province shows that the
number of alligators there has shot up to more than 7,000, making
their dwelling place, the one-square-kilometer lake, a bit
"overcrowded".
</P>
<P>
The reptile is rare and precious because it is one of the few
species that were originated form the same period as dinosaurs but
have survived to this day.
</P>
<P>
It was listed as the endangered species by the United Nations
as early as in 1973 and has been under the state first-class
protection since then.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by a field survey which revealed the alligator's
population had shrunk to less than 500, China built up the first
alligator's breeding center in 1979 in Anhui Province, the
reptile's main natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
Now the center boasts expertise from alligator's egg hatching
to baby alligator raising. The survival rate is more than 90
percent.

<P>
However, that alone cannot make wildlife experts free of
misgives.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid the wild alligator population is decreasing," said
Gu Changming, deputy director of the Wildlife Protection Agency in
Anhui. "It's still too early to say that they would not totally
disappear some day."
</P>
<P>
A recent survey convinced zoologists that the alligator could
no longer be found in its former habitat in Zhejiang Province,
also in east China.
</P>
<P>
That means wild Chinese alligators are now living only in
Anhui, in the 13 nature reserves set up in 1983. These reserves
cover a total water area of 433 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Gu said the use of farm chemicals and pesticide pollution have
poisoned the environment. "Worse still, some people don't have the
conscious to protect wild animals."
</P>
<P>
Some alligators would dig holes for hibernation in the rice
field or ponds, plus they live on fish and shrimps and eat up
ducks and geese they can find in the water. The angry farmers
often kill alligators within their reach.
</P>
<P>
The animal is actually very docile. They are pretty small, the
biggest one is about two meters and weighes about 20 kilograms, Gu
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Anhui Province is preparing a field survey to find out
the wild Chinese alligator population and changes of their living
environment. The project will be joined by experts from the
National Wildlife Federation of the United States and the
International Union of Conservation of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
To boost wild alligator population, zoologists plan to release
to nature some raised in captive, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for alligators brought up in captive to
adapt to natural environment. We must risk that great many of them
should not survive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that alligators kept in the breeding center will
ultimately face challenges from gene degeneration.
</P>
<P>
"We will make efforts to protect wild alligators," said Qing
Jianhua, director of Wildlife Protection Department in the
Ministry of Foresty. "That's the only way to retain the rare
species," he added.

<HEADLINE> Baht's Instability Hampers Economic Revival: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Olarn Chaipravat, president of
the Bankers' Association of Thailand, said on Wednesday that the
instability of the foreign exchange market had hampered efforts to
ease tight liquidity and revamp high interest rate policies.
</P>
<P>
He added that currency instability and the confidence crisis
had stalled efforts by policy-makers to revive the economy and
rendered previous economic theories useless, the Bangkok Post
Thursday quotes him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said made the remarks when commenting on the continued slide
of the baht, which had been falling since the end of the New Year
holiday, creating new lows each day for three straight days.
</P>
<P>
The Thai currency closed at 53.20 to the US dollar on Wednesday
in the local market, compared with 52.20 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Offshore, the baht dropped to as low as 54.50 to the dollar in
the morning session before gaining ground to trade late at
52.80/53.00.
</P>
<P>
The baht has lost more than 100 percent against the dollar
since it was floated on July 2 last year. The pre-float rate was
25.79 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Olarn said demand for the dollar in the market was being driven
by a withdrawal of funds by foreign creditors and investors and by
a rush of local firms to hedge future debt obligations.
</P>
<P>
Normal daily trading in the local market totals about 300-400
million US dollars through 31 foreign and Thai commercial banks in
the country, with about 60 percent of transactions in the forward
market.
</P>
<P>
However, during the past few days forward transactions rose to
about 70 percent, reflecting the panic rush by locals for the
dollar, according to Olarn, who is also president of Siam
Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
Deeply concerned about the continued plunge of the baht,
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Wednesday that the
government would announce new steps to deter speculation against
the Thai currency, but he refused to reveal details.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are searching
for ways to alleviate China's water shortage problems through new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The scientists are trying to improve water pollution treatment
technologies and increase reuse of water. Technologies have been
applied to treat industrial waste water discharged by paper making,
leather, food, dying, and oil-drilling sectors, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Ningyang County Paper Mill, a large plant in east China's
Shandong Province, will take the lead early this year in trying a
water pollution treatment technology approved by the State Science
and Technology Commission (SSTC).
</P>
<P>
The process will be implemented at paper mills across the
country in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Another project which will recycle 99 percent of water used in
oil exploration is being used in oil fields, Wen Jianping,
deputy-director of the China Research Center for Water Pollution
and Water Reuse under the SSTC, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project, developed by Wen's center, can treat 20,000 tons
of waste water daily.
</P>
<P>
Wen and his colleagues are working on recycling discharged
water from hotels, office buildings, car washes and public
washrooms.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the many countries in the world facing water
shortage, a situation plaguing more than 300 of its 660-odd
cities.

BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Each of the 10,000 gold shops
throughout Thailand have agreed to contribute one kilogram of gold
bullion to the government, according to Deputy Finance Minister
Pichet Trangsithpakdi.
</P>
<P>
The gold will be used to boost the country's reserves which are
drying up because of attacks by currency speculators.

is likely to carry an annual interest rate of 5 percent with a
maturity period of three to five years.

The Finance Ministry will appoint a committee to decide on
details of the bond issue next week., he said.

TIANJIN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The "VPW", an automobile alarm
system that can help police locate stolen automobiles in less than
20 seconds, is now available in Tianjin, a north China port city.
</P>
<P>
The alarm system was invented by the Zhengdawang
Telecommunications Co. Ltd. and the Zhongyou Company, using new
DSP processing and magnified frequency telecommunications
technology.
</P>
<P>
According to company executives, a lost or stolen car can be
found in less than 20 seconds after the driver reports the number
of the car to a monitoring center.
</P>
<P>
The system can also be used to locate the position of a moving
object and to follow it in a certain area, or to follow the
positions of ships in a harbor, within a 15-m. range of error.
</P>
<P>
The system is suitable for banks, department stores,
warehouses, or even individual households for emergency purposes.

<P>
BUDAPEST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic are seeking support from the United
States Senate in formally joining the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The three ministers are expected to go to the U.S. between
February 9 and 11 to press the case with Senate members.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Foreign Minister Kovacs Laszlo, who revealed this at
a press conference Wednesday, said there are no insuperable
difficulties for the parliaments of NATO members to ratify the
documents for the three nations to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The alliance signed agreements with Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic on December 16, 1997, after it decided to absorb
the three countries as new members at its Madrid Summit last July.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreements still need to be ratified by the
parliaments of the NATO members before they become effective.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only the U.S. Senate has difficulty in approving the
agreements. The number of supporters in the Senate is less than a
half the total, which is necessary for the ratification.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers of the three countries, who had been to
the United States earlier, hoped to persuade a majority of
senators to support their cause.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Criticizes U.S. Policy Toward Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami on Wednesday criticized the Iran policy adopted by the
U.S. government, saying that the American politicians still live
"with Cold War mentality."
</P>
<P>
"They continue to live with Cold War mentality and try to
create a perceived enemy," Khatami told Cable News Network
reporter Christiane Amanpour in an interview which is to be
broadcast on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Taking Iran as such a kind of perceived enemy, the
U.S. Congress has allocated 20 million U.S. dollars in an attempt
"to topple the Iranian government," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the attitude of the United States toward Iran was
not a "civilized one."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "many progressive countries, including the
Europeans, are far more advanced in their foreign policies than
the United States."
</P>
<P>
The United States adopted a hostile policy against Iran and
tried to inflict economic damage upon it, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that such a policy also had a positive effect.
</P>
<P>
"It made us mainly focus on our domestic capabilities and
resources to advance our objectives."
</P>
<P>
The United States severed ties with Iran in 1979 after its
embassy in Tehran was stormed by a group of Islamic militants and
52 Americans there were held hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
Because of the hostility of the United States toward Iran over
the past two decades, "there is a grave mistrust" between the two
countries, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He said if there is a dialogue between the two countries, the
United States "should respect the rights of each individual and
adopt an approach based on communicative rationality."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Plunges to All-Time low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah plunged to
a record low of 8,450 against the U.S. dollar in the morning trade
Wednesday as the financial market gave a cool response to the
1998-99 state budget but recovered later to close at 7,900/8,100,
dealers here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The weakened rupiah also dragged down share prices, pushing
down the Jakarta Stock Exchange's composite index below 400
points.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah hit a low of 8,450 against the greenback in the
morning session before recovering to 8,200/8,300 during the lunch
break.
</P>
<P>
The spot rupiah ended at 7,900/8,100 at the close compared to
an opening of 7,500/7,900.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has persistently dropped since the financial turmoil
hit the country early July last year. The greenback has
appreciated 235 percent against the rupiah since then.
</P>
<P>
Negative reaction toward the draft state budget unveiled by
President Soeharto Tuesday night fueled the rush for dollars,
currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The demand for dollars did not only come from corporate
borrowers to pay maturing debts, but also from jittery individuals
and institutions, one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said the draft state budget, which called
for a hefty 32.1 percent increase in both revenue and expenditures
to 133.5 trilling rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals 4,000 rupiah),
was too optimistic given the drop in the country's economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
Most people in the financial market think that some figures in
the government's state budget are too optimistic and unrealistic,"
an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rupiah's free fall dragged down share prices,
with the benchmark composite index losing 1.99 percent to close at
394.23.

<HEADLINE> India, Italy Against Quick-Fix Formula on U.N. Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 8 (Xinhua)-- India and Italy have called for
greater democratization of the United Nations and strongly opposed
any quick-fix formula for expansion of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen here Wednesday evening, visiting Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who arrived here Tuesday on a
three-day visit, said that Italy was not opposed to inclusion of
Germany and Japan in the Security Council, but any decision on the
expansion should be taken by the two-thirds of the total
membership of the world body and not merely by a majority of the
members present and voting.
</P>
<P>
As far as Italy is concerned, Prodi said that his country was
opposed to any increase in the number of permanent members of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Indian claim for a permanent seat in the
proposed expansion of the Security Council, he said Italy wished
India well in its endeavour, but it would not be easy for any
non-industrialized nation to get a permanent seat in the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy and India should share their common
perception on the need for complete democratization of the
U.N. and were opposed to any quick fix formula for expansion of
the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Posts Budget Surplus in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government posted
a budget surplus of 1.15 billion pesos (25.5 million US dollars)
in 1997 despite the tight fiscal scenario brought about by the
peso depreciation.
</P>
<P>
This was the country's fourth consecutive year of surplus since
1994, the Philippine Daily Inquirer Thursday quoted Finance
Secretary Roberto de Ocampo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The finance chief noted that the surplus was a "big turnaround"
from the 22-billion-peso (488.9-million-dollar) deficit expected
by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
But it was smaller than the original surplus target of 7
billion pesos (155.6 million dollars) for 1997 and the actual
surplus of 6.3 billion pesos (140 million dollars) in 1996, De
Ocampo said.
</P>
<P>
The surplus was made possible by last minute remittances from
government-owned corporations which had pledged to augment overall
collections by a combined 7.1 billion pesos (157.8 million
dollars) in dividends, he said.

<HEADLINE> Police Chiefs Meet in Rome on Kurdish Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 7 (Xinhua) -- National police chiefs from seven
European countries and Turkey arrived here Wednesday to discuss
ways to control the westward exodus of Kurdish refugees.
</P>
<P>
Top police officials from Italy, Turkey, Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and Greece were scheduled to meet
Thursday for one-day talks on illegal immigration, and better
controls of the European borders.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 immigrants, mostly Turkish and Iraqi Kurds,
arrived in southern Italy in recent weeks. They sparked a debate
that has since spread to other European Union countries on how to
deal with the exodus.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been accused of encouraging a further exodus after it
announced in late December that it would consider Kurds -- either
fleeing the war in southeastern Turkey or fighting in northern
Iraq -- eligible for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Tuesday that his
country would examine favorably requests for political asylum from
Kurds on an individual, not a collective, basis.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the European Commission, the executive body of the
EU, said on Wednesday that the Schegen accord, which provides for
passport-free movement among nine EU states, would not in itself
help an influx of Kurdish refugees to spread throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
But, the commission said: "The EU must speak with one voice and
act after coordinating its actions." If not, "weakness and
difficulties would arise in controlling refugees flows now and in
the future."
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister, traveling in India, Wednesday
called on the European countries to coordinate well in their
efforts to regulate the immigration.
</P>
<P>
"There cannot be an Italian policy, a French one and a German
one. We need a common policy," he said.

<HEADLINE> East China's "Dragon Head" of Pudong Gains Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Pudong, known as the "dragon
head" of China's dynamic Yangtze River Delta, is expected to
flaunt greater economic amplifying power as a result of an
increasing concentration of many of the most important markets.
</P>
<P>
Once the more backward side of China's leading commercial
metropolis separated from the downtown area by the Huangpu River,
Pudong is now home to the markets in property rights, grain and
edible oil, real estate and securities.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of China's
two bourses, to Pudong late last year has been widely deemed as a
symbol of the area as a rising financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that Shanghai will also move the shipping,
technology and metal exchanges to Pudong, making it more matchable
to the role of an engine of economic growth in the Yangtze River
Delta.
</P>
<P>
While more important markets move to Pudong, investment in its
infrastructure has been growing rapidly. A loan of 612 million
yuan has been arranged for the construction of the Century Avenue,
a main line of Pudong.
</P>
<P>
All this indicates that Pudong has entered a new round of
development both in infrastructure and in its role as a financial
and trade center, said Zhao Qizheng, Vice Mayor and Director of
the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
"As it gains weight as a 'dragon head', Pudong will lead
economic growth in Shanghai and the the Yangtze River Valley as a
whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Improvement in the investment environment has turned Pudong
into a kind of magnet for foreign investors, experts here say.
</P>
<P>
To date 20 overseas banks and insurance companies have moved to
Pudong, with nine of the banks allowed to deal in the Chinese
currency on a trial basis. Pudong is also home to the headquarters
and regional offices of more than 70 multi-national corporations.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 4,900 overseas-funded enterprises in
Pudong, with investment totaling more than 23 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pudong's amplifying power to the Yangtze River
Valley and further to the interior areas is becoming increasingly
apparent.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures show that more than 200 state-owned enterprises
were involved in the processing trade in Pudong at the end of last
November. Government ministries, the Shanghai Municipality and
other provinces and regions of China have set up 86 foreign trade
companies in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Pudong grew an estimated 18
percent to 60.8 billion yuan in 1997, with the service industry
accounting for one third of the total. The value of Pudong's GDP
grew 20.2 percent in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo on Wednesday named Rosario Green Macias as foreign
minister, the first woman to ever hold the post in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The new woman minister was named to replace Jose Angel Gurria
who was reappointed as finance minister on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Macias, born in 1941, was an ambassador to the former
Democratic Republic of Germany in 1989-1990, the United Nations
under-secretary-general in 1994-95, and vice foreign minister of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was part of the cabinet reshuffle. Zedillo also
changed the posts of interior, finance and agriculture ministers
on January 3-5.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party said
the changes would help consolidate the national foreign policy,
help the economy recover, and help provide a more feasible
solution to the political crisis in the southeastern state of
Chiapas where 45 women and children were killed in
December.

NEW YORK -- The U.S. dollar dropped more than 2 yen Wednesday
on fears that Japan would join an effort to hold down the surging

WASHINGTON -- An American who was arrested on charges of spying
in Russia will not have to return to that country to face spying
charges, Senator Richard Bryan said Wednesday.
</P>

Bryan was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that
high-level diplomatic negotiations persuaded Russia to lift a
Saturday deadline for Richard Bliss to return.

<P>
However, Bliss, who works for San Diego-based Qualcomm,
technically remains charged with espionage, but doesn't have to
answer to Russian authorities, the senator said.

Bliss was charged with spying on November 25 and was released
December 5, and returned to San Diego Christmas night.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Crimes of Unit "731" Discovered in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of original written
materials which can prove the crimes committed by the Unit "731"
of the war-time Japanese army have been discovered by researchers.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that these materials, written in Japanese,
are the first group of the kind so far found in China.
</P>
<P>
These materials, in 31 volumes, are all printed with the words
"special transfer", which means people arrested by the Japanese
army were sent to the Unit "731" for germ experiments through
special means.
</P>
<P>
Orders signed between 1940 and 1941 by the commander of the
Japanese Kwantung Army, which first invaded northeast China in
1931, and head of Japanese military police corps in northeast
China were also found in the 31 volumes of evidence materials.
</P>
<P>
All the 31 volumes of materials include complete information on
people who were arrested by the Japanese army, which include their
biographical notes, cause of arrest and trial, degree of education
and instructions on sending them to the Unit "731" for
bacteriological test. Some of the materials also have photos of
the arrested.
</P>
<P>
Unit "731" belongs to the Japanese aggressor troop's Kwantung
Army, with its headquarters based in Harbin, during the World War
II. The unit won an ill reputation for manufacturing germ weapons
based on experiments on living people.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 people were used for germ experiments by the Unit
"731", according to an arrested Japanese army official in charge
of germ experiments.

<HEADLINE> Job Layoffs Loom in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 to 20,000 industrial
workers, mostly in the manufacturing sector, will lose their jobs
this year due to production cutbacks by companies hard hit by the
peso depreciation and soaring interest rates.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Raul Concepcion, president of the
Federation of Philippine Industries, who warned that the number of
workers who will be laid off will rise if the financial crunch
does not improve.
</P>
<P>
"As I said this is all market forces driven. The government
can't legislate or the executive can't put out rules and
regulations and say, no, don't cut back," local press reports
Thursday quoted Concepcion as saying.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, he said, permanent workers who will be retained
will have reduced working time of only three days a week.
</P>
<P>
Even in the public sector, there is a mass displacement of
personnel due to the severe belt-tightening measures ordered by
President Fidel Ramos, Concepcion said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos admitted on Wednesday that unemployment will unavoidably
rise this year due to the current currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We must expect that to happen. The government cannot afford to
say we don't need a cutback. We can't do that; otherwise we will
be subsidizing business," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic slowdown, however, the government and the
private sector would continue to produce quality jobs for the
labor force, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion said he feared a surge in the number of unemployed
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) due to cutbacks being implemented
by host countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos remained confident there will be enough jobs for
OFWs particularly in the Middle East.

<P>
BUDAPEST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic are seeking support from the United
States Senate in formally joining the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The three ministers are expected to go to the U.S. between
February 9 and 11 to press the case with Senate members.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Foreign Minister Kovacs Laszlo, who revealed this at
a press conference Wednesday, said there are no insuperable
difficulties for the parliaments of NATO members to ratify the
documents for the three nations to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The alliance signed agreements with Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic on December 16, 1997, after it decided to absorb
the three countries as new members at its Madrid Summit last July.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreements still need to be ratified by the
parliaments of the NATO members before they become effective.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only the U.S. Senate has difficulty in approving the
agreements. The number of supporters in the Senate is less than a
half the total, which is necessary for the ratification.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers of the three countries hope to persuade a
majority of senators to support their cause.

WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami has called for warmer relations between the American and
Iranian people as a way to ease two decades of hostility between

"Nothing should prevent dialogue and understanding between the

Khatami told Cable News Network reporter Christiane Amanpour in an

"Right now, I recommend the exchange of professors, writers,

It is the latest in a series of calls made by Khatami since he

As early as last December, Khatami proposed a "thoughtful
dialogue between the American people and the Iranian people,"
which received a positive response from United States President
Bill Clinton.

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,780 small
state-owned enterprises in north China's Hebei Province have
introduced various reform measures.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
recently excavated ten ancient sites dating back 8,000 years,
which are expected to provide clues to the origin of Chinese
civilization.
</P>
<P>
These sites, including hundreds of tombs and houses, are the
oldest ones of the Neo-Stone Age found on the lower reaches of the
Yellow River, scattered in a 150-kilometer-wide area in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that this is the first time for them to find
Neo-Stone Age sites which are so densely located.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest houses occupies a floor space of 50 square
meters, and is distinctly divided into a kitchen, bedrooms and
parlous. Pottery articles of different types as well as animal
bones have been unearthed.
</P>
<P>
In another site, archeologists found that in two tombs 14 and
19 people were buried together, respectively, hinting that there
existed a strange custom at that time, when matriarchy was quite
popular.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River valley is believed to be the cradle of Chinese
civilization. Since early this century, archeologists have
unearthed thousands of prehistorical sites there, mainly belonging
to the famous Yangshao and Longshan Cultures of the Neo-Stone
Age.

<P>
CARACAS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever killed 40 people
last year in Venezuela and cholera claimed another 50, a report of
the Epidemiology Office of the Health Ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32,391 people were affected by Dengue last year and
2,282 by cholera, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Of the total cases of dengue, 6,109 people, or 19 percent, were
of the hemorrhagic type.
</P>
<P>
Over the first week of this year, another 1,253 people infected
with dengue were registered.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the outbreak and spread of the two diseases
to a decline in the budget for the country's health and
epidemic-control programs.
</P>
<P>
Dengue and cholera were declared epidemic respectively in
Venezuela in November and June last year and the authorities have
not yet removed the alert.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that a social re-organization is the only way to
overcome the epidemics of dengue and cholera which stem from
poverty and less health attention.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Finds More Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Changchun,
capital city of northeast China's Jilin Province, are expected to
say goodbye to the days when they are troubled by shortage of
drinking water resources.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the great efforts the local government
has made in developing water supply projects in urban areas in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Changchun, a famous cultural city and a center of Chinese film
making and automobile manufacturing industries, is one of the
country's 50 cities which are short of water resources.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, the city government has sped up the
construction of water supply projects by introducing foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun Industrial Water Supply Plant, a project
involving Japanese investment, and the Third Water Treatment
Plant, built with a loan from the World Bank, can raise the daily
water supply volume to 1.06 million cubic meters from the former
590,000 cubic meters when they are operational.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the city extended the total length of
its running water supply pipes from 99,600 km to 129,840 km, with
the number of people who use running water rising to 1.79 million
from the original 1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
A project to divert water from the Songhua River into Changchun
city is going on smoothly and is expected to become operational
very soon.
</P>
<P>
The project, with an investment of 1.88 billion yuan, will
enable the city to have enough water for daily living and
industrial use.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ferrari team today unveiled its
new F-300 car with which it hopes drivers Michael Schumacher and
Eddie Irvine to capture the 1998 Formula One championship.
</P>
<P>
The F in the new name stands for Ferrari while the 300 refers
to the number of cubic centimeters (cc) of each of its ten
cylinders.
</P>
<P>
The F-300 was presented in a ceremony held at Maranello,
Ferrari's high-tech wind tunnel, designed by Italian architect
Renzo Piano, with the participation of the two drivers together
with Ferrari Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, team manager
Jean Todi and test driver Luca Baduer.
</P>
<P>
"We want to win the 1998 championship, if we do not it will
mean that we have missed our primary objective for the season",
the Ferrari chairman told the press.
</P>
<P>
The new car is made out of carbon fibers, it is 4.34 meters
long, 1.795 meters wide, 961 centimeters high and weights some 600
kg. It has a new independent suspension system in both front and
back as well as a new semi-automatic transmission and electronic

<HEADLINE> Brazil Increases Mine Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil invested 120 million
U.S. dollars in mine exploration last year, becoming second-placed
as the most attractive nation of the region for foreign investors
on mineral exploration after Chile, the Mining Exploration
Company of Brazil reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Its President Carlos Oiti Berbert explained in Rio de Janeiro
that of the total invested, 33 percent was foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He announced that investment for mine exploration in Brazil
could reach 200 million dollars yearly by 2000, 80 percent expected
to come from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Berbert said that Brazil is recovering its rank at mineral
exploration worldwide after it dropped to the 9th rank in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Brazil had invested an average of 150 million dollars per
year, 41 of them being foreign money, until 1988, but fell then
into a declining phase.
</P>
<P>
Berbert said that his country still has brilliant prospects for
mineral development because "Brazil's 50 percent of mineral areas
still remain unexplored, particularly in the Amazonic."
</P>
<P>
Brazil is expected to have directed some 30 billion dollars to
the mining industry by 2000, of which four billion will have come
from foreign investors, he said.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, south China's
biggest industrial center, has been successful in helping laid-off
workers find new jobs and having a re-employment rate above 55
percent.
</P>
<P>
The city has established a system to ensure that laid-off
workers, who mainly come from financially troubled state
enterprises, can rely on help from job agencies and accept
re-training for other posts, according to Jiang Yun, deputy
director of the Labor Department of Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
For example, the department jointly held a coach
driver-training class for laid-off workers with a public bus
company, which enabled many laid-off workers to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou set aside 25 million yuan (3.12 million U.S. dollars)
in early 1997 to help laid-off workers. The city since has doubled
the allocation.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 laid-off workers benefited from the fund last
year, 60 percent of whom have been re-employed, said Jiang.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urban Students Have Less Skills for College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Less than 20 percent of high
school teachers in inner city schools in the United States are
confident that their students have the skills to do well in
college, said a report on urban education released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Urban districts are those in which 75 percent or more of the
households served by a district are in the central city of a
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
Urban schools, with 11 million students, account for one-fourth
of the nation's public school population. About 43 percent of the
nation's minority children and 35 percent of the poor children
attend urban public schools.
</P>
<P>
The report by Education Week newspaper found that the low
expectations were coupled with low performance by students on
national measures of reading, math and science.
</P>
<P>
By examining results from national standardized tests of
fourth-grade reading in 1994, it was found that 43 percent of the
inner city school children scored at or above a basic level,
compared with 63 percent elsewhere and 58 percent for the nation
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 test for eighth-grade math, 42 percent of city
children scored at or above the basic level, compared with 63
percent elsewhere and 62 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
Similarly in the eighth-grade science test, 38 percent of the
students were at or above basic level, compared with 65 percent
elsewhere and 61 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
Education experts attribute the unsatisfactory performance of
urban students partly to classroom crowding and shortages of
teachers and guidance counselors, in addition to kids from
difficult or poor situations.

MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
planned to slash its spending and seek new loans from abroad as

<P>
The peso has depreciated by more than 70 percent against the
dollar since the regional currency crisis began in July 1997. The
peso fell to a record low of 46.50 per dollar on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Twin-hump Camel Is Suited For Cold Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The reason single-hump camels
live in the scorching deserts of Africa and most twin-hump camels
live in the cold deserts of northwestern China has to do with the
ability to adapt, Chinese scientists have said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 19 million camels in the world have one hump and
live in the deserts of northern and western Africa. There are also
about two million camels with two humps, 400,000 of which inhabit
the regions of Xinjiang, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia in northern and
northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianlin, a professor at Gansu Agricultural University, who
has studied camels for years, said that twin-hump camels have
thick skin that can protect them from cold weather, and hair that
is long in the winter and short in the summer.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two humps, which store fat and nutrients,
other parts of the animal hold large amounts of fat, allowing it
to adapt to the cold weather in northern and northwestern
China, Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
Single-hump camels contain much less fat in their bodies. But,
Wang said, the two still have a lot in common. Their sweat glands
are not very well developed, something that helps them retain
water, and they can drink as much as 80 kilograms of water at one
time, and can live on what their bodies store for more than 20
days.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Agricultural University started doing research on camels
in the 1950s to look for ways to protect the animal, but, Wang
said: "Research on the physical structure of camels is still
not enough."

project in northwest China has greatly benefitted local residents
since its initiation last October.
</P>
<P>
The six-year project, which covers 26 poverty-stricken counties
in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, involves 2.3 million people and a funding of three billion
yuan, including a World Bank loan of 180 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program in Ningxia was designed to provide assistance to
235,000 farmers in four state-designated poverty-stricken
counties. Construction of the first phase project is almost
finished, and more than 6,000 rural families in 85 villages in the
four aforementioned counties have witnessed substantially improved
standards of living.
</P>
<P>
Offices opened by the autonomous region in related villages,
which bear responsibility for all work, have launched land
development, infrastructure, and village enterprise projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, other projects involving improvements to terraced
fields, digging wells, breeding livestock and planting both grass
and trees are currently underway.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank project will lead to the development of
approximately 20,000 ha of terraced fields and grain production on
18,000 ha, as well as the plantation of cash crops on 2,800 ha,
26,000 wells, and three potable water processing projects. In
addition, related programs will help increase the average annual
per capita income of farmers to over 500 yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- German coach Udo Lattek said
Wednesday that he would not take the coach position for Iran's
football team at this year's World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Lattek said he had made his decision to "preserve his family
life".
</P>
<P>
Lattek, 62, was one of three top coaches that Iran had said it
was considering for the post.

<P>
Portuguese Eduardo Vingada and Argentine Carlos Bilardo are the
other contenders, according to Mohsen Safai-Farahani, the head of
the Iran Football Federation.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said it will name its coach by January 15.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Valdeir Vierra, who guided Iran to the finals
with a two-leg playoff victory over Australia, is apparently not
in contention for the post.
</P>
<P>
Iran are drawn in the same World Cup first-round group as
Germany, the United States and Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar dropped more
than 2 yen Wednesday on fears that Japan would join an effort to
hold down the surging U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell against the German mark as traders
anxiously awaited details of a meeting between U.S. officials and
Japanese financial officials.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 131.25 yen,
down from 133.65 late Tuesday. It was the sharpest drop since
December 17, when the dollar fell nearly 6 yen after Japan's
central bank launched a surprise intervention to sell dollars for
the first time in more than five years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 1.8223 marks, down
from 1.8314.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan has reportedly intervened three times since
that first action, the latest being a reported 2 billion U.S.
dollar effort on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the yen's rise, other Asian currencies showed no signs
of recovery Wednesday. The Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah
and the New Taiwan dollar all fell again to record lows.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday:
1.4758 Swiss francs, down from 1.4825; 6.0957 French francs, down

WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Five people were missing and
six others injured in two powerful blasts that leveled an
explosives plant near Reno, Nevada, today, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were inside the Sierra Chemical Co. plant near
Lockwood, about 19 kilometers east of Reno, when the blasts
happened, the Associated Press said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Both main buildings at the plant were flattened, windows of
smaller buildings at the plant were shattered and the buildings
were riddled with shrapnel. The blasts were felt as far as 30
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The plant owner said the buildings contained cast primer, a
TNT-based product used in mining.

Four of the injured remained at the hospital, three in

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- An American who was arrested
on charges of spying in Russia will not have to return to that
country to face spying charges, Senator Richard Bryan said today.
</P>
<P>
Bryan was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that
high-level diplomatic negotiations persuaded Russia to lift a
Saturday deadline for Richard Bliss to return.
</P>
<P>
However, Bliss, who works for San Diego-based Qualcomm,
technically remains charged with espionage, but doesn't have to
answer to Russian authorities, the senator said.
</P>
<P>
Bliss was charged with spying on November 25 and was released
December 5, and returned to San Diego Christmas night.
</P>
<P>
"That was a pretty good indication that he was not a spy,"
Bryan said. "No country would allow a spy to return to the country
of their origin."

<HEADLINE> Governor, District Attorney Vow to Try Bombing Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Oklahoma Governor Frank
Keating and Oklahoma City District Attorney Robert Macy have vowed
to try convicted bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols on
state murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Macy said he is ready to lay fresh charges against the two men.
Nichols today escaped the death penalty for his role in the April
19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
Judge Richard Matsch dismissed a jury in Denver, Colorado,
today after it could not agree on a punishment. Matsch must now
decide Nichols' fate, following his conviction in December last
year on charges of conspiracy to murder and involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh already faces the death penalty, having been found
guilty of first degree murder in the deaths of eight federal
employees of the 168 bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
Of a state prosecution, "We're ready to go. It's not over yet.
That's the important message that needs to go out now. Hopefully
we'll have a different verdict," Macy was quoted as saying by
United Press International.
</P>
<P>
Keating condemned the jury's indecision, saying it did not
square with the first Nichols verdict, "I certainly don't agree
with the second decision, essentially throwing up their hands and
walking away. Anybody involved in any way in this crime deserves
the death penalty that will be imposed at an Oklahoma trial,"
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Many survivors and relatives of victims also want a separate
state prosecution, in which all 168 victims, and not only eight
federal officials, would be named. Some, believing the jury gave
up too easily, want the death penalty for Nichols, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Better Child Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today proposed a 21.7 billion-dollar package of grants and tax
breaks to help working families find affordable care for children.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced the plan before an audience of parents and
children in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called his proposal a fiscally responsible attempt to
help American families, and he urged Republicans in Congress to
embrace it.
</P>
<P>
The key element would be a major expansion of the state block
grant program offering subsidies for child care. Clinton's plan
would add 7.5 billion dollars to the program over five years,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also would expand the reach of the program to
lower-income families, officials said. The program now largely
helps Americans trying to move from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
Congress would have to approve all the money for Clinton's
proposals, and Republicans have resisted earlier attempts to
expand social spending. The administration expects nearly a third
of the money to come from an expected settlement between the
government and the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
Another major component would be 5.2 billion dollars over five
years to expand the income tax credit that parents can take for
child care expenses.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also earmarked money to expand an after-school program
run by the Education Department and called the 21st century
community learning center program.
</P>
<P>
Another initiative calls for early-learning fund, grants to
communities and public-private partnerships for early childhood
development.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also proposed tax credits for businesses that build or
expand child care facilities.

LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
kept on falling and most of them ended lower Wednesday, depressed
by a weaker Wall Street and continued worries over the Asian
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Britain's major shares ended sharply down with profit- taking
largely behind the fall on the back of Asian currency turmoil. The
FTSE 100 index finished the session at 5,224.1, lossing 40.3
points on the day.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a fresh downturn in New York also put
pressure on stocks as Far Eastern woes continued to unsettle
investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a sharp reversal on the Hong Kong market upset HSBC
shares.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market, which ends before Wall Street opens,
closed firmer and near the day's highs, helped by a strong dollar
and futures as well as by hopes of a firmer Dow, with the DAX-30
index 38.91 points higher at 4,391.54.
</P>
<P>
But in later screen-based trade, the IBIS DAX index ended down
20.07 points at 4,339.98.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris finished 31.00 points lower at
3,006.73 as the French market's recovery stalled.

Losses on Wall Street and worries over developments in Asia

<HEADLINE> U.S to Retain Sanctions against Firms Dealing with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it is "serious" to impose sanctions on French
energy company Total and its partners for a 2 billion US dollar
gas deal with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made by Under Secretary of State Stuart
Eisenstat when he delivered a speech at the National Press Club
in Washington, D.C..
</P>
<P>
"Let me emphasize that we are serious about implementing this
law and have not ruled out any options. Sanctions remain a real,
live option in both cases if these activities and found to be
sanctionable," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Eisenstat said the sanctions threat will also apply to Canada's
Bo Valley Energy for its 212 million dollar project to develop
Iran's Balal offshore oil field.
</P>
<P>
The undersecretary of state, who is in charge of economic
affairs, disclosed that the State Department is launching a
formal review of the controversial sanction policy, which has
become a major source of tension between the United States and
its European allies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The State Department is reviewing the use of this
controversial tool," he said. And the State Department is
establishing a sanctions "team" to find ways to make sanctions
more effective in foreign policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is involved in negotiations with France and
Russia in an effort to avoid sanctions looming in the case of the
$2 billion gas deal with Iran by the French energy company Total
and over charges that Russian firms and research centers have
aided Tehran ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering is in Paris trying to
work out a deal with French officials for the purpose of avoiding
the looming sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration is "very carefully"
listening to Iranian President Mohammed Khatami's interview with
CNN, to be broadcast at 6 p.m. EST so that it could determine
whether there is any possibility for conciliation between the
two countries, which has severed the diplomatic relations in
1980.

<P>
KHARTOUM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of south Sudan's
pro-government rebel forces have agreed on the unification of
their forces under the name of "Sudan Defense Force," a faction
source said here today.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official source of the United Democratic Salvation
Front said the leaders of those factions held a meeting Tuesday
on this purpose.
</P>
<P>
They charged Riyak Mashar, chairman of the coordination council
of the southern states, with forming a committee that will undertake
the unification process, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Mashar, who is also chairman of the front which comprises all
rebel signatories of the Khartoum peace agreement with the
government last April, was quoted as saying that the unification
will help expand the scope of peace, establish security and
stability in south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum government signed a peace agreement with four
small southern rebel factions last April in a bid to put an end
to the 13-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The largest anti-government group operating in south Sudan, the
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) did not sign the accord.

<HEADLINE> EU Insists on Open-Border Policy After Refugee Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body, the European Commission, said today that an
open-border policy between nine EU member countries should be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen accord has nothing to do with the recent influx of
Kurdish refugees into Italy, an EU member state, the commission
indicated today.
</P>
<P>
But the EU executive emphasized that "weaknesses and
difficulties" would arise in controlling refugee flows in the
future unless the EU adopted long-overdue draft legislation and
acted in harmony on asylum and immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 refugees, mostly Kurdish people, arrived in
Italy last week aboard two boats from Turkey. More are said to be
on the route.
</P>
<P>
The arrival has caused fears among EU members, especially
Italy's EU neighbors, of an influx of illegal immigrants from
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Migration experts gathered here today to start preparing an
action plan to prevent influx of refugees into Italy, which is
likely to derail the EU's open-borders project.
</P>
<P>
The commission stressed at the meeting that the Schengen
passport-free zone, which involves a total of nine countries at
present, was not "a sieve," according to a spokesman for the EU
executive.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Schengen was the achievement of free
movement which was flanked by efficient measures to control
illegality and criminality. "It works," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that the action plan would be under preparation
for a few more days before being adopted by EU foreign ministers
later this month. It will reportedly involve more effective border
controls, consular cooperation and police cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the EU needed a comprehensive approach to
not only solve the current problem but also anticipate future
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen agreement now has Belgium, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain as its full
members. Italy and Austria have scrapped passport controls for
inter-Schengen flights but their land control borders are due to
disappear in March.

<P>
ALGIERS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Algerian government spokesman
Habib Chawki Hamraoui today reiterated that Algeria categorically
rejects any attempt to interfere in its internal affairs from any
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Hamraoui, also minister of communication, culture, was quoted
today by the Algerian news agency as saying that any attempt under
any cover to create doubts about the sources of terrorism is
totally condemned by Algeria.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the statements made in certain Western
capitals regarding the terrorist crimes being committed in
Algeria. The Algerian government deeply regrets the circulation of
such confusion and misconception, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hamraoui strongly condemned the indiscriminate acts of
terrorism against the Algerian people, particularly since the
beginning of the current fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
A number of Western countries have been exerting pressure on
Algeria to accept investigation into the nature of the terrorists,
and have called upon the Algerian government to safeguard the
legitimate rights of the Algerian people against terrorist actions.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is currently experiencing relative tension on account
of the mounting acts of terrorism throughout the country,
especially since the beginning of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night three massacres took place in an area about
300 kilometers southwest of the capital city of Algiers, in which
at least 62 people were killed and 38 others wounded.

<HEADLINE> EU Opens Inquiry Into Air France Deal With US Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body, the European Commission, said today that it was
starting an investigation into cooperation accords of Air France
with both Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Air France, the French flag carrier, agreed to cooperate with
Continental and Delta, two U.S. airline giants, respectively in
November 1996 and June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision will add to a long list of global
aviation pacts which the EU's antitrust watchdog has been
investigating for 18 months and of which the most controversial
one was the alliance between British Airways and American
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Air France agreed to cooperate with the two airlines giants in
code and revenue-sharing agreements, coordination of routes and
flight frequencies, and joint participation in their frequent
flyer programs.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreements have been implemented only partially
pending negotiations between France and the United States on
liberalizing the air transport market between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission maintains that an agreement of this type might
comprise anti-competitive aspects, just like the alliances signed
by other European airlines with their U.S. counterparts for which
proceedings have been opened.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that it must analyze the effect of these
agreements on competition.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The UN General Assembly
adopted a resolution to transfer responsibility for natural
disaster mitigation, prevention and preparedness from the UN
Department of Humanitarian Affairs to the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), a release from UNDP said today.
</P>
<P>
In response to the resolution, UNDP is establishing a Disaster
Management Program (DMP) starting this month within its
Emergency Response Division, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The release said the new program will focus primarily on
natural disasters, and the DMP's main goals are: to strengthen the
capacities of governments and non-governmental organizations; to
prepare for and manage for risks and vulnerabilities to disasters;
to help integrate disaster management into national development
planning; and to strengthen UN disaster Management Teams and their
national counterparts in disaster prone countries.
</P>
<P>
A priority for DMP is to confront disasters related to EL NINO,
and the United Nations has approved a grant of 2.3 million U.S.
dollars to enable UNDP to carry out its new tasks, the release
added.

<HEADLINE> US Says Algeria Accepts Outside Probe Into Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Algeria has agreed to the
idea of an outside investigation into violence in the country, the
U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"They told us that they would accept a visit" by a human rights
investigator to look into recent mass killings, spokesman James
Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that outsiders may provide additional information
on the scope and source of these heinous crimes," he added. And he
stressed the international probe was aimed at seeking the facts,
not blaming the Algerian government.
</P>
<P>
The United States called Monday for a inquiry into the recent
massacres in Algeria and Rubin said today the Algerian government
had accepted "in principle" the idea of a visit by a U.N. envoy
for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
But his statement conflicted with word from the Algerian
capital that the Algerian government was rejecting the U.S. call.
And reports said the Algerian government Tuesday summoned U.S.
ambassador Cameron Hume to the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The American diplomat was reminded of Algeria's categorical
rejection of any idea of an international commission," the
official Algerian news agency APS said.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin told reporters that the Algerians told Hume during
the meeting "they would accept a visit by a U.N. human rights
rapporteur."
</P>
<P>
Algerian newspapers said that about 1,000 people had been
killed since the Muslim holy month of Ramadan started on December
30. And Algerian security forces said that 62 people had died in
three new massacres in the Western province of Relizane.
</P>
<P>
The killings have brought concerns from the outside world and
the West has called on the United Nations to send a special envoy
to Algeria to assess the situation.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Condemns Massacres in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Belgium today denounced
massacres which recently took place in Algeria and blamed the
African country for being reluctant to allow Western countries to
help it curb the violence.
</P>
<P>
Belgian foreign ministry spokesman Andre Querton called the
massacres "blind violence" at a weekly media briefing held
Wednesday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Belgium was coordinating its exact position
on the massacres, blamed mainly on Islamist fundamentalists, with
other EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
Robin Cook, British foreign secretary, Wednesday said the EU
wanted to discuss with Algerian authorities how to end the wave of
guerrilla mass killings. More than 65,000 people had been killed
in the country's six-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
An international commission of inquiry has been proposed to
cooperate with the Algerian government in order to end the wave of
massacres in the north African country. But Querton said Algerian
authorities had repeatedly said it would not cooperate with such
an organization.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has suggested that Algeria itself establish a
parliamentary commission of inquiry on the civil strife while
Germany has proposed the EU offer help in fighting terrorism and
aiding the victims of violence, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, the Algerian government has reportedly turned down all
bids for foreign investigation or mediation with the Muslim
rebels, saying that they were unacceptable interference.
